COMPANIES SUE L.A. OVER CITY'S TAX SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Already facing massive Rampart settlements and struggling to
salvage damaged relations with the business community, Los Angeles
faces a new attack by several major corporations that claim the
city's tax system is unfair and are demanding millions in refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Nine corporations _ including Eastman Kodak and Pacific Bell _
have filed lawsuits seeking roughly $2 million and which, if
successful, could cost the city as much as $10 million for all
similarly affected businesses, according to the City Controller's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney representing Eastman Kodak said those costs could
rise if the city fails to fix its business tax problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll pile up liability,'' said Los Angeles attorney Charles
Ajalat, who also successfully fought the city's tax code for
General Motors in 1995. ``Our people must be refunded their money
and the city must correct the structure for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials forecast the city will collect nearly $314
million in city business tax this year from its more than 230,000
registered businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The city's business tax code, with its complex and ambiguous
provisions, has caused countless headaches for people doing
business in Los Angeles as well as local government administrators
_ and is the subject of a massive reform movement launched by Mayor
Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Five major department stores filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the
city's tax policy, becoming just the latest to do so after Eastman
Kodak, Pacific Bell, Vons grocery stores and Atlantic Richfield.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of companies have filed similar lawsuits against San
Francisco, which has nearly the same tax system of Los Angeles, and
Ajalat said a state court judge Tuesday called that city's system
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   City legal officials defend the system, saying Los Angeles
retooled it after losing a $50 million judgment to General Motors
Corp. A federal appeals court ruled in 1995 that the city's tax
unfairly exempted manufacturers within the city from paying taxes
on the sale of products, but imposed that tax on manufacturers
based outside of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't think that the claims have any merit, that the
problems were taken care of in 1996,'' said Deputy City Attorney
Miguel Dager.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ajalat and other attorneys say the changes were not
enough. They claim the new system still unfairly exempts locally
based manufacturers from paying certain taxes that those based out
of town must pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been losing all of their cases. They really shouldn't
be prolonging it, they should be changing it,'' Ajalat said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically at issue in the lawsuits are two taxes levied to
businesses operating in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles imposes a payroll tax and a business tax based on
receipts and most locally based companies doing business in the
city must pay only one _ the greater of the two _ and are exempt
from the other.
</P>
<P>
   That system, the lawsuit allege, is unconstitutional and amounts
to discrimination because businesses based outside the city are
required to pay the city's business tax, plus local taxes in the
city in which they are based.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is two taxes vs. one,'' Ajalat said. ``You only
pay one tax if you're solely within the city but you are subject to
two separate taxes if you do business within and without the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Turner, general counsel for the California Taxpayers
Association, said the group has closely monitored the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't discriminate in favor of local business and that was
what, in essence, those local tax structures were doing,'' Turner
said. ``Your tax structure shouldn't be trying to create winners
and losers among competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the city should have remedied the situation years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What surprises me is that we keep having to revisit these
issues,'' he said. ``What's it going to take for these guys to get
the message?''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo said the Mayor's Office couldn't
comment on pending lawsuits. But he said Riordan is confident
ongoing reforms will help simplify the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to press hard on making this city the most
business-friendly in the Southland and the reform of our tax code
is an important element to accomplishing that,'' Delgadillo said.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ There was a time when Pat Riley dreamed of coaching the New
York Knicks to victory in a series-deciding Game 7 against a heated
rival.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday, he realized that dream. But Riley now coaches the Miami
Heat.
</P>
<P>
   With Riley pulling all the wrong strings and unable to come up
with an effective play on Miami's final possession, the Heat _
again _ went down in flames. The Knicks hammered out an 83-82
victory before a crowd of 20,063 at AmericanAirlines Arena, ending
the Eastern Conference semifinals after seven grueling games.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks advance to play the Indiana Pacers in the conference
finals, which begin Tuesday at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The game was full of the usual twists and turns, but nobody was
shocked to see this game between two of the league's fiercest
rivals come down to the wire. Certainly not the Miami fans, who
have seen this deja coup de grace at the hands of the Knicks far
too many times in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was the third straight year the Knicks pulled off a
series-clinching victory at Miami, winning a pair of first-round
Game 5s in 1998 and '99 before Sunday's Game 7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that you're ever surprised about how a game
goes,'' said New York coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``Certainly that it
came down to the last possession was (not a surprise). This was two
teams playing very well and very hard, and I feel very proud of our
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially because it easily could have been the Heat jetting
off to Indy for the next round. But Riley and the Heat couldn't
pull off the same kind of magic Van Gundy managed last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, with the Knicks down by one point and seconds left, Van
Gundy got Allan Houston the ball for one last shot. Houston broke
down the Heat for a leaning shot in the lane that dropped in for a
one-point win.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Heat had the ball, 12.4 seconds away from
exorcising the ghosts of heartbreaks and chokes of past playoffs
with the Knicks. But Riley couldn't get the ball to one of his
primary scorers, with the ball going from Alonzo Mourning to Jamal
Mashburn, who couldn't get rid of it fast enough after a 3-for-15
day.
</P>
<P>
   The ball finally wound up in the hands of Clarence Weatherspoon,
whose 13-foot baseline jumper clanged off the rim into the hands of
Latrell Sprewell (24 points), who managed to tiptoe along the
baseline before calling a timeout that saved the possession for the
Knicks with 2.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon? Not Mourning, who had dominated the game with 29
points, 13 rebounds and five blocks?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the ball in my hands, and they (the Knicks) ran two guys
at me, so I had to kick it to Mash,'' Mourning said. ``Mash was
wide-open but swung it to 'Spoon, and they ran at him. I would have
taken the last shot if I had a good look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of this series, not to mention the four-year
playoff history between these teams, you get used to seeing the
players struggle _ bricking easy shots, making questionable
decisions in key situations and making unforced blunders at the
most inopportune times. But when Riley, regarded as one of the best
in the business, does it
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most critical mistake came in the second quarter,
which began with Miami leading the reeling Knicks 25-16.
</P>
<P>
   Riley benched all of his offensive mainstays _ Mourning (14
first-quarter points), Tim Hardaway (who had started the game by
making three of his first four shots), Dan Majerle and Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   Minus any offensive talent, the Heat scored just four points
over the first 5:01 of the quarter, and the Knicks rallied to tie
it before Riley could hustle Mourning back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad run there,'' Riley said. ``Leads have never
really been safe in this particular series. Teams have been ahead,
and then there have been comebacks. Go down and come back. They
came back, but we came back in the second half, but they came back
again at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team scored over the last 1:21, after a baseline dunk by
Ewing (20 points, 10 rebounds) put the Knicks up by one point.
</P>
<P>
   That's when things got ugly. Not that Riley did it all by
himself. No, he had plenty of help from his players. Mashburn, a
native New Yorker, did all he could to help the Knicks' cause. P.J.
Brown fouled out with 2:21 left. And after sitting for so long
following his fast start, Hardaway never recovered, needing 20
field-goal attempts (making six) to score 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Hardaway could not contain Chris Childs, who scored 13
straight New York points in one stretch, including 10 in a row over
the first eight minutes of the fourth quarter when no other Knick
could manage a point.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in the fact the Heat missed 10 of its 21 free throws,
including five straight in the fourth quarter, and three
fourth-quarter 24-second violations, and you have reasons the Heat
deserved to lose.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than look at the obvious, Riley took to griping about
the officiating, pointing to the Knicks' 28-of-31 foul shooting as
proof his team got jobbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around 30 years, coaching for 18, and I've been
involved in a whole lot of playoff games, but I've never been
involved in a playoff game where it was determined with fouls,''
Riley said. ``And fouls out on the floor, not even shooting fouls.
Just touch fouls. It was very, very tough to take that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, there's always next year.

LOS ANGELES _ Hey, you looking at me?
</P>
<P>
   One game down and the battle of NBA superpowers already might
have turned on the whim of a Travis Bickle wannabe with a whistle
around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Ronnie Garretson calls a pair of technical fouls on
Rasheed Wallace _ the second one for simply staring _ and
Portland's best player is ejected from the game with 6:43 left in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't never heard of nobody gettin' thrown out for lookin'
before,'' said Trail Blazers teammate Brian Grant, who had better
beware of the grammar police.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace isn't just anybody. With 38 technical fouls, six
ejections and a disposition just this side of Bob Knight in the
regular season, Wallace is the guy most referees think should be
driving a taxi with Robert DeNiro.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would be surprised if he showed up for Game 2 wearing a
Mohawk haircut and a vest loaded with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is to self-control what Madonna is to abstinence. Yet he
wants us to feel his pain. And to some extent, we do.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Garretson qualifies as a registered voter of
``Egoville'' for tossing a player in a game of such significance
for a look.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a scowl or a sneer? A glare or a stare? And, oh, did
little Ronnie stay up that night trembling under the covers from
such a grievous act of intimidation?
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say the 5-8 Garretson has Napoleonic tendencies and
is familiar with confrontation. He was knocked over the media table
a few years back during a run-in with then-Laker Nick Van Exel. And
he did learn a few things about the arbiting arts from his father,
former NBA chief of officials and foremost prig, Darell Garretson.
Self-importance does run in the family. And yet there is no getting
around the one salient fact: Wallace was dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not for anything he said or for how he looked, but for
putting himself in a position to have let his teammates down with
his absence. Perhaps not for the specific act but for his perpetual
air of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace just doesn't seem to get it. He lives in a put-upon
dream world where every referee has gotten every call wrong against
him. In his mind, he is always the persecuted party.
</P>
<P>
   It is the victim role, so prevalent in society today, that keeps
lawyers clogging up the court system and multimillionaire athletes
unaccountable and unrepentant for any of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is the linear descendant of Dennis Rodman,
bad-as-I-wanna-be but not tough enough to accept the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The unrepentant part of the equation is nobody's business but
his own if Wallace chooses to go through life as the angry young
man. But there is no getting around the accountability, if to
nobody but his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   For it was not Garretson or the Lakers fans at Staples Center or
anyone in the media who suffered when Wallace had to spend the last
1{ periods of the game in the locker room, especially when the
Blazers cut LA's lead to single digits in the final five minutes.
He is Portland's best player, but he can't score if he isn't in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot have an All-Star sitting in the locker room,'' said
Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy again Sunday. ``At some point he has
got to understand that, even if he's right and it's a bad call.
That doesn't do us any good, because he's in the locker room and
we're on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had another talk. Mostly it was me talking, and I think
he understands. There seemed to be recognition in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   To what end? After his technical-foul-ridden season, Wallace
promised to clean up his act for the playoffs. Now he has picked up
seven technicals in the postseason, and in Game 1 against the
Lakers scored just 11 points in 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's responsibility to his teammates is to do whatever it
takes to stay in the game. There are no points for pride and no
honor in leaving the fight.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's practice, he shot jumpers and worked on post-up
moves and refused to utter a sound, shaking his head at a request.
Wallace has left his teammates in the uncomfortable _ and
unconvincing _ position of having to alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like a stare-down in a heavyweight fight,'' Damon
Stoudamire said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Except it wasn't a fight and Garretson wasn't the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks with a different kind of aggression than most
people,'' said a sheepish Scottie Pippen. ``You have to try to know
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, maybe at a tea party in the summer. For now, it's all so
tiresome.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
MONTREAL _ The Astros will wake up this morning in last place in
the National League Central, their second visit to the cellar this
year after winning three straight division titles.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A miserable road trip got worse Sunday afternoon as the Montreal
Expos sent the Astros to an 8-3 loss, their fifth straight defeat,
before a crowd of 20,111 at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The five-game skid is the Astros' longest since they dropped six
in a row in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad start (to the season), but we started a long time
ago,'' outfielder Moises Alou said. ``We're having a bad season.
It's time for us to regroup and play the way we should be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win two games in a row and then get satisfied. We have a
lot of ground to catch up. If we continue thinking, `It's early,
it's early,' it's going to be August and we're going to be 30 games
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's loss dropped the Astros into last place in NL Central,
percentage points behind the Chicago Cubs. The Astros also fell
into last place April 27 after a 12-3 loss to the Cubs. At 15-26,
they are nine games behind division leader St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos completed their first three-game sweep of the Astros
since 1995, tagging righthander Jose Lima (1-7) for seven runs and
10 hits in 5 innings. Montreal built a 6-2 lead after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos finished their 12-game homestand with an 8-4 mark to
go seven games over .500 for the first time since July 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While Lima struggled, Expos righthander Javier Vazquez (5-1)
continued to puzzle the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez allowed three runs and seven hits and left to a standing
ovation after surrendering a leadoff homer to Richard Hidalgo in
the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez retired the first eight batters he faced before Lima
singled in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the pitcher they had on the mound, it was hard to come
back,'' manager Larry Dierker said of Vazquez, who is 1-0 with a
1.69 ERA in two career starts against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Lima never got on track, allowing a triple to the second batter
he faced, Jose Vidro. Rondell White hit a sacrifice fly for the
Expos' first run, and Andy Tracy's homer in the second made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro had three hits to raise his average to .393.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make mistakes up there, you're going to give it up,''
Lima said. ``I'm going through a tough time right now. The whole
team is going through a tough time. When things aren't going your
way, there's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward, who started at first base as Jeff Bagwell was given
the day off, hit his career-high ninth homer _ a two-run shot deep
into the right-field stands _ in the fourth inning to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal seized the lead for good in the fifth, sending seven
batters to the plate during a four-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Vazquez flied out, Lima allowed three consecutive singles.
On one play, White pushed a soft roller to the first-base side of
the mound. Ward moved in to make the play _ the ball rolled past
him _ and Lima failed to cover first as a run scored.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Lee Stevens hit a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game has its moment,'' Dierker said. ``When you look at
things he (Lima) is supposed to do as a starting pitcher, like get
a bunt down and cover first base, the starting pitcher didn't do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a four-run swing. We still lost by more than four runs,
but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima said, ``I looked bad there because the pitcher is supposed
to come over to first base to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima also failed to get down a bunt in the fifth with a runner
at first and no outs.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-game winner last year, Lima has dropped a career-worst
seven consecutive decisions. He has allowed a major-league-high 19
home runs and 51 earned runs in 53 innings _ an 8.77 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pitch I threw, they hit,'' Lima said. ``I made a pitch
in the dirt, and they still hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos' Geoff Blum homered off closer Billy Wagner in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros need to win at least once in today's doubleheader in
Milwaukee to avoid their first winless road trip in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start playing the way we're capable of playing,''
Alou said. ``Earlier, you could say our pitching wasn't good. Right
now we either hit and don't pitch well or pitch and don't hit
well.''

MICKELSON WILL FIT JUST FINE ON THE WALL OF CHAMPIONS

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ By any standard, Phil Mickelson's name will
look regal on the Wall of Champions lining Colonial Country Club's
first tee.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves town as the PGA Tour's second-leading money winner. He
departs as only the 10th player in golf history to surpass the $11
million mark in career earnings.
</P>
<P>
   And he joins young Whatsisname as the only two players with
three wins on the tour this season.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of his final-round 63, Mickelson overtook Stewart Cink
and won the 54th annual MasterCard Colonial yesterday. Considering
the stakes, considering the valley that Mickelson faced as late as
the 63rd hole, it may have been as dazzling a round of golf as has
ever been played at the grand old tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And for that, Mickelson deserves all the applause, plus his name
etched on the great wall, plus the right to be Forever Plaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a great champion,'' tournament chairman Phil Thomas,
dressed in traditional plaid blazer, proudly predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched him for years. I was tickled to death that Phil
was the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas isn't kidding. The honorable chairman didn't discuss it,
but golf is unique in how it embraces its champions. Underdogs and
unknowns, for the most part, need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans want their leader board to be anointed with familiar
names. If Robert Allenby wants to win, let him go to Hattiesburg.
</P>
<P>
   But a name like Mickelson's is seen as somehow validating the
weekend. The best golfers don't just win a tournament _ they mark
their territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have won this tournament is an amazing feeling,'' Mickelson
said, respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a part of the history of this event, which has a
tremendous history, one of the best that we have on the tour, to
see Ben Hogan having won here in '46 and '47, Craig Wood winning
the Open here in '41, and to be associated with those past
champions means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as good as it feels out at Colonial this morning, I'm going
to guess.
</P>
<P>
   With the party-hearty Byron Nelson Classic tossing out dollars
as if they were cheap pick-up lines, and with the concurrent German
Deutsche Bank-SAP tournament giving away checks as door prizes, it
was being increasingly whispered that Colonial's grip on the tour's
heartstrings was slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Young Whatsisname _ Tiger Woods, they call him in Germany _
hasn't played Colonial in three years. Hal Sutton hasn't been here
in six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real certain how people are gauging that when they say
the tournament is slipping,'' chairman Thomas said. `` I guess
people are judging it by Tiger Woods and the fact that some guys
have gone over to the SAP.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought we had a great field, and I think we'll have an
even better field next year. And I certainly don't think the
stature of our tournament is slipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Mr. Mickelson. Tall, handsome, blessed with a photogenic
wife and a gushingly cute 11-month-old daughter. Mickelson has won
16 times on the PGA Tour. He missed winning the U.S. Open last year
by a single stroke. Even before he shot 63 yesterday, he would have
been on most everyone's list as one of the world's great players.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's, indeed, is just the kind of sexy name that
Colonial's Wall of Fossils needed.
</P>
<P>
   Look it up. At 29, Mickelson is the youngest Colonial champion
in 11 years. The previous 10 winners of the tournament were an
average of 37.6 years old. What goes on at the annual Colonial
champions dinner, anyway _ bingo?
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Thomas said, ``We need some younger guys to start
getting in that top tier. We're proud to have Phil on our wall.
He'll be around for quite a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 54th Colonial proved anything these past seven days, it
is that the hallowed course has never been better. Player after
player sang its praises. On television, CBS made the grand old club
resemble an emerald Shangri-La.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nelson tournament, with its trucked-in trees and
freeway-side address, managed to attract seven of the tour's top 10
money-winners. Colonial had four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're still right in there,'' Thomas said. ``That
might be one of the reasons that the commissioner has us in the
position \Ron the PGA schedule\S we're in. Because he knows that we
have a strong tournament that won't slip.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans, ever star-struck, will have to be the judge of that.
</P>
<P>
   Everything old is new again. Maybe the pros will grow weary of
the weinerschnitzel. Maybe Colonial will become a retro sensation.
Maybe next year, Tiger Woods will again grace us with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there was Phil Mickelson yesterday, in all his
world-class, 7-under-par glory.
</P>
<P>
   His name will probably be etched on the wall by noon.

WINTER'S CAREER ONE LONG SUCCESS STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. - He was a twin, born Morice Fredrick Winter
on Feb. 22, 1922 near Lubbock, Texas. A child of the Depression,
the son of a mechanic and a Dust Bowl refugee, he came to Southern
California his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   His new classmates at Huntington Park High near Long Beach
caught his light drawl and quickly, if not too originally, dubbed
him ``Tex.'' He didn't argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a name like Morice Fredrick Winter, you'd settle for Tex,
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's Morice, as in (begin ital)Morris(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my dad knew how to spell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Winter first learned to play basketball at Huntington Park,
playing well enough to earn scholarships at Oregon State, and after
flying as a naval pilot during World War II, at USC.
</P>
<P>
   He learned well enough that he's been teaching it ever since.
Teaching it longer than anyone in college or professional
basketball ever has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't invent the game, but I've coached it longer than
anyone in history,'' Winter said. ``I've coached it for 54 years. I
take more pride in that than anything. If longevity is any mark for
success, I'd think you'd have to say I've been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter's life has been one long success story. From his 50-year
marriage to Nancy, to having coached over 300 college victories, to
having been part of six NBA championship teams as assistant coach
with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the angle on Winter will always come in threes.
</P>
<P>
   He is the architect of the triangle offense, the offense made
most famous under head coach Phil Jackson with the Bulls and now
brought to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   It is why at age 78, the white-haired, sometimes crusty Winter
is still coaching when others of his generation and stature have
retired to the occasional speech or guest appearance at the old
university.
</P>
<P>
   Over a half-century since he became Kansas State's first full-
time assistant coach, he is still teaching, still drilling the
fundamentals, still prodding role player and superstar alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the game,'' he said. ``Love to teach the game. My
health has been good because I've taken care of myself. My whole
life I've gotten an awful lot of sleep. I say I've hybernated half
my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm only about 40 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The frugal Winter is years younger in energy and spirit. The
same drive that led him to pole vault to 14-4 on a bamboo pole -
and might have left him an Olympian if not for an abdominal injury
- still burns into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tex is just old chronologically,'' said Lakers assistant coach
Jim Cleamons, who was with Winter for seven years with the Bulls.
``Tex's spirit is late 50s. There is a wonderful spirit and
demeanor about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter figured this was all behind him long ago. He had
seemingly done it all. He played against Jackie Robinson in junior
college. Pole vaulted against Bob Richards. Coached against Wilt
Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson and Elgin Baylor - all in the same
season. Opposed coaching greats John Wooden, Pete Newell and Phoag
Allen while at Kansas State, the University of Washington, and,
later Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a head coach in the NBA, even if it was a dismal
experience with the Houston Rockets. And when a brief stint at Long
Beach State went sour in 1983, Winter figured it was time to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   But a ``consulting job'' as a coach for Dale Brown at LSU kept
him going for two more years, before Jerry Krause called with an
assistant's job with the Bulls. Fifteen years later, he's still
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always worked just on a one-year basis throughout my pro
career,'' he said. ``I've been on the verge of retiring for almost
15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter is the guru of the triangle offense. He first wrote a
book about it - ``The Triple-Post Offense'' - in 1962. And although
he normally may be soft-spoken, he's always a straight-shooter,
unfailingly honest. He is highly demanding, as even Michael Jordan
knows well.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said his mental game grew because of the coaching staffs
he worked with, ``Winter being the most important because he
probably criticized my game more than anybody. To me, that's a plus
and a driving force.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Jordan's final season, while calling him the best to
ever play the game, Winter said there were still fundamentals he
needed to work on.
</P>
<P>
   Winter makes the same kinds of demands on Lakers superstar
center Shaquille O'Neal, which have not always gone over as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is not an easy person to coach,'' Winter said. ``I like
him, he's a fine person, and I think he's a great center, but he's
not overly receptive. I've been a little disappointed in that. When
you coach him, for some reason he takes it as you being negative
instead of looking upon it as constructive criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not easy to deal with on that basis. His mind is pretty
much made up, and why wouldn't it be? He is probably the best
center in basketball today, the Most Valuable Player in the NBA,
making the kind of money he makes. Why wouldn't he be pretty
satisfied with where he is?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, that's the unfortunate part about it. He could
be so much better than he is. It's hard for people to understand,
but as a coach I feel that way about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter said he tried to reconstruct O'Neal's free-throw shot,
but the 7-1 center thought he was being negative and did not want
Winter to continue. Now O'Neal has a private coach for his
free-throw shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said O'Neal could even be the all-time best center, but
``I think he's satisfied with where he is, so he doesn't want to be
bothered.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is, after all, the reason Winter is here. He is the
reason Jackson decided to coach the Lakers, and Winter left the
Bulls to join him in Los Angeles. Even in Chicago, they always
wondered what it would be like to have O'Neal as the apex of the
triangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gone pretty well,'' Winter said. ``He's the apex of the
attack, but there again, I think there could be a lot of
improvement there, too. We've tried to explain it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach handles him a lot better than I can. He might feel like
why should I respect this little ol' guy? What does he know about
basketball. I've only coached for 54 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cleamons: ``Shaq responds. I think Shaq has his own
thoughts and ideas, but he understands people only want the best
for him, so he just continues to work. He's kind of stubborn in his
own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look and pay attention, he tries things. Sometimes he's
on his own timeline. But Shaq grew up in the military. He
understands the chain of command, and he's going to give you what
you're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter was already at Chicago when Jackson was first hired to be
the Bulls third assistant. He coached the Bulls summer league team
in Los Angeles, and Jackson went to assist. A long-running
friendship and coaching relationship was born out of those summer
days at Loyola Marymount where Jackson was exposed to the triangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He embraced it,'' Winter said. ``He liked the way we taught it
and broke it down into drills. He was looking for a system of play
that involved all five players, ballplayer movement with a
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson got the Bulls job, he installed the triangle. And
Winters legacy was about to shift from the coach who took Kansas
State to a pair of Final Fours and eight Big Eight titles, to the
father of the triangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been long gone, long retired if Phil hadn't felt
like this was the offense he wanted to develop,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship has slowly changed, evolved over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very close,'' Winter said. ``I don't know if you'd call
it a brother relationship, or a father-son relationship. He is more
the big brother type to me, than my being the big brother to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil is a very intelligent person and knows a lot about a lot
of things. As Dennis Rodman once said, Phil Jackson is an authority
on everything, and he pretty much is. So consequently, we debate a
lot, argue a lot. And he likes that. It's kind of a special
interchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has embraced Winter even more than his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part mentor, part provocateur,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wrote the forward for ``Trial by Basketball, The Life
and Times of Tex Winter,'' a 303-page biography written by Mark
Bender that came out just last month.
</P>
<P>
   Winter even finds fault with his own authorized biography,
lamenting that he didn't get his galley changes back in time before
the book was printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right, I don't think many people will be too
interested in it anyway,'' said Winter, in typical modesty.
</P>
<P>
   Winter left the Bulls because he felt he had a better chance of
winning one more title here than in Chicago. If he gets it this
year, could real retirement finally beckon?
</P>
<P>
   He said it depends whether his health is going strong, being
wanted, and feeling as if 54 years later, he can still contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't make a decision on that until I see how this thing
plays out,'' Winter said. ``Phil and I have been together a long
time, and I'm not so sure at this point how much input I can
have.''

STRONG FINISH KEEPS ESTES ON TRACK FOR BRITISH OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Troy Phillips 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Bob Estes didn't win during his two-week visit to
North Texas, but he might have punched a ticket to Scotland in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Estes' two-round charge up the MasterCard Colonial leader board
should solidify his standing in the World Golf Rankings Top 50 and
earn his exempt status to the British Open, scheduled for July
17-23 at St. Andrews Old Course in Fife, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Estes closed yesterday with a 66 to finish Colonial at 7-under
273, tied for sixth with Greg Kraft. His three sub-par rounds,
including two 66s, had their share of moments in which Estes
escaped trouble with his short game.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Estes closed by chipping out of the No. 10 tee
entrance over a wide cart path/walking area outside the No. 9 green
to cap his first 66.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Estes overshot the par-3 No. 16 hole, chipped on and
drained a perfectly read long putt that broke two feet right and
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Estes' 10 birdies over the final two rounds (five each day)
served as a dramatic turnaround from his three-bogey 72 during the
rain-delayed second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have time or take the time to really work on my short
game, I play rounds like that,'' said Estes, a University of Texas
graduate in his 13th season on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might hit 12 greens and get the other six up and down. The
stats will bear out that I have a really good short game.''
</P>
<P>
   His sixth-place finish at last week's GTE Byron Nelson Classic
moved Estes from 52nd to 49th in the world rankings, not as high up
as he expected to go. Estes said he knew that anything less than
sixth again might cost him what little ground he gained last week.
</P>
<P>
   The top 50 in the world rankings May 30 will receive exempt
status into the British Open. Estes can also strengthen his
position with a high finish in this week's Memorial Tournament in
Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday also marked the 10th top-10 finish for Estes in two
seasons, signs that he is regaining some form that helped him make
27 of 28 cuts and finish 26th in PGA Tour earnings ($1,357,618) in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was extra pressure on me this week and/or next week to
have a really good tournament,'' said Estes, who has missed four of
nine cuts in 2000. You don't think about \Rworld rankings\S while
you're playing. You just know you'd better play good.''
</P>
<P>
   Estes carded his only bogey yesterday at No. 18 after a
wide-right tee shot and scrambling approach into one of the hole's
two greenside bunkers. After his miracle save at 16 and other
highlights, such as a 30-foot birdie putt at 13, Estes had little
regret over his finish. When it comes to saving pars, I saved a lot
when I had to this week,'' he said. I just couldn't get that last
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really understanding what I have to do to get in a
position where everything's more natural and will hold up under
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest world rankings should reflect just that. nn

DOWN 7 WITH 9 HOLES LEFT, MICKELSON ROLLS TO COLONIAL VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Phil Mickelson peeked at the scoreboard and
reassessed his goals. A chance for outright victory, he reasoned,
seemed unattainable as he headed to the back nine Sunday at
Colonial Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, seven strokes down with nine holes to play, figured
his best-case scenario would be a blistering back nine and ``an
outside chance'' for a playoff at the MasterCard Colonial. He
figured wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of regulation, Mickelson was hoisting the Leonard
Trophy after posting the lowest final-round score (63) of any
Colonial champion. Mickelson, 29, closed with five birdies on the
back nine _ eight overall _ and reeled in a fading Stewart Cink to
win his third PGA Tour event of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson finished at 12-under par, two strokes ahead of Cink
and Davis Love III, to become the youngest winner at Colonial since
a 28-year-old Ian Baker-Finch prevailed in 1989. By erasing a
six-stroke deficit in the final round, Mickelson collected a
$594,000 paycheck and authored the second-largest comeback in
Colonial history.
</P>
<P>
   Only Nick Price, who came from seven strokes off the pace to win
the 1994 event, slipped into a plaid jacket after beginning the
final round further behind than Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing feeling,'' said Mickelson, who punctuated a
35-foot birdie putt on the final hole of regulation with a vigorous
pump of his left fist. ``To have won this tournament after being
seven (strokes) back with nine (holes) to play is amazing. I really
can't remember a finish like this. I didn't think at the turn that
it was going to be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson made it possible with a back-nine 30 and three
ill-timed bogeys over the final four holes by Cink, who held a
three-stroke lead after 54 holes. Cink reached 14-under par with a
birdie at the fourth hole during Sunday's round, which coincided
with Mickelson's bogey from the bunker at No. 9 to drop to 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   Although playing well, Mickelson said he never envisioned ending
his round wrapped in a plaid jacket. But he began making strides in
that direction with a three-foot birdie putt at No. 10. When he
rescued birdie at No. 11 after clanging his second shot off a tree
at the par-5 hole, Mickelson began gaining confidence. The momentum
carried on to No. 12, where he buried a 12-foot birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   At that juncture, Mickelson scanned another scoreboard and
realized he had shaved five strokes off Cink's advantage. Down by
only two strokes with six holes remaining, Mickelson began thinking
about a possible playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I thought, `Hey, I've got a shot of winning this
thing,''' said Mickelson, whose birdie binge coincided with Cink
bogeys at Nos. 5 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cink had more holes remaining, Mickelson said he
projected himself with ``an outside chance'' at forcing a playoff
if he closed with a flurry of birdies. He added his next at No. 15,
dropping a 12-foot putt to regain a stroke he lost when Cink
collected his final birdie, at No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson turned up the heat at No. 18, knocking a pitching
wedge approach 35 feet above the hole and dropping the downhill
putt for his final birdie. The putt moved Mickelson to 12 under,
one stroke behind Cink, who arrived at the 15th tee box clinging to
a one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   The lead would not last long. Cink drove into the right rough at
No. 15, then chipped across the fairway into the left rough. He
wound up missing a four-foot par putt, knotting matters atop the
leader board while Mickelson watched from a television in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Cink backtracked again at No. 17, where he three-putted from 40
feet. Cink blew his birdie attempt five feet past the hole and
missed the comeback putt for par. As Cink's par putt slid past the
right lip, Mickelson said, ``Oh, wow!'' as he took his first lead
of tournament week.
</P>
<P>
   From the right rough at No. 18, Cink's bid for a closing birdie
to force a playoff resulted in a wedge shot from 158 yards that
stopped short of the green. Cink three-putted for bogey from the
fringe _ his third bogey in the final four holes _ to seal a
two-stroke victory for Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things I wish I could do over,'' said Cink,
who split just six of 14 fairways and needed 33 putts during a
closing round of 71. ``I just lost it. You can't open the door for
guys like this. Phil ... came back and took the trophy away from
me, and he is deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, whose closing 63 surpassed Price's 64 in 1994 as the
lowest final-round effort by a Colonial champion, said he began the
final day with a good feeling when he looked at the Wall of
Champions before his initial tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that Craig Wood won the 1941 U.S. Open here, and that
Ben Hogan won the first two Colonials, in 1946 and 1947,''
Mickelson said. ``I thought, `Those are some pretty good names at
the front end of that plaque. I'd like to put my name on the other
end.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Mickelson had done so. In the process, he
jumped to No. 2 on the season money list, with $2,355,264. And he
did so in a manner that even Mickelson termed ``amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ever remember a finish like this,'' said Mickelson,
who lost a playoff to Jesper Parnevik at last week's GTE Byron
Nelson Classic. ``I know that Stewart looks at this and knows it
should have been his tournament. I look at last week and feel the
same way. So I understand how that can feel. Now, I understand this
side of it, too. And it feels great.'' nn

RICKEY'S QUICK START WITH M'S HELPS FILL HOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Among the lesser known virtues of Rickey Henderson is
his knowledge of what's going on around baseball. Which only makes
sense _ after 21 years in the majors, he's been a teammate with
just about everybody still in the game. He should know everybody's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he's always known the Mariners business. As a major
part of the persistent, weird dominance by the Oakland A's of the
Mariners, Henderson watched bemused over the years as the Seattles,
despite an impressive offense led by Ken Griffey Jr., always lacked
one key attack element _ Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Henderson said, he and Griffey bantered about the
prospect of coming to Seattle to fix three problems at once _ left
field, leadoff hitting and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always had a lot of offense, but somewhere in the late
innings, the bullpen would lose it for them,'' he said, smiling.
``I'd joke with him and tell him I always got two runs in me, and
you guys always lose by one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``So get me up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dang.
</P>
<P>
   Missed by a year.
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of effort on Griffey's part. In his
long-term role as general-manager-without-portfolio, he steadily
lobbied for Henderson's acquisition. Then again, Griffey steadily
lobbied for the acquisition of Orlando and a golf-course home, as
well as the preservation of the Kingdome. Rebuffed on all fronts,
he chose other options.
</P>
<P>
   The Henderson idea, however, was not preposterous. The Mariners
pursued the free agent after the 1998 season, but the New York
Mets' offer of a two-year guaranteed contract was better than a
one-year deal from the Mariners, whose owners were busy choking on
the cost of the new ballpark and wanted no payroll risks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mariners that off-season signed John Mabry, Tom
Lampkin, Matt Mieske and traded for Butch Huskey, none of whom
fixed the aforementioned problems. The Mariners were on their way
to a second straight losing season.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Henderson over the weekend get on base five times
in his first 10 at-bats and score four runs while hitting two
leadoff homers, the majesty of the mistake in not getting him here
sooner is apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, he's 41 and he could creak to a stop at any
moment. And his history of volatility towards club management could
turn the Mariners into a Jerry Springer show, also at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's a vital patch on a tire that is suddenly covering
some highway.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-1 homestand, concluding Sunday with an 8-4 win over Tampa
Bay, was notable for what didn't happen. After an unpleasant 2-5
road trip, the pitching didn't blow up.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly a month after No. 2 starting pitcher Freddy Garcia
followed No. 1 starter Jamie Moyer onto the disabled list, the
Mariners lead the AL West with a 23-18 mark, as far over .500 as
they've been this season. In this homestand, the revamped rotation
in 37 innings over the six games gave up just 10 earned runs,
including four Sunday by Aaron Sele. The Mariners' team ERA of 4.76
entering the day was fifth best in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Minnesota and Tampa Bay produce flop sweats in no one.
But they still must be beaten, and the fact that the Mariners did
so with a big hole in the top of the rotation speaks well for a
prosperous summer.
</P>
<P>
   While Moyer's expected return is June 2, Garcia's cracked leg
bone won't allow him to pitch until after the All-Star break, if
then. He has to go through virtually a second spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Even when both return to form, the use for now of temporaries
Paul Abbott and Brett Tomko in the rotation puts a strain on an
unsettled bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a few more innings from our starters,'' manager
Lou Piniella said. ``Our bullpen will wear down.''
</P>
<P>
   Which gets back to Henderson. No, he's not going to pitch. But
he does add an offensive weapon when the Mariners have no choice
but to cover the inevitable pitching stumbles with many crooked
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   During the homestand in the alleged pitchers' park, the Mariners
hit .337 and outscored the opposition 45-19. While Henderson was
around for only part of that fusillade, he represents the asset
unseen since Vince Coleman in 1995 _ a player who can get a run
when good pitching shuts down everything else.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' primary leadoff hitters this season, Mike Cameron
and Mark McLemore, combined for the American League's worst batting
average (.190) and second-lowest on-base percentage (.305) out of
the opening slot.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Henderson contributes in the fashion of his first
weekend in Seattle, that problem is over. He'll cost them a little
in the outfield, but the price figures to be small for something so
long needed.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if Griffey had gotten his way on one of the few
general-manager matters he was right about. Then again, as
Mariners, both would have wanted jersey No. 24, Henderson would
have out-talked and maybe out-homered him, the clubhouse would have
to be expanded to accommodate the egos ...
</P>
<P>
   Ah, never mind.

M'S GET BEST OF DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Although they were part of Saturday's storyline, Jose
Canseco and Arthur Rhodes took no significant part in the game
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The whims of baseball are such, however, that Canseco and
Rhodes, combatants in a baseball brawl on Saturday, were the
crucial matchup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes won, striking out Canseco with two outs and the bases
loaded in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   And that meant Seattle won. Rhodes, who also struck out Greg
Vaughn with the bases loaded before facing Canseco, preserved an
8-4 win as the Mariners ended a 5-1 homestand with a flourish by
beating Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes and Canseco tangled on Saturday in the wake of the Devil
Rays' Esteban Yan having thrown at Seattle's Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco won that battle, remaining in the game while Rhodes was
ejected. A repeat victory by the Rays' DH could have been fatal for
the Mariners, but Rhodes made sure it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes threw two fastballs, a slider, another fastball and then
came back with a slider on which Canseco basically had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most pivotal parts of the game,'' shortstop
Alex Rodriguez said. ``He started it by striking out Vaughn, and
then came back and got Jose. And you could tell Jose wanted it. He
took swings that he hadn't taken earlier in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 2-2 slider Arthur threw was just plain nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than Canseco could handle, coming as it did at 83
mph. The fastballs had been clocked at 96 and 97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me two fastballs to hit earlier in the count, and I
missed them both,'' Canseco said. ``I got not one but two fastballs
to hit and I fouled them both back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy is throwing that hard and has that kind of slider,
if you miss two pitches you can hit, you're basically done.''
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter of the Mariners' season is basically done, and
41 games into 2000, Seattle has put together a team that's in first
place in the AL West. The M's are where they are because most days
someone, or several someones, has stepped up to take command.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday it was Rhodes. But it was also Edgar Martinez, who had
two hits, including his 13th homer. It was John Olerud, who had
four hits. It was Dan Wilson and Mike Cameron, who broke a 2-all
tie with back-to-back homers in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our position,'' Martinez said. ``And I like the way
we've been playing. What I like most is that we're playing very
consistent baseball. I can only remember one or two games where we
were out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost some games we should have won, sure. Everybody
does. But the thing is we're in there every day with an opportunity
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has matched its season high by getting to five games
over .500. Next up is a day-long flight Monday to Baltimore and the
start of a six-game road trip in Camden Yards. The Mariners also
play the Devil Rays in Tropicana Field next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Aaron Sele, who won to improve to 4-2, was not
keen on analyzing the season to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to assess a season midway through it,'' Sele said.
``Instead, what you have to do is grind it out.''
</P>
<P>
   That grind-it-out philosophy came in handy for the Mariners
Sunday, with Sele having trouble getting comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Another leadoff homer by Rickey Henderson, the 77th of his
career, helped get Seattle to a 2-0 lead, but Sele gave those back
in the second inning. It wasn't until the fourth, when Wilson and
Cameron both went deep, that Seattle moved ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   And the game wasn't Seattle's to own before a four-run sixth
inning was capped by Martinez's two-run homer. He's hit in 18 of
his last 19 games and is hitting .444 in May with eight homers and
26 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Edgar hot, hitting for average or hot, hitting for
power,'' Rodriguez said. ``I've never seen him this hot, hitting
for power and for average.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez equated his current numbers _ 13 homers, 50 RBIs and a
.363 average _ to a similar quick bolt from the gate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only year that the numbers have been anything like
this,'' Martinez said. ``Every time I make contact, it feels good.
Every contact is solid contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Solid contact put the Mariners in position to win the game.
Avoiding solid contact on Canseco's part was how they were going to
have to win it. And while Rhodes said there was no carryover from
Saturday's on-the-field brush with Canseco, the radar gun told a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for maybe his first game with us in April, I haven't
seen Arthur throw the ball that hard,'' pitching coach Bryan Price
said. ``The most impressive thing to me is that he really does rise
to the situation. When the game is on the line, he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted Jose. He was upset about what happened Saturday. And
what he did was turn that negative energy into a positive result
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson went to the mound a couple of time with Canseco
representing the potential tying run in the seventh. With so much
riding on the game, the catcher didn't want to make any mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, I want him to be 100 percent comfortable
with the pitch I call,'' Wilson said. ``We changed up our signs,
because that situation was the key to the whole entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was his fastball hard, but the couple of sliders he
threw were very hard. You could tell he was reaching back. The best
thing about that was that when he reached back, he stayed right
there, driving the ball through the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   And driving the Mariners home winners.

NICE TEAM YIELDS DULL HEADACHE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They are so wholesome and effective, so full of
character and camaraderie, they are impossible to rip _ even when
they blow a close one, and even when they lose two straight to the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   These first-place Red Sox are killing me.
</P>
<P>
   They were down, 7-0, in the sixth inning Sunday. Did they quit?
Of course not. They put the tying run on second base in the eighth
inning of a 7-5 loss.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the old days when selfish Sox players pointed
fingers, ripped teammates, made the police blotter, and threatened
reporters. Remember Roger Clemens tearing into Wade Boggs after
Boggsie got an official scorer to erase a Boggs error and inflate
Clemens's ERA? Remember flipped SUVs, Mo Vaughn blasting Dan
Duquette, a chorus line of drunks in the manager's office, and the
days of 25 players, 25 cabs?
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone. These Red Sox of the new millennium are 25
John Boy Waltons, golly-gee characters from a young-reader novel by
John R. Tunis. They hustle, they scrap, they give the dedicated Sox
fans a bang for the buck. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   It's big news if they lose, no news when they win.
</P>
<P>
   The Sons of Jimy Williams are the 25 Musketeers, one for all and
all for one. Nomar Garciaparra refuses to talk about his stats.
Darren Lewis won't gripe about losing his starting job to Carl
Everett. Jeff Frye helps Jose Offerman. John Valentin helps Wilton
Veras. Scott Hatteberg helps Jason Varitek. Pedro Martinez helps
little old ladies carry grocery bags that are too heavy. These guys
have all the edge of a Neil Diamond song.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership takes some well-deserved pounding over its quest for
taxpayer help to build a new park, but discouraging words are never
uttered in the Sox clubhouse. On Saturday the Townies lost, 2-1,
because of twin-kill baserunning blunders by Brian Daubach and Trot
Nixon. None of the players assigned blame to teammates. Sunday
Ramon Martinez was routed early, but no one is worried. Sox fans
now operate with the confidence that there'll be a Bret Saberhagen
or a Pete Schourek to fill the gap if someone breaks down. The team
just went 6-1 on a trip that ended with Garciaparra, Everett, and
Varitek on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are deadly for nitwit radio. The most controversial
Red Sox topic for the talk jocks recently was . . . Andy Sheets or
Manny Alexander? Nothing like good 25th-man-on-the-roster talk,
right guys?
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's loss, the cameras invaded manager Williams's
office, and one of the talking heads asked about the rarity of the
Red Sox losing a series.
</P>
<P>
   Returning fire with a chuckle and a shrug, a smiling Williams
said, ``Losing series? Ah, Boston. You guys are beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   These days it's just about impossible to suck the Sox into
controversy. They have become the model organization in all of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It starts at the top. Much as I hate to give credit to general
manager Duquette, let's look at what His Arrogance has done. He
lost Clemens and Vaughn and made the Sox better. He got Pedro and
Nomar for (relatively) short dough and locked them up for the prime
of their careers. He went to the salvage yard and found good
starting pitchers. He got the Pirates to pay 90 percent of
Schourek's salary. He stole Everett from Houston. He assembled a
roster of few stars and multiple role players. He's allegedly
putting together a good farm system. He's made the Red Sox the
blueprint for overachievement and clubhouse calm.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has the lowest earned run average in the majors. Pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan, a.k.a. the Nutty Professor, has become a mound
MENSA without peer. Williams is a sandlot savant _ Sunday Frye
pinch hits for Nixon, who is batting .331, and cracks a single and
double _ who says little but makes the guys want to play for him.
Boston's bench is stocked with hungry hearts ready and able to help
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Hub, the Sox are the feel-good movie of the summer.
Ridicule is heaped on the Celtics and Bruins, and the Patriots claw
to regain respectability, but the Sox have become the Team of the
People. They consistently play the game the way it is supposed to
be played, even when they lose. They don't get too high or too low.
Physically and mentally, they are built for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to stay that way the best we can,'' said Williams.
``Saturday we were in the game from the first pitch. Today we were
back in the game and that's all you can ask when you're down,
7-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and managers from other teams rave about the Red Sox.
The national media fawns all over Boston's nine. The Red Sox could
reach the playoffs for the third time in three years. They are one
game ahead of the Yankees and they have not been blown out in a
while. They're in New York this weekend and the Apple will be agog
_ trying to figure out how Boston is able to keep up with New York
with what appears to be an inferior roster.
</P>
<P>
   I can't figure it out myself. I tell ya, these guys are killing
me.

RED SOX FINALLY TAMED BY TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Don't panic, Red Sox fans. Pedro's pitching Tuesday
night against the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone in the Red Sox clubhouse was worried after a
second straight loss to the lowly Tigers, who came into Fenway for
a weekend series with the worst record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 7-5 teaser of a loss ended a string of six series the
Red Sox had won, dating back to a set in Cleveland April 28-30.
</P>
<P>
   In a frustrating afternoon for the sellout Fenway faithful of
31,893, the Red Sox fell behind, 7-0, early as starter Ramon
Martinez showed more rust than resiliency after his mini-vacation
resting a pulled hamstring. And their comeback attempt fell short
as they left 11 runners stranded.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were a miserable 4 of 24 with runners in scoring
position in the series, 2 of 12 Sunday, which was the main reason
they lost two of three to the Tigers, including a 2-1 decision
Saturday in which shaky baserunning also proved costly.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, not surprisingly, downplayed leaving all
those runners on when his team was chipping away at the big lead
the Tigers and starter Hideo Nomo had built after the first three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in scoring position,'' said Williams. ``The right
guys got on. We can't do it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was chased after 2 1/3 innings in which he gave up six
hits and allowed seven earned runs on a series of bloop hits.
``They had good aim,'' joked Williams. But the Sox slowly came
back.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Mike Stanley started it by hitting his eighth home
run of the year (five off Tigers pitching) with one out in the
sixth. A single to right by Carl Everett caused Detroit manager
Phil Garner to go to his bullpen quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It started a series of moves and counter-moves that brought in
seven Tigers pitchers, who threw 195 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stanley who also ended the Red Sox' comeback in the
bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Detroit lead was down to 7-5, with Donnie Sadler on
third and Jeff Frye on second with two out and Stanley at the plate
representing the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said he was looking only to make contact. ``All I wanted
to do was tie the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tigers pitcher Doug Brocail was worried about more than that
as he threw pitch after pitch that Stanley fought off. Brocail also
was conscious of Stanley's ability to determine what type of pitch
was coming before it was delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's given me some of the toughest at-bats,'' said Brocail,
who was so paranoid about facing Stanley that he used different
grips and disguised his delivery as best he could.
</P>
<P>
   This time it worked as Brocail slipped a curveball on the inside
corner past Stanley that was good for an inning-ending strikeout.
``He just froze me,'' said Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I threw him a fastball that he hits out of the stadium, we
lose,'' said Brocail.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Red Sox lost. Stanley said it was just part of the
game. ``We're still just as good as anybody in the league,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game. Sometimes things go that way. We'll
take the day off (Monday) and come back and start again, ready to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pedro Martinez pitching, the Red Sox will be more than
ready. Over the last two seasons, Martinez has a 13-2 record in
starts following Boston losses.
</P>
<P>
   Williams just smiled when asked if a Pedro start on the horizon
gave him a sense of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I didn't even think of that,'' he said.
``I just know we have an off day. Certainly Pedro is a fine young
pitcher. But we have a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was pure Williams. What happened over the
weekend was not the way the Red Sox want the rest of the season to
play out, especially with their first encounter of the season with
the Yankees in New York this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But losing a series every once in a while is acceptable as long
as the confidence level remains high, which Williams says is the
case. ``The fire is still right in the clubhouse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yesterday &LR;  just temporarily doused the flames.

 Labor official talks about paycheck inequity  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Full-time working women had to work all of
1999 and until May 11 of this year to make the same median wage men
did in 1999, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Kemp, regional administrator of the department's Women's
Bureau, talked about Equal Pay Day (May 11) and issues facing
working women at a public forum Sunday at All Souls Unitarian
Universalist Church in Kansas City. About 30 persons attended the
event, titled ``Lifting the Glass Ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said the public should be aware of the pay gap that exists
between men's and women's wages. She said women in 1999 earned only
76.5 percent of men's median weekly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pay gap is very real,'' she said. ``With so many women as
heads of households now, it's even more important to address this
discrepancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said pay inequities translate into a pension inequities for
older women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no wonder the poverty rate among older women is so
great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said one obstacle to equal pay is lack of information about
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are told that people aren't supposed to discuss
salaries,'' she said. ``But there is nothing illegal about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp also invited employers to evaluate their pay structures to
check for discrepancies that can't be explained by legitimate,
nondiscriminatory factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy A. Witherspoon, a process development specialist at the
bureau, also spoke at the forum about child labor abuse nationwide
and worldwide. She detailed federal child labor laws and encouraged
people to know the laws.

KNICKS BEAT HEAT IN MIAMI, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Memo to the Miami Heat: The Knicks are better. Deal with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Miami. You can slice, dice, dissect, analyze, and
otherwise ponder just exactly how these big games turn out the way
they do, but when all the scrutinizing is done the fact is that in
each of the last three years the New York Knicks have gone into
your house and walked off with the victory that advances them, and
not you, into the next round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The 65th lead change in this seven-game series was the ultimate
difference in the latest installment of basketball's fiercest
rivalry. Trailing, 82-81, with 1:32 remaining following a
straightaway Tim Hardaway 3-pointer, New York regained the lead 12
seconds later when an Alonzo Mourning gamble failed and Patrick
Ewing converted a Larry Johnson entry pass for a dunk. Neither team
would score again, and thus New York's 83-82 victory sends it into
the Eastern Conference finals that begin Tuesday night at Indiana's
Conseco Field House.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a very, very painful offseason for the Heat, who
couldn't hold an 18-point lead in Game 6, who led this one by 6
(79-73) with 4:44 remaining, and who scored just two Hardaway field
goals in the final 7:01. ``There's not much more we can learn from
it,'' sighed Heat coach Pat Riley, who had a lot to say about the
officiating of Dick Bavetta, Danny Crawford, and Bennett Salvatore.
``We've been here before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Riley view is that there were too many ticky-tack fouls
called, especially in the last five minutes of the game. New York,
the road team, was 28 for 31 from the line. ``I've been around 30
years, and I've been coaching for 18, and I've never seen a playoff
game determined by so many fouls out on the floor, not shooting
fouls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Riley and his staff would be poring over Pacers
tapes right now if his team had submitted a professional
performance when it did get to the line. Yes, the Knicks were great
from the stripe. But the Heat were a dismal 11 for 21. In such an
instance, it's probably better not to whine about the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game, to borrow one of Riley's old LA expressions, of
``skirmishes.'' Miami led by 11 (25-14) early, as Mourning (29
points, 13 rebounds, 5 blocks) got off to a spirited start. A great
performance by both Latrell Sprewell (20 of his 24 in the first
half) and the New York bench sparked a 29-14 second quarter and a
6-point (45-39) halftime lead. Trailing, 49-42, the Heat responded
with a 14-4 run, at which point New York made its own little charge
and thus the teams entered the final 12 minutes of a four-year,
24-game war tied at 65.
</P>
<P>
   Before crying about the officials, Miami should review the
fourth-quarter tape and ask itself where it would have been had
there not been three (3) 24-second violations. And with his team
up, 79-73, with the ball, Mourning might re-consider his decision
to take a corner fallaway while guarded by Johnson instead of
taking it to the hoop. That miss turned out to be doubly disastrous
when P.J. Brown fouled Chris Childs on the rebound and Childs made
both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs. Talk about seizing the moment. Guess who scored
the first 10 New York points of the fourth period? Childs. Guess
whose steal and conventional fast-break 3-point play at a juncture
(71-65, Heat) when Miami had momentum was, according to Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy, ``critical, because we were teetering?''
Childs. ``It was the best pressure game of his career,'' said
assistant coach Brendan Malone.
</P>
<P>
   It all came down to this: New York by 1 and Miami in possession
with 12.4 seconds left. New York came out in its usual ABM (Anybody
But Mourning) swarming defense. The ball went from Zo to Jamal
Mashburn and then to sub forward Clarence Weatherspoon, whose shot
would determine Miami's fate. His 12-footer in the lane bounced off
the rim. Sprewell beat Dan Majerle to the bouncing ball and called
time with 2.1 seconds left. One timeout later, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never surprised how a game goes,'' said Van Gundy.
``That it came down to the last possession was fitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed. And when the same team wins the big one three years in a
row on the other guy's court, it's got the bragging rights. Next
time, Miami, make the free throws.

   LOS ANGELES _ If Chad ``Freddy'' Kreuter finds himself suspended
this week, so what.
</P>
<P>
   If Rick ``Jack'' Dempsey gets pulled into Frank Robinson's
dragnet, fine.
</P>
<P>
   But if any of those ever-lovin'-losin', Harry
Caray-derriere-kissin', Second City psychos who infest Wrigley
Field manage to skirt punishment for luring the Dodgers bullpen
into the stands to join their AA meeting last week, that'd be
baseball's cruelest punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, a Dodgers cap costs about 20 bucks at the trinket stand.
You don't need to whack a visiting team member over the head to get
one, even if all your cash for the week has already been spent on
some of Mrs. O'Leary's private stock.
</P>
<P>
   Be thankful Kreuter didn't choke the livin' daytime baseball out
of all you Windy City winos. If Reggie Smith was still the Dodgers
bench coach, none of you'd be around today to worry about missing
last call 'cause you'd be with St. Harry putting your mouth under
the spigot right about now.
</P>
<P>
   Warning to that poor racist John Rocker: When you get to
Chitown, don't expect that L.A.-friendly moon-shot reception. The
only friendly confines these fans should be invited to need bars
over the windows instead of on the concourse, along with a 9 p.m.
lock down. ...
</P>
<P>
   -The question isn't which hat Rickey Henderson will end up
wearing on his Hall of Fame plaque. It's whether he'll have worn
one for every team in existence before he gets there. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Kobe Bryant wants to come up with a rap song for his new bride,
but he can't think of a rhyme for ``prenup''. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Magic Johnson's next project: Opening fitness centers in the
inner-city area. Calling 'em ``Magic Clubs''. ...
</P>
<P>
   -The Clippers can do a lot with the No.3 pick. All three UCLA
players should still be on the board. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Last time the Fox network sent a sports chick over to Egypt to
start prying open pyramids, Suzy Kolber's career was cursed.
</P>
<P>
   Hope the same doesn't happen to Lisa Guerrero, who joins Hugh
Downs at an excavation site in the middle of the desert for Fox's
latest tomb raid special (Tuesday, 8 p.m.). ...
</P>
<P>
   -Finally, in all seriousness ...
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to be sorta skeptical watching former Dodger Steve
Garvey, writer Dick Schaap and one-time L.A. Raider Steve Beuerlein
on C-SPAN last week, testifying before a Capitol Hill Senate
appropriations subcommittee on whether funding needed to be
extended for finding a cure for Lou Gehrig's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   Celebs standing up before politicians on TV trying to raise
money for their pet causes can look suspicious. And Sen. Arlen
Specter addressed that fact.
</P>
<P>
   When Beuerlein brought up before the panel his friend, Jeff
Scherer, a former football player at Long Beach State who in a very
short time has watched his body ravaged by the disease to where he
can't even speak for himself, there was no reason to doubt his
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey then responded to Specter: There are many who criticize
and few who act. I challenge those who question our motives to look
into this and do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

ST. JAMES, BOAT MAKE INDY FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
 500-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Against incredible odds, Lyn St. James and Billy
Boat combined to provide a bit of history and dash of bravado on
Bump Day, the second and final day of time trials that set the
33-car field for the 84th running of the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Both overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles after crashing
their primary cars and jumping into backup cars belonging to other
drivers to make last-gasp qualifications in the final and frenzied
half-hour of Bump Day.
</P>
<P>
   Driving Stephan Gregoire's backup fielded by Dick Simon Racing
that had the engine cowling emblazoned with the words ``Yes She
Can!,'' the 53-year-old St. James became the oldest competitor and
second woman to earn a starting spot with a four-lap average of
218.826 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, meanwhile, qualified a new backup belonging to front-row
starter Eliseo Salazar. Fielded by Boat's former boss, A.J. Foyt,
the car had yet to turn a lap at the Speedway. And yet, with 46
seconds remaining before the final gun went off, Boat jumped into
the car and put it into next Sunday's show with a daring four-lap
run of 218.872 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a day for me and my family,'' said a beaming
Boat. ``There's no place like Indy for the roller coaster of
emotions, and we experienced it all today.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James, who landed in the middle of Row 11 after failing to
qualify the last two years, joined 19-year-old Sarah Fisher, who
qualified on the outside of Row 7 Saturday, as the first two women
to compete in the same race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope women around the country know that you can do this and
that there's more coming,'' said St. James, who created a
foundation in her name to help promote women in racing. ``This is
not a male-dominated sport.''
</P>
<P>
   After tearing up her primary car Saturday ``on a big hit that
certainly put a dent in our program,'' St. James was asked if she
felt any additional pressure to make the field, especially after
Fisher had qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' she said. ``I just wanted to be in the race.
I was proud of Sarah and I cheered her when she went down pit road
on her attempt, but, no, I was feeling the pressure I had put on
myself to get into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just elated to be in the field,'' she added, ``because I
know what it feels like to be bumped and I'm just glad to be back
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Boat.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Boat was sitting pretty on the pole as Foyt's
driver, but Sunday the 34-year-old native of Phoenix was left
scrambling for a ride. He waved off his initial qualifying attempt
Saturday, crashed his primary car fielded by Team Pelfrey on his
second attempt early Sunday, and was left knocking on the garage
door of his former car owner in Gasoline Alley when another ride
fell through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think a lot of Billy,'' said Foyt, who had an
amicable parting of the ways last season after campaigning Boat for
three years on the Indy Racing League circuit. ``I've got a lot of
respect for him and I came here ready to run just two cars, but
when I saw a friend of mine who was in trouble, I just wanted to
help. It was just one way I try to pay back all those people who
have helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than 3 1/2 hours left before the end of Bump Day,
Foyt put Boat in a car that Roberto Guerrero had failed to qualify
in two attempts. Boat put together two solid laps before his third
was hampered by a short on the electronic dash that caused the car
to slow from 219 to 150 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   Boat became the 31st qualifier when he brought the car home with
a last lap of 198.724 m.p.h., good for a spot with a four-lap
average of 192.105.

WASHINGTON'S HOOKER SPRINTS TO PAC-10 DOUBLE VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Ja'Warren Hooker is in a zone. Or a groove. Or a
rhythm. Or whatever you call it when an athlete seems to transcend
his competition and is running basically against himself and the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Washington junior sprinter came into the
Pacific-10 Conference track and field championships expected to do
big things, and came up even bigger in the two-day meet by winning
the 100- and 200-meter dashes and leading the Huskies to a
surprising third-place finish in the 4x100 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker's time in the 100 Sunday night was 10.19 seconds. Half an
hour later, he won the 200 in 20.39.
</P>
<P>
   He has run faster, but rarely with such ease and powerful grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run easy, you usually run better,'' Hooker said after
finishing his impressive weekend by running a devastating second
leg on the Huskies' 4x400 relay. ``When you try to run hard, you
usually don't run as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker, an eight-time state high school champion while at
Ellensburg High School, has been making everything look easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, he has lowered his own school record in
the 200 meters, broken the UW record in the 400 and doubled at the
conference meet _ winning the same sprint titles he did as a
freshman two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Hooker will run the 100 and 200 at the NCAA championships in two
weeks in Durham, N.C. The plan is to then switch the focus to the
200 and 400 for the U.S. Olympic Trials in July in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   But looking too far ahead is taking too much away from what
Hooker accomplished at Hayward Field the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not peaking yet,'' Hooker said. ``I think my training is
just kind of picking up and everything is going in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker's sprint double and a victory in the shot put by Ben
Lindsey gave the Huskies 30 of their 83 points as they finished
tied for fourth with UCLA in the team competition.
</P>
<P>
   USC defended its men's title with 154 points and UCLA won its
fourth consecutive women's championship with 167{ points. The
Washington State women were fourth and the Washington women
finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But no individual performer in this meet was more impressive
than Hooker, who simply did what he was expected to do and
expecting to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing,'' he said, ``you want to make it look easy.
It's not supposed to look hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 100, Hooker again had only a so-so start, coming out of
the blocks a blink behind the Arizona State duo of Dwight Phillips,
the Pac-10 leader this spring who was on Hooker's right; and Marcus
Brunson, who had the conference's third fastest time and was on
Hooker's left.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, however, it was Hooker's second, third and fourth
steps that provided the impetus he needed to surge away from the
pack 20 meters in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who had run 10.11, was second in 10.30 and Brunson
finished third in 10.32.
</P>
<P>
   ``My start is generally not that great,'' said Hooker, who was
even slower out of the blocks in the prelims Saturday but still
managed to run the day's best time (10.20). ``My two, three, four
step is usually the key to my race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have it done.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hooker wasn't done. There was still the 200 to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in lane 4, Hooker had made up the stagger on USC's
Andre Ammons in lane 5 by the time they emerged from the turn. That
was basically the race, as Hooker seemed to glide to the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going for a special time, I was just trying to go out
and run a special race,'' Hooker said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 4x100 relay, Hooker was moved into the lead-off leg and
put the Huskies in front with an opening 100 meters that was as
graceful as it was powerful. The Huskies hung on to finish third,
after entering the meet with the conference's seventh-best time.
</P>
<P>
   In the 4x400 relay, Hooker was fourth and 20 meters behind
UCLA's Tom Jonsson when he got the baton for his second leg. He
passed two other runners down the back stretch and pulled ahead of
Jonsson just before making his pass to Greg Forni. Despite Hooker's
45.9-second leg, the Huskies faded to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bit of sweet revenge for Hooker. After becoming the
first UW athlete to win two events at the Pac-10 meet two years
ago, Hooker struggled because of a stress fracture in his left shin
last year _ when he finished fourth in the 100 and third in the 200
at the conference meet and didn't even compete at the NCAA meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good after being out last year,'' Hooker said. ``A
lot of people forgot about me. To come back and run well at Oregon
and at the conference meet, it's a good feeling.''

REVOLUTION HAVE EXCELLENT FOOTHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution have a right to celebrate
Monday. This is the one-month anniversary of their elevation into
first place in the Eastern Division, a position they retained with
a 1-0 victory at Chicago Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, the Revolution salvaged a 1-1 tie with the Fire on
a frigid night at Foxboro Stadium to creep into the division lead.
They since have lost only once, and have 16 points in 11 games,
tied with Miami for the lead in the division and fourth place among
the 12 Major League Soccer teams. Both Miami and the Revolution
have capitalized on the demise of D.C. United, which fell to 2-9-1
with a 2-1 loss at Los Angeles Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the way into the season, the Revolution are on pace
to break their record of 37 points, earned in 1997. They have been
on similar paces in the past, including last season, but collapsed
after a facing adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Revolution were on course for the playoffs when
they were hammered by Los Angeles, 5-2, July 11, then experienced a
disastrous second half. But this Revolution squad might not be as
fragile.
</P>
<P>
   It recovered from a 4-3 loss to Colorado last Wednesday with a
concise and pragmatic performance against Chicago. Many of the
costly mistakes _ the lack of concentration, the failure to find
skill players in the final minutes _ were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire became frustrated and, lacking their two best players,
Lubos Kubik (knee) and Hristo Stoitchkov (groin), lost direction.
Meanwhile, the Revolution remained faithful to their game plan,
which was based more on stamping out the Fire's attack than
creating their own. This was a valid strategy, since the Revolution
were under no obligation to attack as the visiting team, and
because their forwards were providing only a minimal threat.
</P>
<P>
   The goal resulted from a dead-ball situation as Wolde Harris
headed in a Mauricio Ramos corner kick. The winning strike in three
of the Revolution's four victories has been off a restart, as have
10 of their 17 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos has been effective off set pieces with accurate and
powerful left-footed drives. This is a weapon the Revolution's
creative players should be able to continue to thrive on. William
Sunsing is adept at drawing fouls in dangerous positions, and
Johnny Torres is improving in this respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution don't have to rely only on Ramos to take free
kicks. Imad Baba and Harris have scored on direct kicks this
season, and John Harkes and Ivan McKinley are also effective.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the Revolution seem to be finding a balance.
They performed without three of their most proven players _ Leonel
Alvarez (left ankle sprain), Dan Calichman (groin), and Harkes
(calf) _ but appeared poised and purposeful against Chicago. At the
end, there were six Revolution players on the field age 24 or less.
And coach Fernando Clavijo appears willing to continue to give the
youngsters a chance as the Revolution prepare to host Los Angeles
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good mix of veteran and young players on the field,
and you need that,'' said Mike Burns, who moved from defense into
midfield. ``In the past, we might have given up a late goal and
lost a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Benfica, which finished in third place in Portugal this year,
will meet Colombia's national team in the second game of
Wednesday's doubleheader at Foxboro Stadium. Benfica tied AS Roma,
1-1, in an exhibition before more than 29,000 at Giants Stadium
Saturday night.

MARTINEZ HAUNTED BY BLOOPER SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The pitching line came straight from a slaughterhouse
butcher block: 2 1/3 innings, 6 hits, 7 runs, all earned.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was as revealing as a Jimy Williams press
conference: brimming with evasion, devoid of useful information.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, author of those numbers, was beaten by the
Detroit Tigers, who outlasted the Red Sox, 7-5, Sunday at Fenway
Park. But he wasn't exactly battered by the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first start in 11 days because of a balky left
hamstring, Martinez was undone by wretched location. Where he
placed his pitches wasn't his problem; where the Tigers sent them
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some breaks,'' said Martinez's catcher, Jason
Varitek. ``Some balls fell in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Jefferies, the first batter Martinez faced on this raw
autumn afternoon that somehow wandered into May, set the elusive
tone when he gift-wrapped a 2-1 pitch around the Pesky Pole in
right field for a 300-foot home run.
</P>
<P>
   And the unlikely hits just kept on coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Dean Palmer opened with a double that skipped
over the first-base bag and caromed off the right-field grandstand;
cue shots have been struck with greater vigor in the billiards
parlor down the block on Brookline Avenue. Palmer went to third on
a grounder to second and made it 2-0 on Jose Macias's single to
left, perhaps Detroit's only bona fide hit off Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was similarly blessed in the third, his farewell
inning. Brad Ausmus launched his demise with a grounder into the
hole between shortstop and third; after racing to his right to
snare the ball, shortstop Donnie Sadler tried to get the Detroit
catcher with a jump shot to first that wound up in the Boston
dugout as Ausmus settled in at second. Rich Becker advanced him to
third with a bloop single to left, and Juan Gonzalez made it 3-0
with a check-swing double into the gap in right-center. These were
shaving nicks, not gouges. But two walks and a fielder's choice
later, the bases were loaded, the Tigers were up, 4-0, and Martinez
was getting a conciliatory sendoff from Williams. The manager waved
in John Wasdin, who finished the five-run inning by allowing the
baserunners to score, though all the damage was charged to
Martinez's account.
</P>
<P>
   The righthander's stint on the mound was a marathon compared to
his postgame stay in the clubhouse. He had vanished within minutes
of the final out in order to meet his family. But he relayed an
apology to the curious media and offered a brief analysis of his
performance via Red Sox spokesman Kevin Shea: ``My location was out
of focus a little bit. The hammy didn't bother me. The cold didn't
bother me. The extra days (between starts) got me off my rhythm. I
was just out of the zone with my pitches. That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rust seemed to hurt Martinez more than the Tiger bats.
He readily acknowledges that he is a slave to routine, and his
regimen was disrupted beyond repair after May 10, when the
hamstring betrayed him in a five-inning, three-hit shutout effort
that propelled the Red Sox to a 5-3 Fenway victory over the Chicago
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, Williams kept him in ice packs for his
scheduled start last week, and the layoff was reflected in Sunday's
25-32 ball-strike ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a repetition guy,'' said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
``He needs his side (work) and his start every fifth or sixth
day.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Williams (``Ramon threw the ball good'') and Varitek
(``He looked pretty strong'') offered critical endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   And Varitek anticipates brighter prospects for Martinez during
the weekend's Armageddon against the Yankees in New York: ``I don't
expect him to give up seven the next time he throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he can remove misfortune from his repertoire.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-STUDENTS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ A student movement
demanding sweeping political change is surging in popularity and is
now a significant target for attack by the government of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. The movement, called Otpor, or
Resistance, has given fresh energy, insouciance and an arrogant
innocence to Milosevic's political opposition, which has had
difficulty preserving its unity and its credibility over the last
few years. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CHINA (Washington) _ For seven years now, very little
has gone as planned in Bill Clinton's effort to shape a new
relationship with China. The problem has not been lack of vision;
it has been one of execution. The Chinese have hardly cooperated,
jailing more dissidents even as Clinton argued that economic
freedom would eventually produce political freedom. Nor has there
been much help from the president's fellow Democrats, most of whom
have fought his trade and China policies at every turn. And Clinton
himself tells close colleagues he has let political calculations
lead him into major mistakes in dealing with China. By David E.
Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ It turns out that the most momentous act
of Vladimir Putin's first days as Russia's elected president has
not been his choice of a cabinet, or the internal debate over a
sweeping economic restructuring plan, or even the approval of two
nuclear-arms treaties. Rather, it is Putin's launch last week of a
swift and stunning crusade to gut the power and political influence
of Russia's 89 governors _ and not coincidentally, perhaps, to
enhance his own. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-ARMS (Undated) _ It took decades of international
pressure and weeks of intense negotiations, but when a month-long
conference of more than 185 nations ended at the United Nations
this weekend, the five original atomic powers had agreed for the
first time to the ``unequivocal'' elimination of nuclear arms. By
Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   ETHIOPIA-ERITREA-U.S. (Washington) _ President Clinton and a
trio of his aides took a special interest in trying to head off one
of the continent's biggest and costliest wars. But the
behind-the-scenes courting of the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles
Zenawi, and the Eritrean president, Isaias Afewerki, ended in
tatters 10 days ago when Ethiopia rolled into Eritrea with tanks
and artillery and launched trench warfare reminiscent of World War
I. By Jane Perlez.

<P>
   PRIESTS-RECRUIT (Undated) _ At a time when other dioceses
throughout the nation are struggling through a shortage of priests,
Edward M. Egan, the bishop of Bridgeport, soon to become New York's
next archbishop, has vigorously recruited men for the priesthood,
ordaining a higher proportion of priests than any other diocese in
the Northeast. The bishop's success weighed heavily in his
nomination to head the New York archdiocese, said one church
official involved in the highly secretive process. By Diana Jean
Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   OBIT-CARTLAND (Undated) _ Barbara Cartland, whose outpouring of
more than 700 romance novels during seven decades made her the
undisputed queen of a genre for hundreds of millions of readers the
world over, died Sunday at her home near Hatfield in Hertfordshire,
England. She was 98. By Richard Severo.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-CLOSING (Haverhill, Mass.) _ Bradford College, a small
liberal arts school that had been struggling to find a niche since
it became a four-year, coeducational institution a generation ago,
died Sunday after a bittersweet commencement ceremony that drew
hundreds of alumni from around the country. It was 197 years old.
By Jodi Wilgoren.

<P>
   ASTHMA-TRACKING (Undated) _ As the number of asthma cases in the
United States rises sharply and researchers scramble to find the
cause, newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention shows that a majority of states have no system to track
the number of people with asthma or monitor what happens to them,
and only a few states have any recent reports on the illness in
their jurisdictions. By Philip J. Hilts.

as a treatment for cancer is holding up. By Lawrence K. Altman.

mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign strategy
designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert and

the presidential candidates as the campaign progresses.) By Melinda
Henneberger.

</P>
<P>
   GORE-DAD (Undated) _ Born poor in the remote settlement of
Possum Hollow, Tenn., Albert Arnold Gore lived through the worst of
the Depression and spent seven years working his way through
college. He always said he ran for office because as a kid he had
seen the picture of a cousin who was running for the state
Legislature on a utility pole and liked the idea of seeing his own
face up there. But he was also moved by ideas, and was a committed
free trader and New Dealer who believed that, as he said, ``nothing
cures poverty like money.'' By Melinda Henneberger.

<P>
   CLINTON-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ On Wednesday night, President
Clinton will headline the most lucrative political fund-raising
event in political history, collecting at least $25 million from

<P>
   AP-KOREA-MEDIA (Undated) _ On Sept. 29, 1999, The Associated
Press provided extensive evidence that GIs killed a helpless group
of civilians in the early days of the Korean War. Since then, its
report of the incident at No Gun Ri, 17 months in the making, has
became a media personality in its own right. It has been praised.
It has been followed. It has been honored with journalism's top
prizes. More recently, it has been pilloried. Some wonder if AP
deserved a Pulitzer for the story? A look at the criticism and the

<P>
   PRIVACY-ASSESS (Washington) _ The Federal Trade Commission plans
to go to Congress this week to seek tough new privacy rules for
Internet businesses. But the FTC, the nation's consumer protection
agency, is likely to encounter skepticism from key Republicans and
from industry groups about whether the government can impose

   ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ The E-Commerce column: Most
e-commerce companies are too busy keeping their heads above water
to expand into other countries, but there are exceptions. Sites
like Dell, Schwab and Amazon are running headlong into the global
fray, in hopes of winning first mover advantage in countries that

   COURAGE-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The Advertising column: To the
British, it is a brand of alcoholic beverage. To fans of John F.
Kennedy, it is the subject of profiles. To the Cowardly Lion, it is
reason to see the Wizard. And to Land Rover North America, it is
the centerpiece of a revamped advertising and marketing campaign,
the first created by the company's new agency, GSD&AMP;M in Austin,
Texas. The subject? Courage, of course. By Stuart Elliott.

   BRASSAI-EXHIBIT (Paris) _ With the publication of his first
book, ``Paris de Nuit,'' in 1932, Brassai did more than win
immediate acclaim as a photographer. In what was already a much
photographed city, he created iconic images of nighttime Paris that
redefined how it was seen, almost as if darkness were its natural
condition. In the process he established an artistic trademark
that, if exploited, would have assured him a lifetime of fortune as
well as fame. Brassai, however, was something of a reluctant

THROWN INTO FIRE, FRYE PANS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's tough enough being a reserve and trying to stay
sharp, but even tougher when you're the object of some booing from
the home fans when you get a shot to produce.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Red Sox infielder/outfielder Jeff Frye
at Fenway Park Sunday when manager Jimy Williams sent the
righthanded hitter up for Trot Nixon against Tigers lefthanded
reliever Allen McDill.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, one of Boston's hottest hitters, swings from the left
side and when Frye walked to the plate in the seventh inning, the
displeasure of some fans was audible.
</P>
<P>
   But Frye made Williams's move pay off, singling with two runners
on to load the bases in a three-run inning that closed the deficit
to 7-4. Then, after going to right field to replace Nixon, Frye
battled back from an 0-2 count against righthander Doug Brocail in
his next at-bat and doubled to the left-field corner, scoring John
Valentin with Boston's final run in the 7-5 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Frye, who entered batting .417 against lefties but only .129
against righties, hadn't had a pinch hit since the 1997 season when
he homered against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Once Boston's starting second baseman, Frye now gets his playing
time behind Jose Offerman and wherever else Williams needs him,
mainly in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk of the Red Sox shopping Frye to break the
roster logjam, but until a trade comes _ and it may not _ all he
can do is try to contribute when called upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' said Frye, who is 5 for his last 8.
``There's something wrong with you if you don't want to be an
everyday player. I try to stay sharp when I'm not getting the
at-bats and all I can do is come out, work hard, and try to be
prepared when I get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Nixon, who was batting .351 in his previous 10 games
and had made a great leaping catch to end the top of the seventh,
was, according to the manager, not based on Frye's average against
lefthanders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was playing the percentages, Williams seemed a bit
miffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Percentages, what percentages?'' said the manager. ``I don't
know about them percentages. Just play them all. These kids can
play. I believe in all of them. That's the most important thing,
whether they're successful or not. And if they come through, that
doesn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   So Frye strode to the plate the innocent target of the fans'
displeasure with Williams's strategy, but soon he was standing on
first base with the cheers of the converts ringing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew (Williams) had used me in that spot before,'' said
Frye, who is hitting .244. ``Jimy just pointed my way and said I
was going in for Trot.''
</P>
<P>
   But more impressive was the way he battled back against Brocail,
a pitcher who always has given him problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 0 and 2, I just didn't want to strike out,'' said Frye. ``I
didn't want to get beat chasing a slider. I had my mind set that
he'd have to get me out with his fastball. He gave me a good slider
that I fouled off and then I got a pitch to hit and hit it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to right field ``felt strange,'' he said. ``It's a
position I don't play a lot. It's definitely different. I've got a
lot more going on in the infield.''
</P>
<P>
   Come Tuesday against Toronto, Frye can only glance at the lineup
card to see if his recent success will translate into more playing
time. But he won't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy job,'' he said. ``Sometimes that's the way
the cards are dealt. All you can do is make the most of your
chances and be prepared. I know what the situation is here. I don't
expect to be the starting second baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I can help, sometimes I don't,'' added Frye. ``But
you can't drive yourself crazy worrying about it.''

 SPRINTS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Lake Quinsigamond had a brown tint to it
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. As in Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   The undefeated Bears lived up to their pre-regatta billing as
they captured the varsity heavyweight title in the 55th edition of
the Eastern Sprints under gloomy skies. It was Brown's fourth
Sprints win, the last coming in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears covered the 2,000-meter course in 5 minutes 43.18
seconds and displayed exceptional power over the last 300 meters.
Brown really poured it on, much to the delight of its hundreds of
fans. Princeton was second (5:44.99), Wisconsin third (5:46.21),
Harvard fourth (5:46.59), Dartmouth fifth (5:53.21), and
Northeastern sixth (5:53.44).
</P>
<P>
   The win also put Brown in a position to row at England's Henley
Regatta in July. ``Winning this makes Henley a strong
possibility,'' said coach Scott Roop.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's victory certainly wasn't a surprise because it entered
the event with a 6-0 record and was top-seeded among the heavies.
But Brown also made a statement that it will have a huge overall
say in future Sprints.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also was top-seeded in the second varsity and freshman
events and did well (first and third, respectively). Only two will
graduate from the varsity boat, so the future looks good.
</P>
<P>
   Brown doesn't have a varsity lightweight program, which was good
for the rest of the field, as fourth-seeded Columbia prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were capable of winning here,'' said Roop. ``We
came here confident but certainly not cocky. We had to row a
perfect race and we did. You have to be perfect. One little mistake
could be very costly and opponents like Harvard, Princeton, and
Wisconsin could take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rowed well. I'm very proud of my guys and hopefully we can
do as well at the IRAs in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan was simple. Get out fast and stay there. The
guys did that. You can't approach the Sprints like a dual race.
There are always four or five other solid crews to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown smashed its rivals during the regular season. The victims
were Syracuse by 5 lengths; Boston University by 10; Harvard by a
half-length after Brown relaxed during the final 200 meters;
Dartmouth by 4 lengths; Northeastern by 2; and Princeton by 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard heavies won the Adams Cup under odd circumstances.
The Adams, contested annually among Harvard, Navy, and the
University of Pennsylvania, was canceled because of inclement
weather at Annapolis April 29. It was agreed that the boat that
finished highest in the Sprints would win the Cup. Penn and Navy
failed to qualify for the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern qualified for finals in varsity, JV, and freshmen
for the first time since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UFdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Columbia lightweight crew won its first varsity Eastern Sprints
crown by nipping top-seeded Yale and second-seeded Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, seeded fourth, was a hair behind Yale after 1,500
meters, and the boats slugged it out inch by inch. The Lions posted
a photo-finish 5 minutes 52.48 seconds to the Eli's 5:52.59.
Harvard finished in 5:55.63.
</P>
<P>
   A Columbia gold medal is a rare commodity. The only other time
the Lions struck gold was in 1964 when they won a freshman
lightweight race.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia coach Tom Terhaar, in his fourth season, said, ``We
just took it 500 meters at a time. The guys really hung tough and
it was just a terrific race and effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia dropped its first two races of the year to Rutgers and
Georgetown, narrowly lost to Yale, then beat Cornell, MIT, and
Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were capable of winning,'' said Terhaar. ``It took
a super effort and we got it.''

`BULLET' MAY CREATE EXPLOSIVE RIVALRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Could a heated rivalry develop between Red Bullet,
who won Saturday's Preakness at Pimlico, and Fusaichi Pegasus, who
won the Kentucky Derby and finished second in the Preakness?
</P>
<P>
   Neither side seemed very enthused Sunday about trying to reenact
Affirmed vs. Alydar or Sunday Silence vs. Easy Goer. Right now they
stand even, as Fusaichi Pegasus defeated Red Bullet in the Wood
Memorial at Aqueduct last month (Red Bullet did not run in the
Derby). There is a lot of politics involved in racing, and both
camps are trying to maneuver into position to gain the 3-year-old
championship, and, possibly, Horse of the Year. Whether they meet
again, and how often, is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet, said it was only ``50-50''
that the Preakness winner would run in the Belmont Stakes June 10.
Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi Pegasus, is pointing his charge
straight for the Belmont. However, Drysdale, who won't comment on
horses he doesn't train, refuses to even discuss the possibility of
a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back great, no nicks or anything,'' said Orseno, who
was basking in the glow of Red Bullet's victory of nearly 4 lengths
at odds of 6-1 ($14.40 to win), accomplished under Jerry Bailey.
``Right now, I'd say we're 50-50 to go in the Belmont. We'll
probably take a week to make a decision. We'll see how he comes out
of the race, weigh him to see if he lost any weight, and see how he
acts when he goes back to the track. A lot of factors will be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we make that decision, we'll take a longer look at what
races to consider as the season goes on. The Travers (at Saratoga
Aug. 26) would likely be one.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss by Fusaichi Pegasus, who was the prohibitive 3-10
favorite, cost him a chance to be the first Triple Crown winner
since Affirmed in 1978, and his connections a shot at a $5 million
bonus. The Derby winner no sooner crossed under the Pimlico finish
line when his rider and trainer blamed the wet track (officially
labeled as ``good,'' after going from ``sloppy'' to ``muddy''
earlier).
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we all had to run over it,'' said Orseno. ``The track
was similar when they ran in the Wood. I don't know if the horses
will be facing each other again this year. We'll see. Hopefully, we
can map this out, and do it the right way, so we can have a
3-year-old champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus will be shipped from Pimlico to Aqueduct
Monday. Drysdale intends to train him at the Big A for two weeks,
then van to Belmont Park for a final week of preparation for the
Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse is happy, and well,'' said Drysdale. When asked
about a rematch with Red Bullet, he said, ``I'm just looking
forward to running in the Belmont. I said prior to the Preakness
that Fusaichi Pegasus's style is very suitable to a mile and
one-half (the Belmont distance). When I said that, I didn't know
the Preakness would come up with a nasty track.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 possible starters for the Belmont. Red Bullet,
Fusaichi Pegasus, and Impeachment, who finished third in the
Preakness and Derby, may all go in the Belmont. The others are
Aptitude, second in the Derby; Wheelaway, fifth in the Derby;
Tahkodah Hills, winner of the Lone Star Derby; Unshaded, winner of
the Lexington at Keeneland; Chief Seattle, a top 2-year-old last
year who has not run officially this year and is owned by Godolphin
Stable; Curule, seventh in the Derby and also owned by Godolphin;
Globalize, second in the Lexington, and Commendable, who has won
only a maiden race but would represent trainer D. Wayne Lukas.

MARK CUBAN WANTS NO MORE OF NBA DRAFT LOTTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ There were no fireworks for Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban in his first appearance at the NBA Draft Lottery
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were slotted to pick No. 12 _ and with a
6-in-1,000 chance of winning the top pick _ they wound up with the
12th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Cuban, wearing a pullover black shirt, gray slacks,
black shoes and a silver chain, was talking about steering clear of
the lottery from now on. He views the lottery as a place where
losers converge in search of being sprinkled with some magical dust
that may or may not turn their franchise into instant winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me realize quite clearly that I don't want to be back
here ever again,'' said Cuban, the only person among the 11 men on
the dais without a suit and tie. ``It means we didn't make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to have to worry about, `Am I going to get
the No. 1, or am I getting No. 12, or am I getting No. 13?' I just
want to say, `I experienced it, I was here, and hopefully I'll
never have to see this place again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Was the lottery fun for Cuban?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``You're here because it means you \Rdidn't
play well\S last year, to a certain extent. That's never fun.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in team history that the Mavericks came
away with the 12th pick. In 1995, they used the 12th pick to draft
Duke forward Cherokee Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said since there's a dearth of talent in this year's draft
pool, he isn't against trading the pick. However, told that the Los
Angeles Lakers chose Kobe Bryant with the 13th pick of the 1996
draft, Cuban said he was well aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes to show you that you just never know,'' Cuban said.
``But the short time that I've been in this league, I've realized
very quickly that there's no one thing to commit to.''
</P>
<P>
   The home-state New Jersey Nets won the lottery, overcoming a 4.4
percent chance of obtaining the top pick. Vancouver finished second
and the Los Angeles Clippers were third.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago and Orlando were the only teams with multiple lottery
picks. The Bulls got the fourth and seventh choices, and the Magic
will select fifth, 10th and 13th.
</P>
<P>
   After the lottery, Cuban and Nets owner Lewis Katz were hugging
and laughing. Cuban told Katz beforehand that the Nets were going
to win the lottery. Cuban said Katz was one of the owners who was
supportive while he was going through the ownership process a few
months ago, and he had a feeling that Katz's generosity was going
to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was there for me every step of the way,'' Cuban said. ``So
if it wasn't going to be us \Rwinning the lottery\S, I wanted it to
be him.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz was appreciative of Cuban, whom he refers to as ``a great
owner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's doing is bringing the fans back,'' Katz said. ``And
he's not afraid to be innovative, and not afraid to speak his mind.
And he's young enough that he's going to be the future of the
NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets arena is about three miles from where the lottery was
held, and Katz was reminding everyone how the home court prevailed.
He also still has to hire a director of basketball operations and a
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the people that are going to come in and take over
this program are going to have a wonderful start and a wonderful
opportunity,'' Katz said. ``There's a lot of good stuff and a lot
of good talent out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homecourt advantage clearly helped. Here we are in New
Jersey, and it finally worked for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban flew to New York on Friday from London, where he was
vacationing for nearly two weeks. He also used part of the overseas
journey to speak at the Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday Cuban was speaking basketball, saying he was tired
of the Mavericks' 10-year absence from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm trying to absorb all of this, because it's the
last time the Mavericks are going to be here,'' Cuban said. ``So I
just wanted to experience this, and good things will happen from
here.''
Charting No. 12 The Mavericks will have the No. 12 pick in the June
28 NBA Draft. Here are the past five No. 12 picks in the NBA Draft.

COLONIAL HAS EARNED ITS SPOT AMONG THE ELITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE COCHRAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ They joke endlessly about the splendidly
garish plaid jackets, the legendary lounge lizards, the killer
margaritas and a band called the Sons of the Beaches.
</P>
<P>
   They chuckle still about a millionaire murder suspect's dirty
movie.
</P>
<P>
   They recount with gusto the erratic golf shots and mercurial
golfers, the floods and fires and the time ABC's TV cameras
captured a couple cavorting in the woods on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Just three days ago, during Friday's rain delay, a leggy blonde
and her equally tipsy boyfriend got themselves locked in a torrid,
escalating and quite public embrace outside the press room. As it
started to get really exciting, a female cop arrived and broke it
up.
</P>
<P>
   All this is to say that Colonial has earned its longstanding
reputation for erotic merriment and its distinction as the dynamite
girl-watching stop on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But there were constant reminders all week about what really
makes this such a very special golfing event. In a nutshell, I
think it's history, Hogan, hospitality and, perhaps foremost, the
course itself.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson touched on this after Sunday's dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really cool for me as a player is the feeling that I'm
now a part of the history of this tournament, part of the history
of the game and I'm now associated somewhat with these great
players from the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to have that sense of being on the Champions' Wall on the
first tee is very rewarding as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither has won here, Tom Kite calls Colonial one of
his favorite places on earth and Curtis Strange insists it is one
of the great golf courses of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great championships, the great finishes and the great
champions make the tournament,'' Tom Watson, the winner here in
1998, once said. ``And Colonial is no different from the Masters in
that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintained the late Payne Stewart: ``This is the standard by
which all golf courses should be built.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, you might reasonably wonder: Where's Tiger Woods,
Ernie Els, Hal Sutton, et al?
</P>
<P>
   But then there's Rocco Mediate, who, after firing rounds of 68
and 67, professed his longstanding affection for Colonial and its
Trinity River treachery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love this golf course,'' he gushed. ``I could be
playing lousy and find some reason to play good around here. ...
I've always loved this golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it allows you to play many, many different ways. It
doesn't say, `If you don't do this, you're (done).' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate revealed that Nos. 3, 4 and 5, the so-called ``Horrible
Horseshoe,'' are his favorite stretch of holes on the entire PGA
Tour. That would, by the way, include the famous Masters trio known
as Amen Corner.
</P>
<P>
   Olin Browne, the 1999 champion, said Colonial demonstrated a
typical touch of class with the subtle changes in the course since
his victory a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are so smooth that we would be hard pressed to find
better ones during the course of this year,'' he said. ``But
basically it's the same golf course that it was last year and the
year before and however long before that.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed a common concern that most rebuilt courses suffer
in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm very pleased to see that these guys maintained the
integrity of the course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a job on this redo that is second to none,'' he
volunteered. ``If the (PGA) Tour would send all the guys who want
to fix golf courses here, we might have a chance, because every
time they've tried to fix it, they've ruined it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they could make this better, but ... they just
did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kraft, who wound up tied for sixth at 7-under 273, was
almost as effusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like playing here and that helps me to have a good
attitude,'' he said. ``This course is not all tricked up. It is a
straightforward golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   The trees and the doglegs dictate your shots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is refreshing to come out here, to see some trees, some
doglegs, some sand,'' he added. ``That helps.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's Shootout, three or four of us sat down to chat
with Browne about his year as the defending champion. Hardly the
most illustrious name on Colonial's famous Wall of Champions, he is
in fact one of its most articulate, assertive and amiable winners.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and caddie Mike Harmon, whom everyone calls Stump,
made a memorable trip to the champion's wall on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played in the pro-am, and he asked me if my name was up on
the wall, and I said, `Yeah.' He wanted to go up and take a look,
so we went up there and there it was right next to Tom Watson,
truly one of the great players ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my name will live in infamy for however long.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne, who got hooked on golf as a student at Occidental
College in Los Angeles, has won only twice during 16 years on the
Tour. So don't blame him for being a bit gushy over Colonial and
don't harangue me for quoting him. I believe he captured the
essence of what makes Colonial so special for many of the players.
</P>
<P>
   What Browne said was not so much new as different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are spooks running around here _ Ben Hogan's ghost _ and
there are so many great players who have played here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are so many players who value this championship.
This tournament has such a rich history to it that I couldn't have
picked a better tournament I'd rather win.''
</P>
<P>
   I suspect if Browne wins a major, he might change his tune. But
it's a good point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most stylish tournaments,'' he continued.
``It's got that thread _ that connection to what really made this
game great. As time marches on, we're losing our connection to the
great history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne said his friend Gardner Dickinson, a Colonial champion in
the Sixties, talked often of his experiences here and his
relationship with Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a lot of golf around the world and around this
country and he won a bunch of times, but Colonial was the
tournament that he spent his time talking about,'' Browne said.
``There's a special feeling _ it's an invitational, there's a small
field, it's an old-style golf course, it's where Hogan used to hang
his hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Hogan's Alley. There's really nothing more to be said
about it.'' nn

RETURN TO BOXING GLORY IS GORMAN'S PLAN FOR FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ David Gorman is a nicotine addict born seemingly
with a fresh pack of smokes in his shirt pocket. He has read the
warnings, he has seen the danger. And he can barely wait to light
up.
</P>
<P>
   He has the same addiction to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say? It's just in his blood,'' said Gorman's
wife, Loretta. ``He's supposedly quit countless times, but
eventually he always finds his way back.''
</P>
<P>
   After six years of fist-free living, the patriarch of Fort Worth
boxing has climbed back into the ring. Gorman, who built countless
gyms and managed four world champions in the 1980s, is preparing to
re-establish Fort Worth as one of America's foremost Fight Towns.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to transform another wayward kid into the next Donald
Curry, Gene Hatcher, Stevie Cruz or Troy Dorsey, Gorman opened his
latest gym _ Gorman's Boxing Club _ at 3606 N. Main by Meacham
Field earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pumped to be back into it,'' Gorman said. ``I've made the
commitment to bring another world champion to Fort Worth. This time
I just can't afford to wait five or six years. I might not be
around that long to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of nurturing street-tough kids from their teens, Gorman
is now attempting to put the finishing shine on already polished
boxers. With the financial support of Dallas friends who have
helped him establish Gorman Sports Management, he has signed two
fighters (Robert Tubbs and Dan Batchelder), a female kick-boxer
from Holland, and is looking at new fighters each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tubbs has a real chance to be another Donald Curry,'' Gorman
said of the Cincinnati fighter who is 12-0 with six amateur titles.
``He's a special talent.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps, he said, will be relocating the fighters
to Fort Worth, the city he helped turn into Fight Town in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to stay as busy as a tick on a dog,'' said Gorman,
who pays his bills owning a masonry construction company. ``But I
keep getting the itch. I guess it will never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman said he turned down numerous similar offers in recent
years. But shortly before his son, Mike, passed away in November,
Gorman became convinced he needed to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike told me to stop denying myself what I love to do,''
Gorman said. ``He told me to do what I do best: get a couple of
promising fighters and mold them into champs. In doing so I could
make some money and do some traveling. It all makes sense to me. He
was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman has never been afraid to pick a fight.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he began training sons Mike and David Jr. on the
family's Joshua farm in 1970, Gorman has been seduced by the sport.
In '76, he started the Gorman Masonry Team in a gym on South
Hemphill Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with boxers the same way I lay bricks,'' the
bespectacled Gorman said in his slow, gruff voice. ``You start with
work and desire, then you learn and listen. I try to make it a
family atmosphere, something you never found anywhere else in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Loretta, ``These weren't boxers and fighters to David; they
were like his children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gormans merged with trainer Paul Reyes in the late 1970s and
began holding wildly popular club fights, where amateurs would
bludgeon each other for $50 purses. At the same time, he and Reyes
discovered local talents like Curry, Hatcher, Cruz and Vincent
Releford Jr. on the toughest streets of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have a vision, just a desire to make it all
work,'' Gorman said. ``One day we looked up and realized we had
something pretty special on our hands. These kids just needed some
direction, and boxing gave it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay was Titletown, Detroit was Hockeytown, and Fort Worth
suddenly was Fight Town.
</P>
<P>
   Often paying for fighter's meals out of his own pocket or giving
them rides to and from the gym, Gorman evolved into the Man Who
Would Never Be (Don) King. He opened a more spacious gym _ Gorman's
Super Pro's on South Main _ heavy on guts, void of glitz.
</P>
<P>
   In the gym on a given day in the early '80s were Curry, Hatcher
and Cruz, each world champions at one time under Gorman's guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the top gym in the country, even better than Kronk's in
Detroit,'' said longtime matchmaker Wayne Harrison, who set up the
bulk of Gorman's fights along with trainer ``Papa'' Joe Barrientes.
``When you saw David barking at some young fighter, you knew he was
a champion then or would be soon. It was the place to be and be
seen if you were into boxing. It put Fort Worth on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating on a shoestring budget, Gorman molded tough men first,
then tough fighters. Living on combined income of $25,000, David
and Loretta taught their fighters a bob-and-weave survival on the
streets, and then how to box in everything from worn-out gyms to
the back of abandoned trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't always pretty,'' Gorman said. ``But it's the only
way I knew how to get my message across.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world eventually heard Gorman's gospel loud and
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting with Gorman's trademark grit, Hatcher won the World
Boxing Association junior welterweight title in 1984, Cruz the WBA
featherweight belt in June 1986 and Troy Dorsey the International
Boxing Federation featherweight title in June 1991. Curry, however,
was the thoroughbred of Gorman's stable.
</P>
<P>
   After years under Gorman's wing, Curry won what once was Sugar
Ray Leonard's belt as undisputed welterweight champ in December
1985. At the time, he was considered one of the five best fighters
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But then, just as the Gormans were on the verge of multimillion
dollar paydays and Curry on the cusp of celebrity, the dynasty was
cold-cocked by a surprise upper cut.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, 1986, Curry made a shocking announcement. He was
hiring Akbar Muhammad of Top Rank as his new manager and reducing
Gorman's role to training-camp coordinator. On the surface, it
meant a slice in payday percentage from 28 percent to 6 percent.
Deep down, however, it meant a proud man who had built his
reputation on loyalty was having one of his own turn his back on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating,'' Loretta Gorman said. ``We went to
pieces. The money was bad enough, but losing Donald was like losing
one of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gorman, ``For six months I could barely function as a human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone but Curry seems to agree that the move to Muhammad was
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said Curry could have been one of the top five fighters
all-time for Top Rank had he stayed with Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He concocted these paranoid ideas that Gorman was kow-towing
to me,'' Arum said, ``that Gorman wasn't tough enough \Rin
negotiations\S. He had dreams of instant gratification and ended up
with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That decision was a terrible mistake, one that cost us and
\RCurry\S literally millions of dollars,'' Gorman said. ``I still
hate to think about \RMuhammad\S, because he had Donald in all
these bad investments. Donald asked my advice, and I told him he
should keep the money he's making for the rest of his life. I got
outvoted, Donald wound up broke, and we ended up closing the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry still defends Muhammad. ``I learned so much from him, I
really did,'' Curry said recently. ``Akbar was good for me, he
really was.''
</P>
<P>
   Living on a combined salary of $250,000 and salivating over
million-dollar paydays to come, the Gormans were suddenly knocked
to the canvas and forced to live on 1/10th as much. The South Main
Gym, the one with the ``Home of Donald Curry'' sign over the door,
closed under mounting debt a year after Curry's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning of the end of the Fort Worth dynasty,''
Harrison said. ``You could feel the wind go out of the sails of the
boxing community.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman has kicked the boxing habit numerous times, but it has
always rope-a-doped him back in. He is genuinely excited about his
next round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a dreamer. I'm not really a dreamer any more,'' Gorman
said. ``But I do know full well that I'm capable of doing as much
for a fighter as anyone in this area. And I know I'll be doing what
I love again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ring the bell, David Gorman has survived another eight-count.

said. ``It was the perfect place to grow ornery.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp was the brainchild of manager David Gorman, who sought
a secluded, spartan refuge to train his world-class fighters in
1985. He borrowed the house from his daughter, Cindy, took eight
would-be boxers there, and returned with eight men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the best memories I have,'' Gorman said. ``I guess you
could say it was out of tough love. But I still believe in it as a
way to train and focus. Nowadays you have guys working out in
glitzy hotels with photographers all around. We had none of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gorman provided his fighters with few options but to
hone their considerable skills. Up at 5:30 a.m. for breakfast, a
seven-mile jog on Tolar's dirt roads, followed by five hours of
training under 100-degree temperatures, under Gorman's watchful eye
and menacing bark. A similar routine followed in the afternoon, a
process Gorman was convinced would give his fighters a
``street-tough, survivalist mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   If the boxers weren't exhausted by sundown, they could play
cards, watch a 37-inch TV or dare to indulge some of Paul Reyes'
homemade hot sauce on paper plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a maid,'' chuckled Donald Curry. ``But if we
would've, she'd a been big and fat with no teeth. That was no place
for the beautiful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some boxers slept outside at night, one even sun-bathed in the
nude, and none say they've ever experienced such intense male
bonding since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it wasn't that bad,'' Gorman joked. ``One time I cooked
them barbecue just to convince them it wasn't prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman, now back in the boxing business, revealed he might even
reopen Champ Camp once he builds his next stable of fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the key,'' he said. ``And a fighter can never be
too tough.''

SECOND-PLACE FINISHES CAUSE LOVE FRUSTRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For the second consecutive week, Davis Love
III played just good enough not to win. For someone who has said he
is ``obsessed'' with breaking a victory drought, Sunday's runner-up
finish at the MasterCard Colonial was another stab to the ego.
</P>
<P>
   Although not as gut-wrenching as last week's GTE Byron Nelson
Classic when he lost in a playoff to Jesper Parnevik after leading
each round, Love conceded his tie with Stewart Cink for second at
Colonial adds to his mounting frustration of not winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting tired of playing good golf, but not playing great
for four days. It's frustrating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``I played better this week (than last), but I
didn't get the ball in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Love is trying to end a victory drought that has stretched back
to the MCI Classic in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another frustration, but I did a better job the past two
weeks'' of being in contention, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said key putts again didn't fall, key iron shots didn't
get close to the pins and too many drives strayed off line. Yet, he
has hopes that everything can straighten out by the time the U.S.
Open rolls around in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, it's consistency,'' he said. ``I just need to play
consistent for four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, when he began the day in second place, three shots
behind leader Stewart Cink, Love said, ``I let it get away from me
in the middle of the round,'' and finished with a 2-under 68 and
270 total, two behind winner Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed a little (birdie) putt on No. 6, then I bogeyed No. 9
and didn't birdie (the par-5) 11th,'' he said of his squandered
chances. Then, on No. 10, Love couldn't match Cink's birdie and
fell four shots off Cink's pace while Mickelson was charging to a
closing 63.
</P>
<P>
   Love birdied the 14th, but couldn't get the ball close enough
the rest of the way to take advantage of Cink's collapse down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, Love tried to make a move with birdies on the
second and fourth holes. But Cink, his playing partner, birdied the
first, third and fourth and seemed to have an answer for anything
Love could throw at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would have to play great and shoot a good score just
like Phil did'' Love said. Love expected someone to take advantage
of the sunny day that had little wind.
</P>
<P>
   He was close. But close isn't good enough for him. With 18
runner-up finishes, he been there too many times before.

GOLFERS AT ODDS OVER MASTERS REQUIREMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The PGA Tour Policy Board is scheduled to
meet Monday and Tuesday in Jacksonville, Fla., and the
controversial new rules the Masters implemented this year might get
some air time, board member John Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Masters will be an issue, I'm sure,'' Cook said of the
Masters' decision to not grant automatic berths into the tournament
for winners of PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   If the issue is broached at the meetings, not everyone will be
in harmony with Cook, who wants the Masters to reconsider its new
rule. Davis Love III, Sunday's runner-up at the MasterCard Colonial
and also a board member, believes the issue shouldn't be on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point,'' he said Sunday. ``We have no control of
the Masters. It's their tournament. It's not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when Masters Tournament officials changed
their qualifications and took away the automatic exemption for tour
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, part of the new qualifications include being in the top 50
of the World Rankings. Olin Browne, last year's MasterCard
Colonial's champ, was one of seven winners who didn't make it to
Augusta because he wasn't ranked high enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some players, including Cook, said Masters officials made a bad
decision and expects the policy to be discussed at the board
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the rule change) is a tragedy,'' he said Sunday after
his round at Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   But Love isn't supporting Cook's side, and calls the critics of
the new rule ``malcontents.''
</P>
<P>
   Love said the PGA Tour has no business trying to change rules at
the Masters, the U.S. Open or the British Open, which aren't under
the wing of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't our tournaments. We don't make the rules there,''
Love said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be wrong for the PGA Tour to try to threaten or
cajole the Masters into submitting to its desires _ whatever they
might be.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, however, said, ``It's all about winning out here. Always
has been. And it doesn't matter what tournament or where; it's a
big deal to win out here. I certainly think a PGA Tour winner
deserves to be in the Masters more than the semifinalist of the
U.S. Amateur, and I'm not trying to do a disservice to the Amateur
semifinalist. But they (Masters officials) need to realize it's not
going to diminish their fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big deals about winning out here was ``I can't wait
to get to Augusta,''' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cook said hinging qualifications on the World Rankings is
not a good system, ``because the World Rankings are screwy. You can
actually choose not to play in a tournament so that you can hold
your position (in the rankings).''
</P>
<P>
   Love defended the system, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it's easier now to get in the Masters than
it has ever been,'' he said. ``I'm fourth in the World Rankings,
but I haven't won a tournament in two years. So, obviously it's not
that hard to get in the Masters.'' nn

BELFOUR, HULL SAVE DAY AS STARS EVEN SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Don't ask the Stars to explain why they need to dig
themselves into a hole as inspiration to play well. They can't.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know,'' Stars winger Brett Hull said. ``I think
that's just human nature, knowing your backs are against the wall,
you are in a must-win situation and it's almost like you have
nothing to lose. You are either going to be down 3-1 or you are
back in it at 2-2.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were faced with exactly that situation in Game 4 after
digging themselves a pretty-massive hole in Game 3. They responded
with a 4-1 victory against the Colorado Avalanche at the Pepsi
Center on Sunday to knot the Western Conference Finals at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but the series just became a
best-two-out-of-three, and the Stars have home ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hats off to Belfour,'' Avs defenseman Aaron Miller said. ``He
played a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame the Avs for fingering Stars goalie Ed Belfour as
the sole reason they lost. Of course, there were others. They
wasted 64 seconds of a five-on-three power play, getting only a
single shot. They allowed the Stars to score four goals on 15
shots, including two goals by Hull. The Avs were neither aggressive
nor physical enough.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they had 39 shots, including a 21-4 advantage in the
second period. They should've won right? Belfour wouldn't let them,
stopping all but one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing with a lot of confidence and gets stronger every
game,'' Stars backup goalie Manny Fernandez said. ``If a team is
going to beat him, they're going to have to hurry up and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of play was given to Belfour's assertion that he felt
himself to be as good, if not better than Avalanche goalie Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   As good? Try better. At least in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Avs forward Peter Forsberg, who had six shots,
including a couple of no-brainers, only to watch Belfour deny them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is anything different for Eddie Belfour. He
has a huge bite in the series,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``We got the win in this building that we badly needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had been fuming after Game 3, annoyed that his team
had ``wasted'' an unbelievable performance by Belfour by playing
stupid, penalty-filled hockey.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't waste it Sunday. They knew they couldn't afford to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we got down 3-1 to this team, it would be very difficult to
come back,'' Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Stars winger Mike Keane so aptly said: ``It's just not
wise to put yourself in a situation where you have to win three in
a row against these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Stars did anything and everything Sunday to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock changed up their lines. All of them, including taking
Brenden Morrow right from the training room with what everybody
thought was a season-ending fractured right ankle in Game 1 to the
first line with Hull and Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big surprise,'' Hull said of Morrow's return, ``but as
long as Big 9 is there, I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The line was on the ice for the Stars' final three goals,
including what turned out to be the game-winner by Hull at 17:30 of
the first period for a 2-0 Stars lead.
</P>
<P>
   He added another goal at 7:52 of the second period to give the
Stars breathing room after Avs forward Dave Reid's goal had sliced
Dallas' lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and Modano then assisted on defenseman Richard Matvichuk's
game-sealing goal at 4:39 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   And, just like that, Game 3 became a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very consistent in the past at answering back,''
Modano said. ``We rally around it and learn from it, but don't
dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars certainly learned from the first three games of the
series. They finally scored first.
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk scored a power-play goal at 7:12 of
the first period, finishing a beautiful feed from Jamie
Langenbrunner and Scott Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough sledding,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``Goals haven't
been easy. You have to scratch and claw for everything you have.
When you get shut out twice in a series, you just try to get shots
to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the Stars didn't do everything right.
</P>
<P>
   But they scored on their chances, which wasn't the case in Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it goes,'' Reid said. ``They scored on their
opportunities, and, if we scored on our opportunities, we could
have had four goals easily. I don't think we let them off the hook.
That's not the case at all.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, if they say so.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs lost for the first time at the Pepsi Center in the
playoffs. The series now returns to Reunion Arena for Game 5 and
again for Game 7 if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position was to get one of these two and have two of the
remaining three games,'' Modano said. ``It would be a shame to let
this pass by and let it slip out of our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But history would suggest the Stars need a poor performance in
Game 5 to provide the necessary adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Guy Carbonneau thinks he has a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should practice (Monday) and have a bad practice,''
Carbonneau said. ``Maybe that will work.''

HULL LOVES TO DO WHAT HE DOES BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The grin crept over Brett Hull's face as soon as the
question was asked. He couldn't help it. His favorite subject in
all the world had just been broached in the aftermath of the Stars'
had-to-have-it 4-1 victory against the Avalanche to even the
conference finals series at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who had just become the sixth-best playoff sniper in NHL
history with two goals to pass the great Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard
on the all-time list, was asked to explain how he does it.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that he loves this question?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said before, I'm scared to death I'm going to wake up one
day and never be able to score another goal,'' Hull admitted, his
eyes growing wide with amazement and that little-boy grin stealing
across his face as he considered this innate ability with which
he's been blessed. ``I don't know if it's that inner drive that
makes me continue to do it or what, but it's really the only thing
I enjoy out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I truly, heartfelt, love to do. Thankfully I have a
knack for getting goals and hopefully that'll continue. But I have
no idea why I'm able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, of course, doesn't really matter. You won't hear Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock or Hull's teammates ask that question. They're
only happy that, on days like this, with their playoff fate hanging
in the balance, the guy with the biggest shot in hockey is on their
side.
</P>
<P>
   The schizophrenic Stars, who whimpered like Sybil in a 2-0 loss
in Game 3 and roared like Simba on Sunday, return to Dallas with
the split they came here for and the home-ice advantage once again
in their pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really dwell on our poor performances,'' said Mike
Modano, who drew so much attention from the Avs that he was able to
pick up three assists dishing the puck out to Hull and others.
``Especially in the playoffs, you don't really have time to figure
out what went wrong or point fingers or talk about the shoulda,
coulda, woulda things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the type of game we had to play today to win and we
all came and put in a great effort. Our position was to get one of
these two and have two of the remaining three games in Dallas. It
would be a shame to let this pass by and let it slip out of our
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys who needed to step up for the Stars _ Joe Nieuwendyk,
Modano and Hull _ did exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our star players played very well,'' Mike Keane pointed out.
``Joe played great. Mo played great and Hull scored big goals for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Big isn't the word for Hull's performance, but then, as the
Stars saw in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals against Buffalo last
June, he's never been averse to scoring big-time goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big game for us,'' Hull said. ``The quality of team
they have, you don't want to go home down 3-1. We knew we had to
have this game, especially after kind of a lackluster effort in
Game 3. We came out and played more of our style and capitalized on
the chances we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk took a beautiful, soft feed from Jamie Langenbrunner
from behind the Avs' net just over seven minutes into the game and
flipped it over Patrick Roy's right shoulder to put the Stars in
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that first goal on the road, it settles everybody in
and lets everybody take a deep breath,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal galvanized the Stars and when Modano fed Hull in the
slot after intercepting a Dave Andreychuk pass 10 minutes later,
Hull sizzled it over Roy's right shoulder and into the net,
breaking a tie with Richard for sixth all-time in postseason goals
(he now has 84).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike made a great pass,'' Hull said. ``I was going across the
grain and I just tried to hit the far side and got some good wood
on it and it found an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the mantras of the Denver press has been that if the Avs
get a 2-0 lead, the Stars don't have the firepower to come back.
Let it be known that the flip side is also true. Give the Stars a
2-0 lead and they clamp down like a vise defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe vise is a bit strong. The Avs would finish with 39
shots to the Stars' 15, but it was the Stars who made their
opportunities count.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a big shot-total team,'' Hull said, ``but I looked
up late in the second period and then asked Joe, `Are they
(shorting) us on the clock or do we really only have seven shots?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no grasp either way. It was one of those weird games.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest goal of the game was Hull's second midway in the
second period, giving the Stars some breathing room after a
turnover had allowed former teammate Dave Reid to wrist home an
unlikely 30-footer from the left circle and cut Dallas' lead to
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and Brenden Morrow, the rookie forward who wasn't supposed
to be able to skate because of what was thought to be a fractured
ankle, broke loose on a 2-on-1 rush, Hull speeding down the right
side with the puck. Hull wound up, cut loose and spanked it between
Roy's legs. The Avs goalie got a piece of the puck, but not enough
to keep it from squirting into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on our heels a little bit and Hully scoring that goal,
that was huge,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   He has made a career out of scoring goals like that. Go ahead,
ask him why. He loves it. nn

   BALTIMORE _ No regrets. No looking back.
</P>
<P>
   The handlers of Red Bullet have no regrets about skipping the
Kentucky Derby, even though it means they never had a chance to win
the Triple Crown. But they're not asking what could have been after
Red Bullet won the Preakness Stakes on Saturday by almost four
lengths over Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have run great in the Derby,'' Red Bullet trainer Joe
Orseno said. ``But he wouldn't have been doing as good as he is
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the horse is fine. He looks good. I don't see any
reason not to \Rgo to the Belmont Stakes\S. It should be quite a
showdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown is between Red Bullet and Fusaichi Pegasus, with a
few familiar faces thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude, who finished third in the Wood Memorial Stakes behind
Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet and second in the Derby, skipped
the Preakness in favor of the Belmont. Unshaded, an impressive
winner of the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland, may finally get into a
Triple Crown race after his owner passed on the late entry fee of
$100,000-plus for the first two legs. And Tahkodha Hills has a shot
at a $1 million bonus for winning a Triple Crown event along with
his Lone Star Derby victory last month.
</P>
<P>
   The field could exceed 10, two more than the Preakness when many
horse owners decided to dodge Fusaichi Pegasus after he beat 18
with ease in the Derby. So it looks though the bloom has fallen off
the Kentucky Derby roses. At odds of 3 to 10, Fusaichi Pegasus was
the biggest favorite to lose the Preakness since Riva Ridge in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys don't lack for imagination,'' said trainer D. Wayne
Lukas, who often accuses the media of hyping ``super horses'' to
ridiculously low odds. ``I never could anoint this horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Orseno loaded Red Bullet on a van for the trip to Belmont
yesterday and said the colt is 50-50 for the race. But Neil
Drysdale, trainer of Fusaichi Pegasus, appears unusually eager for
a rematch. Slow to commit to the Preakness after the Derby, this
time he has scheduled to ship Fusaichi Pegasus from Pimlico to New
York today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That race \Rthe Preakness\S, he didn't extend himself,''
Drysdale said by telephone from his barn at Hollywood Park.
``That's good and bad. Good that he didn't extend himself coming
into this next race, but bad because he didn't handle the track and
didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse pulled up well. He was quite bright and alert after
the race. In fact, he was playing when he got to the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale continues to claim that Fusaichi Pegasus couldn't
handle the wet surface at Pimlico Race Course. But the wet surface
at Aqueduct didn't hinder Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood, where he
beat Red Bullet by four lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Here's their theory on the turnaround: Kent Desormeaux, the
jockey on Fusaichi Pegasus, rode at Pimlico for several years
before moving to Southern California. He said Pimlico has a
limestone base that is covered by dirt and other materials. When it
gets wet, he said, it becomes more slippery or ``greasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said the surfaces at New York tracks have a clay base
covered by a sandier surface that provide for better traction. Even
Lukas said the surface Saturday at Pimlico had a ``peanut butter''
feel too it that tired some of the horses.
</P>
<P>
   And Jerry Bailey, who rode Red Bullet, said his colt was fit for
the off going. He said a friend of his from California called him
before the race and told him he remembered that Red Bullet's dam (a
Caro mare named Cargo) was a ``freak'' on a wet track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wet fast track in New York,'' Drysdale said. ``It's
completely different. \RPimlico\S was far from being wet fast. It
was heavier, and \RFusaichi Pegasus\S is a long-striding colt who
didn't handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I thought he did good to even keep going. He
continued on very courageously to get second. A lot of times when a
horse can't handle the track they finish in the back. They ease
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said he thought about equipping Fusaichi Pegasus with
``stickers,'' horseshoes with small protrusions that help a horse
grab into the mud. But he decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Eastern tracks, they either handle \Rwet tracks\S or they
don't,'' Drysdale said. ``Putting hardware on the bottom of the
foot can injure horses.''
</P>
<P>
   But the only thing injured after the Preakness appears to be
Drysdale's pride in his colt. It looks as though he's going for the
cure in the Belmont.

STARS MAKE FOOTE, AVS PAY ON SEVERAL DEFENSIVE LAPSES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ Defenseman Adam Foote's return from an eye injury
hardly went as planned. He took the ice with Ray Bourque on the
third shift of the game to a rousing ovation from the capacity
crowd at the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   Foote, who said his eye gave him no problems, finished a minus-2
and was on the ice for three of the Stars' four goals. Foote and
the Avs' defense limited the Stars to 15 shots, but mistakes were
costly.
</P>
<P>
   The killer was a Stars two-on-one breakaway led by Brett Hull.
Adam Deadmarsh and Foote retreated but were too late. Hull put a
shot between Patrick Roy's legs for a 3-1 lead 7 minutes, 32
seconds into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Deady got back, I started to move over, and \RHull\S
slipped it through Patty, and it was one of those things,'' Foote
said. ``We played it how we always play a two-on-one. \RHull\S
doesn't need much room.''
</P>
<P>
   When Foote, who plans to finish the playoffs wearing a visor,
was out of action, the big question circulating was, `Can the Avs
win without him?' A dominating performance in Game 3 positively
answered those doubts. His return was supposed to bring an even
grittier, hard-hitting edge to the Avs.
</P>
<P>
   Foote's only hit of the game was a heavy one on Hull in the
first period, but Hull had the last laugh. POWERLESS The Stars
short-circuited the Avalanche power play, and a blown five-on-three
opportunity in the second period was a back-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche scored a power-play goal in each of the first
three games but squandered three chances through the first two
periods yesterday, including a two-man advantage for one minute,
four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs rolled out four forwards _ Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg,
Milan Hejduk and Dave Andreychuk _ along with Ray Bourque on the
two-man advantage, but got off only one shot and only two for the
entire power play.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, the Avs had a 20 percent success rate on
power plays goals at a 20-percent rate. However, they are 1-for-14
in the past two games. A SAVE TO REMEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Avs forward Peter Forsberg will have a hard time forgetting the
save Stars goalie Ed Belfour made on him during Colorado's first
power play of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Sandis Ozolinsh launched a shot from the point. The rebound came
to Forsberg at the right crease, but Belfour made an outstretched
save with his blocker to prevent a goal and a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, Hull beat Roy for a 3-1 lead.
Forsberg had several good scoring chances, including three shots on
goal in the first period and six overall.
</P>
<P>
   His third shot of the first period also came off a Belfour
rebound. Belfour stopped Forsberg, then left another rebound for
Joe Sakic, who had the left side of the net wide open. Sakic pushed
the puck into the post and was denied. Sakic has not scored a goal
in this series and has only two in the playoffs. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   -- Ray Bourque inadvertently delayed the game eight minutes 3:30
into the third period when his dump-in shattered a panel of glass
near the right circle. Pieces of glass sprayed into the first two
rows. One woman needed assistance picking glass out of her hair.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Stars' first-period power-play goal was the second the
Avs have allowed on 30 chances at the Pepsi Center during the
playoffs.

STARS' BRENDEN MORROW MAKES MOST OF SURPRISE RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sometime Saturday, Stars rookie winger Brenden Morrow
determined he might be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem. And, no, it wasn't his fractured right
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   His equipment wasn't in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected me to play so it was back in Dallas,'' said
Morrow, who had to borrow Mike Modano's skates on Saturday. ``After
morning skate yesterday I knew I would be in warmup at least, so
they flew the equipment in.''
</P>
<P>
   It arrived in plenty of time for Morrow to be a vital player in
the Stars' 4-1 Game 4 victory yesterday at the Pepsi Center in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He played 13 minutes and 26 seconds with four hits and one
penalty to finish a plus-2 and was on the ice for three of the
Stars' goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea he was ready to play,'' Stars winger Brett Hull
said. ``I thought he was out for this series and might be back for
the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Morrow was back for this one and just in time. The fact that
he was playing, never mind contributing, is a surprise. Remember,
after fracturing his right ankle late in Game 1, he wasn't supposed
to play the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had me in the funny boot and I was sort of cheating a
little bit and I would take it off and it felt pretty good to me,''
Morrow said. ``There wasn't much pain. I'm not really surprised as
some others.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, it's a bone chip, Stars team trainer J.J.
McQueen said, who also said the injury can't get any worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the whole regular season and got to the fun part and
I thought it was all over,'' Morrow said. ``I was really
disappointed after my first game; I thought it was one of my worst
games. ... It was a big relief when the doctor said I had at least
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It took no time for Morrow to be thrown back on his normal spot
on the top line with Mike Modano and Brett Hull. Not that his name
appears on the scorers sheet, but he did have impacts on both of
Hull's goals.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first period, Morrow had circled around the net to
the low-right circle where Colorado defenseman Ray Borque had no
choice but to cover Morrow. That left Hull open for his wrister and
a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the Stars' third goal, Hull had an open two-on-one when Avs
forward Adam Deadmarsh cheated toward Morrow, preventing the pass.
Hull took the shot and scored for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   If Morrow's ankle was hurting, he wasn't showing it. Not when
Colorado defenseman Adam Foote drove him into the boards midway
through the third period and the two got into a scuffle drawing
penalties. Nor was he showing it when he came out of the penalty
box and Colorado forward Peter Forsberg gave him a shove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was nervous and a little bit uptight on how things
would turn out,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``As he got
going, he got better and better and better as the game went on. So
he should be hopefully a significant player as we move along.''
</P>
<P>
   With Morrow back, it gives the Stars something they have only
flirted with all season: A healthy lineup. It gives Hitchcock room
to maneuver his second line with either Scott Thornton or Jere
Lehtinen. And it gives the Stars another banger in a series that is
growing reminiscent of ``Fight Club./
</P>
<P>
   ``You need those types of players against \RAdam\S Foote,
\RJon\S Klemm, \RAaron\S Miller and \RRay\S Borque to take the
body,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``The more players we have
like that the more we can wear them down and find some cracks and
seams and some create some chances.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for Morrow, this creates the chance to finish
the season on the ice. With his equiptment.

NUMBERS ARE MIND-NUMBING IN GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 GOALIES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy and Stars goalie Ed
Belfour head to Dallas all even after four games. The shots they've
faced after two meetings in Colorado have been anything but even.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly by the numbers, it's mindboggling that Game 5 at
Reunion Arena tomorrow won't be the Avs' first of three chances to
close out the defending champion Stars:
</P>
<P>
   In Games 3 and 4, Belfour stopped 76 of 79 shots. Roy stopped 32
of 36, a mammoth 43 fewer shots.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period of Game 4, the Avs pelted Belfour with 21
shots, while the Stars, for the second consecutive period, managed
four shots on Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Shots on goal after the second period: Avalanche 31, Stars 8.
Score after the second period: Stars 3, Avalanche 1. The Avs
finished with 39 shots compared with the Stars' 15. The Stars won,
4-1, to tie the series at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie stoned us. You have to give him credit,'' said Avs
winger Dave Reid, who scored their lone goal 1 minute, 43 seconds
into the second period to cut the Stars' lead to 2-1. ``I don't
think the Stars would be where they are without him. I think he's
played great all series. I don't think he did anything different
tonight than he did all series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs played in the Stars' zone for nearly half of the second
period. Once Reid got them on the scoreboard, their forwards
started to fly and Belfour was forced to save this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to get one win, and we did that,'' Belfour said.
``If we go down 3-1 to this team, it would be very difficult to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first seven minutes of the second period, he stopped a
chance from Milan Hejduk, made a sliding save on Chris Drury and
then made a remarkable pad save on Peter Forsberg right on the
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Avs' ammunition, it took one two-on-one breakaway
led by Brett Hull to nullify it. Hull beat everyone into the Avs'
zone, and one future Hall of Famer beat another, as Hull went
five-hole off the inside Roy's blocker to give the Stars a 3-1 lead
that robbed a rocking crowd of its exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hull scored on the two-on-one. That should have been a save by
me,'' Roy said. ``It would have been a key save. I was a little mad
at myself on that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy received little help defending the chances the Stars had.
Sloppy play and defensive mistakes led to the Stars' best chances,
and the Stars capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 15 shots \Rthe Stars had\S were great opportunities. It
wasn't like it was a shot from the point that he \RRoy\S saw and
just missed,'' Reid said. ``Don't worry about Patrick. Patrick is
going to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Belfour and Roy have been around the block too many times
to worry. They have four Stanley Cups between them. Roy has two
shutouts in the series. Belfour hasn't allowed more than two goals
in all four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have felt better and better every day,'' Belfour said. ``I
am looking forward to getting back in front of our home fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bet that Roy is eager, too. nn

STARS' LINE CHANGES OPEN UP NIEUWENDYK, OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ After seeing his team come up empty in two of the first
three games of the Western Conference Finals, Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock made something happen in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   It was a change for the better for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's line changes put the goal _ and the Joe _ back in
the Stars' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Center Joe Nieuwendyk, who had no goals, no assists, three
shots, a minus-1 rating and four penalties in the first three games
of the series, scored the first goal in the Stars' 4-1 victory
against the Colorado Avalanche yesterday. The Stars' four goals,
which was one more than they had scored in the first three games of
the series, came on only 15 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach hasn't changed at all,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``You
just try and keep working and fighting for your opportunities,
because they don't come easy in this series. I just felt I had a
few good looks at the net, which hasn't been there in the last few
games, and I was able to bury one.''
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is Nieuwendyk's second line.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' shots were hitting nothing but Roy in the first three
games of the series. Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, who had shutouts
in Games 1 and 3, had allowed only three goals on 79 Stars' shots
before yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   That, and the unexpected return of Stars winger Brenden Morrow,
prompted Hitchcock to shake up his lines.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, who injured his right ankle in Game 1, joined Mike
Modano and Brett Hull on the Stars' top line. Nieuwendyk played
with Jere Lehtinen and Jamie Langenbrunner on the second line. On
the bottom two lines, Guy Carbonneau had Grant Marshall and Scott
Thornton as his linemates, and Roman Lyashenko, Kirk Muller and
Mike Keane played together.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Hitch looking like a genius again,'' Keane said. ``Once
in a while, you need a change. I don't think it's that much of a
change, but we got output. We got chances from everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars found that four was better than one.
</P>
<P>
   Before yesterday, the first line had carried the scoring load
with all three of the team's goals. While Hull got two of the
team's four goals yesterday, he and Modano finally got a little
help from their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I think that our strength is our depth,''
Carbonneau said. ``Look at our team the last two or three years. We
seem to tire teams out. I think \Ryesterday\S was a little bit of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's goal, which came at 7:12 of the first period, might
have been the biggest of the series. It gave the Stars a 1-0 lead
for the first time in the series, and it gave Nieuwendyk his first
goal of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nieuwendyk had the game-winning goals in Games 2 and
3 of the Western Conference Finals against Colorado, and he went on
to earn the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the
playoffs, with 11 postseason goals, including six game-winners, and
21 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, this is about the time Joe comes into the
series,'' Hitchcock said. ``... He did it again \Ryesterday\S.''

CUBAN, NELSON SET FOR CONTRACT TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ Mavericks owner Mark Cubanrepeated yesterday
that Don Nelson will coach the Mavericks next season.
</P>
<P>
   He just doesn't know if Nelson will also coach the Mavericks
when the team moves into the American Airlines Center for the
2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's one year or 20 years, I wanted Nellie to be part
of the organization one way or another for a long, long time,''
Cuban said. ``Even if it's 30 years from now and I'm calling him up
in his rocking chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how much respect I have for Don Nelson.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he plans to remain in New York this week to work with
the NBA on some Internet issues. He said he'll meet with Nelson and
work on a new contract for his coach when he returns to Dallas
possibly at the end of this week, or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already talked on the phone and I don't anticipate any
problems,'' Cuban said. ``Nellie and I get along great.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson supposedly had retired after this past season, but then
had a change of heart before any of his possible successors could
be interviewed. Asked if he plans to interview anyone other than
Nelson, Cuban said: ``I don't think so at this point. At this
point, I don't see any reason to.'' WIZARDS LOSE PICK
</P>
<P>
   The big loser at the lottery was the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards had a 64-in-1,000 chance of receiving the top pick
in the draft, but wound up without a first-round pick. Since the
Wizards did not finish among the top three lottery picks _ they
finished seventh _ the pick automatically went to the Chicago Bulls
via a previous three-team trade involving Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're realistic,'' said Darrell Walker, the Wizards' director
of player personnel. ``We're prepared to move on without having a
first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just concentrate on the second round and see if we can
get a nice player in the second round.'' IRONY FOR ROCKETS
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the lottery was not lost on Carroll Dawson, the
vice president of basketball operations for the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were in the lottery this year for the first time in
the lottery's 16-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The worst team in the Eastern Conference and the worst team in
the Western Conference used to flip a coin to determine which one
would receive the top pick. But former Mavericks coach Dick Motta
complained to the league that the Rockets intentionally lost games
in order to enhance their draft position.
</P>
<P>
   That effort, Motta said, netted the Rockets top picks Ralph
Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon in 1983 and '84.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that,'' Dawson said of Motta's assertion. ``That
was a long time ago.''

<P>
   Dawson admitted he was nervous before the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was kind of like the seventh game of the NBA championship
for me,'' he said. ``I didn't sleep \RSaturday\S night.''

   Utah and Portland are the only teams that haven't been in the

BOGEYS ON FINAL TWO HOLES DOOM CINK'S COLONIAL CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Stewart Cink armed himself with an 8-iron in
what would be his last line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `We're starting from scratch here, and I'm tied. I
need to make a birdie on one of the last three holes, and I win the
tournament,' '' he recalled late yesterday afternoon. ``I hit one
of the best iron shots of my life right there on No. 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink's high, arching shot stopped within eight feet of the cup
on the 188-yard hole and rewarded him with an uphill putt with no
break.
</P>
<P>
   The missed putt would be his breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Cink closed with bogeys at No. 17 and 18 and finished two
strokes behind Phil Mickelson, the eventual 2000 MasterCard
Colonial champion.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone think of a better way to celebrate a 27th birthday
with mom, dad and wife in attendance?
</P>
<P>
   ``My putts were all missing, and I didn't have any confidence on
the greens,'' said Cink, who required 33 putts during his final
round after averaging 27 the previous three days. ``That's really
strange because I had just enormous confidence the second and third
rounds. I just didn't have it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink's game deserted him after draining a 15-foot putt for
birdie at No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Misfiring from 21/2 feet for par at No. 5 will do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going along pretty good until then,'' Cink said.
</P>
<P>
   Cink, the only person to post birdies this week at Nos. 3, 4 and
5 _ known as ``The Horrible Horseshoe'' _ appeared destined to be
fitted for his first royal tartan sports coat after his move to
14-under par through 58 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking, `You've been in this situation before,
and you've been way ahead in tournaments. The one thing you can't
do is start playing against the field because that's a sure way to
start backing up,' '' Cink recalled. ``I've trained myself to keep
focusing on each shot at hand and try to make birdies. I had a
little hiccup on No 5. I missed a short putt about two-feet long,
and that kind of threw me off a little bit. I felt a little shaky
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, not nervous, Cink said, but he was shaking, literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that somebody was going to come out and tear it up,''
he said. ``I knew that I had to keep on going. The deeper into the
round we got _ I don't know if it was the heat or that I was
sweating a lot, which I always do _ I felt a little bit shaky on
everything, and I mean shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to play against these guys out here when you
feel good, and I just didn't feel very good. It showed. I don't
think it was the heat. I've played enough in the heat. It was just
... I don't know. I just didn't feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson drained a 35-foot putt for birdie at No. 18 moved the
left-hander within a stroke of Cink, whose wheels soon fell off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was right in the middle of the fairway with a wedge to the
green, and I didn't hit a very good second shot,'' Cink said of his
approach at No. 17. ``It was in between \Rclubs\S, so it was a
really small wedge. I caught it a little chunky and left it about
30 or 40 feet from the hole. I made a good run at my first putt,
but it went about five feet past and missed it coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink needed a birdie on No. 18 to force a playoff, but his shot
from the tee caught the rough and left him a 158-yard, downwind
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit what I thought was a really good shot _ right on my
target and drawing in there toward the flag a little bit,'' he
said. ``I thought it was going to land just on the front edge and
just release right up there. It hit short of the green, where it
was kind of soft, and just stuck there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink's three-putt from the fringe cost him second place alone
and $66,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one player in the field was able to beat me,'' Cink said,
``two if you count myself.''' nn

BILLY BOAT EKES INTO INDY FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ His was the first car out on the track for
practice yesterday morning, and the last to make a qualifying
attempt at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In between, Billy Boat endured a madcap day en route to a
starting position for the 84th Indianapolis 500. Hot-lapping in a
second backup car provided by former boss A.J. Foyt, the legendary
Texan who had fired him at the end of last season, Boat barely beat
the 6 p.m. deadline and barged into the field on the final
qualifying attempt of Bump Day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boat's four-lap//10-mile average of 218.877 mph around the
2.5-mile Speedway bumped Jack Miller from a field that for the
first time in race history includes two women drivers. Lyn St.
James, whose car momentarily got airborne after crashing in Turn 2
on Saturday, scrambled into the field at 218.826 mph in a backup
yesterday. St. James, who qualified 32nd for her seventh Indy 500,
will join 19-year-old rookie Sarah Fisher on the grid for the
traditional flying start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Boat, who began the day crashing the car owned by
Team Pelfrey and ended it in an exchange of bear hugs with Foyt,
who provided the day's drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the world like trying to qualify for the
Indy 500 between 5 and 6 o'clock on Bubble Day,'' said Boat, a
34-year-old resident of Phoenix. ``I know the emotion of this
place, because I've been bumped between 5 and 6 o'clock. I know
what that feels like. And I feel very fortunate that I was with a
team that was able to get the job done under those circumstances. I
mean, I was in two \RFoyt\S race cars within an hour. It was enough
to get qualified for the Indy 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six seconds remained in yesterday's six-hour qualifying
session when Boat rolled out Foyt's No. 11 Rio G Force/Aurora. The
car is the backup for Eliseo Salazar, the Chilean who comfortably
qualified on the outside of the three-car front row Saturday at
223.231 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``That car had never turned a wheel, had never seen the
racetrack,'' Boat said. ``But A.J. said it was set up just like the
other one.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I could see the urgency in everybody's faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who won the pole for the 1998 Indy 500 with a four-lap
average of 223.503 mph while driving for Foyt, started his run at
219.947 mph and got progressively slower on each lap yesterday. But
his 218-plus average easily eclipsed Miller's 216.154 mph effort,
securing the 31st position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of Billy,'' said Foyt, who shared in the Victory
Lane celebration with Boat when he scored his first Indy Racing
League victory at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth in June 1998.
``Billy and I go way back. I see a good friend struggling, so I
have to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat was one lap into his second qualifying attempt in Dale
Pelfrey's No. 81 Dallara/Aurora when he spun in Turn 1 and hit the
wall shortly after noon. The unsponsored car sustained heavy damage
to the left side and rear. Boat was checked at the track's medical
center and cleared to drive.
</P>
<P>
   But drive what? The car he wrecked could not be repaired in
time, and Pelfrey's only backup was a 1999 model deemed to be
obsolete. That's when Foyt came to the rescue. Foyt had opted to
release former Indy 500 pole sitter Roberto Guerrero from the seat
of the No. 41 car co-owned by himself and Kenny Brack, the 1999
Indy 500 champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't get him \RGuerrero\S going,'' Foyt said. ``I
really felt bad about pulling him out. Sometimes it don't click.''
Boat approached Foyt about the car's availability and was told to
bring his seat over.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:18 p.m., Boat qualified the No. 41 G Force/Aurora 31st at
192.105 mph _ a four-lap average that went awry when the car's
electronic dash malfunctioned and cut the engine on the third lap.
The hiccup dropped Boat's speed from 219.085 mph to 150.928. Boat's
fourth lap in that run also was a bust at 198.724 mph. Boat held
the 31st spot for 16 minutes, until St. James qualified a backup G
Force/Aurora owned by Dick Simon at 218.826 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 5:39 p.m., the bumping process saw Robby Unser,
Davy Jones, and Scott Harrington tossed from the lineup. By that
time, Foyt had decided to loan his untried backup to Boat, who
finished third in the 1999 Indy 500 for A.J. but was fired after a
disappointing season. Salazar and Jeff Ward, who qualified sixth
here Saturday at 222.639 mph, are flying Foyt's colors this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes careers go in different directions,'' Boat said of
his dismissal. ``I feel very fortunate that A.J. and I maintained
the relationship that we did, and that I still felt that I could
walk into his garage and say, `I'm in trouble. Can I get in one of
your cars?'''

FOR MICKELSON, PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH AND CHARLES CLINES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ MasterCard Colonial champ Phil Mickelson needed
only 26 putts during yesterday's final round, the fewest among the
top five finishers on the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Mickelson said, was a putting drill he initiated after
Saturday's third round. Mickelson placed 10 balls in a circle
around one hole, all inside three feet. He did not leave the
putting green until he drained 100 consecutive putts from that
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm putting good, it takes me 20 minutes. But
\RSaturday\S night, it took 45,'' said Mickelson, who was the last
player remaining on the Colonial practice green when he dropped his
100th consecutive three-footer at 8 p.m. Saturday. ``I didn't have
my stroke where it needed to be, but I got it back. I was making
them in the middle of the cup by the time I finished.''
</P>
<P>
   During yesterday's final round, Mickelson drained eight birdie
putts, including the tournament-winner from 35 feet on the 18th
hole. ON SECOND THOUGHT ... Phil Mickelson committed one of his few
gaffes yesterday during his acceptance speech on the 18th green.
After closing with a 63, the lowest final round of any Colonial
champ, Mickelson attempted to compliment local citizens for their
Texas hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, the Phoenix resident underestimated the provincial
pride of the pro-Fort Worth crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have had two great weeks in Dallas,'' said
Mickelson, who finished in a tie for second at last week's GTE
Byron Nelson Classic. ``We really enjoy the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson was immediately shouted down by fans, who reminded him
he was standing in Fort Worth, not Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just bit my tongue,'' Mickelson told the crowd. ``We've had
two wonderful weeks HERE.'' TIGER WATCH BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament, Colonial tournament chairman Phil Thomas
said he ``would come close to betting'' that Tiger Woods would
return to Fort Worth in 2001 unless he successfully defended his
title at this week's Deutsche Bank Open in Alveslohe, Germany.
Woods, however, surrendered a one-stroke lead with eight holes
remaining in yesterday's final round and lost by four strokes to
Lee Westwood at the European Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   That means Woods will not have a title to defend next season if
the European Tour event falls on the same week as Colonial for a
third consecutive year. Thomas reiterated his optimistic stance
yesterday about a probable return to Colonial in 2001 by the PGA
Tour's top gate attraction. ESTIMATED ATTENDANCE
</P>
<P>
   Colonial officials estimated attendance for tournament week at
170,000, with a high of 45,000 during yesterday's final round.
Estimated attendance for the Thursday-Sunday rounds included:
Sunday, 45,000; Saturday, 40,000; Friday, 30,000; and Thursday,
25,000. The remaining 30,000 came from practice rounds and pro-am
days. STARTING POINT
</P>
<P>
   John Cook shot a 2-under 68 yesterday to finish at 6-under 274
for the tournament and cashed only his fourth check in 14
tournaments this season. But he said it's too early to ``say I'm
back. This is just a starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook has tried several putters and went to a cross-handed grip
for two weeks before switching to a new putter and a regular grip
Monday in an effort to climb out of his slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a relief,'' he said of his efforts at Colonial. ``It has
been a long time since I've played this good. Houston is the first
time I've felt like had any control.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook didn't make the cut at Houston but did the next week in New
Orleans. Then he missed the cut again at last week's GTE Byron
Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not back, but I hit some good shots when I had to this
week and putted reasonably well, something I haven't done in a long
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a start.'' STARS TRACKING
</P>
<P>
   Fans were watching golf around the 18th green, but several had
on headphones to keep track of the Stars' playoff game against the
Avalanche. A cheer went up once among several spectators when
someone reported the Stars had just gone up 3-1. They won, 4-1.
MEDIATE'S WILD RIDE
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Mediate said ``something crazy'' would have to happen
yesterday in order for him to win. It almost did.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate, who finished tied for fourth with David Toms at 8
under, dropped in an eagle on the par-4 No. 15 to pull within
serious striking distance at 9 under. Mediate holed out from 167
yards with a 7-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a better shot at 16 and made bogey, so go figure,''
Mediate said. Mediate dropped his tee shot on the 188-yard par-3
No. 16 within 4 feet of the hole. His birdie put slid by the hole
and down to the green's bottom shelf, where Mediate had to two-putt
from for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting kind of frustrated,'' he said. ``I missed a
short one for par at 14, and then I get the eagle.'' FAR EAST SHOWS
WELL
</P>
<P>
   For only the second time in tournament history, the MasterCard
Colonial saw three Japanese players play all four days.
</P>
<P>
   Shigeki Maruyama (5 under) tied for 13th, Kaname Yokoo (4 over)
tied for 55th and Kazuhiko Hosokawa (8 over) tied for 62nd. In
1997, Maruyama, Hosokawa and Joe Ozaki all made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama won $56,571 to add to an impressive earnings total
($730,640), which ranked him 19th overall on the PGA Tour. He has
five top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Tour regular Hosokawa earned his first PGA check in two
starts this season, and Yokoo has made three of four cuts in the
United States in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get into the top 10 in Japan, I'll have a good chance
of coming to play here full time,'' said Yokoo, 27, through his
translator and manager, Aaron Buckmister. ``That's the goal, of
course. If I can't, I'll stay in Japan and try harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Yokoo finished ninth in Japan Tour earnings in 1998 and '99 and
sits in the top 20 this season. CHANGES BRING CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   The more than $3.5 million in course renovations at Colonial the
past year met with approval by the PGA Tour competitors, and the
changes affected the way the pros played some of the holes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change was No. 9, which had the tee moved back some
30 yards. It jumped to third-hardest hole, replacing the third hole
of the ``Horrible Horseshoe.''
</P>
<P>
   The 470-yard fifth hole that skirts the Trinity River remained
the hardest for the competitors as the scoring average was 4.363.
The second-hardest over the years had been the 476-yard third hole,
but this week, the 246-yard fourth hole proved more difficult. It
played to a 3.146 average, while the third hole played to a 4.118
average and dropped to fifth hardest.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the hardest holes at Colonial have been, in
order, Nos. 5, 3, 4 (the ``Horrible Horseshoe''), and Nos. 12, 10,
15, 14, 8, 18, 16, 7, 9, 13, 17, 6, 2, 11 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they were holes 5, 4, 9, 18, 3, 7, 14, 15, 13, 2, 10,
12, 8, 16, 6, 17, 11 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   The par-5 first hole, the par-4 sixth and 17th holes were the
only ones that the field averaged under par. They averaged 4.713
strokes on the 565-yard first hole, 3.944 on the 393-yard sixth and
3.938 on the 383-yard 17th. OUT OF NOWHERE
</P>
<P>
   Carl ``A Cinderella Story'' Paulson _ forgive the Bill Murray
impersonation _ came from nowhere to card a 29 on the back nine
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, who witnessed no gophers on the course, posted a
six-birdie, bogey-free nine to match the second-best back nine at
Colonial. Keith Clearwater carded a 28 during the 1993 tournament.
Paulson and six others earned $26,117 for their 24th-place finish.

NEBRASKA ATTACK SUBDUES BAYLOR IN BIG 12 FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Plotting his team's strategy before the Big 12
Tournament championship game, Nebraska coach Dave Van Horn issued a
public vow: ``We will do anything necessary to win, except put
Shane Komine on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   Komine, the Cornhuskers pitching ace who was knocked out by
Missouri in the tournament opener, was probably the only guy
wearing red who declined to step up and take a swing at Baylor
(45-15) yesterday, as Nebraska (47-15) rode a 15-hit barrage to an
11-3 victory in a battle of top seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was led by left- fielder Adam Stern, designated
hitter Justin Cowan and right fielder Adam Shabala _ voted the
tournament's Outstanding Player _ who combined to drive in eight
runs. But the hero of the hour was Chad Wiles (4-2), who carried a
no-hitter into the sixth and gave the Bears little hope of a
counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Wiles, who has struggled through a so-so year, found himself in
familiar circumstances: he got the save in this game last year when
Nebraska topped the Bears, 4-3, and also threw a one-hitter against
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is about this tournament,'' he said.
``Maybe I just get focused a little better. I've been struggling
all year, but I don't know why ... just baseball, I guess. But I
had an extra motivation because they swept us down there early in
the year, and we didn't want them to beat us a fourth time.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn recalled that after the final game of the Baylor
series, ``I told them that if we didn't have a really good April,
we were going to be sitting home at this point, and we're too good
a team for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, they had a players-only meeting, and I think
some of the older guys had a few things to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is 29-4 since that point, and Shabala _ who had
problems seeing the ball until he tried contact lenses _ is hitting
.449. After losing the tournament opener, the Cornhuskers won five
consecutive games to claim the title for the second consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   They finished the charge with glittering pitching performances
from Scott Fries and R.D. Spiehs _ who each held hard-hitting
Oklahoma to one run in a doubleheader victory Saturday _ and Wiles,
three pitchers who are not the mainline figures in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the things is, they were last year,'' Van Horn said. ``I
think what you've seen the last two days is three guys with their
backs to the wall who came out battling. Guys who were good last
year and have been relatively forgotten this year.''
</P>
<P>
   With both teams assured a berth in the NCAA regionals _ Baylor
will be a host next weekend _ Nebraska was able to save Komine and
Baylor coach Steve Smith saved the aces that had compiled a 1.67
earned-run average coming into this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bats just killed us today,'' Smith said. ``But they were
also deeper on the mound than we were. We were throwing freshmen,
but they still had Wiles. He made our bats look awfully slow.''

<P>
   DENVER -- Lost in the Stars' victory yesterday was their
five-on-three penalty kill in the second period that seemed to
break the Colorado Avalanche's spirit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a turning point for us,'' Stars forward Mike Keane
said. ``We still had a two-goal lead, but they could have jumped
back in. They were slowly getting momentum. Then, we got the
kill.'' &QL;

Derian Hatcher was given a two-minute penalty for high sticking.
Only 56 seconds into the Avs' power play, Keane joined him in the
penalty box for high sticking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Avs a five-on-three, and a chance to get back into
the game. But Ed Belfour stopped three Colorado shots during the
power play, including one during the five-on-three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's trying to keep the puck out of your net,'' Stars center
Guy Carbonneau said. ``Obviously, they've got a great power play.
You have to be a little bit lucky, and you need your goaltender to
make the save. We just try and keep the puck away from the net as
much as possible, and give them the worst shot possible.'' &QL; 
FIGHTING BACK &QL; 
The Stars talked Saturday of needing to turn this series into a
street fight. It appears the Avalanche had the same idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the final half of the third period, both teams seemed content
to muck it up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The period included[ There were] 11 penalties, two fights and
too much pushing and shoving to count. Problems began when Stars
captain Derian Hatcher and Avs forward Adam Deadmarsh exchanged
blows with 7 minutes, 43 seconds remaining. Jamie Langenbrunner and
Adam Foote followed not long after, with more tussles between
Darryl Sydor and Shjon Podein, Brenden Morrow and Aaron Miller and
Sylvain Cote and almost everybody.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs, that's the way it goes,'' said. ``When[ gusy]
guys have been banging heads for four games, usually when the score
is like that, you are going to have guys giving each other extra
little[ shtos,] shots, extra little whacks. I don't think it's a
surprise to anybody.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hatcher-Deadmarsh fight, it wasn't really a fight.
There was one punch, a right hook by Hatcher that drew blood,
before both players fell down. &QL; 
LYASHENKO PLAYS &QL; 
Stars rookie center Roman Lyashenko made his Western Conference
Finals debut; he[ yesterday. The rookie had been] was a healthy
scratch in the first three games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And while the stat sheet [ only]showed him with only one shot,
25 percent in the faceoff circle and two hits, he had a very busy
afternoon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lyashenko drew a[ the] roughing call on Serge Aubin at 5:39 of
the first period. Joe Nieuwendyk scored on the ensuing power play
for a 1-0 lead. Lyashenko replaced[ came in for] Aaron Gavey, who
was a healthy scratch[ along with winger Blake Sloan] for the first
time[ in] this series.  &QL; 
Manson fits his niche &QL; 
Stars defenseman Dave Manson was brought in from Chicago to be
physical. Yesterday, Manson played 24 physical minutes and at one
point demonstrated that the Stars will take care of those who touch
Stars goalie Ed Belfour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Colorado forward Peter Forsberg took a little swipe at
Belfour, Manson did all he could to get at Forsberg. Before he
could, however, he was separated. The play was indicative of
Manson's day; he finished with two shots and four hits. &QL; 
A ONE AND A ... 222? &QL; 
Stars center Guy Carbonneau passed Bryan Trottier, now a Colorado
assistant, for fourth place on the NHL's all-time playoff list for
games played. Yesterday was Carbonneau's 222nd postseason game.
Only Mark Messier (236), Larry Robinson (227) and Glenn Anderson
(225) have appeared in more playoff games. Did I?'' Carbonneau said
when asked about passing Trottier. I stopped counting after one.''
FIGHTING MAD
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Scott Thornton received a 10-minute misconduct
penalty with 1:54 left in the game. It was the Stars' fifth penalty
of the period and ninth of the game. They had warned us that any
extracurricular at that time, they'd throw the player out,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. Second-period blues The Stars have been
outshot, 56-29, in the second period of the four games of the
conference finals. And that includes outshooting the Avs 17-5 in
the second period of Game 2. The one thing that is concerning us is
our second period in this building,'' said Hitchcock, whose team
has been outshot, 41-8, in the second period of the past two games.
It has been poor. We stopped playing a strong territorial game
\Ryesterday\S, and it put us behind the eight ball again. We tried
to make extra plays with the puck that were unnecessary.'' FACEOFF
FOLLIES
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the sexiest stats in the world, but in terms of zone
time and setting up goals, faceoffs are usually vital. Yesterday,
the Stars won the game but were beaten on faceoffs 38-29. This
coming after a first period in which they won 13-9. Center Guy
Carbonneau, who was 13-8, was the only Stars player to win more
faceoffs than he lost. Sometimes you play, and it doesn't really
matter,'' Carbonneau said. But I always take pride in winning the
one that we need to. Those are the ones that count. Sometimes you
go through a game where you feel like you are unbeatable, and
sometimes you just can't win one.'' nn

RANGERS RALLY, CAP SWEEPS WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Scott Erickson was dealing, Darren Oliver was
finished, and the national ESPN television audience had to be doing
some serious channel surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around the fifth inning Sunday night, all signs were
pointing to a real snoozer taking place at The Ballpark in
Arlington, one that would bring the Rangers' immensely successful
homestand to a disappointing end.
</P>
<P>
   But some simple truths could not be erased. The Rangers are on a
serious roll, the Baltimore Orioles are spiraling out of control,
and Frank Catalanotto still bids to be the first .600 hitter in
major-league history.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto got his sagging batting average back to the .600
level Sunday night with a two-out pinch-hit single in the eighth
inning, driving in Ruben Mateo with the winning run and giving the
Rangers a 6-5 victory against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers trailed 5-0 going into the sixth inning before
mounting a comeback that gave them their sixth consecutive victory
and 15th in 20 games. The Rangers finished with a 6-0 homestand for
only the fourth time in club history, and they are 14-5 in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up there pretty high right now,'' said Catalanotto,
speaking of the Rangers' confidence. ``We feel even if we're down
early in the game, we're going to come back and score some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Johnny Oates: ``It's been a good month of May.
Offensively we've scored a lot of runs, the bullpen is coming
around, and we've been able to win a lot of one-run ballgames. The
bullpen has a lot to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Darren Oliver put the Rangers down early by
giving up three runs in the first inning and left trailing 5-0 with
two on and two out in the fifth. But the bullpen combination of
Mark Clark, Francisco Cordero, Mike Venafro and John Wetteland
threw 41/3 scoreless innings to give the Rangers a chance to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen, after being the whipping boys for six weeks, helped
make it a successful homestand by holding opponents to two earned
runs in 20 innings. Wetteland, who struck out Will Clark with the
tying run at second to end the game, saved five of the six
victories and has been successful on seven consecutive save
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen has been a big key for us,'' first baseman Rafael
Palmeiro said. ``They keep us close, and, when we get the lead,
they come in and close the door. They're giving us a chance to win
these games late.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Rangers were toasting their success, the Orioles were
left to ponder the pain of having lost 15 of 17 games, effectively
removing them _ at least for the foreseeable future _ from the
American League East race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were our own worst enemy,'' Orioles manager Mike Hargrove
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles seemed fine through five innings yesterday. Erickson
had a two-hitter, a five-run lead and his sinking fastball working
well. Then all of a sudden, it started to unravel. Rafael Palmeiro
hit a solo home run in the sixth, Mike Lamb followed with a two-run
shot, and the Rangers were down 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, in his fifth start since coming off the disabled list,
went back out for the seventh, but got in trouble when he walked
Jason McDonald, gave up a single to Luis Alicea and walked Chad
Curtis to load the bases. Ivan Rodriguez's sacrifice fly off Al
Reyes brought home one run, and Palmeiro's slow grounder off Buddy
Groom drove in the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo got the winning rally started by drawing a leadoff walk.
Lamb bunted him to second and Catalanotto's two-out single off Mike
Trombley brought Mateo home. Catalanotto, who is bothered by a
strained groin muscle, has 21 hits in 35 at-bats this season and is
9-for-11 since coming off the disabled list at the start of the
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can say is the ball is finding holes,''
Catalanotto said. ``I'm seeing the ball good, but it's not like I'm
crushing it. It's just getting through the infield.'' nn

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak recalled his peace
negotiators from Sweden on Sunday after a firebomb seriously
wounded a 2-year-old Israeli girl in a car passing through the
sleepy Palestinian-ruled city of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   The attack prompted Israel to block entrance to the Palestinian
territories, declaring them unsafe for Israelis and tourists, and
temporarily undercut a year of normalization efforts. The incident
also undermined Palestinian attempts to restore order, although the
Palestinians did clamp down on street fighting for the first time
in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials denounced Barak for pushing away from the
peace table. Calling it an ``irresponsible decision,'' Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority, said it
would lead to ``further deterioration and increased tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, because of surging violence in the West
Bank, Gaza and Lebanon, Barak also canceled a trip to consult with
President Clinton on the U.S.-mediated ``final status'' peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's advisers said they understood, the
cancellation indicated that Israel was setting its own timetable
despite prodding from administration officials who have devoted two
terms to the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and feel that their
remaining time is ebbing away.
</P>
<P>
   Middle East peace, however, does not work on anyone's schedule.
Certainly the last two weeks have produced an unpredictable shift
on the ground, in which the Palestinians' frustration with the slow
pace of peace erupted at the same time that officials finally got
down to serious and substantive final-status negotiations in
Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators face a September deadline, which is tight even
without timeouts, given that other events will compete for the
Israeli leader's attention. Soon, Barak, who is also the defense
minister, will be forced to focus on the complex and delicate task
of withdrawing Israeli troops from southern Lebanon by July 7. And
analysts believe that the dynamic of the withdrawal is already
affecting Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Arab world see Israel's withdrawal as a defeat to be
celebrated, and as an object lesson that negates the value of peace
negotiations. Fighters from Hezbollah, or the Party of God, are
intensifying their combat to ensure that Israel pulls out under
fire.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, for the first time in years, they attacked an Israeli
outpost at the foot of Mount Hermon, in the Shebaa Farms area that
was Syrian territory when Israel occupied the Golan Heights. Israel
does not plan to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms even though Lebanon
recently claimed the land as Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which will certify whether Israel's
withdrawal is complete, is unlikely to accept Lebanon's assertion.
This makes the Shebaa Farms a worrisome zone, and Hezbollah sent a
message Sunday that it would keep fighting Israel if the withdrawal
did not include the area.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television reported that Barak had told the military to
prepare to pull its troops out of southern Lebanon in the next 10
days, but government officials immediately denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The approach of a full withdrawal is also prompting more
defections from the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army. Forty-six
militia fighters reportedly abandoned three crucial outposts in
Lebanon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in the last week, Palestinian youths cited the
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as proof that violence ``forces the
Israelis to surrender,'' as one teen-ager said Sunday. ``They are
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this will be a new intifada,'' Nafez Azzam, a
leader of the Islamic Holy War group in Gaza, said, referring to
the uprising of the late 1980s. ``It should continue as far as
occupation remains. There is no excuse for resumption of talks
under such an atmosphere. This is an atmosphere of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The street violence, which involved sustained gunfire between
Israeli and Palestinian troops last Monday, provoked opposition
forces on both sides to press their leaders to suspend the peace
talks. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, Health Minister Shlomo
Benizri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party said that Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, was ``either a dead horse or a deadly
one,'' and he proclaimed the peace effort to be useless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stockholm negotiations continued until Sunday, when
Barak halted them ``in light of the situation.'' He also deferred
the transfer of Abu Dis and two other villages abutting Jerusalem
to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said he viewed the incident in Jericho ``with the
greatest concern'' and has demanded that the Palestinian Authority
track down those responsible. The little girl was severely burned,
and her mother and aunt had less serious burns. Their car was
passing through Jericho early Sunday on its way to northern Israel,
a shortcut that many Israelis prefer to the circuitous bypass road
that was built so they could avoid Palestinian-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Jericho attack unnerved pro-peace Israelis, who have
hesitated to accept that the recent violence could be anything but
a short-lived spurt, because such incidents were coming to be seen
as a thing of the past. Many have touted the normalization of
tourism to and travel through Jericho in particular as an emblem of
successful ``people to people'' peace relations.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a reflection of the successful casino there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We today are not at peace with ourselves when we see what is
happening with the Palestinians,'' said Shlomo Lahat, a former
mayor of Tel Aviv and chairman of a pro-peace forum. ``We are
sensitive people, and we understand their pain _ but to attack
people and shoot at them _ that's the thanks we get? These things
cause us to reconsider whether the road we are on is the right
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, of course, see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   In the last nine days, rubber-coated or live bullets fired by
Israeli troops killed five Palestinians and wounded more than 1,000
others, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian human rights groups said the Israeli troops were
using ``excessive force against unarmed Palestinians,'' although
some of the protesters, who threw stones and firebombs, were backed
by sharpshooters. The Israeli soldiers targeted chests, abdomens
and necks, and used live ammunition to disperse crowds, the human
rights advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence grew out of street protests on behalf of the 1,650
Palestinian prisoners in Israel, coupled with demonstrations
marking the anniversary of what Palestinians call the ``nakba,''
the ``catastrophe'' that coupled the destruction of Palestine with
the birth of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a familiar ritual here, some protesters marched to Israeli
guard positions on the outskirts of Palestinian areas and threw
stones and firebombs. The Israeli soldiers responded by shooting
tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets. And the Palestinian
police were hesitant to place themselves between their own people
and the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian Authority cannot use brutal measures on its
own people,'' said Nabil Amr, the minister of parliamentary
affairs. ``We cannot deny them the right to express themselves even
if, unfortunately, it leads to violence and more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, however, the Palestinian police prevented most
demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza from escalating into
violent clashes. In Ramallah, for instance, they set up roadblocks
on all streets leading to an Israeli-guarded junction and then,
using billy clubs, pushed hundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators
away from the fence of a nearby settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, demonstrators began throwing stones at their
own police officers, and some of the officers hid behind a wall and
threw stones back.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians said they thought a visit by Sandy Berger,
President Clinton's national security adviser, to Arafat on
Saturday night helped calm the situation. They met in Ramallah.
Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, said that ``the
Americans affirmed their readiness to hold a trilateral summit''
with Arafat and Barak but insisted that progress in negotiations be
made first.
</P>
<P>
   That would require negotiations to resume. And Berger, who spoke
at Tel Aviv University on Sunday morning, seemed to be urging the
parties to rise above the moment and take the long view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today and in the months ahead, we have a historic opportunity
that we must not allow to slip away _ a chance to resolve the
Israeli-Palestinian problem, the core of the Arab-Israeli
conflict,'' he said. ``The alternative to a peaceful compromise is
not the status quo. It is something very different and, I am
convinced, far worse. For the condition that produced hostility in
the past remains current to this day, as we see in the violence of
the past week.''

LONG BEACH STATE WANTS TO KEEP PLAYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ There will be no begging.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Long Beach State spent Sunday evening trying to lobby
members of the NCAA Baseball selection committee about the
postseason-worthiness of the Dirtbags.
</P>
<P>
   Dirtbag coach Dave Snow did not wake up this morning and feel
the need to reach out to anyone within earshot of the committee. It
isn't his style, and everyone who knows him knows better than to
even ask the question.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dirtbags get one of the 64 invitations to the postseason,
to be handed out at noon today (ESPN), it will be on the program's
merit and the 31 wins it claimed during an odd 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   No win was bigger than Sunday's, of course, a 9-5 victory at
Blair Field over cross-county rival Fullerton. It gave the 49ers
two wins in their final three-game series against the Titans, a tie
for third-place in the Big West standings (18-12), and four wins in
six games on the season against a team that will host one of the 16
first-round tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the positives in the 49ers' case. But clearly,
the oddest season in Snow's dozen on Atherton has everyone
associated with the program guessing on the 49ers' future,
including Snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no feel for it,'' he said. ``No thoughts, no feel. No
body knows what they'll do. It's all speculation. I'd like to think
we've got some good wins this season, maybe enough to get us in. We
also had some ugly losses.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' 31-25 regular season mark is the worst in Snow's 12
years, although it isn't so far off some other regular season marks
-- the 49ers had regular season marks of 32-22 in 1996 and 34-22 in
1997 -- to make one recoil in horror. The season only pales because
the expectations are so high.
</P>
<P>
   If someone were to try and influence a committee member, these
are the stats that would be emphasized:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) The 49ers went 11-13 against seven opponents currently
ranked in Collegiate Baseball's Top 30. In a year in which there
was no dominant west coast team, that's not a bad number. Fullerton
finishes the season 35-19 overall and 14-12 against ranked teams.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two schools isn't so great that one
team is host for a playoff round while the other has to watch.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) In one unofficial ranking that the committe doesn't
necessarily use but is similar to college basketball's RPI, the
49ers rank 40th in the nation. A separate strength of schedule
index by another college basketball number-crusher says the 49ers
played the 10th toughest schedule in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) The 49ers swept a Texas Tech team that will earn an
at-large berth, split a two-game series with a 40-win Wichita State
team, and swept a three-game series at Arkansas, a team that just
won two of three games against No. 1-ranked South Carolina and
played the second-toughest schedule in the country. There was also
a win in three games at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) And finally, there's the nine-straight tournament
appearances. This is one of the few moments when Long Beach State
can actually site tradition an asset. Snow's Dirtbags have been to
the tourney nine straight years (and 10 of 11) and the College
World Series four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to say we deserve a spot,'' Snow said. ``There were
a lot of disappointing things about the season. There have been
times when we've played horribly. We had some deficiencies that it
took us 20 games to show.'' The 49ers opened the season 16-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys before the series that we needed to hang in
there. Coming in, we had to have a
whatever-it-takes-to-get-the-job-done attitude. Even in our loss
Saturday (4-2), we went about the game the way we're supposed to. I
told them not to let the lack of a result bring on any negativity,
because we've struggled with (bad vibes) the last few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers certainly could have given in against Fullerton
Sunday. The Titans opened up a 4-0 first-inning lead, and the 49ers
trailed 5-2 after a sixth-inning, bases-loaded, no out situation
produced just one run. Instead, they bundled together a classic
rally for six runs in the seventh -- two walks, four singles, a
double and a game-tying non-sacrifice bunt. The key hit was a
pinch-hit, chalk-drawing line drive by pinch-hitter Casey Grzecka.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, the Titans loaded the bases with two outs and sent
outfielder Chris Beck, who hit a three-run first-inning homer, to
the plate as the game-tying run. But reliever Josh Alliston blew a
2-2 fastball by Beck for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely believe we belong,'' said catcher Bryan Kennedy.
``The way we played this weekend shows what this team can do. We've
played and beaten good teams this season.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Losses to mediocre teams -- three to UCSB, two to
Sacramento, Northridge and Pepperdine -- were the team's biggest
problem. The 49ers lost their last seven mid-week non-conference
games. Win three of those seven games and the Snowmen are wondering
where they're headed, not if.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told us that if we don't get in, we'll spend the season
wondering `what if.' But if we do get in, we're all going to start
0-0. I don't care where they send us. I just want to keep
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just looking for a shot,'' said reserve Bobby Womack.
``We like being the underdog, and nobody likes playing the
Dirtbags.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one notion the committee hopefully won't consider.

   To know him is to love him: NBA fans may only be aware of the
78-year-old Winter as the triangle guru, first with the Chicago
Bulls (for 14 years), and now the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   So Cal basketball people may know he played at USC (with Alex
Hannum and Bill Sharman), coached at Washington against UCLA's John
Wooden and ended up directing Long Beach State's struggling program
in the late '70s, where after his ``retirement'' at age 60 looked
to be out of the game for good.
</P>
<P>
   There had to be a beginning. And an in between. That's where
this book fills the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   The last chapter about his coming to the Lakers entitled
``Escape to L.A.'' could also be one of the book's first chapters.
As a 14-year-old, born in Wellington, Texas, who came to L.A. with
his mom during the Great Depression, he learned to play basketball
in Huntington Park. The kids called him ``Tex'' - not as a
compliment.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 chapters, plus plenty of photos from the family album,
this pieces together Winter's ride through basketball and life to
where he's finally received the respect and admiration of his peers
and players.

ST. JAMES, FISHER MAKE HISTORY
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Lyn St. James has been racing cars longer than
Sarah Fisher has been alive. But on Sunday, the oldest and youngest
drivers in the field will make history as the first two women to
start an Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, a 19-year-old rookie, will start 19th after compiling a
four-lap//10-mile qualifying average of 220.237 mph[ on] Saturday.
St. James, 53, secured the 32nd spot in the field of 33 with a
qualifying effort of 218.826 mph yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   St. James' Bump Day run ended a streak of two frustrating years
of missing the race and put her in the company of postergirl
Fisher. But St. James said her motivation for the race's 84th
edition was not about making statements on gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be in the race,'' said St. James, who
followed Janet Guthrie (1977-79) as the second woman to compete in
the Indy 500. ``What Sarah is doing has no pressure on my deal, to
be my best and drive my best. I've been racing for 26 years, as one
who loves the sport. I am proud of Sarah Fisher. She came up the
right way. She realized she had to go fast. But not all fast
drivers come to Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James put together her run approximately 24 hours after
crashing her primary No. 90 Yellow Freight Systems G Force/Aurora
in Turn 2 of the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The car she
qualified was a hybrid 2000 chassis based on the backup of Dick
Simon Racing teammate Stephan Gregoire, who will start 20th in the
No. 7 Mexmil G Force/Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years of not making it \Rthe Indy 500\S tore me
up inside,'' St. James said. ``It was the strongest test I've had
in knowing who Lyn St. James is. I'm happy and pleased to be where
I am.'' Texas team starts two Rockwall-based TeamExtreme saw both
its drivers qualify when veteran Davey Hamilton joined rookie
Airton Dare on the final grid yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, the only driver to start all 38 Indy Racing League
events, landed in the 28th spot after qualifying at 219.878 mph.
Dare, of Brazil, earned the 21st spot Saturday at 219.970 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton never had qualified lower than 11th in four previous
Indy 500s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard horror stories about starting in the back,'' said
Hamilton, driver of the No. 16 Lycos G Force/Aurora. ``I'll let you
know what it's like back there after the race.'' Mears lends
expertise Indianapolis native Andy Hillenburg realized a lifelong
dream when he qualified for the race, with a little help from a
famous friend. Hillenburg will start 33rd and last after qualifying
at 218.285 mph in the No. 48 The Sumar Special Dallara/Aurora.
Hillenburg's coaching staff was headed by Rick Mears, the third man
to win four Indy 500s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing,'' said Mears, the race winner in 1979, 1984,
1988 and 1991 with Team Penske. ``I was visiting with Bill Simpson
\Rteam co-owner\S, and he said they were struggling a bit. I didn't
really do much. I was just another set of eyes and ears. Andy went
out there and stood on it, and got it done.'' Matsuda hospitalized
Popular Japanese driver Hideshi Matsuda, 45, was admitted to
Methodist Hospital downtown with a fractured right wrist and left
knee after crashing his backup No. 20 Hubbard-Imke Dallara/Aurora
in Turn 3 on a practice run late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuda, who has started four previous Indy 500s, was scheduled
to undergo surgery last night. It was Matsuda's third crash in as
many days.

GEORGIA WINS TITLE ON TIEBREAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. - Don't think tennis is a team sport? Try
explaining that to the women of Georgia and Stanford, who battled
into the early evening and had their NCAA Championship match
decided in doubles play.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the final doubles match went to a tiebreaker
before Georgia's Marissa Catlin and Lori Grey pulled out a 9-8
(7-3) victory over Teryn Ashley and Marissa Irvin to give the
Bulldogs a 5-4 victory and their second national championship
Sunday at Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Catlin and Grey led 6-1, but Ashley and Irvin won the next six
games, and later forced the tiebreaker with a service break.
Stanford won the first two points of the tiebreaker but just one
point after that.
</P>
<P>
   A double fault set up match point for Georgia, and Irvin hit
into the net on match point. Stanford lost its only match of the
season and finished 30-1, and Georgia (27-2) added another title to
the one it won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went away from each other for a while, but we got it under
control,'' Grey said. ``We had to do it for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams split the six singles matches, sending the match to
doubles play. Stanford got some momentum in the final singles
match, when Gabriela Lastra held off Grey for a 6-2, 6-7 (7-9), 6-1
victory, and based on rankings, the Cardinal had the advantage of
two of the three doubles matchups.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how it worked out. Georgia's Esther Knox and
Aarthi Venkatesan beat Laura Granville and Keiko Tokuda 8-3, and
Stanford's Lauren Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra beat Anne Nguyen and
Zoe Mellis 8-2, meaning the match would be decided on Court 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw our girls standing around cheering, I knew we had
to win,'' Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   The match seemed destined for doubles play almost from the
beginning. The Cardinal got off to a quick start in singles when
Granville continued her torrid play with a 6-0, 6-3 victory over
Knox at No. 2, and Stanford's prospects looked even better when
fifth singles Jennifer Heiser pounded Kelly Baskin 6-4, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Cardinal seemed a lock for at least one or two
more victories, but Stanford's fortunes headed south quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Almost simultaneously, Georgia's No. 3 and No. 6 players, Catlin
and Nguyen, held off challenges to earn two crucial points. Catlin,
ranked No. 55, upset No. 9 Kalvaria, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) and Nguyen,
after a dreadful second set, came back to beat Tokuda 6-3, 1-6,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The match of the day, however, was the contest between
top-ranked Irvin (a graduate of Harvard-Westlake High) and No. 5
Venkatesan, who earned the 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 victory in a match that
featured 17 service breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Down 5-4 in the second set, Irvin held off two break points and
broke Venkatesan. Irvin went up a break early int the third set,
but Vekatesan broke Irvin's serve the next three times to pull out
the surprising victory.
</P>
<P>
   The singles tournament begins at 9 a.m. today with 32
first-round matches. Second- and third-round matches will be held
Tuesday.

PLAYING WITH BASEBALL-STYLE MONOPOLY MONEY

<P>
   Game: Dodgers Collector's Edition Monopoly
</P>
<P>
   Price: $50
</P>
<P>
   How to get it: Dodger Stadium gift shop, the team Web site
(www.dodgers.com) or by phone at 323-224-1HIT.
</P>
<P>
   How it's played: Like regular Parker Brothers' classic - roll
the dice, buy property, put up houses (in this case, luxury boxes)
and hotels (or ballparks) and try to clean out your opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Who's on Boardwalk? Jackie Robinson ($400).
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the gameboard: Fernando Valenzuela might be a rather
curious choice to occupy Robinson's neighborhood at the Park Place
property (with a $350 price). Vin Scully ($260) is part of the
yellow lot purchase with Dodger Stadium and Ebbets Field.
</P>
<P>
   The green group is Tom Lasorda ($320), Don Drysdale and Steve
Garvey, while the red trio consists of Duke Snider ($240), Pee Wee
Reese and Roy Campanella. The orange group is Eric Karros ($200),
Kirk Gibson and Orel Hershiser. The three property families from
the ``Go'' position are represented by the team's Dominican and
spring training facilities, the minor-league affiliates and the
World Championships of '55, '63 and '88.
</P>
<P>
   The two utilities are replaced by the TV and radio rights, while
the railroad foursome consists instead of the Stadium Club, Dugout
Club, Diamondvision and Stadium Suites.
</P>
<P>
   What's obviously missing: Sandy Koufax. The Dodgers asked if the
Hall of Famer would be part of the game, but, as is his way, he
respectfully declined.
</P>
<P>
   Game pieces: A Dodgers cap, a Dodger dog, a Dodgers pennant, a
catcher's mask, a baseball glove and a statue of a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chance'' card we wish was included: ``You mooned John Rocker.
Go directly to jail. Do not pass Lasorda.''
</P>
<P>
   The unique packaging: ``Trying to fit a square game into a round
box was an engineering nightmare,'' admits Mike Nygren, the
Dodgers' director of merchandising. ``But we're the only ones who
are going to have a Monopoly game in that kind of (15''-diameter)
baseball-shaped box.'' (Other games for the New York Yankees and
Boston Red Sox are currently being co-produced by those teams).
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion: It's only been out about three weeks, but ``the
reception has been nothing short of incredible,'' Nygren said. ``We
think it's a good representation of the franchise's rich history.''

</P>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Country clubs have traditionally been places where
affluent, white (mostly Protestant) Americans could get together to
play golf, drink, eat mediocre food and casually discuss business.
Talking politics was never polite but, come election time, the
members would line up behind Republican candidates, including that
consummate club member, George Bush, Sr. But George W. Bush would
be wise not to take his father's group for granted. He may have
solid country-club credentials and even a decent golf swing, but
America's country-club Republicans are not the dependable political
force they once were. ``It's not your father's country club any
more, and it's not your father's Republican Party either,'' says
Marshall Wittmann of the Heritage Foundation. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 was supposed to wean
American farmers off federal handouts. That act ended price
supports for common crops such as corn and wheat, encouraging
farmers to switch instead to more unusual plantings in response to
market demand. But last year proved they were still relying on
government money in the form of emergency payments and loans, and
this year will probably prove it again. This is, after all, an
election year, and most of the money will conveniently arrive in
the autumn. But farmers might find Congress less kind when the
pressure to win friends is over. ``I am much less convinced we can
count on that kind of largesse next year and down the road,'' says
an Iowa State University economist. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Next week, the American Congress will vote on
whether to grant China permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) as
part of that country's entry into the World Trade Organization. It
promises to be a razor-close vote. Congress should vote in favor of
the bill, not mainly for reasons of American economic
self-interest, but because PNTR will speed the very changes in
China that critics of the measure say they want to see. &QL;

Viewed from on high, he seemed to be meandering all over the place.
Go with the flow, however, and you would find he was always moving
in the same general direction. Unfortunately, Wahid's
seven-month-old government presides over an Indonesia that is far
from stable. If he is not to follow in the steps of his ousted
predecessor, President Suharto, Wahid needs to chart a straight and

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Country clubs have traditionally been places where
affluent, white (mostly Protestant) Americans could get together to
play golf, drink, eat mediocre food and casually discuss business.
Talking politics was never polite but, come election time, the
members would line up behind Republican candidates, including that
consummate club member, George Bush, Sr. But George W. Bush would
be wise not to take his father's group for granted. He may have
solid country-club credentials and even a decent golf swing, but
America's country-club Republicans are not the dependable political
force they once were. ``It's not your father's country club any
more, and it's not your father's Republican Party either,'' says
Marshall Wittmann of the Heritage Foundation. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 was supposed to wean
American farmers off federal handouts. That act ended price
supports for common crops such as corn and wheat, encouraging
farmers to switch instead to more unusual plantings in response to
market demand. But last year proved they were still relying on
government money in the form of emergency payments and loans, and
this year will probably prove it again. This is, after all, an
election year, and most of the money will conveniently arrive in
the autumn. But farmers might find Congress less kind when the
pressure to win friends is over. ``I am much less convinced we can
count on that kind of largesse next year and down the road,'' says
an Iowa State University economist. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ America's economy has been roaring along, with low
inflation, for so long now that any mention of speed limits and
overheating was becoming decidedly unfashionable. No longer. In
recent weeks, the signs that the economy is being stretched beyond
its limits have become unmistakable. All eyes are now on the
Federal Reserve's next policy-making meeting on May 16. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Next week, the American Congress will vote on
whether to grant China permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) as
part of that country's entry into the World Trade Organization. It
promises to be a razor-close vote. Congress should vote in favor of
the bill, not mainly for reasons of American economic
self-interest, but because PNTR will speed the very changes in
China that critics of the measure say they want to see. &QL;

most-favored-nation trading status on a permanent basis (PNTR),
very little will actually change. But the crucial vote will have
far-reaching repercussions for both countries _ and for both
political parties. Place your bets, gentlemen _ it's going to be a
cliffhanger. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ When he was no more than a leading Islamic figure
and part-time opposition politician, Abdurrahman Wahid was known
for his sometimes bewildering changes of course. These rarely
disconcerted his admirers, one of whom compared him to a river.
Viewed from on high, he seemed to be meandering all over the place.
Go with the flow, however, and you would find he was always moving
in the same general direction. Unfortunately, Wahid's
seven-month-old government presides over an Indonesia that is far
from stable. If he is not to follow in the steps of his ousted
predecessor, President Suharto, Wahid needs to chart a straight and
steady course _ and stick to it. &QL;

   RAMALLAH _ In the worst bout of violence for several years,
thousands of Palestinians battled with the Israeli army on May 15.
They were marking al-Nakba Day: the term Palestinians use for the
``catastrophe'' of Israel's establishment and their dispossession
from most of Palestine. The al-Nakba anniversary always casts a
sombre pall over Palestinians, wherever they are. But this time, in
the West Bank and Gaza, the violence was fuelled by other, more
incendiary causes. &QL;

in 1916, they were cut down in their thousands. But Ethiopia's
human-wave advance was more successful than earlier invasions of
the same kind. After two years of an intermittently ferocious war,
this could be the start of the Ethiopian-Eritrean endgame. &QL;

son were murdered. The perpetrators have claimed to be from the

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Next week, the American Congress will vote on
whether to grant China permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) as
part of that country's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is the subject of one of the most intense lobbying
efforts seen on Capitol Hill for many years and its outcome is
still in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should vote in favor of the bill, not mainly for
reasons of American economic self-interest, narrowly defined, but
because PNTR will speed the very changes in China that critics of
the measure say they want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Both America and China would benefit in economic terms from the
tariff-reduction and market-widening proposals at issue, as with
any trade-expanding agreement. The deal would reduce average
Chinese tariffs from 24 percent to 9 percent by 2005. It would
abolish China's import quotas and licenses.
</P>
<P>
   And it would open up the Chinese market by allowing foreign
companies to set up wholly-owned distribution and sales
subsidiaries, by permitting 49 percent foreign ownership of
telephone companies, and by treating foreign banks in the same way
as domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, in view of this list, few oppose the measure
by claiming that America is giving up too much and China too
little. All the tariff cuts and market openings are on the Chinese
side. America gives up nothing except its ability to impose
unilateral trade sanctions under Section 301 of its trade laws.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue instead either that America would not get any of
the promised benefits because China cannot be trusted to keep its
word, or that America could get the same benefits anyway, without
giving up its unilateral trade-restricting powers. Both arguments
are weak.
</P>
<P>
   China's willingness to fulfill its international treaty
commitments has been, like America's, adequate though not
impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   China has signed four agreements with the United States since
1992. Its compliance with one of them _ an agreement to enforce
intellectual-property rights _ has been good; its record on keeping
its environmental promises has been fair, and on
nuclear-proliferation a bit less so.
</P>
<P>
   It has been bad at dealing with private commercial disputes
inside its borders, though even here there is progress. The record
could be better. But it gives no support to the idea that China is
inevitably negotiating in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that America can get the gains from normal trade
relations without the so-called loss of its Section 301 reprisals
is also implausible.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is that it could rely on its rights under a
bilateral agreement signed in 1979; or, failing this, that the
annual review (with implicit threat of sanctions) of China's status
is anyway consistent with the obligations both countries undertake
as members of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The expert consensus is that neither of these views stands up.
Certainly, under both rubrics there is scope for years of
litigation _ and while that is going on, American firms will be at
least somewhat restricted in their access to Chinese markets.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the real objections to the agreement are political,
rather than economic. PNTR, say its opponents, would stamp
America's seal of approval on a regime that is one of the worst
violators of human rights in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's own annual report on human rights recently
found that China's ``poor human-rights record deteriorated markedly
throughout (1999) as the government intensified efforts to suppress
dissent.'' And if this happens even when China is seeking a new
trade relationship with America, imagine what will happen when it
gets that and America permanently eschews annual review of China's
human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never offer permanent normal trading relations with
Nazi Germany,'' says one congressional opponent of the deal. ``Why
should we do the same for China?''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting question. There are two answers.
</P>
<P>
   First, liberal trade with a country should never be seen as
conferring a nation's moral approval, not least because trade
comprises transactions between people and firms, not between
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has other ways of signalling disapproval to
China _ ways which, unlike trade restrictions, do not curb the
freedom of Americans as well as that of ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Second, China is not Nazi Germany, an irredeemably evil regime
bent on destruction and conquest. It is not as murderous, not as
implacable and not as dedicated to its goal: indeed, its leaders
are divided between those seeking to build a modern economy and
society, and the ``dark forces'' in the army and the government
concerned to build up military power and national assertiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that China's militarists and reactionaries are
its own foremost opponents of PNTR. They rightly see it as a
threat. The reformist leaders, intent no doubt on keeping the
Communist Party in power, nonetheless believe they had no choice:
the economy is struggling and there seems no other way to spur
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal trade by no means guarantees that China will move
swiftly, or ever, towards a western-style liberal democracy. Only
this week China's president called for party cells to be
established in private companies, on the grounds that the party has
long been the guiding light of ``progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is wicked and fatuous in equal measure _ but also, as
the economy liberalizes, probably unworkable. Trade with foreigners
will add to the pressure, already developing internally, for the
rule of law to be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Gradual progress in the field of commercial law, which is where
a more prosperous bourgeoisie first makes its presence felt, is
especially encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Trade is probably the best thing the West can do to stack the
odds against the regime. Withholding trade will likely do the
opposite, serving only to strengthen the forces of reaction and
their claim on popular support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supporting China's entry into the WTO represents the most
significant opportunity that we have had to create positive change
in China since the 1970s, when President Nixon first went there,''
said Bill Clinton in March.
</P>
<P>
   He is right. Congress should grant China permanent normal
trading relations. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The cavalry, in the form of seven British warships
and 1,000 British paratroopers and marines, thundered in and
secured Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader, has been captured. Extra U.N.
troops are being flown in to provide security in the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Are Sierra Leone's problems on the way to being solved? Far from
it.
</P>
<P>
   The main stage in the struggle to put Sierra Leone together is
only now starting. And the main participants in this harsh struggle
seem to have little idea, and no joint idea, which way they should
be heading.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the immediate problem of reinforcement. Britain
has suggested raising the U.N. force to 13,000. But the U.N. needs
bigger numbers far less than it needs well-trained, well-equipped
soldiers with both the ability and the mandate to attack the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The British troops go some way towards this, but they are not
under U.N. control and their continued presence is far from
certain. A large U.N. force that can do little more than guard duty
is desperately vulnerable to further hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the crucial question of what the next step should
be. Will there be a return to last year's Lome peace agreement,
which gave the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels seats in the
cabinet and Sankoh the status of vice-president?
</P>
<P>
   The government may have to choose between tearing up the
agreement and finding another RUF leader to cut a deal with. If it
decides to tear the deal up, it will have to try to defeat the RUF,
presumably with U.N., and perhaps British, assistance.
</P>
<P>
   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government says the question is
``under review.'' Privately, it is looking to Britain to give a
lead. The British, fearing accusations of neo-colonialism, say it
is a matter for Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nation's special representative in Sierra Leone wants
a return to the Lome agreement. The United Nations in New York is
less sure, worried particularly by the agreement's amnesty for
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, whose officials drafted the Lome deal, and whose
presidential envoy to Africa, Jesse Jackson, pushed it through, are
also divided.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was quoted last week as comparing Sankoh to Nelson
Mandela. This week he was trying to sound more diplomatic. But
Richard Holbrooke, America's ambassador to the United Nations, has
described the RUF as ``a bunch of ragtag, machete-wielding
murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   The void in policy is filled, to an uncomfortable extent, by
Liberia's president, Charles Taylor. He and Sankoh met through
Libya's Muammar Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   As the leading warlord in Liberia's own brutal civil war, Taylor
helped launch Sankoh and the RUF from Liberia in 1991. Since then
he has supplied them with arms, in return for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   In Liberia's 1997 election, which marked the end of the civil
war, he terrorized people into voting for him. Now he is seeking
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Sierra Leone provides the opportunity to play
statesman, as when he secured the release last week of some of the
U.N. soldiers who had been taken hostage by the RUF two weeks ago.
He says the arrest of Sankoh on May 17 is a ``stumbling block'' in
the release of the remaining 250 or so hostages.
</P>
<P>
   By this he means that he will be extracting a price for their
freedom. He may want something for Liberia, such as aid or, some
say, a state visit to Washington. Or he may just want Sankoh set
free in order to keep him in play in Sierra Leone and to continue
taking his cut.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations, Britain, America and the Sierra Leonean
government all followed the same policy towards Liberia and the
RUF, Taylor could be taken on. But they are at odds.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia, which was founded by black Americans, looks to the
United States as Sierra Leone looks to Britain, the former colonial
ruler. And Jackson, together with other black Americans who are
influential in formulating American policy on Africa, are personal
friends of Taylor's.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the unlikely event of the outside world formulating a
single coordinated policy towards Sierra Leone and Liberia, other
fundamental problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   The country is wrecked and Kabbah's government does not look
remotely capable of rebuilding it. It is hard to find any
politicians or civil servants who are not on the take. Groups in
the army have rebelled, deserted, joined the rebels or just used
their guns to enrich themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All this has created the frustration that the RUF feeds off.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the state is on nobody's immediate list, but defeating
the rebels, and their influence, cannot be done without it. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Scorned and deeply frustrated, the peacemakers from
the U.N. Security Council boarded their flight home from Addis
Ababa at dusk on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Their Ethiopian hosts wasted no time. At around midnight the
following day, they began shelling Eritrean positions; at dawn
their troops moved forward.
</P>
<P>
   They came in waves, like ghosts from the battle of the Somme
transported to the parched Mereb Valley that forms the border
between Ethiopia and Eritrea. And, as at the Somme in 1916, they
were cut down in their thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethiopia's human-wave advance was more successful than
earlier invasions of the same kind. One of the crossing points was
not heavily defended by the Eritreans because it was not thought
reachable.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the Mereb River, south of Enda Simeon, the Ethiopians
had to march over mountains impassable to tanks and artillery. The
Eritreans, believing that the Ethiopians would not attempt this,
had only a few trenches and troops on their side of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours, the Ethiopians had broken through, capturing
nearly 500 Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopians also invaded in force across the frontier near
Shambiko, some 40 km (25 miles) to the west. This time they used
their newly acquired tanks, backed by Russian-built fighter-bombers
and helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   The Eritreans moved thousands of troops in an attempt to staunch
the breach. But by May 18 they had been forced to withdraw from
Barentu, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
   If the two prongs of the Ethiopian assault can join up on the
road from Barentu to Mendefera, they could swing eastwards,
climbing the mountains towards Eritrea's capital, Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea claimed to have killed or wounded 25,000 Ethiopians in
the first three days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from the military casualties, whatever they really
were, the renewed fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of
civilians who will now join the 13 million people in the Horn of
Africa facing starvation because of drought and war.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of an intermittently ferocious war, this could
be the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders, Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of Ethiopia,
and Issaias Afwerki, the president of Eritrea, seem determined to
slug it out.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see how they can return to the negotiating table
until one of them is near defeat _ and tens of thousands of their
young men dead on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. team, led by Richard Holbrooke, America's envoy to the
United Nations, applied intense pressure on both governments before
it left empty-handed. One member of the team said that the talks
had broken down long before diplomacy had run its course.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that political and economic factors, not least the
personal rivalry between the two leaders, were more important than
the original border dispute.
</P>
<P>
   When Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia in 1993, many
issues, including their future fiscal and trade relations, were not
defined but left to the good relationship between the two leaders.
The collapse of that friendship left a void.
</P>
<P>
   The war began as a clash over an obscure sliver of borderland.
The Eritreans went on the offensive, believing that the Ethiopian
government would collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopians quickly accepted a peace plan prepared by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), but Eritrea held back. Then,
last year, the Eritreans had a setback on the battlefield which
made them realize that their huge neighbor was far better able than
they to sustain a long war.
</P>
<P>
   They too signed the peace plan, but by then the Ethiopians were
no longer in the mood. They backed away from the plan, creating
technical problems that they said prevented them from accepting a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meles saw the war as a chance to establish his nationalist
credentials. A Tigrayan from the north, he was linked with the
Eritreans in the war against Mengistu Haile Mariam's dictatorship,
and had long been suspected of being Issaias's pawn. But the
normally fractious Ethiopians have now united around him, and his
party is likely to have done well at this week's election.
</P>
<P>
   When negotiations with the OAU broke down, it took the
unprecedented step of publishing an account of the failed talks. It
did not directly apportion blame, but its account showed that
Ethiopia had been the more obstructive.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side, however, has been prepared to go out of its way to
secure a peace. Both have used the truce to prepare for a
resumption of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has quadrupled its defense spending since the war began
to $467 million last year. After a similar increase, Eritrea spent
$236 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money went to weapons from Russia and Ukraine _
which explains why Russia has been reluctant to allow a U.N. arms
embargo to be imposed on the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia dropped its opposition this week, letting the
Security Council impose an embargo for one year, it is now late for
this to have much effect.
</P>
<P>
   In about five weeks' time, the annual rains should begin
flooding the Mereb River, making war impossible. By then, the
Ethiopians will have tried to reach Asmara and the Eritreans, who
are at their fiercest when cornered, will have done their best to
stop them. &QL;

<P>
   RAMALLAH _ In the worst bout of violence for several years,
thousands of Palestinians battled with the Israeli army on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   They were marking al-Nakba Day: the term Palestinians use for
the ``catastrophe'' of Israel's establishment and their
dispossession from most of Palestine. (Israel, on the other hand,
celebrated its Independence Day on May 10.)
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, five Palestinians were dead, including two
children run over by a Jewish settler, and hundreds were wounded
from army bullets, both real and rubber. On the other side, 15
Israeli soldiers had been injured, five from Palestinian gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   The al-Nakba anniversary always casts a sombre pall over
Palestinians, wherever they are. But this time, in the West Bank
and Gaza, the violence was fuelled by other causes.
</P>
<P>
   One was the passing of yet another unmet deadline: the May 13
target for reaching an Israeli-Palestinian ``framework agreement''
on borders, settlement, Jerusalem, refugees and water.
</P>
<P>
   However, an even more inflammatory issue was the Israeli
government's reluctance to release the 1,600 Palestinian political
prisoners still interned in Israeli jails, of whom 600 or so are
now on a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner issue highlights, for ordinary Palestinians, the
similarity between Ehud Barak's government and that of his
unlamented predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election last year, Barak has released about 400
prisoners, but always in niggardly batches.
</P>
<P>
   He has rejected advice from his own Shin Bet intelligence
service that the freeing of another 400 prisoners belonging to
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement _ including those with ``Jewish
blood on their hands'' _ would help the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without freeing the prisoners, there's no point talking about
peace,'' said a local Fatah leader, Marwan Barghouti, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Did Arafat encourage the protests that day? In a sense, yes. He
told Fatah leaders last week that the prisoners must be the
``central focus'' of the al-Nakba demonstrations and instructed his
negotiators to deal with no other issue in their talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat was almost certainly not behind the gunfights,
between Fatah activists, including members of the Palestinian
police force, and Israeli soldiers, that erupted in various parts
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was a sign of the temper of his people that he could
no longer prevent such battles. When one of his security chiefs
went to Ramallah on Monday to tell Fatah men to stop shooting, he
was met by a hail of bullets, and they were not aimed at the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that Arafat raises the heat in the
occupied territories when he wants to jolt Israel into coming some
way towards him in the negotiations. But domestic motives also play
a part.
</P>
<P>
   The release of a significant number of prisoners would do a
power of good to his declining stock in the West Bank and Gaza _
and nothing unites the Palestinians so strongly as the death of
``martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a high-risk game. If, after such sacrifices, prisoners
are not released, Palestinians will cast around for more culprits
than the Israelis alone. Some are already doing so.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the clashes, Arafat's chief negotiator, Yasser
Abed Rabbo, submitted his resignation. This, or so went his
official reason, was in protest against the back-channel talks
going on in Sweden between Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a quiet warning to Arafat not to sign any
declaration of principles that would dilute Palestinian claims on
East Jerusalem, the right of refugees to return and the release of
all political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo has always been loyal to his leader. The Fatah
activists who took to their guns are loyal to the cause but not,
unconditionally, to Arafat. Their message to him was that any deal
that is acceptable to Israel must also be acceptable to them.
</P>
<P>
   With the occupied territories ablaze, Barak transferred three
villages on the outskirts of Jerusalem to the Palestinian
Authority. It was a transfer from partial to full control that had
been on the negotiating table for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had told the Palestinian leader that the delay was due to
``domestic constraints'' within his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, Arafat answered him by unleashing a few constraints
of his own. &QL;

   PORT-AU-PRINCE _ ``Everything is finished for the Espace!''
shouted the men who drove up to Graciamax Jean's house in a
Port-au-Prince suburb at 2:30 one morning this month, before
opening fire at the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, a parliamentary candidate for the Espace de Concertation
(Space for Concord), a coalition of opposition parties, was lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, Claudy Myrthil, was kidnapped for 12 days
last month and beaten, before being freed in return for a promise
to stop campaigning. He is now hiding. And on May 9, a rural leader
of the coalition and his son were murdered.
</P>
<P>
   In several recent cases of political violence, including the
attack on Jean's house, the perpetrators have claimed to be from
the Lavalas Family, the political party of Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the predecessor and mentor of Haiti's current president, Rene
Preval.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that is true, violence against Lavalas's
opponents has mounted. There have been at least 15
politically-related murders, most of the victims being from the
opposition. Many opposition candidates have stopped campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigning is supposed to be for local and parliamentary
elections. These have been postponed five times since their
original date in November 1998. Haiti has had no parliament or
local officials for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The first set of elections _ there are two _ is now scheduled
for May 21. If the first lot is not held by June 12, a new
parliament cannot sit until January.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition accuses the government, and Lavalas, of trying to
delay these elections until a presidential vote in December, when
Aristide will run again. His popularity might boost other Lavalas
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the problems are logistical. Certainly,
registering 4 million-odd voters and 29,300 candidates is not easy
in a country as chaotic as Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it any help that in March the United States Senate,
prompted by Senator Jesse Helms, blocked funds for the elections,
after Haitian customs officers had seized a shipment of imported
rice from an American company in Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian authorities say the firm under-declared its
shipments; it denies doing so. The government's attitude is
suspicious, or at least unhelpful. It has repeatedly criticized
both the electoral council and its foreign helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Micheline Begin, the director of the local office of the
International Foundation for Election Systems, a Washington-based
group with much experience in Haiti, was declared persona non grata
this week by the government because she had accused Preval of being
unduly influenced by Lavalas. She left before she could be kicked
out.
</P>
<P>
   According to a foreign official, the electoral council is now
closer than ever to being ready, though it will have trouble
training ballot-box staff by May 21.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the last chance: leading opposition parties have
said they may withdraw altogether if voting is not held by then.
Yet even if the election is held, it will not look credible,
especially to Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Few may vote. In the last elections, in 1997, a turnout of less
than 5 percent set off the disputes that led to the current mess.
Foreign pressure on Haiti to hold a ballot soon is increasing. But
a dubious election could be just as bad as no election at all. &QL;

   ANNAPOLIS, MD. _ Is the high-tech party over, as Nasdaq bucks
and slides? Not if messing about in boats is anything to go by.
</P>
<P>
   Buying something that needs a rudder has always been an
indicator of economic confidence (few people need a boat to take
the children to school).
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, yachting and power-boating have taken
off in a big way, especially among the techies of the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   James Denn, executive editor of Boating Industry International
magazine, reports that total sales in the American recreational
boating market were up more than 19 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plushest yachts actually come from Germany. But
Sailing/Cruising World magazine still reckons that sailing-boat
production in North America increased by 16 percent from 1998 to
1999, with strong growth in the large (over 36-foot) boat sector.
</P>
<P>
   Boating-accessory sales are booming, too. Don Durant, the owner
of Club Nautique/Cruising Specialists, a San Francisco firm, has
seen fresh demand for his products at close hand. Since March 1999
``it's been almost straight uphill.''
</P>
<P>
   Are his customers mostly the IT crowd? ``And how! We're close to
Silicon Valley so we're seeing a huge increase in buyers with cash
as opposed to credit. Lots of people with bonuses, options,
founder's stock, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand miles away in Annapolis, Md., Rob Emmet, the
owner of Performance Yacht Systems, a boating-accessory e-business
set up in 1997, noticed demand from areas such as Silicon Valley
and the Northwest almost immediately. Orders came from the Seattle
area ``even before we advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology folk are not known for their love of natural light,
let alone the great outdoors. Boats seem to be an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of technology gurus such as Bill Gates
(Microsoft), Larry Ellison (Oracle) and Jim Clark (Netscape), all
owners of extremely sleek sail or power yachts, cannot be
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Durant says he saw a flow diagram published recently showing the
steps to going public. One of the steps was ``Order new yacht.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ When he was no more than a leading Islamic figure
and part-time opposition politician, Abdurrahman Wahid was known
for his sometimes bewildering changes of course. These rarely
disconcerted his admirers, one of whom compared him to a river.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from on high, he might have seemed to be meandering all
over the place. Go with the flow, however, and you would find he
was always moving in the same general direction.
</P>
<P>
   Even now that he is president, Wahid's maneuverings have proved
surprisingly effective at achieving difficult political ends.
</P>
<P>
   They have, however, so far failed to restore confidence in the
economy. And, as President Suharto found in 1998, when popular
unrest forced him to relinquish power after 32 years, economic
failure can topple seemingly stable Indonesian regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Wahid's seven-month-old government presides over an
Indonesia that is far from stable.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Jakarta's Chinatown was burned and looted with
the loss of hundreds of lives, precipitating Suharto's fall, the
city has again seen rioting. Far from the capital, fighting between
Muslims and Christians in the Molucca Islands erupted again this
week.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor is already on the way to independence, after deciding
last year to leave Indonesia, a decision met by a welter of
destruction. Elsewhere, notably in Aceh at one tip of the
straggling archipelago, and in Irian Jaya at the other,
secessionist sentiment remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   Under Suharto, there was no doubt about what, ultimately,
guaranteed national unity: it was the repressive might of the army.
Yet Wahid has made progress towards defusing the most serious
regional insurrection, in Aceh, while at the same time clipping the
army's wings.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva on May 12, his government signed a cease-fire
agreement with the Acehnese separatists. It is far from being a
lasting settlement, but much closer than seemed likely last year,
when Wahid first promised a referendum on the region's future, and
then changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He deceived nobody with his ``clarification'' that the vote
would merely be to ask the Acehnese whether they wanted to see
Islamic sharia law introduced.
</P>
<P>
   In another hopeful development this week, a court convicted 24
soldiers and one civilian for their part in a gruesome massacre in
Aceh last year.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists were quick to complain that the sentences _ up to
ten years in jail _ were far too lenient. But that the armed forces
have been submitted to civilian justice at all is a huge step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Even the army's former commander, General Wiranto, faced several
hours of questioning by prosecutors, also this week, about his role
in the debacle in East Timor. He then formally resigned his cabinet
position.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Wahid's apparent dithering _ he had earlier sacked
General Wiranto, only to soften this into a ``suspension'' _ has
been vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   All of this builds hopes that Indonesia may slowly confront and
come to terms with some of the abuses and excesses of the Suharto
years and the chaos that followed. Even Suharto himself no longer
appears certain to escape punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The river may wind its way to the sea in the end. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 525, OR CONTINUE TO 800) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Wahid's wiles work less well with investors. They
have three legitimate concerns: that the president knows little
about economic management, and cares less; that his economic
ministers are at loggerheads with each other and with him, adding
to the policy cacophony; and that his political aims are
interfering with economic policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   Worries on all three fronts helped to set off another alarming
slide in the currency's value this month.
</P>
<P>
   That the president is no economist would not matter if there
were clear leadership within his cabinet. But his chief economics
minister, Kwik Kian Gee, appears at odds with the president. He has
even said he would be ``ashamed'' to promote Indonesia to foreign
investors, as Wahid has done.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Kwik's position appears secure. The president has
sacked two other economics ministers for alleged corruption. Some
suspect their dismissals formed part of a deal to shore up
political support for Wahid in the diffuse coalition he heads. It
has not helped that he has appointed his unqualified brother to a
job in an important bank-restructuring agency.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has dragged the rupiah and the Jakarta stock market
down to levels last seen in October, when Wahid assumed the
presidency in a mood of some optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The lurch was arrested on May 17 by the announcement of an
agreement with the IMF. But even that was uncomfortably reminiscent
of two years ago, when successive IMF aid agreements failed to
prevent a slide into financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he may get away with in politics, Wahid needs to chart
a straight and steady course in economics _ and stick to it. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The manager of the biggest Nissan dealership in
Fukushima prefecture, about 200 miles (320 km) north of Tokyo, is
on edge. He barks commands to line up his troops as the great
boss's entourage is spotted coming down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no traditional Japanese occasion, full of bows and
elaborate protocol. The visitor, the man who runs Japan's
second-largest car company, is a Brazilian-born Frenchman, and he
prefers to get down to nitty-gritty questions about business.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ghosn used to be the chief operating officer of Renault,
France's biggest car company. He made his reputation as ``le cost
cutter,'' who paved the way for the French car manufacturer's
dramatic turnaround after he arrived there from the Michelin tire
company in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Renault came to the rescue of Nissan, investing Y643
billion ($5.4 billion) for a 37 percent stake in the Japanese
company.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ghosn is touring Japan to find out what has gone wrong with
Nissan in its home patch. He swept in to Koriyama for a quick tour
of the first showroom in Japan to sell Renault models alongside
Nissans.
</P>
<P>
   In his rapid-fire English, he quizzes the locals, through an
interpreter, on which cars are selling well and which not. He needs
the answer, fast.
</P>
<P>
   English is now the language of the company, at management level.
Ghosn is adding Japanese to the four languages he already speaks,
but he sticks to English to avoid misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   Through an interpreter, he holds a meeting with all the sales
and service staff, asking for their complaints and suggestions. It
works a treat, and he learns a lot. He is such a famous figure in
Japan that the local television stations turn up when he goes on
tour. So ``it's good for business too,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since last July, Ghosn's job has been to rescue Japan's ailing
car manufacturer; he is chief operating officer, but collects the
title of president after this summer's general meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With the title goes a heavy responsibility. Nissan's plight is
awful: losses in seven out of eight years, a domestic market share
that drifted to an all-time low of 19 percent last year, and a pile
of debt, totalling Y1.4 trillion, plus Y1.2 trillion in its
financing division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like mission impossible,'' he admits, ``but we are
on track to make profits in fiscal year 2000, ending next March. If
we don't do that, we won't be credible.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, Nissan was due to announce results for 1999, which
will probably be slightly better than the consensus forecast of an
operating profit of Y35 billion and a net loss of Y600 billion
after including provisions for closures and restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   A year hence, say analysts such as Steve Usher of Jardine
Fleming Securities in Tokyo, operating profits should reach around
Y100 billion-Y130 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn is confident that he can do better than expected in both
1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   How? He aims to hack away the number of suppliers and force them
to take price cuts to provide 60 percent of the Y1 trillion cost
savings needed to get into the black and earn a return on sales of
4.5 percent by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this amazingly bullish forecast is Ghosn's accumulated
experience. He came to Renault in 1996 when it was losing heavily.
Its strategy of merging with Volvo, to round out its product
portfolio, had foundered as Swedish shareholders revolted.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year he had closed three European factories, so that
booming sales from promising new models such as the Megane, Clio
and Twingo translated into profits rather than just unprofitable
sales.
</P>
<P>
   There was uproar when he closed one big assembly plant in
Belgium. While Louis Schweitzer, his boss, took the flak, Ghosn got
on with the hacking.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy paid off: within three years Renault went from
operating losses of FFr6 billion ($1.2 billion) in 1996, at the
depth of its troubles, to operating profits of FFr9.7 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn now has to do the same with Nissan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 375 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the two companies, on opposite sides of the globe,
were very similar before Ghosn got to them.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily bureaucratic, they were both staffed by former civil
servants, long on sophistication and short on hard-nosed knowledge
about how to make cars efficiently, and how to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, as in France, such people are resistant to change. But
Ghosn has a rough-and-ready strategy for dealing with this: he
ignores them.
</P>
<P>
   At Renault, he judged that things were so bad that, with the
support of Schweitzer, he could afford just to press ahead. So he
did.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressed by his Renault experience, Ghosn is likewise ignoring
internal opposition to his changes at Nissan. His view is that the
situation had become so desperate under the old regime that it had
lost all credibility, so he has carte blanche to sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   But he is no autocrat. When he arrived last July, he formed nine
cross-functional teams (CFTs) of middle managers to come up with
plans to transform the company.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kiyoaki Sawada, a senior finance manager leading
one team, these are not like ordinary project teams. ``We had those
before, but everybody just represented their department's
interest,'' he says. The new teams are different.
</P>
<P>
   The CFTs were a device that Ghosn first used in America to bring
about the merger of Michelin and another tire company, Uniroyal
Goodrich. He also installed them in Renault four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is hooked on the cross-functional approach, for several
reasons. It works in a crisis, he says, because people can
understand the need for rapid action. It makes people act outside
their specific areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most companies people make a specific contribution to the
company in their function,'' he says. ``But it is not expressed in
terms of profit, only in terms of performing their function
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Ghosn, who meets all the teams monthly, gets them to
focus on profit creation, which he reckons lies in the interstices
of different company functions. ``Profit is the most global aspect
of a business, and it is cross-functional.''
</P>
<P>
   The first product of the teams helped to form the basis of the
Nissan revival plan unveiled last October. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the land of lifetime employment (at least for many workers in
big companies), Ghosn shocked Japan by announcing the closure of
five factories employing over 16,000 people in Japan alone, cutting
capacity by 30 percent to bring it more into line with sales and
boosting utilization rates to around the 75-80 percent rates at
which car makers begin to make money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Already machinery is being moved out of the doomed plants into
those that will survive, and some workers have been transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Strong demand in the American market (and to a lesser extent in
Europe) means that production is actually running about 10 percent
higher than last year, so extra labor is needed in some other
Japanese factories.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn hopes to avoid actually sacking workers, which is
expensive in Japan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,500 WORDS) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of his plan _ to rationalize the Nissan and
Renault distribution and dealer networks in Europe _ has just been
announced, and aims to produce savings of about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn hopes to cut costs at Nissan's British plant, already
Europe's most efficient, by 30 percent, but thinks more pain is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, more fundamental changes are going
on. The two companies are pooling their businesses, moving towards
joint product development.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's biggest problem was that it has been making reliable
but boring cars, which customers shunned in favor of more
attractive Hondas (in Japan) or Volkswagens (in Europe).
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn ordered no fewer than 22 new models to appear by the end
of 2002. But beyond that, he is planning to build all Nissans and
Renaults on the same ten or so platforms, sharing the basic
floorpan that is the core of a car body and using a common range of
engines, gearboxes and other parts.
</P>
<P>
   The cars will look different, and the two separate brands will
be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   This process seems bound to lead to eventual merger, perhaps
within three years, to coincide with the French government's sale
of its 44 percent stake in Renault.
</P>
<P>
   The executive boards of both companies have considered merging
and decided that it must be the eventual goal, even though nobody
talks publicly about it. But before anything so drastic could
happen, Nissan must transform itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who no longer holds any position in Renault, could be
creating his next job opportunity, as head of the combined group. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's economy has been roaring along, with low
inflation, for so long now that any mention of speed limits and
overheating was becoming decidedly unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. In recent weeks, the signs that the economy is being
stretched beyond its limits have become unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Every measure of inflation has ticked up, particularly consumer
prices. Labor costs are accelerating. And productivity growth, the
elixir of the new economy, has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve's next policy-making
meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Will Alan Greenspan and his colleagues raise interest rates by
half a percentage point, abandoning their current strategy of
gradually tightening monetary policy in quarter-point increments?
</P>
<P>
   Most economists reckon that they will. The real issue, however,
is more fundamental. Is the extraordinary American expansion of the
1990s at risk of ending in the good old-fashioned way, with
spiralling inflation forcing a hard landing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question depends on three more questions. How
strong is today's inflationary pressure, and how quickly is it
likely to intensify? And will the economy slow down quickly enough
to dampen price pressure without tipping into recession?
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for inflationary pressure is now unambiguous.
Consumer prices rose 3.7 percent in the year to March. Even
excluding the volatile categories of oil and food, ``core''
consumer prices rose 2.4 percent, roughly one half of a percentage
point faster than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The GDP price deflator rose by 2.7 percent in the first three
months of 2000, up from 1.2 percent in the middle quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of March's nasty inflation surprise might be
``one-offs'': tobacco prices, for instance, were affected by a tax
increase in New York state. Nonetheless _ and modest as they may be
_ there are broad-based upward trends.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six months, prices of services _ from health care
to hotel rooms _ have risen at an annualized rate of 3.6 percent,
almost a percentage point faster than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   More important for longer-term price pressure, labor costs are
also rising. The employment-cost index, perhaps the most widely
watched gauge of wage pressure, rose 4.3 percent in the year to
March, its biggest jump for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Rising wages and higher benefit costs both fuelled the increase.
For workers in private industry, wages and salaries rose 4.2
percent in the year to March, while overall benefit costs were up
5.5 percent over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Health benefits, in particular, have risen sharply. In another
recent report, the Minneapolis Federal Reserve noted that
health-care costs in Minnesota were up 10-12 percent from a year
ago. The downward nudge that low benefit costs gave to wage figures
seems to be over.
</P>
<P>
   That America's super-stretched labor market is finally producing
accelerating wages is hardly a surprise. The unemployment rate fell
to 3.9 percent in April, the lowest level since 1970 and the lowest
peacetime level since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a brave economist who actually puts a number on
where the ``natural'' rate of unemployment might be today, it is
almost certainly higher than 3.9 percent. Nor does the tight labor
market show any signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the jump in employment was caused by the temporary
hiring of hundreds of workers for the U.S. Census. But even
excluding that, over 256,000 new jobs, on average, have been
created every month for the past six months. That is substantially
more than the already strong monthly average of 230,000 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 65 percent of Americans aged 16 and over are now
employed, a record high. And every measure of joblessness is at
record lows: unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics, for
instance, have hit their lowest level since records began.
</P>
<P>
   With a labor market this tight, wage pressure is likely to keep
building up. It may do so gradually, but it will be persistent. To
what extent higher wage pressure will fuel inflation depends on
productivity growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of 1999, productivity grew so fast that it
more than made up for rising wages. Unit labor costs actually fell.
</P>
<P>
   Recent evidence suggests that this trend may be reversing.
American workers output per hour rose by an annualized 2.4 percent
in the first three months of 2000, well below the 6.9 percent rate
of productivity growth in the final quarter of 1999. As a result,
unit labor costs rose 1.8 percent in the first three months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this is still a modest rise, well below the rate of
inflation. Compared with a year ago, unit labor costs have risen a
tiny 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And it is important not to exaggerate the impact of one
quarter's figures. Nonetheless, it seems that productivity growth
is slowing while employment costs are accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at Goldman Sachs expect unit labor costs to
accelerate to 3.2 percent by the end of the year. At those levels,
more inflationary pressure will be inevitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of a wage-price spiral, the labor market
needs to calm down. And in order for unemployment to rise a bit,
the economy clearly needs to cool off: not just to its sustainable
rate of growth, but quite possibly below that for a while. For only
if the economy grows below trend will unemployment begin to edge up
again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Again, accelerating productivity means that no one knows exactly
where America's sustainable growth rate now lies. But it is
certainly below the annualized 7.3 percent by which the economy
grew during the last three months of 1999, and below the 5.4
percent it grew in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible (but still highly uncertain) guess is that
America's sustainable rate of growth now lies between 3.5 percent
and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Can the economy slow to that level, and beyond, without a hard
landing? So far, it is hard to see much evidence of serious
slowdown. In many ways, the first quarter's GDP estimates
understate just how much demand has been booming.
</P>
<P>
   A huge trade deficit and drops in inventory dragged down overall
GDP growth, even though overall consumption grew by a staggering
8.3 percent at an annual rate, and investment in equipment and
software soared almost 24 percent, as companies stopped worrying
about Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   This rip-roaring rate is unlikely to continue. The post-Y2K
effect will not recur. And much of the consumption boom was
probably due to the exceptionally mild winter, which may have
induced people to spend more than they might normally have done.
</P>
<P>
   Some statistics are still strong: April sales of new houses were
firmer than expected. But retail sales unexpectedly fell in the
same month.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, given that exports are likely to rise in today's
more vibrant global economy, and that inventories will need to be
built up, GDP growth in the second quarter of 2000 could still be
well over 4 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a sustained slowdown, interest rates clearly need to
rise. But by how much?
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets have priced in a high probability of
short-term rates rising a full percentage point, to 7 percent, this
year. Some analysts expect an even more aggressive tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at J.P. Morgan, for instance, now forecast that the
federal funds rate will reach 7.25 percent by August, which implies
a total rise of 1.25 percent in only four months.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of rapid tightening may well not happen, but it is not
unprecedented. In 1994, Greenspan raised short-term interest rates
by 1.5 percent in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   Quite plausibly, rates could rise enough to slow down the
economy sufficiently without bringing on a calamity. But once a
boiler has started steaming, it is certainly hard to carry on
boosting it without blowing it up. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It is, by common consent, the most important trade
vote in Congress since the approval of the North American
Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it hardly looks that way. When the House of
Representatives decides, next week, whether to give China
most-favored-nation trading status on a permanent basis (PNTR, in
the jargon), very little will change.
</P>
<P>
   China will enter the World Trade Organization whatever happens.
And America is not being asked to cut its tariffs one jot.
</P>
<P>
   But this vote will dictate the terms under which the $100
billion trade between America and China is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   It will influence how far American companies will share in the
modernization of the Chinese economy that WTO membership is likely
to inspire.
</P>
<P>
   It will determine whether American negotiators are involved in
the final few discussions over the terms of China's WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
   And as if all that were not enough, the vote is one of the most
important national-security decisions for many years.
</P>
<P>
   If America and China are left at odds on trade, this will
bedevil resolution of other urgent problems _ over Taiwan and the
deployment of a missile-defense shield _ that need attention.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is a cliff-hanger. To pass or defeat the bill, 218
votes are needed. At the moment, neither side has them.
</P>
<P>
   On the most recent formal count by Congress Daily, 167 members
of Congress are in favor, 160 are against and 108 are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Informal, and more accurate, tallies suggest that both sides
have nearly 200 votes and the real pool of undecideds is nearer 40.
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, heavy votes in favor of the bill in both the House
Ways and Means Committee (34-4) and the Senate Finance Committee
(18-1) seem to have persuaded some of the waverers. But many are
still unsure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some support the bill on its merits, but worry about the
reaction of their constituents and so are taking time to screw up
the courage to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   David Dreier, one of the leading Republican supporters of the
bill, says he reckons that 150 members of his party will vote for
it. That is the number of Republicans who voted for annual renewal
of China's trade status last year.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow-Californian, Robert Matsui, who is organizing support
for the measure among Democrats, says he has over 60 votes lined up
and hopes to get nearer 70. If so, the bill would squeak through.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality the vote is so close that any calculations could
be easily overturned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   David Bonior, the bill's leading Democratic opponent, says that
two-thirds of his party will oppose it, 40 more than opposed the
annual renewal of the China trade bill last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The evenness of the contest is surprising. Considered in the
light of the usual (mercantilist) terms for judging trade deals,
the arguments in favor of the Chinese agreement look overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, China would cut average tariffs from 24 percent
to 9 percent by 2005; eliminate import quotas and licenses; open up
its retail market by allowing foreigners to set up wholly-owned
distribution and sales subsidiaries; allow minority foreign
ownership of telecoms companies and securities houses; and stop
discriminating against foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   In return, America would give up nothing but its ability to
impose unilateral trade sanctions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The forces of persuasion have been no less one-sided. For once,
no one can accuse President Bill Clinton of ignoring a
foreign-policy matter. He has set up a ``war room'' to rally
support for the bill, modelled on the one that oversaw the
relentless effort to win the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   He will meet face to face with all the undecided congressmen.
Last week, he gathered together virtually everyone who was anyone
in the conduct of foreign policy for the past quarter-century:
former presidents, former secretaries of state, former secretaries
of commerce, even a long serving former Senate leader, Mike
Mansfield, still sprightly at 97.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the opponents of the China bill staged a rally
starring no one more lustrous than Goldie Hawn, an even sprightlier
actress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Both John Sweeney, the head of the AFL-CIO, the main union
federation, and his opposite number at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, Tom Donohue, have promised to do whatever it takes to
swing the vote their way.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been as good as their word. The difference is that
business groups have outspent unions by about ten-to-one and have
inundated congressmen with visits and meetings in their own
districts. You cannot throw a brick in the Capitol these days
without hitting two or three business lobbyists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Hence the intriguing question: why, despite this overwhelming
preponderance of influence, money and argument, is the China vote
so close?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Republican opposition to the bill is driven by
political concerns over national security and human rights. The
Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have been giving
congressmen briefings that explain, in detail, how China is using
its export earnings to upgrade its weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a time of tension between China and Taiwan, and not
long after last year's revelations of Chinese spying in American
nuclear laboratories, the impact has been considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Several free-trading Republicans, who voted for annual renewal
of Chinese trade, have come out against PNTR on national-security
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, China's deteriorating record on human rights _
detailed in a recent report by the State Department _ has
galvanized a group of Republicans for whom moral and religious
questions trump business arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the main organizations of the religious right, such as
the Family Research Council, once run by Gary Bauer, are strongly
against trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger explanation for the persistent strength of the
opposition has nothing to do with the merits of the argument or
national debate at all.
</P>
<P>
   All politics, as a former Democratic speaker once said, is
local. Many Democratic congressmen, including some who accept the
intellectual arguments for PNTR, will still vote against it because
this is election year and they are relying on union members, rather
than businessmen, to support them in close races.
</P>
<P>
   The last time there was a comparable decision, over NAFTA in
1993, the free-traders won because some Democrats defied the unions
and voted along with Republicans in favor of the bill. The next
year, the Democrats lost control of the House for the first time in
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of argument or business money can change the power of
that example, or alter the fact that labor has made defeat of the
China bill its top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   So what, if anything, might change the debate in its final days?
One possibility is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sandy Levin, a
Democrat, and Doug Bereuter, a Republican, to set up what they call
a ``Helsinki-style'' commission, with members drawn from both
houses of Congress and from the administration, to report each year
on Chinese human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents condemn this as toothless, but it might give wavering
Democrats the fig leaf they need to vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   So might an unusual recent development: the emergence of a
number of dissident voices inside China supporting PNTR. (This is
significant because such voices are being heard for the first time:
most exiled Chinese dissidents in America have condemned the
proposal.)
</P>
<P>
   But the vote remains on a knife-edge. It will be won, or lost,
one congressman at a time. And, if it fails, the world will be left
to pick up the pieces. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Last year was a horrible year to be a farmer. Demand
for American agricultural products dried up in Asia while, in
Europe, consumers began to object to genetically-modified American
legumes and grains. But wheat corn and soybeans were still produced
in huge quantities at home.
</P>
<P>
   As prices tumbled, farmers watched their debt soar. Many
teetered on the edge of ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the end of the spring planting season finds farmers
in remarkably good shape. First, the warm weather has allowed them
to get well ahead, and about 80 percent of the corn is emerging
already.
</P>
<P>
   Second, according to a recent survey of Midwestern farmers by
the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, 50 percent of them are reporting
average or above-average income, up from 12 percent in the middle
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   More farmers say they are repaying their loans. And prices for
cropland are rising: in Minnesota, up 4 percent from the last
quarter; in Montana, up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If these glowing numbers were the result of some shift in
economic conditions, they might be cause for jubilation. But they
are not.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors are keeping doom at bay for many small farms. The
first is off-farm income: according to the Agriculture Department,
almost 90 percent of the total income of rancher or farmer
households now comes from outside earnings.
</P>
<P>
   And the second factor is federal aid. Last year, the federal
government paid out some $22 billion to farmers, up from $16
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 was supposed to wean farmers off
federal handouts. That act ended price supports for common crops
such as corn and wheat, encouraging farmers to switch instead to
more unusual plantings in response to market demand.
</P>
<P>
   But last year proved they were still relying on government money
in the form of emergency payments and loans, and this year will
probably prove it again.
</P>
<P>
   According to Neil Harl, an economist at Iowa State University,
agricultural exports will rise only marginally, to $50 billion,
this year; but farmers will still flood the market with wheat and
corn, assuming they will be helped out again by Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   A fair assumption. On April 13, Congress approved $7.1 billion
in extra help for farmers. This is, after all, an election year,
and most of that money will conveniently arrive in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers might find Congress less kind when the pressure to
win friends is over. ``I am much less convinced we can count on
that kind of largesse next year and down the road,'' says Harl.
</P>
<P>
   If the government scales back support, farmers will have to find
other ways of surviving. Some will look abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department estimates an increase of some $2
billion in agricultural exports if China joins the World Trade
Organization. That would perk up farmers. Yet China's arrival as a
proper trading partner may not be unalloyed good news.
</P>
<P>
   Harl thinks the Chinese will also use freer trade to acquire
more advanced technology, so that they can harvest bigger and
better crops. ``What we're going to watch closely is how rapidly
they can ramp up their own internal agriculture output to meet
their needs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious farmers will also be looking for new ways to add value

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Last year was a horrible year to be a farmer. Demand
for American agricultural products dried up in Asia while, in
Europe, consumers began to object to genetically-modified American
legumes and grains. But wheat corn and soybeans were still produced
in huge quantities at home.
</P>
<P>
   As prices tumbled, farmers watched their debt soar. Many
teetered on the edge of ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the end of the spring planting season finds farmers
in remarkably good shape. First, the warm weather has allowed them
to get well ahead, and about 80 percent of the corn is emerging
already.
</P>
<P>
   Second, according to a recent survey of Midwestern farmers by
the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, 50 percent of them are reporting
average or above-average income, up from 12 percent in the middle
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   More farmers say they are repaying their loans. And prices for
cropland are rising: in Minnesota, up 4 percent from the last
quarter; in Montana, up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If these glowing numbers were the result of some shift in
economic conditions, they might be cause for jubilation. But they
are not.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors are keeping doom at bay for many small farms. The
first is off-farm income: according to the Agriculture Department,
almost 90 percent of the total income of rancher or farmer
households now comes from outside earnings.
</P>
<P>
   And the second factor is federal aid. Last year, the federal
government paid out some $22 billion to farmers, up from $16
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 was supposed to wean farmers off
federal handouts. That act ended price supports for common crops
such as corn and wheat, encouraging farmers to switch instead to
more unusual plantings in response to market demand.
</P>
<P>
   But last year proved they were still relying on government money
in the form of emergency payments and loans, and this year will
probably prove it again.
</P>
<P>
   According to Neil Harl, an economist at Iowa State University,
agricultural exports will rise only marginally, to $50 billion,
this year; but farmers will still flood the market with wheat and
corn, assuming they will be helped out again by Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   A fair assumption. On April 13, Congress approved $7.1 billion
in extra help for farmers. This is, after all, an election year,
and most of that money will conveniently arrive in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers might find Congress less kind when the pressure to
win friends is over. ``I am much less convinced we can count on
that kind of largesse next year and down the road,'' says Harl.
</P>
<P>
   If the government scales back support, farmers will have to find
other ways of surviving. Some will look abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department estimates an increase of some $2
billion in agricultural exports if China joins the World Trade
Organization. That would perk up farmers. Yet China's arrival as a
proper trading partner may not be unalloyed good news.
</P>
<P>
   Harl thinks the Chinese will also use freer trade to acquire
more advanced technology, so that they can harvest bigger and
better crops. ``What we're going to watch closely is how rapidly
they can ramp up their own internal agriculture output to meet
their needs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious farmers will also be looking for new ways to add value
to their products. Many are tempted to join producer-owned
cooperatives, where farmers can make higher profits by pooling
resources and cutting out middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   But Cenex Harvest States, America's largest farmer-owned
cooperative, recently reported a 71 percent fall in earnings in the
first half of its fiscal year _ the result, it claimed, of high oil
prices and continued weakness in agricultural markets.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Never in the history of human wealth-creation has so
much been pocketed so quickly by so many.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now boasts 300 billionaires and 5 million
millionaires, with Silicon Valley adding 64 new millionaires every
day. Nine million Americans have household incomes above $100,000 a
year, up from just 2 million in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   If Great Britain was the first country to produce a mass middle
class, the United States is the first country to produce a mass
upper class.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when politicians think, as they must, of courting the rich,
their first thoughts often turn to the smooth-turfed watering holes
where the rich used to gather when there were fewer of them.
</P>
<P>
   Country clubs have traditionally been places where affluent,
white (mostly Protestant) Americans could get together to play
golf, drink, eat mediocre food and casually discuss business.
</P>
<P>
   Talking politics was never polite, but, come election time, the
members would line up behind Republican candidates, including that
consummate club member, George Bush, Sr.
</P>
<P>
   But George W. would be wise not to take this group for granted.
He may have solid country-club credentials and even a decent golf
swing, but America's country-club Republicans are not the
dependable political force they once were
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the country clubs have changed. Wealthy young
Americans are not queuing up to join as their fathers did; many
would rather spend what little spare time they have at a health
club.
</P>
<P>
   The faces of those who do join are more diverse. ``People like
me _ Jewish females _ can now join,'' says Jennifer Laszlo-Mizrahi,
a political strategist. And people like her vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But that misses the larger point: that America's economic elite,
wherever one may find them and whatever they may look like, have
become increasingly detached from the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The National journal, analyzing voting patterns in 100 of
America's wealthiest towns over the past five presidential
elections, found that the Democratic share of the vote increased
steadily from 25 percent in 1980 to 41 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bill Clinton carried 13 of the 17 richest congressional
districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy voters who would once have been country-club Republicans
are turning up in the Democratic Leadership Council, says Mrs.
Laszlo-Mizrahi. Indeed, Jesse Jackson has referred to the DLC, the
conservative wing of the Democratic Party, as the ``Democratic
Leisure Class.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are an increasing number of wealthy Americans defecting to
the Democrats? One reason, according to ``Bobos in Paradise,'' a
new book by David Brooks, a senior editor at the Weekly Standard,
is that the new rich feel more in sympathy with them.
</P>
<P>
   These nouveaux-millionaires, he writes, have found a way ``to be
both dippy hippies and multinational fat cats''; hence all those
hiking boots and biking shorts in the corridors of corporate power.
</P>
<P>
   In general, too, the Democratic Party scares the rich much less
than it used to. Bill Clinton's lasting contribution to the
political scene has been to convince voters that the Democrats are
no longer the party of redistribution, says Bill Kristol, the
editor of the Weekly Standard.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may disagree over how much credit Clinton deserves for
the boom, but most will concede that he has not messed it up.
``Their stock portfolios did better under Clinton than they did
under Reagan,'' says Mrs. Laszlo-Mizrahi.
</P>
<P>
   But the most powerful explanation for shifting country-club
allegiances lies with the Republican Party itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not your father's country club any more, and it's not
your father's Republican Party either,'' says Marshall Wittmann of
the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have let in a lot of people who would have been
blackballed at the country club. The party has become more Southern
(as the Democrats embraced civil rights), more working class (as
Ronald Reagan broadened the party's appeal) and more driven by
social issues (as abortion and gay rights energized the religious
right).
</P>
<P>
   Kristol notes that 1994 was the first election in which going to
church, rather than having wealth and flaunting it, was a better
indicator of whether or not someone would vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Country-club Republicans care about pocketbook issues, not
social crusades. They may snigger at a gay joke on the golf course,
but they would never ride a bus across the country to protest
against gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   They favor free trade (unless they work in an industry
threatened by cheap foreign imports), have faith in international
institutions and produce the required corporate guff in favor of
affirmative action. And they do not view government as the enemy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (50-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Pew Research Center for The People &AMP; The Press
found that 61 percent of moderate Republicans agreed with the
statement that ``government often does a better job than people
give it credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary 91 percent agreed that ``this country should do
whatever it takes to protect the environment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075 WORDS) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   These are all views at odds with the increasingly influential
blue-collar, populist wing of the Republican Party. As the National
journal noted in its assessment of party-hoppers, ``Culturally
speaking, the center of gravity in the party has shifted from the
country club to the stock-car track.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when rich Americans stick with the Republicans _ as most
still do _ the richest congressional districts produce some of the
only remaining moderate Republicans, says Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   He himself went on safari to the affluent Chicago suburb of
Winnetka to study this mysterious species, and concluded: ``To be
elected in Winnetka you have to demonstrate you are on the correct
side of the cultural divide that splits the GOP between the sane
moderates and the Bible-thumping crazies.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that Winnetka has been represented for 20 years by
John Porter, a Republican who is pro-choice, pro-gun-control and
has been endorsed by the Sierra Club. His replacement (for he is
now retiring, and the seat is hotly contested) may well be a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for George W. Bush and Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   Rich voters are more up for grabs in this election than they
have ever been. The candidates have until November to persuade them
to vote like country-club Republicans or country-club Democrats.
And to perfect their golf swing at the same time, with luck. &QL;

   The National journal, analyzing voting patterns in 100 of
America's wealthiest towns over the past five presidential
elections, found that the Democratic share of the vote increased
steadily from 25 percent in 1980 to 41 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bill Clinton carried 13 of the 17 richest congressional
districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy voters who would once have been country-club Republicans
are turning up in the Democratic Leadership Council, says Mrs.
Laszlo-Mizrahi. Indeed, Jesse Jackson has referred to the DLC, the
conservative wing of the Democratic Party, as the ``Democratic
Leisure Class.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are an increasing number of wealthy Americans defecting to
the Democrats? One reason, according to ``Bobos in Paradise,'' a
new book by David Brooks, a senior editor at the Weekly Standard,
is that the new rich feel more in sympathy with them.
</P>
<P>
   These nouveaux-millionaires, he writes, have found a way ``to be
both dippy hippies and multinational fat cats''; hence all those
hiking boots and biking shorts in the corridors of corporate power.
</P>
<P>
   In general, too, the Democratic Party scares the rich much less
than it used to. Bill Clinton's lasting contribution to the
political scene has been to convince voters that the Democrats are
no longer the party of redistribution, says Bill Kristol, the
editor of the Weekly Standard.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may disagree over how much credit Clinton deserves for
the boom, but most will concede that he has not messed it up.
``Their stock portfolios did better under Clinton than they did
under Reagan,'' says Mrs. Laszlo-Mizrahi.
</P>
<P>
   But the most powerful explanation for shifting country-club
allegiances lies with the Republican Party itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not your father's country club any more, and it's not
your father's Republican Party either,'' says Marshall Wittmann of
the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have let in a lot of people who would have been
blackballed at the country club. The party has become more Southern
(as the Democrats embraced civil rights), more working class (as
Ronald Reagan broadened the party's appeal) and more driven by
social issues (as abortion and gay rights energized the religious
right).
</P>
<P>
   Kristol notes that 1994 was the first election in which going to
church, rather than having wealth and flaunting it, was a better
indicator of whether or not someone would vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Country-club Republicans care about pocketbook issues, not
social crusades. They may snigger at a gay joke on the golf course,
but they would never ride a bus across the country to protest
against gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   They favor free trade (unless they work in an industry
threatened by cheap foreign imports), have faith in international
institutions and produce the required corporate guff in favor of
affirmative action. And they do not view government as the enemy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (50-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Pew Research Center for The People &AMP; The Press
found that 61 percent of moderate Republicans agreed with the
statement that ``government often does a better job than people
give it credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary 91 percent agreed that ``this country should do
whatever it takes to protect the environment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075 WORDS) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   These are all views at odds with the increasingly influential
blue-collar, populist wing of the Republican Party. As the National
journal noted in its assessment of party-hoppers, ``Culturally
speaking, the center of gravity in the party has shifted from the
country club to the stock-car track.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when rich Americans stick with the Republicans _ as most
still do _ the richest congressional districts produce some of the
only remaining moderate Republicans, says Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   He himself went on safari to the affluent Chicago suburb of
Winnetka to study this mysterious species, and concluded: ``To be
elected in Winnetka you have to demonstrate you are on the correct
side of the cultural divide that splits the GOP between the sane
moderates and the Bible-thumping crazies.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that Winnetka has been represented for 20 years by
John Porter, a Republican who is pro-choice, pro-gun-control and
has been endorsed by the Sierra Club. His replacement (for he is
now retiring, and the seat is hotly contested) may well be a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for George W. Bush and Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   Rich voters are more up for grabs in this election than they
have ever been. The candidates have until November to persuade them
to vote like country-club Republicans or country-club Democrats.
And to perfect their golf swing at the same time, with luck. &QL;

BROADWAY BARD?: KENNETH BRANAGH FILMS A SHAKESPEARE MUSICAL

Labour's Lost.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Believe it or not, his new musical version of Shakespeare's
``Love's Labour's Lost'' isn't an entirely new departure for the
acclaimed actor/director Kenneth Branagh.
 &HT;    ``I know I have this reputation as Mr. Serious,'' Branagh says.
``But few know I do have a musical background, which seems to have
fallen off my resume.''
 &HT;    In fact, one of his first professional jobs after graduating
from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art was in a London production
of the Gershwins' ``Lady Be Good.''
 &HT;    ``I was a waiter in the background chorus,'' Branagh recalls,
relaxing at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel. ``To tell you the
truth, it was the most fun I've ever had doing live theater. The
pressure was off _ all I had to do was pop up from behind a little
window with this huge tray of drinks.
 &HT;    ``Of course, the only hard part was praying I didn't drop
anything.''
 &HT;    ``Love's Labour's Lost'' is more demanding, calling on Branagh
and most of his cast _ including Nathan Lane, Matthew Lillard and
Alicia Silverstone _ to sing, dance and generally kick up their
heels in a complicated story of three aristocrats who vow to give
up women and devote their lives to scholarly study.
 &HT;    ``I admit that I was in a daffy mood when the concept came into
my mind,'' says Branagh, who also wrote the screenplay and
directed. ``I thought to myself, `OK, I've done ``Henry V'' (1989)
and ``Othello'' (1995) and ``Hamlet'' (1996) the straight way. Now
here is this obscure work by Shakespeare _ you know, the one play
in the entire Shakespearean canon that was not performed for maybe
200 years after his death.
 &HT;    ``It's a very funny vaudevillian comedy about a war of the
sexes,'' Branagh hastens to add, ``but it does have a rather
melancholy ending which left the audience unsatisfied. I said, `I
want to take all of the above and do it in a really different
manner.' I said, `I know! I'll do it as a '30s musical, full of
songs by Cole Porter and George Gershwin!''
 &HT;    ``At which point,'' he admits, ``I started having these
recurring nightmares where people screamed, `What the hell was he
thinking?' Or, quite simply, `Branagh has snapped. News at 11.'''
 &HT;    Part of his desire to do a musical stemmed from his role as a
crippled mad scientist in last summer's flop ``Wild Wild West.''
 &HT;    ``I was stuck in a wheelchair for that entire movie, playing
this deranged villain,'' Branagh says. ``Honestly, I felt this mass
amount of impotent rage at being so confined. It really did make me
angry at others for their mobility.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `What can I do that is the direct opposite of this
situation?''' he says. ``The only thing I could think of was that I
could sing and dance.'''
 &HT;    He had feared that the Porter and Gershwin estates would be wary
of lending their songs for so bizarre a project, but was pleasantly
surprised to find them helpful.
 &HT;    ``They were very cooperative. The songs cost money, but I got
them,'' Branagh says. ``I think both estates are just very
concerned in the way the songs are used. But they both told me,
based on the relationship I had with Shakespeare, they knew I would
use the songs with respect.''
 &HT;    The hardest part of the whole thing, the British actor says, was
writing a screenplay that would be accessible to modern audiences.
 &HT;    ``It was very painstaking, intricate work to find the right
balance,'' Branagh says. ``The hard part was deciding how quickly
or slowly you should come out of the song. Should I cut immediately
to dialogue? Or give people a moment to say, `Hey, they're not
singing anymore'?
 &HT;    ``Also, I didn't want to offer this thing up like a theater
piece,'' he adds. ``I didn't want each song to be a show-stopper,
with a pause as if I was waiting for an audience to applaud the
number.''
 &HT;    Casting was easier _ even the controversial choice of Alicia
Silverstone as the princess whose arrival destroys the men's serene
retreat.
 &HT;    Yes, Batgirl does the Bard. And a swimming-pool dance number, to
boot.
 &HT;    ``She will shock people,'' Branagh says. ``She turns in a great
performance. Alicia speaks as if she was a Shakespearean natural.
It's like she was born to do this work _ which you might find
unbelievable, but it's true.''
 &HT;    And she sings well enough that Branagh claims to be more worried
about his own contribution to the soundtrack, including a rendition
of the Gershwin classic ``They Can't Take That Away From Me.''
 &HT;    ``I just hope the audience doesn't stand to leave when I get up
to sing,'' he says.
 &HT;    In recent years, Branagh has made fewer of his own movies,
instead lending his acting services to films as diverse as Robert
Altman's ``The Gingerbread Man'' (1998), Woody Allen's
``Celebrity'' (1998) and ``Wild Wild West.'' Still, he says, his
heart is in filmmaking.
 &HT;    ``Most times I would rather direct, but only if the subject
matter is compelling for me,'' he says. ``I often feel like I must
direct this project or I can't do it at all. The whole thing
bubbles away at me for two or three years, until I'm just dying to
get behind that camera. I've made note after note. In my sleep,
when I'm awake _ I'm often just consumed with a movie.''
 &HT;    In his early career, every project Branagh touched seemed to be
charmed. Shortly after graduating from the Academy, he was accepted
into the Royal Shakespeare Company, for which he starred in ``Henry
V'' and ``Hamlet.'' He went on to form his own troupe, the
Renaissance Theater Company _ through which he met former wife Emma
Thompson _ and then to a triumphant film debut as director and star
of ``Henry V,'' a success that led to two more hits, ``Dead Again''
(1991) and ``Much Ado About Nothing'' (1993).
 &HT;    In 1994, however, he came a cropper with ``Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein.''
 &HT;    ``It taught me that I wasn't the golden boy,'' he says. ``I
could fumble.''
 &HT;    Thereafter Branagh lived through a series of ups and downs, with
successes such as ``Hamlet'' balanced by flops such as ``The
Gingerbread Man'' and ``The Theory of Flight'' (1998).
 &HT;    Offscreen he endured similar tumult, divorcing Thompson to take
up with Helena Bonham Carter, from whom he recently split. The
resulting tabloid frenzy was disconcerting to the privacy-loving
actor.
 &HT;    ``Being in the spotlight has made me feel very uncomfortable at
times,'' he admits. ``I've just wanted to do the work _ to act, to
direct, to be a creative person.
 &HT;    ``But understand that it's a learning process,'' he adds. ``I
was just a slip of a boy when I made `Henry V.' I was 27 when we
made the film, and no one sat me down and said, `Now, Kenneth, your
entire world is about to change.'
 &HT;    ``But what I'm most grateful for is that the fame buys me a
ticket into a room where I can pitch a movie like a Shakespearean
musical,'' he adds, more cheerfully. ``It's humbling when someone
hands me a check and says, `I believe in you.' It's humbling when a
movie opens, and someone writes me a letter saying it affected
their life.
 &HT;    ``At such moments I'm reminded of how these projects touch
people, and it's all worth it.''

 (Includes a color slide of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in a
scene from ``The X-Files.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before June 11. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As fans of ``The X-Files'' know perfectly well, there's no such
thing as the truth. Every answer raises two new questions, and
while the truth may be out there, it isn't likely to turn up in
here.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the recent weeks of rumor, speculation and downright
disinformation about the future of the show played out remarkably
like an episode from the series itself, right down to an earnest
performance by David Duchovny as ... well, in this case as himself.
</P>
<P>
   When Duchovny finally relented and agreed to one more go-round
on the show _ though he will appear in only about half of the next
season's episodes _ it resolved the matter of his status for the
moment, but left open as many questions as it answered.
</P>
<P>
   For example, is Duchovny really happy to be back?
</P>
<P>
   During the actor's very public feud with Fox over his return to
his role as Agent Mulder, he often cited creative staleness as one
of his reasons for wanting to leave the show. At the same time,
however, he kept insisting that he wasn't opposed to continuing to
play the character _ especially on the big screen, where his heart
clearly lies after his assured performance opposite Minnie Driver
in ``Return to Me'' (2000).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to choose good material,'' he says with a
shrug. ``Something that warrants four months of my life doing. If
it was an FBI agent and it was the best script I'd read in months,
I'd probably do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny is only the latest in a long string of television
actors to try their luck in the movies and, to judge by the
box-office failure of ``Playing God'' (1997) and the modest
receipts of ``Return to Me,'' he may find it difficult to make the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   But he brushes off the question with an annoyed wave of his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you see,'' he says with bemused patience, ``that's not
true _ if you look at it, it's such a terrible cliche. Clint
Eastwood, Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin _ try to name the actors that
didn't come out of television, it's much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason actors come out of TV is it's probably easier to
get work in TV when you're first starting out,'' he adds, ``and you
come out of TV and you do film work. Demi Moore started in a soap
opera _ soap opera is a lot worse than being in `The X-Files!'''
</P>
<P>
   The actor laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I would think that the odds of coming out of a soap opera
are pretty bad,'' he says, ``and you've got Demi Moore and Robin
Wright and all these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny won't even acknowledge the struggles of the two
highest-profile television defectors of recent years, ``E.R.'s''
George Clooney and ``NYPD Blue's'' David Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clooney's doing great,'' he says sternly. ``He's working with
David Russell, he's working with Soderbergh. David Caruso _ he's a
hero in my book, he could be making millions of dollars, but he
left (``NYPD Blue'') because he wasn't being treated well and it
wasn't creative for him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because he hasn't been in a hit movie doesn't mean he's
not a great actor,'' Duchovny insists. ``It's luck whether or not
you're going to be in a good movie, whether or not you're going to
be in a movie that makes money. It has nothing to do with TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' took a lot of heat, from both critics and fans,
when it shifted location from Vancouver to Los Angeles this past
season. The fans bemoaned the loss of spooky, misty locales, while
the critics perceived a loss of purpose, alleging that the series
had lost its impetus.
</P>
<P>
   Both factions overlooked the truth, which is that ``The
X-Files'' has always been patchy, in the great way that only truly
innovative, imaginative and risk-taking television can be.
</P>
<P>
   From the first season on, each episode of ``The X-Files'' has
had the potential either to seize the imagination of the viewer or
to fail miserably trying. This experimental unpredictability has
provided much of the show's edge. Fortunately, the failures have
been few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, ``The X-Files'' hit the nail on the head rather
consistently this season. Among a slew of killer-weirdo episodes,
there was the incredibly inspired ``Cops'' hybrid, a perfect
example of a television show delighting in the deconstruction of
its own myths, and also in its brilliant use of the new Los Angeles
location.
</P>
<P>
   That episode was scripted so cleverly that many viewers thought
that it was ad-libbed _ a suggestion which draws a laugh from
Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not at all,'' he says. ``Totally scripted.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny originally had been slated to direct that episode, but
it didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had too much other work,'' he says. ``To direct you
need to not be in the preceding episode, so you can do prepping,
and they just didn't write me out.''
</P>
<P>
   He did get to step behind the camera _ and behind the
typewriter, since he also scripted _ for the wild and risky episode
in which Mulder and Scully went to Hollywood and visited the set of
a movie based on their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   The episode featured Garry Shandling as ``Mulder'' and Tea
Leoni, Duchovny's real-life wife, as ``Scully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't need any direction,'' the actor says
enthusiastically. ``She was really phenomenal _ she'd do stuff that
I would never think of to tell her, and she's just really always
right, she's gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he's hesitant to say that he and Leoni, who last
year welcomed Madelaine West Duchovny to the family, will be
working together professionally in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objectively I'd like to work with her, because I think she's
so great,'' Duchovny says cautiously. ``Personally I would be a
little afraid to work with her, because I think it's a little icky
when you start using your relationship publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't married to her, she'd be the first person I would
want to work with,'' he says. ``Because I'm married to her, it's
just a little weird when you start using yourself in that way, or
your life or your relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny is usually as solemn offscreen as Mulder is onscreen,
but in the past few years ``The X-Files'' has offered occasional
glimpses of his dry sense of humor. In the Hollywood episode, for
example, Duchovny made fun of his resemblance to Richard Gere in
one of the series' funniest moments.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain resemblance, he admits, but he adds that fans
rarely mistake him for Gere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody thought I was a Baldwin brother the other day,'' he
says, laughing. ``It was funny, because he said, `I know your
brother, Danny,' and my brother's name is Danny. `He grew up on
Long Island and I grew up in New York.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I realized he meant Daniel Baldwin!''
</P>
<P>
   It's all very ``X-Files.'' A moment of insight _ but new
questions follow close on its heels: Does that make Duchovny Alec?
William? Stephen?
</P>
<P>
   Is it too soon to start speculating about whether the show will
be back after next year?
</P>

 (Includes a color slide of singer Neil Young.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Neil Young is on the outside, looking in. Literally.
 &HT;    Sporting a long, dark coat, a T-shirt and jeans, the singer has
stepped into a hallway at the stately Driskill Hotel in Austin,
Texas, to greet an interviewer, only to let the door to his room
shut behind him.
 &HT;    ``I left my key in there,'' he says, more bemused than sheepish.
 &HT;    Fortunately, there are a couple of couches in the hall, so Young
shrugs.
 &HT;    ``Let's just do it out here,'' he says, and sits down for an
interview.
 &HT;    It's a day off between tour dates for Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP;
Young in Charlotte, N.C., and in Pittsburgh, so Young has dropped
into Austin to premiere ``Silver &AMP; Gold,'' a concert DVD _ sharing
the name of his latest album _ that was filmed at Austin's Bass
Concert Hall during his 1999 solo tour.
 &HT;    Like many entries in Young's canon, ``Silver &AMP; Gold'' has a
history far more convoluted than the simple recording of an album.
It's another one of the periodic forays into gentler, acoustic
music that dot Young's catalog, alongside the roaring electric rock
of Crazy Horse and his ambitious, underrated detours into country,
blues and rockabilly.
 &HT;    It's an area that has also brought Young his greatest commercial
successes: ``After the Goldrush'' (1970) and ``Harvest'' (1972)
were multimillion-sellers, and the latter is Young's only album to
hit No. 1. ``Comes a Time'' (1978) also made its way into the Top
10, while ``Harvest Moon'' (1992) was another million-seller.
 &HT;    So wood and steel clearly suit the Toronto-born Young _ though
he says that has nothing to do with his decision to make this
particular album.
 &HT;    ``There's no real logic to it,'' says the 55-year-old Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame honoree _ twice, actually, once on his own and
once with his 1960s band Buffalo Springfield. ``I may make two
rock-'n'-roll albums in a row at some point, or I may do two soft
ones in a row. I may do some different kind of album that everybody
wonders what the hell I did that for. It just depends.
 &HT;    ``There's no plan,'' he says. ``I'm just going with the songs _
the songs dictate the direction. There's no way to tell where the
songs are going to come from and when, so there's no need for a
plan. I just wait.''
 &HT;    ``Silver &AMP; Gold'' began life in 1997, when Young returned to his
ranch near Woodside, Calif., after a tour with Crazy Horse. He had
a variety of projects to work on, including his long-planned
boxed-set retrospective and an extensive Buffalo Springfield
anthology, but he found himself drawn back into the studio.
 &HT;    ``I came back and recorded a couple of tunes that I had written
on the road,'' he recalls. ``I recorded them just solo acoustic,
and then I went on and recorded a bunch of tunes with the band over
time.
 &HT;    ``Every three months or so we'd get together and play a little
more,'' Young continues. ``I'd write a few more tunes and we'd do
them, and I'd do some old songs at the same time, just for feel and
so we had enough songs to do to make it worth it for everybody to
come.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I'd just throw those in to have something to do to
get warmed up with,'' he adds, ``and in this case we caught a
couple of them and we got masters on them, which was a big surprise
that they actually came to the party.''
 &HT;    Among those, Young says, was the first single, ``Razor Love,''
which was originally written for ``Trans'' (1982) but not used, and
the title track, which had long baffled him.
 &HT;    ```Silver &AMP; Gold' I recorded 11 times,'' he says, ``and didn't
like any of the recordings because, as soon as the band learned the
song, it sounded contrived. The song's so simple that once you
actually started playing parts _ `Wow, that's terrible.'
 &HT;    ``It's better if it's just simple,'' Young says. ``They're the
kind of songs that have to be performed in a way that is real _ you
have to deliver the song.''
 &HT;    There's a settled, calming nature to ``Silver &AMP; Gold.'' Its
songs are sweet, warm and even sentimental, celebrating romance,
family and friendships with an open, genial spirit.
 &HT;    It isn't the album Young set out to make, however, or even the
one he actually had finished when he hit the road to tour in 1999.
 &HT;    While he was working on the album, Young was also compiling the
Buffalo Springfield box set, and eventually he invited former
bandmate Stephen Stills out to the ranch to listen to the songs
with him. Stills played a song that he was working on for an new
album with David Crosby and Graham Nash, and ended up inviting
Young to join them in recording the number.
 &HT;    One thing led to another, and soon a full-fledged CSNY reunion
was up and running. For his contribution, Young offered up the
songs he'd recorded for ``Silver &AMP; Gold.''
 &HT;    ``I said, `Just take the ones you want, they're yours. Go ahead
and take the best ones that you think we can do the best job on,'''
he recalls.
 &HT;    By the time CSNY's ``Looking Forward'' was done, Young was short
four of his own album's original 14 tracks, but he says the end
result actually benefited ``Silver &AMP; Gold.''
 &HT;    ``I'd listened to `Silver &AMP; Gold' a bunch of times, and I could
never get the sequence right,'' he explains. ``It always seemed too
heavy to me. It was a revelation to me, after trying for a year to
sequence this thing in a way that would work right for me and never
feeling right about it, that I really received the perfect
combination by letting them take the cream of the crop, whatever
they wanted.
 &HT;    ``So it worked out great _ I'm ecstatic about it.''
 &HT;    Young did cut two additional tracks, ``The Great Divide'' and
``Buffalo Springfield Again.'' The latter is, perhaps, the most
attention-getting track on ``Silver &AMP; Gold.'' A pleasant, jaunty
tune _ ``kind of Sunday afternoon,'' Young calls it _ it's filled
with sentiments such as ``Like to see those guys again/and give it
a shot.''
 &HT;    So is he officially proposing a reunion? Young says no.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if the Springfield will ever play again,'' he
says. ``I played with Dewey Martin and Bruce Palmer a couple of
years ago, at my ranch for a couple of days. I wasn't playing much,
because that was right after I cut my finger _ I had a big
(bandage) on my finger, so I really couldn't play that much. But we
had fun, so anything's possible.''
 &HT;    As for CSNY, there too Young is reluctant to commit to anything
beyond the current tour.
 &HT;    ``We'll stop for a while,'' he says opaquely, ``and see what
we're going to do after that.''
 &HT;    Next on his agenda is bringing out the Buffalo Springfield boxed
set and possibly the first installment of an eight-CD set that will
track his solo career from 1969 to 1972.
 &HT;    As far as original music is concerned, however, he remains
vague.
 &HT;    ``Again, I don't really have an idea of what the next song I'm
going to write is about,'' he says. ``I don't ever know. I don't
try to know ...
 &HT;    ``I have a notebook in my room,'' he says. ``I have a guitar in
my room, I have a piano in my room. Everywhere I go, I like to have
musical instruments ... so I'm ready when something comes.''

TAKE 2: TURNER CLASSIC CAPTURES HOLLYWOOD HISTORY ON FILM

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of actor Jason Robards.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Sam Peckinpah, Fred Zinneman, Katharine Hepburn, Hank Fonda,
Lana Turner, Dalton Trumbo, Sergio Leone, Jason Robards Sr.,
Jonathan Demme. ``A Thousand Clowns,'' ``All the President's Men''
and ``Magnolia.''
 &HT;    The stars, movies and stories spill from Jason Robards' lips,
and there's no hiding his enthusiasm. For nearly an hour, the
77-year-old actor has sat and recounted his memories for an
ambitious archival project undertaken by Turner Classic Movies, the
cable channel that specializes in old-time Hollywood films.
 &HT;    Afterward, Robards warmly shakes hands with his interviewer,
producer Alexa Foreman, and steps into another room at the
Swissotel in Manhattan. Despite recent health scares, Robards
remains tall and strong, and the sparkle in his eyes is
undiminished.
 &HT;    ``I enjoyed that,'' he says. ``I hope I didn't talk too much
about myself. I still have no idea who I am, but maybe I'm the sum
of all the projects I've been in, the history of the movies and the
stage that I've been a part of. I'm probably a witness to history,
more than a part of it.
 &HT;    ``It's so funny to think I've devoted all of my life to the
stage and not done big movies I was offered because I wanted to do
a play instead,'' he adds. ``I like to think, `I'm a stage actor,'
but sitting here I realized I've done 60-odd films.
 &HT;    ``How the hell did I fit that in? I'm not that old that I could
have done 60 films.''
 &HT;    He managed, and even won back-to-back Oscars for supporting
performances in ``All the President's Men'' (1976) and ``Julia''
(1976).
 &HT;    ``Whether the films or plays turned out good or bad is really
not the point,'' Robards says. ``The point for me was to be a part
of what the author put down on paper, to help give life to it.
That's the true art of movies and stage, taking words and bringing
them to life.
 &HT;    ``It all begins with the words,'' he says. ``I've been
interested in words all of my life _ the words propel our business,
and I don't know if enough actors know that. The more they know it,
the better they are.''
 &HT;    Robards' interview is only the latest installment in the TCM
archives project, which since 1994 has included more than 200
people, among them such actors, directors and behind-the-scenes
people as Marge Champion, Cyd Charisse, Betty Comden, Stanley
Donen, Farley Granger, Garson Kanin, Lena Horne, Andre Previn, Rod
Steiger and Gloria Stuart.
 &HT;    ``Our goal is to preserve as much history of the motion-picture
industry as we can,'' Foreman says. ``By doing it on film the
people look good and sound good and, to me, it's better than an
oral history. You're able to see these people, their mannerisms,
gestures and expressions.
 &HT;    ``People love movies,'' she adds. ``and it's important to
remember how it all began. A number of the people who were there at
the time are dying, unfortunately, and that makes what we're doing
urgent.
 &HT;    ``Thank God for Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, who'd already
done their television documentaries and got most of the people from
the silent-film era,'' Foreman says. ``If we'd started our project
today, we'd have lost 15 percent of the people.''
 &HT;    Responsibility for lining up _ and, sometimes, locating _ the
interviewees falls to Darcy Hettrich, director of talent for TCM
and Turner Network Television.
 &HT;    ``Some of the names we all know, and they're still active and
still working,'' she says. ``But the obscure ones are tough.
Sometimes we get someone who comes in and has a great time _ we had
Ricardo Montalban and George Wells, who were both using walkers,
racing down the hall together _ and that someone puts us in touch
with two or three people we'd love to get. Or we'll follow a small
lead from an article. We'll call the writer and say, `Where did you
find so-and-so?'''
 &HT;    Foreman and Hettrich can't grab everybody, however. Among those
they'd most like to talk to _ but who have, for reasons obvious and
not so obvious, remained elusive _ are Kirk Douglas, Sue Mengers,
Nancy Reagan, Ray Stark, Billy Wilder and Elia Kazan.
 &HT;    While waiting patiently for those folks, Foreman and Hettrich
continue to corral a dozen or more people for two several-day
sessions held twice a year, once each in New York and in Los
Angeles. During one March weekend in New York, TCM trained its
camera on Robards, Budd Schulberg, Gwen Verdon, Jane Powell, Skitch
Henderson and others.
 &HT;    Verdon may be best known as a hoofer, a multiple Tony Award
winner who is also the former wife of the legendary choreographer
Bob Fosse, but she also appeared in the film version of ``Damn
Yankees'' (1958), in which she reprised her Broadway role as the
seductive demon Lola. She returned to the big screen 25 years later
for non-musical roles in ``The Cotton Club'' (1984), ``Cocoon''
(1985), ``Marvin's Room'' (1996) and the upcoming ``Walking Across
Egypt.''
 &HT;    ``I'd forgotten about some of the earlier things I'd done,''
Verdon says by telephone from her Long Island home, her voice still
bourbon over gravel. ``Actually, I remember the films, but I hadn't
thought about them or talked about them in years.
 &HT;    ``People still think of me as Lola,'' she says, ``and that's
part of the reason I was supposedly away so long. I took three
years off after my daughter was born, and then it took me a long
time to convince people that I could play older women, such as in
`Marvin's Room.'
 &HT;    ``As I say, they still think of me as Lola. I should probably
take that as a compliment, but it was also frustrating.''
 &HT;    Henderson, currently music director of the New York Pops, has
spent his life on television and the concert stage. Still, he has
some unique Hollywood memories to impart: As a young pianist in the
1930s, he worked with Charlie Chaplin, and served as a rehearsal
accompanist for Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and for Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers.
 &HT;    ``I was just a beginner,'' Henderson, now 82, says by telephone
from his Manhattan apartment. ``I didn't get any star billing, I
wasn't to be photographed or talked about. But that period was my
education _ Hollywood was my high school and college.
 &HT;    ``I remember walking onto a sound stage for the first time and
hearing Max Steiner conducting an orchestra at Warner Bros.,'' the
conductor says. ``I remember first playing in an orchestra on a
sound stage at MGM. I was a rehearsal pianist and generally didn't
play with the orchestra _ I worked individually with people.
 &HT;    ``If it hadn't been for World War II,'' he adds, ``I probably
would have made it for a while, then disappeared like everybody
else. But I wouldn't change a thing _ I learned a lot in Hollywood
and now, being at Carnegie Hall, I've got my Valhalla.''
 &HT;    Like almost everyone who has stepped before the camera for TCM's
archival project, Henderson considers it an effort of great
importance.
 &HT;    ``Somebody has to take care of the history,'' he says,
``because, if nobody does, it will all disappear downstream. I'm
astounded that so many people have no concept of what this world
was like. Rock 'n' roll killed the music, and television killed the
film business. Between the rock 'n' roll and television, it was a
hell of a blow to all of us.
 &HT;    ``So I'm thrilled that someone is taking the time to look back
and get on the record what happened so many years ago.''

BROADWAY BARD?: KENNETH BRANAGH FILMS A SHAKESPEARE MUSICAL 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Kenneth Branagh with Matthew Lillard,
Alessandro Nivola and Adrian Lester in a scene from ``Love's
Labour's Lost.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Believe it or not, his new musical version of Shakespeare's
``Love's Labour's Lost'' isn't an entirely new departure for the
acclaimed actor/director Kenneth Branagh.
 &HT;    ``I know I have this reputation as Mr. Serious,'' Branagh says.
``But few know I do have a musical background, which seems to have
fallen off my resume.''
 &HT;    In fact, one of his first professional jobs after graduating
from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art was in a London production
of the Gershwins' ``Lady Be Good.''
 &HT;    ``I was a waiter in the background chorus,'' Branagh recalls,
relaxing at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel. ``To tell you the
truth, it was the most fun I've ever had doing live theater. The
pressure was off _ all I had to do was pop up from behind a little
window with this huge tray of drinks.
 &HT;    ``Of course, the only hard part was praying I didn't drop
anything.''
 &HT;    ``Love's Labour's Lost'' is more demanding, calling on Branagh
and most of his cast _ including Nathan Lane, Matthew Lillard and
Alicia Silverstone _ to sing, dance and generally kick up their
heels in a complicated story of three aristocrats who vow to give
up women and devote their lives to scholarly study.
 &HT;    ``I admit that I was in a daffy mood when the concept came into
my mind,'' says Branagh, who also wrote the screenplay and
directed. ``I thought to myself, `OK, I've done ``Henry V'' (1989)
and ``Othello'' (1995) and ``Hamlet'' (1996) the straight way. Now
here is this obscure work by Shakespeare _ you know, the one play
in the entire Shakespearean canon that was not performed for maybe
200 years after his death.
 &HT;    ``It's a very funny vaudevillian comedy about a war of the
sexes,'' Branagh hastens to add, ``but it does have a rather
melancholy ending which left the audience unsatisfied. I said, `I
want to take all of the above and do it in a really different
manner.' I said, `I know! I'll do it as a '30s musical, full of
songs by Cole Porter and George Gershwin!''
 &HT;    ``At which point,'' he admits, ``I started having these
recurring nightmares where people screamed, `What the hell was he
thinking?' Or, quite simply, `Branagh has snapped. News at 11.'''
 &HT;    Part of his desire to do a musical stemmed from his role as a
crippled mad scientist in last summer's flop ``Wild Wild West.''
 &HT;    ``I was stuck in a wheelchair for that entire movie, playing
this deranged villain,'' Branagh says. ``Honestly, I felt this mass
amount of impotent rage at being so confined. It really did make me
angry at others for their mobility.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `What can I do that is the direct opposite of this
situation?''' he says. ``The only thing I could think of was that I
could sing and dance.'''
 &HT;    He had feared that the Porter and Gershwin estates would be wary
of lending their songs for so bizarre a project, but was pleasantly
surprised to find them helpful.
 &HT;    ``They were very cooperative. The songs cost money, but I got
them,'' Branagh says. ``I think both estates are just very
concerned in the way the songs are used. But they both told me,
based on the relationship I had with Shakespeare, they knew I would
use the songs with respect.''
 &HT;    The hardest part of the whole thing, the British actor says, was
writing a screenplay that would be accessible to modern audiences.
 &HT;    ``It was very painstaking, intricate work to find the right
balance,'' Branagh says. ``The hard part was deciding how quickly
or slowly you should come out of the song. Should I cut immediately
to dialogue? Or give people a moment to say, `Hey, they're not
singing anymore'?
 &HT;    ``Also, I didn't want to offer this thing up like a theater
piece,'' he adds. ``I didn't want each song to be a show-stopper,
with a pause as if I was waiting for an audience to applaud the
number.''
 &HT;    Casting was easier _ even the controversial choice of Alicia
Silverstone as the princess whose arrival destroys the men's serene
retreat.
 &HT;    Yes, Batgirl does the Bard. And a swimming-pool dance number, to
boot.
 &HT;    ``She will shock people,'' Branagh says. ``She turns in a great
performance. Alicia speaks as if she was a Shakespearean natural.
It's like she was born to do this work _ which you might find
unbelievable, but it's true.''
 &HT;    And she sings well enough that Branagh claims to be more worried
about his own contribution to the soundtrack, including a rendition
of the Gershwin classic ``They Can't Take That Away From Me.''
 &HT;    ``I just hope the audience doesn't stand to leave when I get up
to sing,'' he says.
 &HT;    In recent years, Branagh has made fewer of his own movies,
instead lending his acting services to films as diverse as Robert
Altman's ``The Gingerbread Man'' (1998), Woody Allen's
``Celebrity'' (1998) and ``Wild Wild West.'' Still, he says, his
heart is in filmmaking.
 &HT;    ``Most times I would rather direct, but only if the subject
matter is compelling for me,'' he says. ``I often feel like I must
direct this project or I can't do it at all. The whole thing
bubbles away at me for two or three years, until I'm just dying to
get behind that camera. I've made note after note. In my sleep,
when I'm awake _ I'm often just consumed with a movie.''
 &HT;    In his early career, every project Branagh touched seemed to be
charmed. Shortly after graduating from the Academy, he was accepted
into the Royal Shakespeare Company, for which he starred in ``Henry
V'' and ``Hamlet.'' He went on to form his own troupe, the
Renaissance Theater Company _ through which he met former wife Emma
Thompson _ and then to a triumphant film debut as director and star
of ``Henry V,'' a success that led to two more hits, ``Dead Again''
(1991) and ``Much Ado About Nothing'' (1993).
 &HT;    In 1994, however, he came a cropper with ``Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein.''
 &HT;    ``It taught me that I wasn't the golden boy,'' he says. ``I
could fumble.''
 &HT;    Thereafter Branagh lived through a series of ups and downs, with
successes such as ``Hamlet'' balanced by flops such as ``The
Gingerbread Man'' and ``The Theory of Flight'' (1998).
 &HT;    Offscreen he endured similar tumult, divorcing Thompson to take
up with Helena Bonham Carter, from whom he recently split. The
resulting tabloid frenzy was disconcerting to the privacy-loving
actor.
 &HT;    ``Being in the spotlight has made me feel very uncomfortable at
times,'' he admits. ``I've just wanted to do the work _ to act, to
direct, to be a creative person.
 &HT;    ``But understand that it's a learning process,'' he adds. ``I
was just a slip of a boy when I made `Henry V.' I was 27 when we
made the film, and no one sat me down and said, `Now, Kenneth, your
entire world is about to change.'
 &HT;    ``But what I'm most grateful for is that the fame buys me a
ticket into a room where I can pitch a movie like a Shakespearean
musical,'' he adds, more cheerfully. ``It's humbling when someone
hands me a check and says, `I believe in you.' It's humbling when a
movie opens, and someone writes me a letter saying it affected
their life.
 &HT;    ``At such moments I'm reminded of how these projects touch
people, and it's all worth it.''

 (Includes a color slide of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in a
scene from ``The X-Files.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before June 11. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As fans of ``The X-Files'' know perfectly well, there's no such
thing as the truth. Every answer raises two new questions, and
while the truth may be out there, it isn't likely to turn up in
here.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the recent weeks of rumor, speculation and downright
disinformation about the future of the show played out remarkably
like an episode from the series itself, right down to an earnest
performance by David Duchovny as ... well, in this case as himself.
</P>
<P>
   When Duchovny finally relented and agreed to one more go-round
on the show _ though he will appear in only about half of the next
season's episodes _ it resolved the matter of his status for the
moment, but left open as many questions as it answered.
</P>
<P>
   For example, is Duchovny really happy to be back?
</P>
<P>
   During the actor's very public feud with Fox over his return to
his role as Agent Mulder, he often cited creative staleness as one
of his reasons for wanting to leave the show. At the same time,
however, he kept insisting that he wasn't opposed to continuing to
play the character _ especially on the big screen, where his heart
clearly lies after his assured performance opposite Minnie Driver
in ``Return to Me'' (2000).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to choose good material,'' he says with a
shrug. ``Something that warrants four months of my life doing. If
it was an FBI agent and it was the best script I'd read in months,
I'd probably do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny is only the latest in a long string of television
actors to try their luck in the movies and, to judge by the
box-office failure of ``Playing God'' (1997) and the modest
receipts of ``Return to Me,'' he may find it difficult to make the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   But he brushes off the question with an annoyed wave of his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you see,'' he says with bemused patience, ``that's not
true _ if you look at it, it's such a terrible cliche. Clint
Eastwood, Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin _ try to name the actors that
didn't come out of television, it's much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason actors come out of TV is it's probably easier to
get work in TV when you're first starting out,'' he adds, ``and you
come out of TV and you do film work. Demi Moore started in a soap
opera _ soap opera is a lot worse than being in `The X-Files!'''
</P>
<P>
   The actor laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I would think that the odds of coming out of a soap opera
are pretty bad,'' he says, ``and you've got Demi Moore and Robin
Wright and all these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny won't even acknowledge the struggles of the two
highest-profile television defectors of recent years, ``E.R.'s''
George Clooney and ``NYPD Blue's'' David Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clooney's doing great,'' he says sternly. ``He's working with
David Russell, he's working with Soderbergh. David Caruso _ he's a
hero in my book, he could be making millions of dollars, but he
left (``NYPD Blue'') because he wasn't being treated well and it
wasn't creative for him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because he hasn't been in a hit movie doesn't mean he's
not a great actor,'' Duchovny insists. ``It's luck whether or not
you're going to be in a good movie, whether or not you're going to
be in a movie that makes money. It has nothing to do with TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' took a lot of heat, from both critics and fans,
when it shifted location from Vancouver to Los Angeles this past
season. The fans bemoaned the loss of spooky, misty locales, while
the critics perceived a loss of purpose, alleging that the series
had lost its impetus.
</P>
<P>
   Both factions overlooked the truth, which is that ``The
X-Files'' has always been patchy, in the great way that only truly
innovative, imaginative and risk-taking television can be.
</P>
<P>
   From the first season on, each episode of ``The X-Files'' has
had the potential either to seize the imagination of the viewer or
to fail miserably trying. This experimental unpredictability has
provided much of the show's edge. Fortunately, the failures have
been few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, ``The X-Files'' hit the nail on the head rather
consistently this season. Among a slew of killer-weirdo episodes,
there was the incredibly inspired ``Cops'' hybrid, a perfect
example of a television show delighting in the deconstruction of
its own myths, and also in its brilliant use of the new Los Angeles
location.
</P>
<P>
   That episode was scripted so cleverly that many viewers thought
that it was ad-libbed _ a suggestion which draws a laugh from
Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not at all,'' he says. ``Totally scripted.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny originally had been slated to direct that episode, but
it didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had too much other work,'' he says. ``To direct you
need to not be in the preceding episode, so you can do prepping,
and they just didn't write me out.''
</P>
<P>
   He did get to step behind the camera _ and behind the
typewriter, since he also scripted _ for the wild and risky episode
in which Mulder and Scully went to Hollywood and visited the set of
a movie based on their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   The episode featured Garry Shandling as ``Mulder'' and Tea
Leoni, Duchovny's real-life wife, as ``Scully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't need any direction,'' the actor says
enthusiastically. ``She was really phenomenal _ she'd do stuff that
I would never think of to tell her, and she's just really always
right, she's gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he's hesitant to say that he and Leoni, who last
year welcomed Madelaine West Duchovny to the family, will be
working together professionally in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objectively I'd like to work with her, because I think she's
so great,'' Duchovny says cautiously. ``Personally I would be a
little afraid to work with her, because I think it's a little icky
when you start using your relationship publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't married to her, she'd be the first person I would
want to work with,'' he says. ``Because I'm married to her, it's
just a little weird when you start using yourself in that way, or
your life or your relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny is usually as solemn offscreen as Mulder is onscreen,
but in the past few years ``The X-Files'' has offered occasional
glimpses of his dry sense of humor. In the Hollywood episode, for
example, Duchovny made fun of his resemblance to Richard Gere in
one of the series' funniest moments.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain resemblance, he admits, but he adds that fans
rarely mistake him for Gere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody thought I was a Baldwin brother the other day,'' he
says, laughing. ``It was funny, because he said, `I know your
brother, Danny,' and my brother's name is Danny. `He grew up on
Long Island and I grew up in New York.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I realized he meant Daniel Baldwin!''
</P>
<P>
   It's all very ``X-Files.'' A moment of insight _ but new
questions follow close on its heels: Does that make Duchovny Alec?
William? Stephen?
</P>
<P>
   Is it too soon to start speculating about whether the show will
be back after next year?
</P>

FOREVER YOUNG: NEIL YOUNG REVISITS HIS PAST WITH AN EYE ON THE
FUTURE

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer Neil Young.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Neil Young is on the outside, looking in. Literally.
 &HT;    Sporting a long, dark coat, a T-shirt and jeans, the singer has
stepped into a hallway at the stately Driskill Hotel in Austin,
Texas, to greet an interviewer, only to let the door to his room
shut behind him.
 &HT;    ``I left my key in there,'' he says, more bemused than sheepish.
 &HT;    Fortunately, there are a couple of couches in the hall, so Young
shrugs.
 &HT;    ``Let's just do it out here,'' he says, and sits down for an
interview.
 &HT;    It's a day off between tour dates for Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP;
Young in Charlotte, N.C., and in Pittsburgh, so Young has dropped
into Austin to premiere ``Silver &AMP; Gold,'' a concert DVD _ sharing
the name of his latest album _ that was filmed at Austin's Bass
Concert Hall during his 1999 solo tour.
 &HT;    Like many entries in Young's canon, ``Silver &AMP; Gold'' has a
history far more convoluted than the simple recording of an album.
It's another one of the periodic forays into gentler, acoustic
music that dot Young's catalog, alongside the roaring electric rock
of Crazy Horse and his ambitious, underrated detours into country,
blues and rockabilly.
 &HT;    It's an area that has also brought Young his greatest commercial
successes: ``After the Goldrush'' (1970) and ``Harvest'' (1972)
were multimillion-sellers, and the latter is Young's only album to
hit No. 1. ``Comes a Time'' (1978) also made its way into the Top
10, while ``Harvest Moon'' (1992) was another million-seller.
 &HT;    So wood and steel clearly suit the Toronto-born Young _ though
he says that has nothing to do with his decision to make this
particular album.
 &HT;    ``There's no real logic to it,'' says the 55-year-old Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame honoree _ twice, actually, once on his own and
once with his 1960s band Buffalo Springfield. ``I may make two
rock-'n'-roll albums in a row at some point, or I may do two soft
ones in a row. I may do some different kind of album that everybody
wonders what the hell I did that for. It just depends.
 &HT;    ``There's no plan,'' he says. ``I'm just going with the songs _
the songs dictate the direction. There's no way to tell where the
songs are going to come from and when, so there's no need for a
plan. I just wait.''
 &HT;    ``Silver &AMP; Gold'' began life in 1997, when Young returned to his
ranch near Woodside, Calif., after a tour with Crazy Horse. He had
a variety of projects to work on, including his long-planned
boxed-set retrospective and an extensive Buffalo Springfield
anthology, but he found himself drawn back into the studio.
 &HT;    ``I came back and recorded a couple of tunes that I had written
on the road,'' he recalls. ``I recorded them just solo acoustic,
and then I went on and recorded a bunch of tunes with the band over
time.
 &HT;    ``Every three months or so we'd get together and play a little
more,'' Young continues. ``I'd write a few more tunes and we'd do
them, and I'd do some old songs at the same time, just for feel and
so we had enough songs to do to make it worth it for everybody to
come.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I'd just throw those in to have something to do to
get warmed up with,'' he adds, ``and in this case we caught a
couple of them and we got masters on them, which was a big surprise
that they actually came to the party.''
 &HT;    Among those, Young says, was the first single, ``Razor Love,''
which was originally written for ``Trans'' (1982) but not used, and
the title track, which had long baffled him.
 &HT;    ```Silver &AMP; Gold' I recorded 11 times,'' he says, ``and didn't
like any of the recordings because, as soon as the band learned the
song, it sounded contrived. The song's so simple that once you
actually started playing parts _ `Wow, that's terrible.'
 &HT;    ``It's better if it's just simple,'' Young says. ``They're the
kind of songs that have to be performed in a way that is real _ you
have to deliver the song.''
 &HT;    There's a settled, calming nature to ``Silver &AMP; Gold.'' Its
songs are sweet, warm and even sentimental, celebrating romance,
family and friendships with an open, genial spirit.
 &HT;    It isn't the album Young set out to make, however, or even the
one he actually had finished when he hit the road to tour in 1999.
 &HT;    While he was working on the album, Young was also compiling the
Buffalo Springfield box set, and eventually he invited former
bandmate Stephen Stills out to the ranch to listen to the songs
with him. Stills played a song that he was working on for an new
album with David Crosby and Graham Nash, and ended up inviting
Young to join them in recording the number.
 &HT;    One thing led to another, and soon a full-fledged CSNY reunion
was up and running. For his contribution, Young offered up the
songs he'd recorded for ``Silver &AMP; Gold.''
 &HT;    ``I said, `Just take the ones you want, they're yours. Go ahead
and take the best ones that you think we can do the best job on,'''
he recalls.
 &HT;    By the time CSNY's ``Looking Forward'' was done, Young was short
four of his own album's original 14 tracks, but he says the end
result actually benefited ``Silver &AMP; Gold.''
 &HT;    ``I'd listened to `Silver &AMP; Gold' a bunch of times, and I could
never get the sequence right,'' he explains. ``It always seemed too
heavy to me. It was a revelation to me, after trying for a year to
sequence this thing in a way that would work right for me and never
feeling right about it, that I really received the perfect
combination by letting them take the cream of the crop, whatever
they wanted.
 &HT;    ``So it worked out great _ I'm ecstatic about it.''
 &HT;    Young did cut two additional tracks, ``The Great Divide'' and
``Buffalo Springfield Again.'' The latter is, perhaps, the most
attention-getting track on ``Silver &AMP; Gold.'' A pleasant, jaunty
tune _ ``kind of Sunday afternoon,'' Young calls it _ it's filled
with sentiments such as ``Like to see those guys again/and give it
a shot.''
 &HT;    So is he officially proposing a reunion? Young says no.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if the Springfield will ever play again,'' he
says. ``I played with Dewey Martin and Bruce Palmer a couple of
years ago, at my ranch for a couple of days. I wasn't playing much,
because that was right after I cut my finger _ I had a big
(bandage) on my finger, so I really couldn't play that much. But we
had fun, so anything's possible.''
 &HT;    As for CSNY, there too Young is reluctant to commit to anything
beyond the current tour.
 &HT;    ``We'll stop for a while,'' he says opaquely, ``and see what
we're going to do after that.''
 &HT;    Next on his agenda is bringing out the Buffalo Springfield boxed
set and possibly the first installment of an eight-CD set that will
track his solo career from 1969 to 1972.
 &HT;    As far as original music is concerned, however, he remains
vague.
 &HT;    ``Again, I don't really have an idea of what the next song I'm
going to write is about,'' he says. ``I don't ever know. I don't
try to know ...
 &HT;    ``I have a notebook in my room,'' he says. ``I have a guitar in
my room, I have a piano in my room. Everywhere I go, I like to have
musical instruments ... so I'm ready when something comes.''

TAKE 2: TURNER CLASSIC CAPTURES HOLLYWOOD HISTORY ON FILM

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of actor Jason Robards.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Sam Peckinpah, Fred Zinneman, Katharine Hepburn, Hank Fonda,
Lana Turner, Dalton Trumbo, Sergio Leone, Jason Robards Sr.,
Jonathan Demme. ``A Thousand Clowns,'' ``All the President's Men''
and ``Magnolia.''
 &HT;    The stars, movies and stories spill from Jason Robards' lips,
and there's no hiding his enthusiasm. For nearly an hour, the
77-year-old actor has sat and recounted his memories for an
ambitious archival project undertaken by Turner Classic Movies, the
cable channel that specializes in old-time Hollywood films.
 &HT;    Afterward, Robards warmly shakes hands with his interviewer,
producer Alexa Foreman, and steps into another room at the
Swissotel in Manhattan. Despite recent health scares, Robards
remains tall and strong, and the sparkle in his eyes is
undiminished.
 &HT;    ``I enjoyed that,'' he says. ``I hope I didn't talk too much
about myself. I still have no idea who I am, but maybe I'm the sum
of all the projects I've been in, the history of the movies and the
stage that I've been a part of. I'm probably a witness to history,
more than a part of it.
 &HT;    ``It's so funny to think I've devoted all of my life to the
stage and not done big movies I was offered because I wanted to do
a play instead,'' he adds. ``I like to think, `I'm a stage actor,'
but sitting here I realized I've done 60-odd films.
 &HT;    ``How the hell did I fit that in? I'm not that old that I could
have done 60 films.''
 &HT;    He managed, and even won back-to-back Oscars for supporting
performances in ``All the President's Men'' (1976) and ``Julia''
(1976).
 &HT;    ``Whether the films or plays turned out good or bad is really
not the point,'' Robards says. ``The point for me was to be a part
of what the author put down on paper, to help give life to it.
That's the true art of movies and stage, taking words and bringing
them to life.
 &HT;    ``It all begins with the words,'' he says. ``I've been
interested in words all of my life _ the words propel our business,
and I don't know if enough actors know that. The more they know it,
the better they are.''
 &HT;    Robards' interview is only the latest installment in the TCM
archives project, which since 1994 has included more than 200
people, among them such actors, directors and behind-the-scenes
people as Marge Champion, Cyd Charisse, Betty Comden, Stanley
Donen, Farley Granger, Garson Kanin, Lena Horne, Andre Previn, Rod
Steiger and Gloria Stuart.
 &HT;    ``Our goal is to preserve as much history of the motion-picture
industry as we can,'' Foreman says. ``By doing it on film the
people look good and sound good and, to me, it's better than an
oral history. You're able to see these people, their mannerisms,
gestures and expressions.
 &HT;    ``People love movies,'' she adds. ``and it's important to
remember how it all began. A number of the people who were there at
the time are dying, unfortunately, and that makes what we're doing
urgent.
 &HT;    ``Thank God for Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, who'd already
done their television documentaries and got most of the people from
the silent-film era,'' Foreman says. ``If we'd started our project
today, we'd have lost 15 percent of the people.''
 &HT;    Responsibility for lining up _ and, sometimes, locating _ the
interviewees falls to Darcy Hettrich, director of talent for TCM
and Turner Network Television.
 &HT;    ``Some of the names we all know, and they're still active and
still working,'' she says. ``But the obscure ones are tough.
Sometimes we get someone who comes in and has a great time _ we had
Ricardo Montalban and George Wells, who were both using walkers,
racing down the hall together _ and that someone puts us in touch
with two or three people we'd love to get. Or we'll follow a small
lead from an article. We'll call the writer and say, `Where did you
find so-and-so?'''
 &HT;    Foreman and Hettrich can't grab everybody, however. Among those
they'd most like to talk to _ but who have, for reasons obvious and
not so obvious, remained elusive _ are Kirk Douglas, Sue Mengers,
Nancy Reagan, Ray Stark, Billy Wilder and Elia Kazan.
 &HT;    While waiting patiently for those folks, Foreman and Hettrich
continue to corral a dozen or more people for two several-day
sessions held twice a year, once each in New York and in Los
Angeles. During one March weekend in New York, TCM trained its
camera on Robards, Budd Schulberg, Gwen Verdon, Jane Powell, Skitch
Henderson and others.
 &HT;    Verdon may be best known as a hoofer, a multiple Tony Award
winner who is also the former wife of the legendary choreographer
Bob Fosse, but she also appeared in the film version of ``Damn
Yankees'' (1958), in which she reprised her Broadway role as the
seductive demon Lola. She returned to the big screen 25 years later
for non-musical roles in ``The Cotton Club'' (1984), ``Cocoon''
(1985), ``Marvin's Room'' (1996) and the upcoming ``Walking Across
Egypt.''
 &HT;    ``I'd forgotten about some of the earlier things I'd done,''
Verdon says by telephone from her Long Island home, her voice still
bourbon over gravel. ``Actually, I remember the films, but I hadn't
thought about them or talked about them in years.
 &HT;    ``People still think of me as Lola,'' she says, ``and that's
part of the reason I was supposedly away so long. I took three
years off after my daughter was born, and then it took me a long
time to convince people that I could play older women, such as in
`Marvin's Room.'
 &HT;    ``As I say, they still think of me as Lola. I should probably
take that as a compliment, but it was also frustrating.''
 &HT;    Henderson, currently music director of the New York Pops, has
spent his life on television and the concert stage. Still, he has
some unique Hollywood memories to impart: As a young pianist in the
1930s, he worked with Charlie Chaplin, and served as a rehearsal
accompanist for Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and for Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers.
 &HT;    ``I was just a beginner,'' Henderson, now 82, says by telephone
from his Manhattan apartment. ``I didn't get any star billing, I
wasn't to be photographed or talked about. But that period was my
education _ Hollywood was my high school and college.
 &HT;    ``I remember walking onto a sound stage for the first time and
hearing Max Steiner conducting an orchestra at Warner Bros.,'' the
conductor says. ``I remember first playing in an orchestra on a
sound stage at MGM. I was a rehearsal pianist and generally didn't
play with the orchestra _ I worked individually with people.
 &HT;    ``If it hadn't been for World War II,'' he adds, ``I probably
would have made it for a while, then disappeared like everybody
else. But I wouldn't change a thing _ I learned a lot in Hollywood
and now, being at Carnegie Hall, I've got my Valhalla.''
 &HT;    Like almost everyone who has stepped before the camera for TCM's
archival project, Henderson considers it an effort of great
importance.
 &HT;    ``Somebody has to take care of the history,'' he says,
``because, if nobody does, it will all disappear downstream. I'm
astounded that so many people have no concept of what this world
was like. Rock 'n' roll killed the music, and television killed the
film business. Between the rock 'n' roll and television, it was a
hell of a blow to all of us.
 &HT;    ``So I'm thrilled that someone is taking the time to look back
and get on the record what happened so many years ago.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Not the retiring type
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A fellow I went to school with _ who is
currently slipping up on 60, same as I am _ says he's thinking
about retiring in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   I've had similar thoughts from time to time. Then I ask myself,
``Retire from what?''
</P>
<P>
   But he's got a different deal, getting up before the sun's up
most mornings, being the first person at the office, maintaining a
strict schedule of working hard, helping others and doing good.
</P>
<P>
   One time, with the idea of encouraging him to slow down a bit, I
suggested he ought to stop by my house on his way to work for a cup
of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   He said fine, that I could look for him about 5:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   I allowed that I was suddenly having second thoughts about the
extent of my hospitality, and that in fact if he came knocking on
my door at such an hour, I would sic the dogs on him.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining a good friend is one thing. Interrupting a good
night's sleep is something else.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he now tells me he may be able to alter his
schedule more to my liking in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   That'll be a big change for him, seeing as how he's had a job
since he was in the third grade. I asked him what he planned to do
once he quit working himself night and day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anything for the first year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good thinking. I read recently that Tom Dewey gave Richard Nixon
much the same advice when Nixon found himself in early retirement
as a result of the 1960 presidential election: Don't make any
important decisions for at least six months. Best to let your brain
calm itself down first.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who may or may not have ever got his brain calmed down,
similarly advised George Bush when he lost out to Bill Clinton in
1992. So it was that Bush waited awhile before he started jumping
out of airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to my friend, he did mention, more than once, that
one thing he'd like to do is cultivate the habit of having a
leisurely breakfast, meeting with friends at the coffee shops,
catching up on the local gossip.
</P>
<P>
   What with his work schedule, that's something he's missed out on
all these years. Just opposite for me. It was always part of my
job.
</P>
<P>
   As a young reporter, sitting in coffee shops, I could get more
news from a back booth than I could the front page. Never mind that
most of it you couldn't print.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I got to be so well-rounded, more especially with a
regular diet of fried eggs and ham, pancakes and grits, biscuits
and gravy.
</P>
<P>
   I wish my friend all the best in his impending retirement. He
can even have my old spot at the back booth.
</P>
<P>
   This word of advice for him on entering small town cafe society:
Don't believe everything you hear or tell everything you know, and
you'll do just fine.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Finding someone other than Haider to blame
 &HT;    (Eds: Palaces cq in 2nd graf. For release May 24, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ What was it that Virgil warned us about almost 2,000
years ago; oh, yes: ``Whatever it is, I fear Greeks even when they
bring gifts.'' I should have known better than to accept the offer
of coffee from Neco; there was a price to pay, a double price _ one
in coin, the other in inference.
</P>
<P>
   Neco Karakas is a roly-poly guy who emigrated from Greece to
Austria and has an upscale souvenir shop just across from Vienna's
Belvedere Palaces. It was while we were having a light breakfast at
a coffee shop next door that Neco came into my life, marching into
the room, proclaiming his recognition of the American visitors and
offering to buy us a cup of coffee ``just from my heart,'' as he
clutched his fist to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted because he seemed like an interesting person with
whom to discuss Austria's political arsonist Joerg Haider, Neco
being an immigrant, and Haider's Freedom Party riding into the
nation's parliament on an anti-immigration platform (in addition to
Haider's sympathy with things Hitlerian).
</P>
<P>
   That's where I got fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Even scapegoats have to have scapegoats _ and Neco has his.
</P>
<P>
   Before he drew us into his shop for repayment of the cup of
coffee (purchased: a decent print of Gustav Klimt's ``The Kiss,''
the real thing on display just across the street at the Upper
Palace), Neco had astonished me.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had I asked him about Haider's impact on Austria _
expecting a diatribe against the man and his party that blames the
nation's problems on the influx of immigrants such as he _ than
Neco targeted what he said was the real problem: Jews.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to get there. I asked Neco how business was
doing since so many nations imposed sanctions on Austria after
Haider's troops were elected and accepted into the government. It
was bad compared to last year, he said, but he added that it was
all the fault of the Israelis and ``the American Jewish
what-do-you-call-it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Jewish lobby?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the lobby. None of this (the sanctions) would have
happened if it wasn't for the Jews. They made a big thing of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't realized that. I don't think too many others had too. I
also don't believe it. I believe much of the rest of the world felt
strongly about the Austrian government's acquiescence to Haiderism.
</P>
<P>
   What I realized about Neco, however, is that when things go bad,
there has to be someone to blame and who else is handier than the
Jews?
</P>
<P>
   This, I decided, was not the time or place to reveal my
religious affiliation, better to just listen to the man who
apparently has yet to realize that he, an immigrant, is the target
of a turbulent reaction that is agitating not only Austria but all
of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration, particularly illegal immigration, is a flashpoint
across the continent as it is elsewhere, but moreso; it has given
succor to extremists such as Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with Neco, things are a little different. Likely, he has
become part of the establishment _ an immigrant, yes, but one who
has been around long enough to buy his own place and defend it
against the hordes of others who would enter the country and want
it also.
</P>
<P>
   But his ledger book has been assaulted by international
sanctions and Neco needs a specific culprit.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``Jewish lobby'' came in handy, as it has so many times
before.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation didn't venture much past that, Neco wanted to
sell us something after his gift of coffee. So my wife and I
entered his shop and, despite his misplaced acrimony, purchased the
print of ``The Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely, the only customers he had that day were a couple of
Jews. Go figure.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Unions' narrow interests threaten China bill
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All that congressional Democrats are being asked to do this week
is to vote in the manifest national interest, but with the AFL-CIO
pulling them the other way it is unclear how many will approve
permanent trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   With business lobbying hard for a yes vote, this is a no-brainer
for most Republicans. It comes naturally to them. And the pitch for
support from a cohort of China's own dissidents has given cover
even to the GOPers who have been grandstanding against China's
lousy human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   (Interestingly, many in Congress who fulminate against political
oppression, party-line justice and authoritarianism in China have
shrugged off comparable and worse flaws in right-wing regimes as
mere imperfections.)
</P>
<P>
   But asking Democrats to go against labor's passionate, and
well-heeled, opposition to the bill is like asking a dog to walk on
its hind legs. The act is unnatural and even the ones with a little
practice are awkward at it.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has a long and honorable tradition of supporting the
rights of workers in repressive countries. That was especially so
of its solidarity with the straining reformist movements in the
East Bloc countries under the Soviet thumb.
</P>
<P>
   But labor's opposition to permanent trade status for China is
part of its more recent, broad-brush antagonism to international
trade in general, and that antagonism is, at its core, merely
protectionist _ a self-interested recoil from economic competition
that could swipe some U.S. jobs from older production industries
even as it creates more and often better-paying jobs in fields
outside labor's historic base.
</P>
<P>
   Chronically second-best to Republicans in political
money-grubbing, Democratic candidates are disproportionately
dependent upon, and beholden to, union largess. A vote to back
President Clinton's pitch for trade menaces a Democratic
representative's or senator's re-election funding with no prospect
of offsetting votes from a largely indifferent electorate.
</P>
<P>
   More than a little pious blather has been hooted on behalf of
the bill. No, bringing China fully into the international trade
system will not start a momentum toward inevitable democracy or
seed a flowering garden of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   It will, however, push China toward the development of
predictable, politically independent business law, potentially a
start on other at least marginal reforms. It will involve China in
a commercial network in which China's own interests will favor
international stability over international mischief.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, reliable trade with China will be good for U.S.
businesses, especially agriculture. That may weigh lightly in any
elegant moral assay of the issue, but it is no bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   With any unilateral U.S. attempt to marginalize and harry China
over trade unlikely to force Beijing to see the human rights light,
there is simply no good reason to cede the territory to
unhesitating Japanese and European competitors.

SIR JOHN GIELGUD: HE BROUGHT A TOUCH OF PUCK TO HAMLET

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great Shakespearean actors are a breed unto themselves, in a
line stretching from hallowed founders such as Richard Burbage and
Will Kemp down to latter-day stars such as Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   But with the death of Sir John Gielgud at 96, a pivotal
generation has seen its final curtain. Gielgud died peacefully at
home Sunday near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire west of London, his
former agent, Laurence Evans, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody currently working in the theater will agree that his
death is the end of an era,'' Trevor Nunn, director of the Royal
National Theatre, told the Associated Press. ``As Shakespeare said,
`There's a great spirit gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like his peers Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, Gielgud
was a leader of the first group of actors to bring the Bard to
movies, radio and television, establishing that Shakespeare would
flourish in the modern media as he long had on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud was much more than a great Shakespearean, however.
Indeed, many will mourn not one of the century's great Hamlets but
rather the Oscar-winning dry comedian of the film ``Arthur''
(1981).
</P>
<P>
   Born on April 14, 1904, in London, Arthur John Gielgud was of
prestigious theatrical blood. His mother was the actress Kate
Terry, one of four noted sisters who starred on the Victorian stage
_ Ellen, Kate, Marion and Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his theatrical heritage, however, Gielgud hardly
resembled the stereotypical Shakespearean actor. Unlike his friend
and rival Olivier, whose towering stature, piercing eyes and
brooding good looks made him as natural a Hollywood leading man as
he was a stage icon, Gielgud was a tiny man who stood only a bit
over 5 feet tall. His spry bearing and elfin smile belied his
capacity for wrenching drama, as well as the one attribute he
shared with Olivier: an infinitely flexible voice that could be
winsome and cajoling one moment, thundering and commanding the
next.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, the whimsical Gielgud loved to repeat his single
line in his stage debut _ at London's Old Vic in Shakespeare,
appropriately enough: ``Here is the number of the slaughter's
French,'' he said as an English soldier in a 1921 performance of
``Henry V.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an anything-but-ostentatious beginning, befitting an
actor who would never be either a heaven-storming thespian or a
spotlight-seeking celebrity. But it led to other roles, including
his first London hit, ``The Constant Nymph'' (1926), and star turns
in such classic English plays as ``The Importance of Being
Earnest,'' ``The School for Scandal'' and ``The Duchess of Malfi.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it was to be for Shakespeare that he would become best
known. His major roles included a lyrical Macbeth, a thoughtful
Marc Antony and, in 1930, a Hamlet which one critic called ``the
high-water mark of English Shakespearean acting in our time.'' The
role became a specialty for Gielgud, who toured in it as late as
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s Gielgud was also an established director for the
English stage, showing versatility in handling not only Shakespeare
but also modern plays such as Tennessee Williams' ``The Glass
Menagerie'' (1948, starring Helen Hayes).
</P>
<P>
   American audiences first encountered Gielgud in films. In the
1940s he toured with ``Hamlet'' and ``Blithe Spirit,'' and in the
late 1950s and early 1960s became a semiregular on Broadway. He
earned a 1958 Best Actor Tony Award for ``Ages of Man,'' then in
1961 matched it with a Best Director Tony for ``Big Fish, Little
Fish.'' He returned again in 1964 as the director/star of Edward
Albee's ``Tiny Alice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud had made occasional films as early as ``Who Is the
Man?'' (1924), and had starred in Alfred Hitchcock's first big hit,
``Secret Agent'' (1936). However, he did not undertake a serious
film career until he played Cassius to Marlon Brando's Antony in
``Julius Caesar'' (1953). He, Olivier and Richardson appeared
together in ``Richard III'' (1955), and Gielgud subsequently worked
steadily in British and Hollywood films, earning a 1964 Oscar
nomination as King Louis VII of France in ``Becket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood never quite knew what to do with the diminutive,
quicksilver Gielgud, however, and he generally found himself cast
in supporting parts, often authority figures for which his regal
presence _ increasing notably as he aged _ lent itself naturally.
</P>
<P>
   It was in one such role, as the aristocratic valet to Dudley
Moore's drunken millionaire, that he won an Oscar for ``Arthur.''
Dryly sarcastic without ever seeming mean-spirited _ when the Moore
character announced that he was going to take a bath, Gielgud
responded, ``I shall alert the press'' _ the role suited him to a
``T.'' In fact, despite his character's having died in the first
movie, he reprised the role in ``Arthur 2'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's last major film role was as a surreal Prospero in
Peter Greenaway's controversial Shakespearean rhapsody,
``Prospero's Books'' (1991). In this highly offbeat riff on ``The
Tempest,'' studded with high-tech digital imagery, the 87-year-old
Gielgud spoke nearly every word of the two-hour-plus film. Reaction
to the film varied wildly, but Gielgud's performance was widely
praised.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews for ``Prospero's Books,'' Gielgud noted that ``The
Tempest'' is generally considered Shakespeare's final play, and he
seemed to think of the film as his own valedictory. Thereafter he
avoided large roles, though he remained active in a series of small
roles and cameos in films as diverse as ``Shining Through'' (1992,
as a cagy British diplomat), ``Shine'' (1996, as a subtle English
piano tutor) and ``Elizabeth'' (1998, as a conspiratorial pope). In
1996 he made a wordless micro-cameo as King Priam in Branagh's epic
``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud also appeared in a wide range of television projects,
including the PBS special ``Summer's Lease'' (1991), which won him
an Emmy Award. He may also have notched some kind of record for
publishing his autobiography over the longest span: ``Early
Stages'' appeared in 1939, while ``Backward Glances'' was published
exactly 50 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Gielgud's greatest performances took place onstage, and
were not recorded for posterity. Despite widespread acclaim as one
of the greatest actors of his era, he lacked the ambitious drive of
Olivier and other contemporaries, often seeming more comfortable in
supporting roles than in commanding the stage himself.
</P>
<P>
   In his more than 75 years of performing, however, there may have
been no actor who was better liked. Though the theatrical trade is
notorious for insecurity and egotism, Gielgud _ who was knighted in
1953 _ won over practically everyone he worked with by his good
spirits, his charity toward others and his own courtly, unassuming
ways.
</P>
<P>
   So little did Gielgud seek the spotlight that when, in 1997, he
acknowledged offhandedly that he was gay, he was convincing when he
said that he had never mentioned it previously simply because he
had always thought either that it was already known or that nobody
would be particularly interested. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: THE ESSENTIAL GIELGUD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Gielgud did most of his best work on the British stage, and
very little of it was documented on tape or film. However, many of
his best films are available on video. A greatest-hits sampling
might include the following eight films:
</P>
<P>
   _ `THE SECRET AGENT' (1936).
</P>
<P>
   A rare look at a young Gielgud, age 32, as he and Madeleine
Carroll are secret agents posing as man and wife on a secret
mission to Switzerland. Offbeat early Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   _ `JULIUS CAESAR' (1953).
</P>
<P>
   A wild melange of styles somehow works out, as Gielgud's Cassius
and Brando's Antony play off a star-studded cast that also includes
James Mason (as Brutus), Greer Garson, Louis Calhern and Deborah
Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   _ `RICHARD III' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare as only the Brits could do it. Laurence Olivier,
director and star, heads a cast that also includes Gielgud, Ralph
Richardson, Claire Bloom and Cedric Hardwicke. Long (155 minutes)
and deliberately stagy, but well worth the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ `BECKET' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's delightfully hammy Louis VII of France steals the film
from Richard Burton as Thomas Becket and Peter O'Toole as Henry II.
Gielgud earned an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ `ARTHUR' (1981).
</P>
<P>
   As the sardonic, deadpan valet Hobson, an Oscar-winning Gielgud
enjoys perfect chemistry with dipso Dudley Moore and working-class
Liza Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   _ `WAGNER' (1983).
</P>
<P>
   It's Richard Burton's show in this five-hour condensation of a
nine-hour British miniseries, but Olivier, Gielgud and Richardson
reunite for a wonderful triple cameo as Vienna musical bigwigs.
</P>
<P>
   _ `THE SHOOTING PARTY' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud embodies British tradition as a guest at an English
mansion for a hunting party in the dying days of the British
Empire. Mason, as the host, is also gripping.
</P>
<P>
   _ `PROSPERO'S BOOKS' (1991).
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's final leading role, director Peter Greenaway's
phantasmal multimedia meditation on Shakespeare's ``The Tempest''
proves that, at 87, the old British lion was still at the height of
his powers.

   Green's was a lively place back then. The stools at the soda
fountain were nearly always occupied. In the mornings, businessmen
came in for coffee and gossip. High school kids slurped milk shakes
and flirted away the afternoons. But on that July day, the chatter
stopped cold.
</P>
<P>
   The telegrams came one after the other until the town thought
they would never stop. Each expressed the ``deep regret'' of the
secretary of war. Over the next week, Bedford would learn that 21
of its sons had died June 6 in the D-Day invasion of France.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a population of 3,200, ``if you didn't know the person who
had been killed, you probably knew his family,'' recalled Teass,
who was 21 that summer.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many telegrams that Sheriff Jim Marshall enlisted
the undertaker and taxi driver to help deliver them to parents and
wives in town and on surrounding farms.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the husky sheriff himself who went to the Hoback
dairy farm. The family was about to go to services at the Center
Point Methodist Church just across the road when Marshall stood
awkwardly on the porch and delivered his news. Pvt. Bedford Hoback,
30, had been killed on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   A day or so later, the two teen-aged Hoback sisters were
churning ice cream to try to comfort their grieving parents when
the sheriff returned. Staff Sgt. Raymond Hoback, 24, was missing in
action.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bedford men who did return from the war remembered a
wounded Raymond waiting on Omaha Beach to be transported back to a
ship. They theorized that he drowned when the tide came in. His
body was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were never the same after those telegrams, said
Lucille Hoback Boggess, who was 15 that sad summer.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, her mother wouldn't go on family picnics and other
outings. It was as if she thought that she shouldn't enjoy herself
if her sons weren't there to have fun, too. And their father would
send the sisters from the dinner table whenever they were laughing,
Boggess said.
</P>
<P>
   On every Bedford street, it seemed, there was a house with a
gold star in the window.
</P>
<P>
   A whole town was in mourning for a lost generation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Today, on a dusty construction site on the edge of Bedford, the
granite arch of the National D-Day Memorial rises 44 feet and 6
inches above a Victory Plaza inlaid with the Allied designation for
the five Normandy beaches: Omaha. Utah. Gold. Sword. Juno.
</P>
<P>
   The height symbolizes the invasion date: 6/6/44. The word
``Overlord'' is emblazoned on the arch. ``Operation Overlord'' was
the code name for the Normandy landing.
</P>
<P>
   This Memorial Day, this first phase of the National D-Day
Memorial _ the arch and plaza _ will be opened to the public. The
completed project, including an adjoining education center, is to
be dedicated on June 6, 2001, the 57th anniversary of the historic
landing that is now remembered as the turning point of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Although funded mostly by private donations, the $12.2 million
memorial was approved by Congress in 1996 to honor the valor and
sacrifices of the 175,000 Allied forces involved in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Allies suffered 9,758 casualties on D-Day, including 6,603
from the United States. This rural community by a bend in the
Little Otter River was chosen for the national memorial because it
experienced the greatest per-capita loss of any American town or
city. Of the 35 sons of Bedford who landed at Normandy, 19 died
within the first 15 minutes of the battle, and two more were lost
later on that ``longest day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bedford casualties were all members of an activated Virginia
National Guard unit, the 116th Infantry Regiment of the 29th
Division. Along with regular army units from the First Infantry
Division, these were the first soldiers to go ashore at Omaha
Beach, scene of some of the bloodiest fighting. The companies of
the 116th Regiment went ashore alphabetically, and Bedford was the
home of Company A.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The Stevens twins, Roy and Ray, were platoon sergeants in
Company A. They had grown up on a farm outside Bedford and were
inseparable from boyhood. They were together when their National
Guard unit steamed to England aboard the Queen Mary, and they
bunked in the same barracks during training for the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But on D-Day, they headed ashore in separate Higgins landing
craft with their different platoons.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to meet at an intersection on the map. ``Ray wanted
me to shake his hand'' upon departure, Roy recalls. ``But I said we
would shake when we met up at that crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cold, choppy channel, though, the boat carrying Roy
Stevens' platoon hit an underwater German obstacle and sank. Most
of those aboard managed to stay afloat for several hours until
being picked up and taken back to England. Four days would pass
before Roy Stevens landed on Omaha Beach, where there was already a
row of fresh graves.
</P>
<P>
   The first wooden cross he examined was marked with the dog tag
of his twin brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw Ray's grave, I said, 'I'm going to get even,' and
I volunteered for everything to try to get some revenge,'' he
recalled. ``But 20 days was all that I had in battle. It seemed
like an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on patrol, he was wounded by an exploding land mine. After
surgery and a stay in a field hospital, he spent the rest of the
war in England training soldiers to be sent to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Then came V-E Day, and he went home to Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was a small woman who had 14 children. I remember
her coming out of the house to meet me. She said, 'at least one of
you got back,' `` he recalls. ``My daddy was a big old rough
farmer. The first time I had ever seen him cry was when I came
home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Victory Plaza on the National D-Day Memorial is about an acre in
size, semi-circular in shape, and ringed with flags of the 13
Allied nations involved in the D-Day invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The finished memorial will include a sprawling scene below the
plaza that symbolizes the landing.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-foot wall will represent the German bunkers that guarded
the cliffs of Normandy. A realistic statue titled ``Across the
Beach,'' depicting a GI pulling a wounded comrade, will stand below
the wall. A reflecting pool will symbolize the English Channel. A
replica of a Higgins landing craft will symbolize the crossing of
the Allied invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the arch is another realistic statue, ``The Final
Salute,'' honoring those who fell in combat. The statue depicts an
infantryman's rifle, with bayonet affixed, stuck into the ground. A
combat helmet sits atop the rifle butt and and dog tags hang near
the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the education center near the memorial will recall
the fortified bunkers that the soldiers encountered in Normandy. It
will house four galleries, an auditorium and the 120-seat Arnold M.
Spielberg Theater, named for the father of filmmaker Steven
Spielberg. The elder Spielberg is a World War II veteran who fought
in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg, whose movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' renewed
interest in D-Day, made a monetary contribution to build the
education center but did not disclose the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Burrow, president of the D-Day Memorial Foundation, said
that one of the galleries will feature rotating exhibits from the
National D-Day Museum, which is opening June 6 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death in February, ``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles
Schultz, a World War II veteran, led the fund-raising campaign for
the D-Day Memorial in Bedford. His widow, Jeannie Schultz, has
taken over the duties.
</P>
<P>
   Burrow said $8.7 million has been raised. Virginia will match
the next $3.5 million in private contributions, he said, which will
cover all construction costs and start the endowment to pay for
operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stevens, 80, and 85-year-old Ray Nance, a Company A first
lieutenant who was wounded on Omaha Beach, are the only two of
Bedford's ``D-Day boys'' still living in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Bedford is largely a bedroom community for folks who
work in Roanoke or Lynchburg. It is still surrounded by scenic
farms, including one where Elizabeth Teass lives. Lucille Boggess
is a county supervisor. Green's Drug Store is closed. Ray Nance is
a retired rural letter carrier. Roy Stevens is a retired rubber
plant worker who lost a hand in an industrial accident.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Stevens, who met and married Roy after the war, was
working in a Bedford plant that made gas masks that summer when the
telegrams arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``One mother was working there when she heard that her son had
been killed. She went home and never went back. Her husband later
committed suicide,'' she said. ``For a long time, Bedford was just
like a funeral.''

   BEDFORD, Va. _ Weeks of waves had washed the blood from the
beaches of Normandy before townsfolk learned how D-Day had
devastated their peaceful community in the shadow of the Blue Ridge
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It was the middle of the summer of 1944. Elizabeth Teass was
working in the telegraph booth in the back of Green's Drug Store
when the warning from the Roanoke operator clicked out on the
teletype machine: ``I have casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's was a lively place back then. The stools at the soda
fountain were nearly always occupied. In the mornings, businessmen
came in for coffee and gossip. High school kids slurped milk shakes
and flirted away the afternoons. But on that July day, the chatter

for a couple of miles _ at least by his lofty standards. He was
content to poke along with the pack in the early stages of the 89th
Examiner Bay to Breakers on Sunday, in a race that seemed to be
stuck in cement. The pace was so slow that unseeded runners and
guys jumping into the action from off the curbs along Sixth Street
actually managed to keep up with the top-rated men for more than a

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ For some reason, people who would
never admit to being yuppies, dot-commies and other things ending
in ``-ies'' are proud to say they're foodies. Such is the elevated
status of the alimentary tract in the Bay Area. But if you think
you're a foodie because you get to the hottest restaurants before
the critics do, think again. You're a restaurant victim. By ROB
MORSE.

   AIDS-AFRICA (San Francisco) _ Thabo Mbeki, the president of
South Africa, is visiting the United States this week. He has been
the subject of great controversy since the publication of a letter
he wrote last month which raised questions about the nature of the
AIDS epidemic sweeping Africa and the efficacy of applying Western
treatment models there. By JEFF SHEEHY and TOM COATES.

 &HT;    Dr. Weil, a pioneer in the field of integrative medicine,
recently authored ``Eating Well for Optimum Health.''

<P>
   Warm weather's here, and your days off are likely to be spent in
the woods and on the beach. Although the living can be easy, the
season has its own set of health concerns, from hay fever to
black-and-blue knees. Be prepared by assembling a first aid kit
filled with natural, all-purpose remedies before you head outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Repel mosquitoes and reduce the itch: The best way to steer
clear of mosquito bites is to know when the pesky insects are most
likely to be around. Mosquitoes generally feed around dusk, so if
you can't stay indoors during this time, wear long-sleeved,
loose-fitting clothing and tuck your pants into your socks. You may
want to wear such neutral colors as beige and khaki, which don't
seem to attract bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider taking B-complex vitamins regularly _ mosquitoes
find human blood unpalatable when people are on this supplement.
Take 100 milligrams three times a day starting a few weeks before
mosquito season, which kicks in around April and peaks in July and
August.
</P>
<P>
   If these precautions don't work, try applying neem oil
(Azadirachta indica), which can provide significant protection for
up to 12 hours. Extracted from an Indian tree, this oil is
available in health-foods stores.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that a mosquito does snack on you, dab Tiger Balm
or aloe vera gel on the bite to relieve the itching.
</P>
<P>
   Get the better of bee stings: Whether you're gardening or
hiking, you may brush up against a bee or happen to disturb a hive.
If you do get stung, attempt to remove the stinger before it
releases all the bee's venom; you'll end up with a smaller, less
painful welt. To ease the pain and inflammation, ice the area
immediately, then apply a paste made with baking soda and water.
You can also treat the bite site with full-strength tea tree oil
(Melaleuca alternifolia) or peppermint oil (Mentha piperita),
effective topical antiseptics, or the homeopathic gel StingStop,
which contains an infinitesimal amount of stinging nettle.
</P>
<P>
   Stave off summer sickness: Don't assume you're immune to colds
Simply because it's not winter. At the first sign of a summer bug,
take echinacea (Echinacea purpurea), a natural antibiotic and
immune-system enhancer. Try A freeze-dried supplement or a
standardized extract. Follow directions on the package and halve
the dose for children.
</P>
<P>
   Ease sore summer muscles: If those first few sunny-weather
outings leave your lately hibernating muscles aching, try rubbing
tincture of Arnica (Arnica montana) on the injured area. This
bright-yellow daisy-like flower, a popular healing plant among
Native Americans, speeds the healing of bruises, sprains, soreness
and swelling; it also relieves arthritis, and muscle and cartilage
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Arnica comes in a variety of other topical forms _ cream, salve,
ointment, gel and oil _ but I like the tincture. Never apply it to
broken skin or an open wound: It can be toxic if it gets inside the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Take the ``ouch'' out of poisonous plants: Recognition is the
first line of defense when it comes to dealing with poison ivy,
oak, and sumac. Learn to identify these plants and then avoid them.
If you do touch one, wash off the allergenic resin with soap and
water within 20 to 30 minutes of contact and slather the affected
area with aloe vera gel, to help soothe the itch if a rash does
develop.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best poison-ivy treatments I know is to get in as hot
a shower as you can stand for 5 to 10 minutes. This will increase
the itching _ but only for a few minutes. That's when the
nervous-system circuits seem to get overloaded, stopping the
discomfort for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Beat motion sickness: There's nothing worse than embarking on a
well-deserved holiday and becoming dizzy or nauseated before you
even hit the interstate. Fortunately, there are a number of
remedies that may make it possible for you to enjoy your journey.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling, try wearing acupressure wristbands, which have
a plastic peg that presses against the nausea controlling acupoint
on the inside of your wrists. The bands are available at most drug-
and health-food stores.
</P>
<P>
   Taking ginger (Zingiber officinale) also prevents and treats
motion sickness. Twenty minutes before travel, mix a half teaspoon
of ginger powder in a glass of water and drink it. Or take two to
four capsules of powdered ginger. Ginger snaps, ginger ale and
candied ginger can help with mild nausea, too.
</P>
<P>
   Soothe sunburn: Think prevention. Always use a sunscreen with an
SPF of 15 or higher that contains Parsol 1789, zinc oxide, or
titanium dioxide. These ingredients block almost the entire
spectrum of the sun's damaging rays. Slather sunscreen on every
exposed part of your body each time you work up a sweat or get out
of the water. Wear a broad-brimmed hat, lightweight pants or skirt,
and cover your shoulders and chest.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get sunburned, your skin will appreciate the cooling
and healing effects of aloe vera. Scrape out the gel from inside an
aloe leaf or buy a lotion whose primary ingredient is aloe, then
apply a generous amount to the affected area. You can also soothe
sunburn with cooled black tea (the tannins are what do the trick).
</P>
<P>
   Heal hay fever: I have found stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) to
be a highly effective treatment for hay-fever symptoms, minus the
side effects _ drowsiness and dry mouth _ of conventional allergy
medicines. Use a freeze-dried extract of the leaves, sold in
capsule form, and take one to two capsules every two to four hours
as needed.
</P>
<P>
   I also like quercetin, a bioflavonoid found in buckwheat and
citrus fruit, as an allergy preventive. Quercetin appears to
stabilize the immune-system cells that release histamine, the
mediator of allergic reactions. Take 400 milligrams twice a day
between meals. Give it a few weeks to show its full effect.
</P>
<P>
   Dr.Weil's summer first-aid Kit Stave off the season's troubles

 &HT;    Andrew Postman is the author of four books, most recently
``What's in an Age? Who Did What When, from Age 1 to 100.'' &HT;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   As you may have heard by now, ex-Toronto Blue Jay, now Los
Angeles Dodger right fielder Shawn Green, with only one All-Star
appearance under his belt, is getting $14 million a year for six
years. Is he worth it? We think not.
</P>
<P>
   Far worse, there's Bobby Bonilla. For his $5.9 million salary in
1999, he gave the New York Mets the following as a return on their
investment: He ate and didn't work out in an apparently desperate
attempt to win inclusion on the post-season roster of Macy's
Thanksgiving Day parade balloons; he challenged his manager to a
fight; and, during the final innings of Game 6 of the National
League Championship Series against the Atlanta Braves, the
culmination of arguably the most exciting baseball playoff series
in years, he decided to play cards in the clubhouse with fellow Met
malcontent Rickey Henderson (who, though also a Bonilla-like
loafer, was still a relative bargain, and far more useful to the
team, at his paltry sub-$2 million per year).
</P>
<P>
   We could field an ``All-Overpaid Team'' 10 times over. But there
are a lot of very good players who don't get nearly as much money
as they deserve. Here are our nominations for baseball's
``All-Underpaid Team.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST BASE: MARK MCGWIRE, St. LOUIS CARDINALS What? Underpaid at
just shy of $9 million? Absolutely. We don't doubt that McGwire has
earned tons in endorsements, and that he will continue to do so
until (and beyond) the end of his career. But what his home-run
light show (an astounding 135 over the past two seasons) did for
league attendance, TV baseball ratings and national esprit de corps
cannot be quantified. If and when McGwire is reevaluated, he will
be worth way more than nine mil. Remember: When McGwire came to St.
Louis, he was a slugger, but an often injured slugger, and no one
could reasonably have expected that at Busch Stadium _ no one's
idea of a home-run park _ he would not only break Roger Maris'
single-season home-run record two years in a row but obliterate it.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND BASE: POKEY REESE, CINCINNATI REDS We couldn't help
picking Pokey for a few reasons (not the least of which is being
able to say ``picking Pokey''). He was a steal at $270,000; his
fielding range is ridiculous (it earned him his first Gold Glove);
and he appears to be on a rocket going straight up, and fast (in
his rookie year he hit .219; the next year, .256; last year, .285).
He's also saddled, at least for now, with what was certainly the
league's All-Overachieving, All-Underpaid Team. How about Sean
Casey, fourth in the league in batting, at $220,000? How about
Scott Williamson (12-7, 2.41 ERA, 19 saves, more than a strikeout
per inning) at $200,000? How about Manager of the Year Jack McKeon
being asked back with only a slight increase to his 1999 salary of
roughly $500,000?
</P>
<P>
   SHORTSTOP: REY ORDONEZ, NEW YORK METS Undoubtedly, many will
disagree with this choice. Ordonez is, after all, one of the least
effective offensive players in the history _ this is not a misprint
_ in the history of Major League Baseball. But hear me out: It is
not merely that Ordonez is without question the best-fielding
shortstop in at least a quarter century. (And please, tiresome
Cardinals fans, look in the mirror before you make that face about
Ozzie Smith, because he was never this good a fielder, and he
played more than half his games on the easier-to-negotiate
artificial surface.) And it is not just that Ordonez's range and
arm allow him to turn hits into outs, and force-outs into double
plays. It is that Ordonez is so reliable (a staggering major league
record of 100 consecutive errorless games, and counting, through
the end of last season) that he allows his pitchers to throw more
of the notoriously hard-to-predict, but ultimately very effective,
sinkers and splitters that turn into ground-ball outs. In short, he
makes his entire pitching staff calmer and better. Finally, if
we're going on highlight-reel appeal, Ordonez produces as many
moments annually as (and of greater breadth than) your
garden-variety All-Star slugger. At $1.65 million in 1999, he was a
GM's dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD BASE: TONY FERNANDEZ, TORONTO BLUE JAYS Fernandez toyed
with .400 for the first half of the season and ended up at .328,
the highest average of his 17-year career. Indeed, his is a case of
either great perseverance and batterly autodidacticism (ouch) or
really bad timing. In what should be the autumn of his career,
Fernandez has flourished in the past two seasons as he never has
before. Word to Tony (at $2.2 million): The way to do it is to
start hot, sign a fat contract, then tail off _ not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER: JASON KENDALL, PITTSBURGH PIRATES It's hard to find
guys who are badly underpaid at this position, because the
brutality of playing catcher leaves so few catchers able to walk
without a limp, much less contribute both offensively and
defensively. But had Kendall not suffered a gruesome broken ankle
halfway through a very productive season, he might have established
himself as worthy of being considered in the next breath after
cream-of-the-crop catchers like Ivan Rodriguez and Mike Piazza. A
durable player and career .312 hitter, Kendall makes $1.25 million
with the Bucs. If he's healthy for the 2000 season and beyond,
he'll soon make his way out of All-Underpaid status, though he'll
probably have to leave small-market Pittsburgh to do it.
</P>
<P>
   LEFT FIELD: LUIS GONZALEZ, ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS Here is the
classic case of a player, seemingly out of nowhere, having the year
of his life. In his tenth full year in the big leagues, Gonzalez
hit 36 points higher, knocked in 32 more runs, rapped 44 more hits
and scored 28 more runs than he had in any other season. He also
had a 30-game hitting streak, the second-longest in the National
League since 1987. So why did it happen now? Was it having Buck
Showalter as manager? Playing on a playoff-caliber club? Breathing
the Phoenix night air? Whatever the reason, Gonzalez was arguably
the veteran steal of the year, at $2 million, and he has a good
enough swing to make his second All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD: TIE BETWEEN KEN GRIFFEY JR., CINCINNATI REDS, AND
ANDRUW JONES, ATLANTA BRAVES Griffey? Look at it this way: In his
last years, the best basketball player of the nineties,
what's-his-name Jordan, was paid $30-plus million in annual salary.
The best baseball player of the nineties topped out at $8.5 million
_ and he had to play a lot more games. It's nutty, we know. But in
today's sports market, that's a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, at a paltry $330,000, hasn't been around long enough to
demand big money. But in the four years he's been with the Braves,
they've won four division championships and two National League
pennants. What's more, Jones is not only a fabulous center fielder
but perhaps the most graceful outfielder ever to step on grass. (We
hear you, Willie Mays supporters; give us a break, DiMaggio
acolytes. Enough with the nostalgia: Use your eyes.) He's not yet
(and may never be) a great offensive player, but Jones is a good
one (.275, 26 HRs, 84 RBIs) who'll be covering 65 percent of the
outfield for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD: TONY GWYNN, SAN DIEGO PADRES There is no position
in baseball that comes close to having such a plethora of great
players not making what they should (Vladimir ``Best Outfield Arm
in Baseball'' Guerrero, Montreal Expos, at $1 million; Larry ``Best
All-Around Player in the National League'' Walker, Colorado
Rockies, at $5.2 million; Manny ``Most RBI in 61 Years'' Ramirez,
Cleveland Indians, at $4.1 million; Sammy Sosa of the Cubs; Bobby
Abreu of the Phillies; Matt Stairs of the A's...)
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Gwynn, at $4.3 million and one of the greatest hitters
of all time, takes this one. Want to hear what Gwynn has hit in the
seven seasons since he turned 33, what for anyone else would be the
slippery downside of one's career? .358, .394, .368, .353, .372,
.321 and .338.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn could have made many more millions signing with a
bigger-market club but stayed true to the only team he's known.
There are very, very few players who've been in the league more
than 10 years and who have similarly stayed put (Cal Ripken Jr.
with the Orioles, Barry Larkin with the Reds, Tom Glavine with the
Braves). Anyway, Tony will have the last laugh the day he's
enshrined in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT-HANDED STARTING PITCHER: JOSE LIMA, HOUSTON ASTROS Lima
($1.95 million) blossomed in 1998, going 16-8 (the first time in
his career he didn't have a losing record) and, to show it wasn't a
fluke, followed up that effort with an even better 21-10 record and
a lower ERA. His strikeout-to-walks ratio in the past two years is
just silly _ an unbelievable 9: 1 _ and he's shown himself to be a
money pitcher, too. Lima's days of being underpaid should fast be
coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   LEFT-HANDED STARTING PITCHER: JOSE ROSADO, KANSAS CITY ROYALS A
guy who was 10-14 last year is underpaid? Who has lost eight more
games in his career than he's won? Whose ERA was just a tad under
4? You got it (though he didn't). Rosado toiled for the woefully
under-budgeted, though young and talented, Royals. That 3.85 ERA of
his? Believe it or not, that was good enough for fifth best last
year in the ludicrously offensive-biased American League (from the
DH to smaller parks to minuscule strike zones to expansion,
pitchers have no chance). And who, you ask, are the four hurlers
ahead of Rosado? A guy named Pedro Martinez, one named David Cone,
one named Mike Mussina, and one named Brad Radke. Those four
combined earned almost $28 million in 1999. Rosado made $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE RELIEVER JOHN JOHNSTONE, SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS This is the
quintessential underpaid, under-appreciated position. After all, a
pitcher becomes a middle reliever ``because he's not good enough to
do anything else.'' That said, middle relievers have become
increasingly important; not coincidentally, playoff teams,
including the Mets, Yanks, and Braves, tend to boast the deepest
corps of middle relievers (a.k.a. ``relief specialists'').
Johnstone, whom no one outside of his family and the Bay Area has
ever heard of (and even the Bay Area we're not sure about), made
just under $700,000 last year. He had a minuscule ERA of 2.60, and
he led the major leagues in ``holds'' (keeping a lead) _ which
means that if not for him, the Giants closer would have had nothing
to save.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSER: BILLY WAGNER, HOUSTON ASTROS Not only does this guy
throw 100 mph, it is conceivable, given the trajectory of his
brilliant career, that he will soon be averaging two strikeouts per
inning. That's correct: We said two, not one. Last year, his ERA
was a this-has-to-be-a-misprint 1.57. While closers are often,
almost by definition, underpaid (after all, they tend to burn out
almost as quickly as they emerge), Wagner, at a hair over $2
million, makes far less than the few equals he has among dominant,
ice-water-in-the-veins short relievers (Mariano Rivera, Trevor
Hoffman).

<P>
   Suffering from the nightly baby-induced sleep deprivation that
all new parents seem to go through, I could never decide if we
humans are meant to sleep alone, in pairs, or what. It seemed
unfair to make a tiny baby sleep all by himself or to try to pawn
off a ``cuddly'' of some sort to approximate companionship when we,
clearly, each had a big, living cuddly we could latch onto. Plus,
it can be so comforting to sleep with babies. They sleep with such
complete devotion, such brow-furrowed concentration, when they do
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   True, they practice their art at odd hours, having spurts of
inspiration, then long periods of frustration. They might even
become blocked on sleeping. And that's when babies, and their
parents, need an operating system, a book on sleeping _ they need
The Book.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't find The Book on my own, heavens no. I was one of those
natural, instinctive mothers who was convinced that she intuited
mothering in such an innately motherly way that it didn't cross my
mind that I might need any book. Or so I thought, before I hit the
wall, literally, in the sheets-and-towels section of Sears, utterly
exhausted from what had felt like an all-night hostage situation.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I was discovered stumbling about there, sighing deeply,
by my friend Maeta, a no-nonsense, peripatetic mother of a baby six
months older than mine, which, from my inexperienced point of view,
might as well have meant mother of an Oxford don.
</P>
<P>
   Maeta's cheeks looked flushed from the brisk outdoors and her
eyes were fully open. She was probably shopping for clearance sale
sheets to make apostle robes in her capacity as assistant director
at the community theater. (She was both mother of an Oxford don and
able to get 50 schoolkids to wave their palm branches in the right
direction during ``Jesus Christ Superstar.'') I'll never forget the
way she took one look at the slumbering baby on my back and my own
ravaged state and then said it: ``You need The Book.'' I could have
sworn she said, ``Let there be light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems'' is revelatory, yet simple.
It is a plan laid out by Dr. Richard Ferber for teaching your baby
to fall asleep. Alone. If he learns to fall asleep alone at
bedtime, down the road he can learn to fall asleep in the middle of
the night. Without you. That's the idea. Looking back, I am amazed
at the simplicity of the process compared to the turmoil it tapped
in my heart.
</P>
<P>
   There is REM and non-REM sleep, and Stages I through IV, and
``hypnagogic hallucinations,'' and ``circadian rhythms'' to know
about, but, in my own particular Book, what Parents of the
Sleepless (the gothic terminology of one reviewer) are advised to
do goes something like the following scenario.
</P>
<P>
   You put baby to bed, awake. He starts to howl.
</P>
<P>
   You look at your watch. After one minute (you select the
starting increment), you go in and comfort him without picking him
up. He beams at you in instant relief. You leave. He howls.
</P>
<P>
   You look at your watch. After five minutes you go in to comfort
him without picking him up. He twists his red, wet face toward you
beseechingly. You leave. He howls.
</P>
<P>
   You look at your watch again. After 10 minutes you go in to
comfort him without picking him up. He draws shuddering breaths,
hiccuping mightily. You leave. There is a stunned moment of
disbelief And then he howls.
</P>
<P>
   You look at your watch, grab fistfuls of your hair and yank.
After 15 minutes you go in and comfort him without picking him up.
His crying is so loud and dense that you swear it is a form of
solo-polyphonic ritual chant. You don't want to know what he is
chanting. You leave. He continues to howl.
</P>
<P>
   You look at your watch. And after 20 minutes you go in. Your
baby nails you with a look of such withering rancor through his
tears that you don't even try to comfort him but instead beat a
hasty retreat. He continues to howl; the pitch rises in a
methodical step fashion.
</P>
<P>
   You look at your watch, nonstop, for 30 minutes. You go in. He
does not acknowledge your presence in any way. He is utterly
focused on his crying and does not want to be distracted. You
leave, feeling numb in all your extremities.
</P>
<P>
   You are unable to look at your watch. You stand motionless in
the middle of the living room as if in the eye of a hurricane. You
draw one quivering breath and feel as if you are in labor again. It
is not going well. You curse the fact that you decided to start
this program when your husband was out of town. You curse the
program. You curse all books on baby rearing. You curse the fact
that you ever learned to read.
</P>
<P>
   And then: He stops.
</P>
<P>
   Your baby stops his crying. But he is actually awake, you can
sense it. He is awake and alive. He is alone and intact. You both
are listening, riveted, to the silence of the other. And then he
starts making that squishing, sputtering mouth sound he makes when
he's talking to Curious George (his cuddly).
</P>
<P>
   You just stand there frozen, a statue. You know that he is
pointing out to George that he, George, has an eye here, and
another there, and a nose just below, and a mouth right here. After
he points that out, repeatedly, to George, you hear some rustling
sounds. The crib slats shake once, twice. You stand rigid, a pillar
of salt. You know that he is lying on his back and kicking his feet
just to see them go up and down. He is considering his feet.
</P>
<P>
   And then: There is a long, long significant pause ....
</P>
<P>
   He is sailing away from you. He is sailing away. You stand
fixed, chiseled, still. You gaze over the river of crystal light.
You start to sense it. The deep, deep, ocean-deep breathing
of...sleep.
</P>
<P>
   A new day is born.

 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   Seattle _ hip, environmentally aware and holistically minded _
figures high on annual lists of America's most livable cities. No
wonder: It's flanked by the snowclad Olympic and Cascade mountain
ranges _ with 14,411-foot-high Mount Rainier in dramatic view to
the southeast _ and rimmed by the scenic shores of Lake Washington,
Lake Union, Elliott Bay and Puget Sound. And this sprawling
metropolis of 3 million hasn't sacrificed its outdoor lifestyle (at
least not yet) to the demands of urban culture. Yes, there are too
many cars. But 8,000 commuters bike to their offices, and some
18,000 others float to work on ferries. Ecological and political
passions still run high here, as evidenced by last fall's
demonstrations against the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``Emerald City of the Pacific Northwest'' for its
generous green spaces, Seattle also boasts an appealing array of
residential neighborhoods, each with a distinctive personality. In
north Seattle alone, there's funky, free-style Fremont; yuppie
Wallingford; and traditional, working-class Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   In the northeast, you'll find wooded Ravenna and University
District, home of the University of Washington. East Seattle is
comprised of trendy Capitol Hill, upscale Madison Park and
ethnically rich Madrona. Youthful Alki sits in the southwest; in
the west, affluent Magnolia perches on a peninsula and chic Queen
Anne towers above downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Country in the city
</P>
<P>
   From Peregrine falcons to stately cedars, wildlife and
wilderness abound in Seattle. There are more than 6,000 acres of
parkland in the city alone. You might spy bald eagles somewhere in
the 500 rustic acres of Magnolia's Discovery Park and will
certainly come upon honking Canadian geese at Lake Union's shores.
</P>
<P>
   Watch sockeye salmon run at the Hiram Chittenden Locks (June
through August; 315 N.W. 54th St.), and if you ride the ferries to
Bainbridge and Vashon Islands, you can often spot orcas cavorting
in Puget Sound (The trip to 48-square-mile Bainbridge Island takes
35 minutes. Call Washington State Ferries, 800-843-3779, for
schedules).
</P>
<P>
   For the best viewing of old-growth trees, visit Schmitz Park,
part of West Seattle, and Lake Washington's Seward Park. Capitol
Hill's Volunteer Park is one of the city's most accessible open
spaces. The landscaping, which includes fountains, promenades and
formal gardens was the work of the Olmsted brothers, whose father
and step-father, (the family relationship was complicated)
Frederick Law Olmsted, was one of the pioneers of American
landscape architecture. An observatory in Volunteer Park offers
panoramic views of the city. In the heart of downtown's bustling
Pioneer Square, don't miss the sweet, small-scale waterfall in
Waterfall Park.
</P>
<P>
   Fitness frontiers
</P>
<P>
   If exploring neighborhoods on foot and wandering along park
trails doesn't satisfy your need for exercise, get your heart
pumping with tennis, bike-riding, or paddling, to name just a few
of the activities available in this athletic town. The waterfront
and 2.8-mile trail around Green Lake are joggers' favorites. The
city maintains 155 tennis courts, awarded on a first-come,
first-served basis or reserved in advance at Seattle Parks and
Recreation (5201 Green Lake Way N.; for reservations, phone
684-4077). (Note: Unless otherwise listed, the area code is 206.)
</P>
<P>
   To pedal your way through Seattle's streets, rent bikes equipped
with a computerized mapping system at Blazing Saddles Bike Rentals
(1230 Western Ave.; 341-9994). Cycle along the 12-mile Burke Gilman
Trail, which skirts Lake Washington's shores, or try some
island-pedaling by taking your bicycle on the Vashon or Bainbridge
ferries (just pay the foot-passenger toll).
</P>
<P>
   Vashon Island is tranquil and rural; Bainbridge is flatter, but
you'll have to contend with more cars. And the city's Engineering
Department can provide you with a free map of other scenic bike
routes and loops (684-7583).
</P>
<P>
   If plying the waters strikes your fancy, start by renting a
rowboat, kayak, or sailboat at Green Lake Boat Rentals (7351 E.
Green Lake Dr. N.; 527-0171). How about a sea-kayak tour? Check out
Pacific Water Sports (16055 Pacific Hwy. S.; 246-9385). Can you
canoe? Get equipped for an excursion on Lake Washington's tranquil
bayous at the University of Washington Waterfront Activity Center
(20 minutes north of downtown; 543-9433). For information about
swimming, river-rafting, skiing, horseback-riding, golf, or scuba
diving, contact the Seattle-King County Visitors Bureau (Washington
State Convention &AMP; Trade Center, 800 Convention Place, Seattle, WA
98101; 461-5840).
</P>
<P>
   Places that pamper
</P>
<P>
   Spas and salons proliferate both in the heart of the city and in
residential neighborhoods. Unwind with a warm-oil massage at
Ummelina, a downtown gem with a dry sauna that re-creates the
healing environment of the desert (1525 4th Ave.; 624-1370).
Jaroslava specializes in such treatments as seaweed body wraps and
almond loofah scrubs (1413 4th Ave.; 623-3336). In the same
building as the Alexis Hotel, Aveda Lifestyle Store &AMP; Spa features
treatments that include aromatherapy massage and Dead Sea-salt
exfoliation with the company's well-known, plant-based products
(1015 First Ave.; 628-9605). Robert Leonard specializes in facials
(2033 6th Ave., Suite 151; 441-9900). Habitude, which offers herbal
body masks and facials, has locations in both Ballard (5350 Ballard
Ave. N.W; 782-2898) and Fremont (513 N. 36th St.; 633-1339).
</P>
<P>
   Spirited reading
</P>
<P>
   With more bookstores per capita than any other American city,
Seattle is a bookworm's delight. Spend an afternoon of enlightened
browsing at the Elliott Bay Book Company in Pioneer Square; this
literary landmark features an extensive general-interest inventory
and hosts one of the most respected reading series in the country
(101 S. Main St.; 624-6600). Beyond the Closet focuses on
alternative lifestyles, with extensive offerings from small presses
(518 E. Pike St.; 322-4609). East West Book Shop is a popular
Ravenna haven with an enormous selection of Jungian-psychology
books (6500 Roosevelt; 523-3726). Nearby, Mandata covers
spirituality and metaphysics (918 N.E. 64th St.; 527-2979). A
favorite in grassroots Fremont, the Fremont Place Book Company (621
N. 35th St.; 547-5970) accents gender studies. Check out Left Bank
Books, a cooperatively run bookstore with an emphasis on radical
politics, philosophy and poetry (92 Pike St.; 622-0195). Upstairs
from Seattle's largest Asian food store, Kinokuniya Bookstore
includes a fine alternative medicine section (519 6th Ave. S.;
587-2477). For an extensive complementary-health bookstore, head to
Bastyr University, just 40 minutes from downtown Seattle in Kenmore
(14500 Juanita Dr. N.E., Kenmore, WA 98028-4966; 425-823-1300).
</P>
<P>
   Healthy dining
</P>
<P>
   Seattle offers far more than just java joints. The city's
restaurants excel in seafood and Pacific Rim cuisine, with organic,
locally grown products a highlight; the Painted Table in the Alexis
Hotel is a prime example (92 Madison St.; 624-3646). Refined and
full- flavored, the vegetarian fare at Cafe Flora is first-rate
(2901 E. Madison St.; 325-9100). Whether you're in the mood to sip
a tamarind-ginger lemonade or to savor a vegetarian snack,
Carmelita will not disappoint (7314 Greenwood Ave. N.; 706-7703).
In Capitol Hill, Gravity Bar is a classy, slick vegetarian
restaurant with an Asian accent (415 Broadway E.; 325-7186). The
friendly Still Life in the Fremont Coffeehouse will transport you
back to the 1960s; its homemade fare, much of it vegetarian _ is
delectable (709 N. 35th St.; 547-9850). Out-of-towners should visit
Ray's Boathouse, for its stunning views of the Olympic Mountains
and its extensive fish offerings (6049 Seaview Ave. N.W.;
789-3770). In Green Lake, don't miss Ed's Juice and Java, just
below the Compounding Apothecary, for organic everything _ from
wheatgrass to rice plates (7900 E. Greenlake Dr. N.; 524-7570).
Nearby, the Urban Bakery serves up meatless soups and terrific
breads (7850 E. Greenlake Dr. N.; 524-7951).
</P>
<P>
   Rest for the weary
</P>
<P>
   Set on a quiet street in lovely Capitol Hill, the turn-of
the-century Salisbury House _ graced with welcoming fireplaces and
elegant beamed ceilings _ makes a great home base (750 16th Ave.
E.; 328-8682; rooms start at $85 per night). Downtown, between Pike
Place Market and Pioneer Square, the stately Alexis Hotel is
conveniently located next to the Aveda spa (1007 First Ave.;
800-426-7033; www.alexishotel.com; rooms start at $165).
Overlooking the flower stalls of Pike Place Market, Inn at the
Market opens onto expansive Elliott Bay views (86 Pine St.;
443-3600; www.innatthemarket.com; rooms start at $145). Pike Place
Market, the country's oldest continuously operating farmers'
market, is a treasured Seattle landmark where, among other things,
you can buy organic produce and all manner of fresh fish, linger in
a tearoom or lunch in a kosher deli.
</P>
<P>
   For a quintessential Seattle experience, try a floating home on
Lake Union; the restored 1944 U.S. Army Tugboat M.V. Challenger
Bunk &AMP; Breakfast will set you up in one of its eight rooms on the
water (1001 Fairview Avenue N., 1600; 340-1201 or 877-340-1201;
www.challengerboat.com; rates start at $100).
</P>
<P>
   More tips
</P>
<P>
   When touring downtown, save money and time by walking or using
public transportation (from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. there's a
21-block-long free-ride bus zone). To venture out into the
neighborhoods, however, you'll need to drive, hop on a bus (call
206-553-3000 for info), or bike. Once you get there, though,
explore on foot _ it's the best way to absorb the flavor and rhythm
of each district.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rumors of incessant downpours, Seattle's annual
rainfall is 36 inches _ less than that of Manhattan or Atlanta. The
city is often misty, though, so a waterproof jacket is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   To learn about local politics and concerns, tune in to 94.9
KUOW, the University of Washington's National Public Radio
affiliate, or check out the free alternative weeklies widely
distributed downtown: ``The Stranger,'' creative and courageous,
and ``Seattle Weekly,'' the city's answer to New York's Village
Voice.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For some reason, people who would never admit to
being yuppies, dot-commies and other things ending in ``-ies'' are
proud to say they're foodies. Such is the elevated status of the
alimentary tract in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think you're a foodie because you get to the hottest
restaurants before the critics do, think again. You're a restaurant
victim.
</P>
<P>
   You're just eating restaurant food, and most restaurants can't
find help and can't keep chefs. San Francisco has two gossip
columns devoted to chefs' comings and goings, and they are
well-read. It's hard to keep up with who's stealing the great chefs
of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants are booming, but it hardly matters what the food
tastes like. A little buzz, a lot of decor, some showy
presentation, and the restaurants fill up with young beneficiaries
of computer wealth who can't cook and think the world's best food
is in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know that great cuisines come from the world's homes.
I have one young friend who has opinions about all the latest
restaurants, yet can't make anything more complicated than a
grilled cheese sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   When she cooks at home for company, she tries to prepare
restaurant food from great chefs' cookbooks, using recipes with 21
steps that somewhere in the middle say, ``Last week make a stock.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder young people eat all their meals in restaurants,
and let someone else make the stock last week.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you really know if you're a foodie, a food victim of
very sophisticated pretensions: How many kinds of salt do you have
in your cupboard?
</P>
<P>
   The salt craze hit my home hard. Our cupboard contains red
Hawaiian tidal crystals, gray Celtic sea salt, damp French fleur de
sel, Aigues-Mortes salt, Sicilian salt, coarse Portuguese sea salt,
ultra-fine Japanese salt, kosher salt and rock salt. That's not
even counting salt from the Sea of Iodized.
</P>
<P>
   We have enough sea salt to start a sea. It would be
international waters.
</P>
<P>
   We even have the ``Salt &AMP; Pepper'' cookbook by Bay Area food
writer Michele Anna Jordan, and it's a good book about all the
newly revealed mysteries of the shaker and grinder. Salt is
``flavor's midwife,'' as Jordan puts it, and different salts give
birth to different flavors.
</P>
<P>
   This is getting serious. I'm not just a foodie. I'm a saltie.
</P>
<P>
   Having a cookbook collection isn't enough anymore. Your
collection has to include antique cookbooks, anthropological
cookbooks and trendy single-subject cookbooks like Jordan's ``Salt
&AMP; Pepper.'' That's technically a two-subject cookbook, I suppose,
but not on most tables.
</P>
<P>
   Currently on bookstore shelves are such single-subject tomes as
``The Rice Bible,'' ``The Complete Meat Cookbook'' and ``The Good
Egg.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the great cholesterol panic is over, eggs are over easy
and served up every other conceivable way. San Francisco restaurant
consultants Gayle Pirie and John Clark have a reassuringly slim
cookbook called ``Country Egg, City Egg,'' on the foodstuff so
often taken for granted, and massacred since the invention of the
pan, to use M.F.K. Fisher's imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole M.O. is that you can find six eggs in your
refrigerator, a little balsamic vinegar, a beer, and you can make a
feast,'' Pirie says.
</P>
<P>
   You have to break some eggs to make an omelet, so you might as
well crack a book about the simplest food in the most confusing
department in the supermarket. Now I know why some eggs are white
and others brown, but it's better to have blue.
</P>
<P>
   If young restaurant addicts can't face cooking at home yet,
Pirie and Clark will be cooking their bread-crumb fried eggs and
other egg dishes as guest chefs at Berkeley's Cafe Rouge at
lunchtime Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the life of the palate in Berkeley, formerly the home of
the life of the mind. Naturally, the salt on the eggs won't be the
nasty iodized kind, but strictly kosher.
</P>
<P>
   If single-subject cookbooks are all the rage, I should be able
to get a piece of the action, too. I was going to write ``The Water
Cookbook,'' but got stuck on the difference between hard and soft
water.
</P>
<P>
   Boiling I'm not so sure about, but I've got freezing down cold.
</P>

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Gains in workplace equality for gay and lesbian Americans have
been ``rapid and remarkable,'' says Kim Mills, education director
of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest political
organization.
 &HT;    ``The progress shows no signs of abating,'' she says. ``In many
workplaces we've gone beyond the basics of a nondiscrimination
policy, domestic-partners health-insurance benefits and a
sanctioned employee resource group to diversity training at all
levels of the corporation, including sexual orientation and gender
identity. This includes respectful and appropriate marketing to our
community and financial commitments to our organizations.''
 &HT;    Mills, the author of HRC's published report, ``The State of the
Workplace,'' visited Boston to address a monthly dinner meeting of
the Greater Boston Business Council, or GBBC.
 &HT;    GBBC, a gay and lesbian professional and business organization,
promotes visibility of gays in the workforce, providing positive
images.
 &HT;    Mills heads up WorkNet, an HRC project that collects, analyzes
and distributes _ free of charge _ information to assist employees
and employers in implementing and tracking policies that ensure
equal treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender workers.
WorkNet includes the most extensive database of U.S. employers who
implement nondiscrimination policies that cover sexual orientation
and domestic-partnership benefits.
 &HT;    Mills' statement that ``progress has been rapid and
remarkable,'' is no exaggeration. In March, WorkNet documented an
impressive 3,402 U.S. employers who offer domestic-partner health
insurance.
 &HT;    ``From the end of last year until mid-March, 117 companies
started providing health-insurance benefits,'' Mills says. ``That's
a rate of about nine a week.''
 &HT;    There are currently 70 ``Fortune 500'' companies that provide
health insurance for domestic-partners. Employers offering
equal-benefits include American Airlines, American Express, Apple
Computer, AT&AMP;T, Eastman Kodak, General Mills, IBM, Marriott,
Mattel, Walt Disney and Xerox.
 &HT;    ``One of the incredible things about workplace advocacy is
seeing the progress, the quantifiable data that show how far we've
come,'' Mills says.
 &HT;    In 1982, the New York City-based Village Voice newspaper became
the first employer to offer domestic-partner health-insurance
benefits. For most of the 1980s, however, only a handful of
employers followed suit. By 1990, fewer than two dozen employers
implemented such a policy.
 &HT;    In 1991, however, the Cambridge-based Lotus Development Corp.,
then an independent company, raised the stakes in the information
technology sector, becoming the first publicly held corporation to
add domestic-partner benefits.
 &HT;    Fast forward to late 1999. Since then, here's been a virtual
explosion in the numbers of employers in 40 states who offering
domestic-partner health insurance. California, Massachusetts and
New York _ each with more than 100 employers _ lead the way. The
District of Columbia, Illinois and Pennsylvania are not far behind,
according to HRC's database.
 &HT;    Today, domestic-partner benefits are rated the most effective
recruitment tool for executives and the third most effective for
managers and line workers, according to a 1999 survey by the
Society for Human Resource Management.
 &HT;    Behind these impressive gains is the city of San Francisco. In
1996, San Francisco passed an equal-benefits ordinance _ the
nation's first _ which mandated that any contractor doing business
with the city or county must offer equal-benefits.
 &HT;    Employers tracked by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission
accounted for 76 percent of all the identified employers nationwide
offering domestic-partner benefits, according to the report. The
commission shares its data with the WorkNet project, enabling HRC
to advocate progressive changes in policy nationwide.
 &HT;    ``We can help companies do the right thing in advising employees
and employers on the value of workplace diversity, which includes
sexual orientation along with gender, race, and ethnicity,'' Mills
says. ``We've helped to educate executives all the way to the top
of major corporations on diversity issues.''
 &HT;    HRC's WorkNet project can't achieve workplace equality alone.
That requires an effort by all gay and lesbian Americans to make
the case company by company, asking for the equal treatment at work
that we deserve.
 &HT;    For a complete list of employers who offer domestic-partner
health insurance, see the HRC WorkNet Web site at

 By ISIS ARTZE  
 &HT;    Increasingly, traditional careers are being replaced with
careers of the 21st century, whether it's broadband architecture,
fuel-cell engineering or gerontological counseling. Consider these
examples:
 &HT;    _ Auto manufacturers say that by 2010 many gasoline engines may
be replaced by small electric motors that run on fuel cells. The
result is that future fuel-cell engineers will create vehicles that
are more fuel-efficient.
 &HT;    _ Law, a favorite career area for Latinos, will see many
changes. The new millennium calls for multidisciplinary lawyers,
who will combine their skills with those of accountants and
consultants.
 &HT;    In an article titled ``Top Careers for 2000 and Beyond,'' (on
CareerPlanner.com), career reporter Mike Robinson explains that the
key to understanding future career prospects is to become aware of
the long-term trends that are taking place. One of these is an
aging population and longer life spans, Robinson says. It's a trend
that will lead to a high demand in products and services tailored
to the elderly, including healthcare and nursing facilities.
 &HT;    ``With the ranks of those 65 and over set to swell from 33
million to 80 million over the next 40 years,'' according to U.S.
News Online, the demand for individuals specializing in the
concerns of the senior citizens is already huge and will only grow.
 &HT;    Pat Gleason-Wynn, a gerontological counselor, is one such
individual. Visiting private homes and nursing facilities,
Gleason-Wynn handles anything _ from a woman recovering from a
broken hip who needs help making her home easier to navigate to a
widower having trouble with his social life.
 &HT;    Another career identified by U.S. News as a hot job is that of
an intensivist. This is a physician who tries to prevent medical
complications by evaluating medical histories, surgeries and
diseases, then consults with surgeons, cardiologists and other
specialists to coordinate the complex care of the critically ill.
 &HT;    Ronald L. Krannich, author of ``The Best Jobs for the 21st
Century'' (Impact, 1998) agrees that healthcare careers will
abound. He says that, in addition to favorable demographics, the
healthcare industry will grow due to advances in medical technology
and the likelihood that financing healthcare will become easier.
 &HT;    While these traditional careers are being revamped, everyone
agrees that information technology is the fastest-growing field in
the new decade. Jobs related to the Internet may seem intimidating,
but, as Krannich says, ``information technology tends to service
all industries.''
 &HT;    It is also important to remember that there is much division of
labor in Web jobs. Some individuals produce content, the area that
requires the least amount of technical expertise. It entails, among
other duties, writing copy for Web sites, and often creating the
graphics.
 &HT;    In the area of Web design, individuals must have HTML and
graphic design experience, and are often responsible for sound,
animated graphics, page layouts and site architecture.
 &HT;    Web developers are probably highest in demand. These jobs
require knowledge of a variety of current database and business
applications, as well as standard programming languages such as
Java and C++.
 &HT;    Web sites also need managers, individuals who plan and budget,
and are responsible for site development and maintenance. And, like
all other businesses, Web sites offer careers in traditional jobs
such as sales and marketing.
 &HT;    The Web has also created a new breed of broker. Besides
traditional financial and analytical skills, online brokers must be
able to answer technical questions as easily as questions about
stock splits and industry statistics, and have good customer
service skills.
 &HT;    But Web jobs aren't the only fast-growth opportunities. Another
hot field is travel, according to Krannich, who says it is probably
the second-fastest growing industry after information technology.
Krannich says that careers in hospitality, rental cars and hotels
will boom because people have more spare time. And, Krannich adds,
those who hold these jobs have a high level of job satisfaction.
 &HT;    CareerPlanner.com's Robinson agrees that increased leisure time
is characteristic of the new millennium.
 &HT;    ``With longer lives and an increase in leisure time,'' he says,
``expect the entertainment industry to boom. There will be more
time for books, concerts, movies and television.''
 &HT;    One final long-term trend that will have an impact on future
careers is cocooning, a phenomenon in which people will want to
stay inside the safety, security and comfort of their homes, cars,
offices and gated communities. The result is that people will do
more from their homes, and that careers involving home
entertainment systems and home remodeling will grow, according to
Robinson.
 &HT;    And, if more and more people will be staying home, the success
of broadband, a new technological breakthrough, seems imminent.
Broadband is a technology that merges the computer and the
television set. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates that 73 million
homes will have access by 2008. Information architects will be
needed to organize and present its content. The training is similar
to that of online information design.
 &HT;    Krannich points out the obvious: ``Although technical skills
will not be required in every twenty-first century career, jobs
will be very technologically oriented.''

THE POWER OF THE NATIVE-AMERICAN VOTE

 By KAREN LINCOLN MICHEL 
 &HT;    Albuquerque, the city that many Southwest Indians call home, was
the place presidential candidates were invited to speak last month
about their stand on Native-American issues.
 &HT;    The American Indian Chamber of Commerce of New Mexico publicized
the forum nationally and persuaded CBS correspondent Hattie Kaufman
_ the highest profile Native broadcast journalist _ to moderate.
 &HT;    Everything was set. But the only candidate who traveled to
Albuquerque for the event was Green Party candidate Ralph Nader,
who appeared with his running mate, Winona LaDuke, a Native-rights
activist, and White Earth Chippewa from northern Minnesota.
 &HT;    In Indian Country, that's like holding a special ceremony for
faraway dignitaries and only your family shows up.
 &HT;    Ouch.
 &HT;    Before it turned into a platform for the Green Party, the forum
raised the question of why politicians continue to ignore
Native-America.
 &HT;    The small voting block certainly plays into it. In a population
of more than 2 million, where the median age is 26, more than half
of American-Indians and Alaska Natives are of voting age. A
potential block of 1 million-plus votes seems to be considered
nothing by Al Gore and George W. Bush. But if they expect to
represent all of America, the native vote is nothing to overlook _
even if only a fraction of them are registered voters.
 &HT;    In Arizona, 56,946 Americans-Indians registered to vote as
Democrats in 1998, according to the Democratic National Committee.
There are no comparisons for American-Indians voting Republican by
the Republican National Committee.
 &HT;    Some American-Indian politicos say American-Indians made all the
difference in the outcome of the 1996 presidential election in
Arizona. Clinton and Gore narrowly defeated Republican candidates
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp by 2 percent, or by 31,215 votes, of the
1.38 million ballots cast.
 &HT;    Although voting records do not distinguish race or ethnicity, a
tally of precincts within the Navajo Reservation _ the largest of
Arizona's 20 Indian tribes _ showed the Clinton-Gore ticket won 51
percent of the 24,907 votes cast as compared to Dole-Kemp's 37
percent.
 &HT;    It seems Al Gore should have remembered that before snubbing the
American-Indian business community in one of the largest urban
Indian centers in the Southwest.
 &HT;    It is no secret that American-Indians historically have aligned
themselves with the Democratic Party. Although the number of
Native-American Republicans is slowly on the rise, Native-American
Democrats far outnumber them.
 &HT;    Since gaining the right to vote with the 1924 Indian Citizenship
Act _ and later for some tribes, while still others refuse U.S.
citizenship _ American Indians as a group have favored Democrats.
 &HT;    The DNC says that over the past 20 years, roughly 85 percent of
American-Indian voters have cast ballots for Democrats in national
elections. And when tribes contribute financially to political
parties, most of those dollars wind up in the coffers of the
Democratic Party and its candidates.
 &HT;    But if Gore and other Democrats continue to take that loyalty
for granted, we could see a shift in support at a time when tribes
are becoming politically astute.
 &HT;    The growth of Indian gaming has allowed ``gaming tribes'' to
contribute monetarily to the political process. And tribes
nationwide have banded together in some cases to lobby Congress on
certain bills.
 &HT;    The Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington, D.C.-based
independent research company that tracks campaign contributions,
considers American-Indians successful in their ability to make
their political donations pay off.
 &HT;    A spokeswoman for the center said they have noticed a steady
increase in lobbying efforts in recent years and an increase in
overall involvement by tribes that engage in gaming.
 &HT;    When I looked closely into this subject in 1998, tribes had
rallied congressional support to defeat measures that would have
undermined tribal sovereignty.
 &HT;    Among the proposals that died were efforts to tax revenues of
tribes, require tribes to waive sovereign immunity against law
suits in exchange for federal funds, and require legal actions
against tribal governments to be heard in federal courts rather
than tribal courts.
 &HT;    Statistics gathered by the center show that gaming tribes
contributed more than $1.9 million to political campaigns and
parties in the 1995-1996 election cycle. Of that total, 85 percent
benefited Democrats.
 &HT;    The 1995-1996 total was more than 2.5 times greater than that
during the 1993-1994 election cycle, when gaming tribes anted up
$585,400 in hard and soft money contributions and Political Action
Committee donations. Nearly 79 percent of the total combined
contributions went to Democrats.
 &HT;    That doesn't sound like a lot of money in American politics. But
tribes appear to be making their contributions work for them.
 &HT;    Generations ago, a war party might have been sent out to track
down Gore and Bush for insulting and humiliating the Southwest
tribes. We're more civilized today. We'll take a stand at the polls
and, in the meantime, try to lobby them to death.

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Gains in workplace equality for gay and lesbian Americans have
been ``rapid and remarkable,'' says Kim Mills, education director
of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest political
organization.
 &HT;    ``The progress shows no signs of abating,'' she says. ``In many
workplaces we've gone beyond the basics of a nondiscrimination
policy, domestic-partners health-insurance benefits and a
sanctioned employee resource group to diversity training at all
levels of the corporation, including sexual orientation and gender
identity. This includes respectful and appropriate marketing to our
community and financial commitments to our organizations.''
 &HT;    Mills, the author of HRC's published report, ``The State of the
Workplace,'' visited Boston to address a monthly dinner meeting of
the Greater Boston Business Council, or GBBC.
 &HT;    GBBC, a gay and lesbian professional and business organization,
promotes visibility of gays in the workforce, providing positive
images.
 &HT;    Mills heads up WorkNet, an HRC project that collects, analyzes
and distributes _ free of charge _ information to assist employees
and employers in implementing and tracking policies that ensure
equal treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender workers.
WorkNet includes the most extensive database of U.S. employers who
implement nondiscrimination policies that cover sexual orientation
and domestic-partnership benefits.
 &HT;    Mills' statement that ``progress has been rapid and
remarkable,'' is no exaggeration. In March, WorkNet documented an
impressive 3,402 U.S. employers who offer domestic-partner health
insurance.
 &HT;    ``From the end of last year until mid-March, 117 companies
started providing health-insurance benefits,'' Mills says. ``That's
a rate of about nine a week.''
 &HT;    There are currently 70 ``Fortune 500'' companies that provide
health insurance for domestic-partners. Employers offering
equal-benefits include American Airlines, American Express, Apple
Computer, AT&AMP;T, Eastman Kodak, General Mills, IBM, Marriott,
Mattel, Walt Disney and Xerox.
 &HT;    ``One of the incredible things about workplace advocacy is
seeing the progress, the quantifiable data that show how far we've
come,'' Mills says.
 &HT;    In 1982, the New York City-based Village Voice newspaper became
the first employer to offer domestic-partner health-insurance
benefits. For most of the 1980s, however, only a handful of
employers followed suit. By 1990, fewer than two dozen employers
implemented such a policy.
 &HT;    In 1991, however, the Cambridge-based Lotus Development Corp.,
then an independent company, raised the stakes in the information
technology sector, becoming the first publicly held corporation to
add domestic-partner benefits.
 &HT;    Fast forward to late 1999. Since then, here's been a virtual
explosion in the numbers of employers in 40 states who offering
domestic-partner health insurance. California, Massachusetts and
New York _ each with more than 100 employers _ lead the way. The
District of Columbia, Illinois and Pennsylvania are not far behind,
according to HRC's database.
 &HT;    Today, domestic-partner benefits are rated the most effective
recruitment tool for executives and the third most effective for
managers and line workers, according to a 1999 survey by the
Society for Human Resource Management.
 &HT;    Behind these impressive gains is the city of San Francisco. In
1996, San Francisco passed an equal-benefits ordinance _ the
nation's first _ which mandated that any contractor doing business

 &HT;    HRC's WorkNet project can't achieve workplace equality alone.
That requires an effort by all gay and lesbian Americans to make

stay inside the safety, security and comfort of their homes, cars,
offices and gated communities. The result is that people will do
more from their homes, and that careers involving home
entertainment systems and home remodeling will grow, according to
Robinson.
 &HT;    And, if more and more people will be staying home, the success
of broadband, a new technological breakthrough, seems imminent.
Broadband is a technology that merges the computer and the
television set. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates that 73 million
homes will have access by 2008. Information architects will be
needed to organize and present its content. The training is similar
to that of online information design.
 &HT;    Krannich points out the obvious: ``Although technical skills
will not be required in every twenty-first century career, jobs
will be very technologically oriented.''

 By KAREN LINCOLN MICHEL 
 &HT;    Albuquerque, the city that many Southwest Indians call home, was
the place presidential candidates were invited to speak last month
about their stand on Native-American issues.
 &HT;    The American Indian Chamber of Commerce of New Mexico publicized
the forum nationally and persuaded CBS correspondent Hattie Kaufman
_ the highest profile Native broadcast journalist _ to moderate.
 &HT;    Everything was set. But the only candidate who traveled to
Albuquerque for the event was Green Party candidate Ralph Nader,
who appeared with his running mate, Winona LaDuke, a Native-rights
activist, and White Earth Chippewa from northern Minnesota.
 &HT;    In Indian Country, that's like holding a special ceremony for
faraway dignitaries and only your family shows up.
 &HT;    Ouch.
 &HT;    Before it turned into a platform for the Green Party, the forum
raised the question of why politicians continue to ignore
Native-America.
 &HT;    The small voting block certainly plays into it. In a population
of more than 2 million, where the median age is 26, more than half
of American-Indians and Alaska Natives are of voting age. A
potential block of 1 million-plus votes seems to be considered
nothing by Al Gore and George W. Bush. But if they expect to
represent all of America, the native vote is nothing to overlook _
even if only a fraction of them are registered voters.
 &HT;    In Arizona, 56,946 Americans-Indians registered to vote as
Democrats in 1998, according to the Democratic National Committee.
There are no comparisons for American-Indians voting Republican by
the Republican National Committee.
 &HT;    Some American-Indian politicos say American-Indians made all the
difference in the outcome of the 1996 presidential election in
Arizona. Clinton and Gore narrowly defeated Republican candidates
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp by 2 percent, or by 31,215 votes, of the
1.38 million ballots cast.
 &HT;    Although voting records do not distinguish race or ethnicity, a
tally of precincts within the Navajo Reservation _ the largest of
Arizona's 20 Indian tribes _ showed the Clinton-Gore ticket won 51
percent of the 24,907 votes cast as compared to Dole-Kemp's 37
percent.
 &HT;    It seems Al Gore should have remembered that before snubbing the
American-Indian business community in one of the largest urban
Indian centers in the Southwest.
 &HT;    It is no secret that American-Indians historically have aligned
themselves with the Democratic Party. Although the number of
Native-American Republicans is slowly on the rise, Native-American
Democrats far outnumber them.
 &HT;    Since gaining the right to vote with the 1924 Indian Citizenship
Act _ and later for some tribes, while still others refuse U.S.
citizenship _ American Indians as a group have favored Democrats.
 &HT;    The DNC says that over the past 20 years, roughly 85 percent of
American-Indian voters have cast ballots for Democrats in national
elections. And when tribes contribute financially to political
parties, most of those dollars wind up in the coffers of the
Democratic Party and its candidates.
 &HT;    But if Gore and other Democrats continue to take that loyalty
for granted, we could see a shift in support at a time when tribes
are becoming politically astute.
 &HT;    The growth of Indian gaming has allowed ``gaming tribes'' to
contribute monetarily to the political process. And tribes
nationwide have banded together in some cases to lobby Congress on
certain bills.
 &HT;    The Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington, D.C.-based
independent research company that tracks campaign contributions,
considers American-Indians successful in their ability to make
their political donations pay off.
 &HT;    A spokeswoman for the center said they have noticed a steady
increase in lobbying efforts in recent years and an increase in
overall involvement by tribes that engage in gaming.
 &HT;    When I looked closely into this subject in 1998, tribes had
rallied congressional support to defeat measures that would have
undermined tribal sovereignty.
 &HT;    Among the proposals that died were efforts to tax revenues of
tribes, require tribes to waive sovereign immunity against law
suits in exchange for federal funds, and require legal actions
against tribal governments to be heard in federal courts rather
than tribal courts.
 &HT;    Statistics gathered by the center show that gaming tribes
contributed more than $1.9 million to political campaigns and
parties in the 1995-1996 election cycle. Of that total, 85 percent
benefited Democrats.
 &HT;    The 1995-1996 total was more than 2.5 times greater than that
during the 1993-1994 election cycle, when gaming tribes anted up
$585,400 in hard and soft money contributions and Political Action
Committee donations. Nearly 79 percent of the total combined
contributions went to Democrats.
 &HT;    That doesn't sound like a lot of money in American politics. But
tribes appear to be making their contributions work for them.
 &HT;    Generations ago, a war party might have been sent out to track
down Gore and Bush for insulting and humiliating the Southwest
tribes. We're more civilized today. We'll take a stand at the polls
and, in the meantime, try to lobby them to death.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It used to be known as ``Crab Island.'' Some local residents
even recall having to shut their doors to keep crabs from crawling
into their living rooms.
 &HT;    Most of the crabs are gone now from the tiny island of Vieques,
Puerto Rico. Why? Because of the toxic, destructive effects of
bombs blasted there over the last 60 years _ bombs sent by the U.S.
military, which uses the land for practice.
 &HT;    Environmentalists say Vieques' delicate coral reefs have been
largely obliterated. Long stretches of its once-pristine beaches
now stand littered with tons of shrapnel, unexploded shells,
discarded military hardware and even the radioactive debris of
bombs that the U.S. Defense Department now admits were tipped with
depleted uranium. Using uranium-tipped weapons is a direct
violation of Pentagon rules.
 &HT;    Carlos Zenon, a local fisherman and activist, says the job of
supporting his family in the poor, remote community has been made
far more difficult by the island's six-decade ``military
occupation.''
 &HT;    Like most of the island's 9,600 residents, Zenon wants the
bombing range shut down. And he vehemently opposed U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno's decision to order federal agents to expel more
than 200 protesters from Camp Garcia on Vieques on May 4.
 &HT;    Some of the protesters had been camping there for nearly a year
in a stubborn show of civil disobedience against the U.S.
military's use of a 33,000-acre swath on the island.
 &HT;    Protests increased after the death of David Sanes Rodriguez, a
civilian guard at the base, who was killed about a year ago when a
fighter pilot accidentally dropped a bomb on him.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Zenon repeated the longstanding
complaints of Vieques' residents _ that the bombing has crippled
the local fishing industry and stymied tourism and other economic
development. Unemployment hovers around 50 percent.
 &HT;    Many locals also complain of health problems, including higher
cancer rates, which they believe are linked to the island's
environmental degradation.
 &HT;    But David Sanes Rodriguez's death was the last straw.
 &HT;    Even though Reno has cleared the beaches and sent the protesters
packing, the island's dispute with the Defense Department is still
not resolved _ and it's far from over.
 &HT;    Soon after the expulsion of the protesters from Camp Garcia,
Zenon told me that his sons, Cacimar and Pedro, protested the
conditions by hiding in secret camouflaged shelters somewhere
inside the boundaries of the bombing range.
 &HT;    Later, a federal magistrate issued arrest warrants for the
brothers _ even as the Navy's destroyer USS Stump and Navy A-4
Skyhawks began shelling Vieques with non-exploding ``dummy'' bombs.
 &HT;    Immediately after Reno raided the beaches, a broad coalition of
Puerto Rican church officials, activists and political leaders
vowed to continue fighting until they kick the Navy out of Vieques.
 &HT;    Since then, dozens of protesters have been arrested for
trespassing on the bombing range. Federal authorities say the
protesters could face stiff fines and up to 10 years in prison.
 &HT;    Recently, the bombing range's opponents lost a key ally. Pedro
Rossello, the governor of Puerto Rico, is being roundly criticized
for backing a decision by President Clinton in January to permit
the resumption of limited bombing exercises on Vieques.
 &HT;    According to Clinton's plan, no live ammunition will be used _
at least not unless local residents vote in a referendum to allow
that to happen.
 &HT;    To help persuade the residents that it was a good idea to allow
the bombing to resume, Clinton promised about $90 million in
special economic assistance to the island.
 &HT;    The first $40 million installment could come this year or next,
depending on congressional approval. The remaining $50 million is
contingent upon a ``yes'' vote to let the Navy stay. Seems like a
fair bribe.
 &HT;    According to the White House plan, Vieques' voter referendum on
the issue is supposed to take place sometime in the next two or
three years. Opponents of the bombing range shouldn't count on it.
Clinton wants the issue to just go away.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the Republican leadership in Congress is already
pressing for ``live ammunition'' bombing to resume immediately.
 &HT;    In the meantime, some have labeled Rossello a ``traitor'' for
backing Clinton's proposal and for also enforcing the removal of
the protesters. It was Rossello who, during a U.S. Senate hearing
last fall, said that ``not one more bomb'' would fall on Vieques.
 &HT;    Rossello did betray the cause. It seems that when it served his
desire to boost his national reputation, Rossello was with the
Puerto Rican people, most of whom want the Navy out. But when he
began to ponder his immediate political future _ Rossello cannot
seek re-election as governor _ he buckled to political pressure
from the White House. If Gore wins the White House, Rossello will
most likely be rewarded.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Zenon says he and his family plan to keep
protesting.
 &HT;    ``As a father, I'm concerned about what may happen to my sons,''
he said. ``Yet there are so many Vieques families who have already
suffered that we're willing to pay the price.''

&HT;     `BLACK BOXES' FOR CARS RAISE PRIVACY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Black boxes'' for cars, a technology borrowed from the airline
industry, now are poised to help auto-accident investigators pin
the blame on drivers responsible for causing crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have
been equipped with a device similar to an airliner's black box, or
flight data recorder, which automatically records the vehicle's
speed, throttle setting, braking effort and engine rpm for each of
the five seconds leading to an air-bag deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, it was difficult to extract that information
from the car's air bag control module.
</P>
<P>
   But a California company in March began selling a device that
connects a car's onboard computer to a laptop computer to quickly
extract such key information from a crashed vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The $2,500 device _ called a Crash Data Retrieval System _ is
being marketed to police departments, insurance companies and
auto-rental agencies to help them reconstruct crashes to determine
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system lets investigators collect objective, accurate data
on crashes to enhance reconstruction (of accidents),'' said Jim
Zaleski, president of Santa Barbara-based Vetronix Corp., which
markets the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens the door to a new generation of understanding and
modeling automobile accidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vehicles that have the capability to provide such
data also can tell investigators whether the car's occupants were
wearing seatbelts and whether the passenger-side air bag had been
deactivated.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the data that the system gives to crash investigators
isn't new _ such information has been used for decades to
reconstruct accidents, said Phil Haseltine, president of the
Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety, an auto-industry funded
group.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators had to gather the information using other
sources, such as tire skid marks, in the past. Now they can get it
from the vehicle's onboard computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology isn't measuring anything new, but it is
measuring it more accurately than in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the engineering side, it will help the design engineer find
out whether safety systems work as well in real crashes as they do
in laboratory crash tests. I predict we will see crash data
recorders used by more automakers as they install more advanced
air-bag systems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Haseltine and others, including officials at General Motors,
say there are privacy issues that have kept the technology from
advancing as rapidly as it could have.
</P>
<P>
   The data that a police investigator or insurance adjuster
extracts from the car's air-bag control module could be translated
into hard evidence for use in prosecution of a driver who is at
fault in an accident, or for use by plaintiffs in lawsuits over
such accidents, critics warn.
</P>
<P>
   Vetronix says it is in negotiations with the California Highway
Patrol to provide the devices to its officers, and the company
plans to market the system aggressively to police agencies and
insurance companies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capability to use this information in a intrusive manner
is there, and we should all be vigilant to make sure nobody tries
to do that,'' Haseltine said. ``Manufacturers aren't putting these
systems in vehicles with the intention that just anyone would be
able to access the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving the technology to police investigators is a gray
area,'' he said. ``If a judge orders it in a court case, it can
eventually wind up in court. But it's likely that we will only see
that in very serious crashes with expensive litigation. I can't
imagine using it for every little fender-bender.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has a ``strict policy that the data belongs to
whoever owns or leases the vehicle, and it won't be accessed
without their consent,'' said Terry Rhadigan, the automaker's
safety spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Vetronix promotes the system as something investigators can
use almost immediately, at a crash site, to download the
information, and there are concerns that such a situation sometimes
might preclude getting a vehicle owner's permission.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus to record this information to aid crash
investigators came from the National Transportation Safety Board,
which recommended in 1997 that automakers develop onboard
collision-sensing and -recording devices.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has long required that such equipment be installed on
most modes of public transportation, including airliners, buses and
trains. But this is the first time the technology has been extended
to private passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   So-called recordable air-bag modules have been installed in many
General Motors vehicles since 1990, but it has just been recently
that the data from an air-bag deployment or near-deployment could
be easily downloaded for use by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is value to this data,'' GM's Rhadigan said. ``The more
we know about how our vehicles perform in the real world, the more
we can improve them. It's another way to aid in accident
reconstruction, along with eyewitness reports.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At present, the Vetronix system is designed to download the
information only from late-model GM vehicles, and Vetronix has
obtained exclusive rights from GM to market a system to retrieve
the data from those cars.
</P>
<P>
   Those vehicles include the 1998 Buick Park Avenue and most '98
Cadillacs; most 1999 Buicks and Cadillacs, the Chevrolet Corvette
and Camaro, and the Pontiac Firebird; and nearly all 2000 model
Buicks, Cadillacs, Oldsmobiles, Pontiacs, Chevrolet cars and trucks
(including sport-utilities), GMC trucks and sport-utilities, the
Isuzu Hombre pickup, and the Saturn S-series cars.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers, including the Ford Motor Co., have air-bag
control modules that record the same information. Vetronix says its
system can be readily adapted to read the data from the other
manufacturers' vehicles as soon as those automakers release the
technical data necessary to develop the retrieval software.
</P>
<P>
   Vetronix also plans to develop software in concert with GM to
retrieve the data from air-bag-equipped GM cars dating to 1990,
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For $2,495, Vetronix provides the crash data retrieval module
and Windows-based software, along with the necessary cables to
connect the device to the vehicle and a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The software puts the data into graphs that can be printed out,
showing the vehicle's speed and other data for each of the five
seconds preceding the air-bag deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential impacts of this product are immense, since about
18,000 tow-away crashes occur daily,'' Zaleski said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the system is tied to the air-bag activation computer,
and manufacturers such as GM don't see the technology evolving into
a full-scale black box setup like that used in airliners, Rhadigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In planes, there is a flight data recorder that keeps track of
the aircraft's physical movements, and a separate cockpit voice
recorder that picks up whatever the pilots say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the automobile system used in just this air-bag
application,'' Rhadigan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ever want people to think we're going to get to the
point where we record conversations and other things that occur in
airplanes. Those are pretty sophisticated devices.''

the local fishing industry and stymied tourism and other economic
development. Unemployment hovers around 50 percent.
 &HT;    Many locals also complain of health problems, including higher
cancer rates, which they believe are linked to the island's
environmental degradation.
 &HT;    But David Sanes Rodriguez's death was the last straw.
 &HT;    Even though Reno has cleared the beaches and sent the protesters
packing, the island's dispute with the Defense Department is still
not resolved _ and it's far from over.
 &HT;    Soon after the expulsion of the protesters from Camp Garcia,
Zenon told me that his sons, Cacimar and Pedro, protested the
conditions by hiding in secret camouflaged shelters somewhere
inside the boundaries of the bombing range.
 &HT;    Later, a federal magistrate issued arrest warrants for the
brothers _ even as the Navy's destroyer USS Stump and Navy A-4
Skyhawks began shelling Vieques with non-exploding ``dummy'' bombs.
 &HT;    Immediately after Reno raided the beaches, a broad coalition of
Puerto Rican church officials, activists and political leaders
vowed to continue fighting until they kick the Navy out of Vieques.
 &HT;    Since then, dozens of protesters have been arrested for
trespassing on the bombing range. Federal authorities say the
protesters could face stiff fines and up to 10 years in prison.
 &HT;    Recently, the bombing range's opponents lost a key ally. Pedro
Rossello, the governor of Puerto Rico, is being roundly criticized
for backing a decision by President Clinton in January to permit
the resumption of limited bombing exercises on Vieques.
 &HT;    According to Clinton's plan, no live ammunition will be used _
at least not unless local residents vote in a referendum to allow
that to happen.
 &HT;    To help persuade the residents that it was a good idea to allow
the bombing to resume, Clinton promised about $90 million in
special economic assistance to the island.
 &HT;    The first $40 million installment could come this year or next,
depending on congressional approval. The remaining $50 million is
contingent upon a ``yes'' vote to let the Navy stay. Seems like a
fair bribe.
 &HT;    According to the White House plan, Vieques' voter referendum on
the issue is supposed to take place sometime in the next two or
three years. Opponents of the bombing range shouldn't count on it.
Clinton wants the issue to just go away.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the Republican leadership in Congress is already
pressing for ``live ammunition'' bombing to resume immediately.
 &HT;    In the meantime, some have labeled Rossello a ``traitor'' for
backing Clinton's proposal and for also enforcing the removal of
the protesters. It was Rossello who, during a U.S. Senate hearing
last fall, said that ``not one more bomb'' would fall on Vieques.
 &HT;    Rossello did betray the cause. It seems that when it served his
desire to boost his national reputation, Rossello was with the
Puerto Rican people, most of whom want the Navy out. But when he
began to ponder his immediate political future _ Rossello cannot
seek re-election as governor _ he buckled to political pressure
from the White House. If Gore wins the White House, Rossello will
most likely be rewarded.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Zenon says he and his family plan to keep
protesting.
 &HT;    ``As a father, I'm concerned about what may happen to my sons,''
he said. ``Yet there are so many Vieques families who have already
suffered that we're willing to pay the price.''

&HT;     HOW TO GET GOOD AEROBIC EXERCISE WITHOUT ACHES, PAINS

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tom Fox jogged for more than a decade before his
knees and feet gave out. For the past six months, the retired state
educational administrator has opted for a less jarring type of
exercise _ water aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this much better,'' said Fox, 63. ``It's a good workout
and the impact on the joints is much less.''
</P>
<P>
   More people are turning to the water as a way to stay in shape
without the aches and pains that go along with traditional types of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big benefit is, it's low-impact,'' said Rorie Kerns, a
water and fitness instructor in the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, however, still associate low impact with little
effort and little reward. Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say low-impact exercises, such as water aerobics,
cycling and walking are as effective over the long term as some
other kinds of exercises at building fitness and preventing
osteoporosis, a problem of bone-loss, especially among older women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any type of exercise that stresses the skeleton in some way is
beneficial,'' said Dr. J. David Abraham of Northeast Orthopaedics
in Albany. ``Some exercises just give you more bang for your
buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Running and weight-lifting are good examples of high-impact
exercises that put a lot of strain on the skeleton and,
consequently, help build the bone density that prevents
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such exercises often increase the potential for injuries,
including stress fractures and tendinitis, problems that can derail
a fitness plan for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a trade-off that way,'' said Dr. Shankar Das of
the Orthopaedic Group, also in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the reasons physicians are increasingly steering
people toward the water, especially those with arthritis or those
who are new to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot fewer injuries in the water,'' said Dr. Robert
Cooley, the chief of orthopedics at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady.
``It's a great alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Joba, 83, attributes her good health in part to a
regimen that includes at least one pool session a week. On other
days, she enjoys walking in her hometown of Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do arms, legs and weights,'' she said. ``We're huffing and
puffing. We feel great afterward. It's tiring but you feel
energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerns, 34, believes many younger people continue to look at
water aerobics as something for senior citizens or injured
athletes. But fitness classes in the water have become more
challenging in recent years with more of an emphasis on resistance
and weights, using specially designed dumbbells and flotation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Oh, it's in the water, you're not going to get a
workout,''' she said. ``A lot of people don't realize what a great
workout it is.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The key to reaping the fitness and bone-building benefits from
any exercise program is consistency. ``The problem most people have
when they start an exercise program is they don't stick with it,''
Das said.
</P>
<P>
   Add the potential for injury and pain, as is the case with some
high-impact exercises, and you have another reason to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who haven't exercised previously, water exercise
allows them to participate and minimize the risk of injury. This
allows them to get hooked without injury or pain,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   Because water aerobics puts less strain on the skeleton than
jogging or walking, Cooley likes to see people mix in other
activities, like walking, to maximize fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pushing a lot more cross-training,'' he said. ``It keeps
people healthy if you do a variety of activities. You're less apt
to injure yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has tried water aerobics, Fox said he doesn't miss
the pain from jogging. And he believes his weekly pool classes have
helped keep him healthy enough to exercise regularly, both at the
local YMCA and at home in his yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's better,'' he said.

&HT;     MAJOLICA POTTERY HAS ROOTS STEEPED IN THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Majolica is a type of glazed jewel-toned pottery associated with
Spain, Italy and Mexico. It was widely produced in Europe and
America in the second half of the 19th century, but its roots are
much older.
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, a collection of majolica (pronounced
ma-JOL-e-ka) signified affluence and good taste. Majolica also was
considered to be the perfect gift for important occasions such as
engagements, weddings or births.
</P>
<P>
   The process of making majolica includes applying a tin (lead, on
early pieces) enamel to a fired piece of earthenware, forming a
white, opaque, porous surface on which a design is painted. The
most dominant themes are fauna and flora, especially leafy
patterns. The completed design is then coated with a transparent
glaze and the piece is fired again.
</P>
<P>
   A vast variety of the items made from majolica were fun and
humorous. Almost anything was made in majolica: teapots, tobacco
jars, smoking paraphernalia from ashtrays to match holders, butter
pats, oyster plates, mugs, platters and other dinnerware, figurals
and cuspidors. Dessert sets were very popular.
</P>
<P>
   Majolica was made originally by 14th-century potters and was
popularized in the mid-15th century. It takes its name from the
Spanish island of Majorca, from where it was exported to Italy
during the Italian Renaissance. It soon made its way across Europe
and eventually to America, where it debuted at the Philadelphia
Centennial Exhibition in 1876.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the majolica made in the 19th and 20th centuries
was from a mold. The more intricate the pattern, the more
desirable, especially pieces that feature raised decorations.
</P>
<P>
   This decorative pottery fell from fashion in the early 1900s.
But it has been making a comeback since the 1960s. Because of its
popularity, reproductions abound. Many potters are making majolica
today, but collectors covet early pieces.
</P>
<P>
   As with most popular antiques, the cost of a piece of majolica
is much higher than its original price. Pieces may cost anywhere
from $35 for a small plate to thousands of dollars for a set of
dishes. Look for bargains at flea markets, yard or garage sales.
</P>
<P>
   Cost depends on the condition, size, quality, maker, pattern or
uniqueness. Among the more familiar names of majolica makers were
Wedgwood, Holdcraft, Minton and Etruscan. Most majolica is
unmarked, but the European pieces often feature a mark or a series
of numbers pressed in before firing.
</P>
<P>
   Majolica is soft and porous and chips easily, so handle it with
care.

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JEFF SHEEHY AND TOM COATES  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ South African President Thabo Mbeki is scheduled
to travel to San Francisco later in the week after wrapping up his
state visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the subject of great controversy since the
publication of a letter he wrote last month that raises questions
about the nature of the AIDS epidemic sweeping Africa and the
efficacy of applying Western treatment models there.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this letter, many have suggested Mbeki does not
believe that the human immunodeficiency syndrome, or HIV, causes
AIDS. However, that's not what he says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he charts a journey toward truth that Africa must
undertake in its response to HIV. Mbeki contrasts the nature of the
AIDS epidemic in the West to that in Africa. In the West, he says,
exposure to HIV has resulted largely through homosexual contact. In
Africa, HIV/AIDS is transmitted predominantly through heterosexual
intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations reports that about 2 million Africans died of
AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in 1998 and that 23
million Africans are carriers of HIV. Death rates from AIDS are
declining in the West, yet rising in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki draws certain conclusions from these facts.
</P>
<P>
   First, ``whatever lessons we . . . may draw from the West . . .
a simple superimposition of Western experience on African reality
would be absurd and illogical.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``our urgent task is to respond to the specific threat
that faces us as Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, ``We will not, ourselves, condemn our own people to death
by giving up the search for specific and targeted responses to the
specifically African incidence of HIV/AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this controversial? Perhaps, but Mbeki's willingness to
educate himself and his government and to consider tailored
responses to the epidemic does not deserve the near hysterical
avalanche of criticism it has received.
</P>
<P>
   Have we forgotten our own history? How grateful would Americans
confronted with AIDS have been if previous presidents had
approached the epidemic with the same intensity and seriousness?
</P>
<P>
   Some of what Mbeki says is of great concern. He has decided that
his government will not provide, at this time, AZT to HIV-positive
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, he is sympathetic to the dissidents who say HIV
does not cause AIDS. It is understandable that, as a former
dissident, Mbeki is sympathetic to those who challenge authority.
And some of his choices are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   However, we know needle exchange programs halt the spread of
AIDS and do not encourage illicit drug use. Still, senior American
policymakers refuse to support needle exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Note the American experience. Dissidents in the streets, in
government and in the medical establishment propelled the battle
against AIDS. It took the active cooperation of the affected
communities to stem the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Communities and individuals self-regulated their sexual
practices. The medical establishment underwent unprecedented
changes as the affected communities and individuals demanded a
partnership with health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health now includes AIDS activists on
its councils and peer review groups, and other disease-related
research reviews now include relevant community activists. The
message was clear: Business as usual could not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   A significant part of our success has come by empowering those
affected by HIV/AIDS. Yet this attempt by an African leader to
articulate a uniquely African response is damned. A democratically
elected leader of a people whose struggle for freedom is rightly
celebrated is now treated with disrespect bordering on contempt.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has just declared AIDS a national and global
security threat. Our total spending on HIV/AIDS in 2000 is
approximately $11 billion. Yet only $254 million has been proposed
to fight AIDS in the developing world. Pharmaceutical companies are
pledging $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Mbeki compares these dollar figures with the estimated
numbers of people with HIV/AIDS in the United States versus the
numbers in Africa, is he wrong to be skeptical?
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is that the savage spread of HIV in Africa is
avoidable. The United Nations estimates that an annual expenditure
of $2.5 billion on prevention would cut the number of new
infections by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   We could be making condoms, sex education, explicit
advertisements and inexpensive STD drugs available now.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the commitment of $1.5 billion to train the Colombian
army to chase drug runners? Let us not get frustrated with Mbeki.
He has a right to be frustrated with us.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Africa must find its own way. We must support leaders like Mbeki
who have the vision and courage to confront the grim challenge
facing them.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the Western scientific establishment who wish to become
engaged in the politics of AIDS in Africa should push their
countries to accept their responsibility toward our fellow
residents of this planet.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, both East and West poured resources into
Africa to support friendly regimes. Can we not demand our societies
show the same interest in supporting African governments, many of
them now democracies, in their struggle to find a way to avert this
catastrophe?
</P>
<P>
   Since President Mbeki wrote his letter, the Clinton
administration has responded in several ways: declaring AIDS a
security threat, allowing patented drugs to be manufactured by
African countries and boosting spending are all important actions.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's letter succeeded in getting our attention. All the same,
these measures only feebly begin to address the horrifying reality
that Mbeki and all of Africa face.
</P>
<P>
   When HIV has gone the way of smallpox and the World Health
Organization is deciding what to do with the last vial of this
lethal virus, historians will be writing about all of the good
things that the United States has done in the fight against
HIV/AIDS. America's research is unparalleled. We have made a
commitment to the care of people with HIV/AIDS. Nevertheless,
future historians will rightly take us to task for the genocide
that we are allowing to happen in Africa.

&HT;     GIRLS GOING CRAZY OVER TRADING CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELAINE ARADILLAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A new trading card game on the market has
adolescent girls going crazy. Boy crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Card magnate Decipher Inc. has tapped a nerve in the young male
market with games inspired by ``Star Wars,'' and now, girls who
want to have a little fun can trade Chris from California for Kevin
in Minnesota with the Boy Crazy! game cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys get whatever they want, like WWF or sports trading cards,
and girls are supposed to get games about math, women in history
and role models,'' said Leslie Hellerman, marketing and public
relations manager for Boy Crazy!, based in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Hellerman said young people should be learning about subjects
that are educational and good for them _ referred to as ``spinach''
in the marketing industry _ but sometimes girls need to feel good
about other things they are interested in, like boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is providing what they want, and that's why Boy Crazy!
is going through the roof,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every girl is insane about Boy Crazy! cards. San Antonio
middle school student Brenda Donahue, 12, was at North Star Mall
recently when Decipher held a casting call for young Texans to
appear on next year's gaming cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have better things to spend my money on,'' Donahue said,
rolling her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so sixth-grade,'' added her friend Michelle Franco, a
seventh-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Crazy!, featuring boys from all over the country, was
launched on Valentine's Day 1999, but has really taken off in the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Toy Manufacturers of America, an industry trade
association, the trading card industry shipped $820 million worth
of cards to retail stores in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon sort of opened the door for girls to begin trading.
Boy Crazy! has filled that next step for them,'' Hellerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are sold in packs of nine for a retail cost of $3.99.
Each card showcases a particular boy, with his photo and personal
information, and what he sees as ideal traits in a girl. There are
363 boys featured on the cards. The game is intended for girls 10
and older.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game has one girl secretly choosing the guy
she would most like to go out with, based on the information listed
on the cards. Her friends try to guess which boy she picked and
explain why.
</P>
<P>
   If a girl doesn't find the boy of her dreams in her pack of
cards, she can go online at www.boycrazy.com and peruse more than
300 virtual cards featuring boys from all over the country. The
interactive site receives more than a million visits a day.
</P>
<P>
   Decipher Inc. has decided to expand its boundaries and is
searching globally for its next edition of boy cards. In the
upcoming months, Hellerman and her public relations team will be
searching for boys in Toronto, Paris and London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what language you speak or where you live.
It's an international stage that girls go through _ that stage of
boy-craziness,'' she said.

   TAKING THE SEDATION OUT OF VALIUM-LIKE DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   Valium without the drowsy side effects? Separating the calming
effect from the dulling one may pave the way to a more refined
drug, says new research.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-anxiety drugs from the Valium family (benzodiazepine) are
some of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. When they
came on the market in the 1950s, they were a vast improvement over
barbiturates, which could be habit-forming and had other side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, benzodiazepines are far from perfect, and patients
still face side effects like sedation, motor coordination problems
and the risk of dependence. But now researchers have managed to
lower the anxiety level of mice without dulling their senses. They
hope to use similar techniques to develop anti-anxiety drugs for
humans without the undesirable side effects. (500 words. Slugged

   VIBRATING TOOLS AND SMOKING DON'T MIX

</P>
<P>
   The disease -- called vibration-induced white finger, or
occupational Raynaud's phenomenon -- occurs when the vibration of
tools like chainsaws and jackhammers make the user's hands

   CONTAMINANT LEVELS LOWER IN FARM-RAISED FISH

</P>

   Researchers at Purdue University tested farm-raised catfish,

</P>
<P>
   But a new reader-friendly publication aims to change that. The
publication takes the medical information used by oncologists in

   MORE PEOPLE FACE THROAT CANCER RISK
</P>
<P>
   Significantly more people who suffer from a precancerous

cancer than previously thought, American researchers now say.
</P>
<P>
   Associated with chronic heartburn, Barrett's esophagus affects
about 2 million people in the United States. It develops when the
regurgitation of stomach contents stimulates changes in the lining
of the esophagus -- the tube that carries food from the mouth to
the stomach -- so that it resembles the lining of the intestines.

THE LEGACY OF JOHN WESLEY, THE INADVERTENT FOUNDER OF METHODISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ While controversial issues were being debated last week
at the United Methodist General Conference in Cleveland, I was in
London looking for the heart of Methodism.
</P>
<P>
   My goal was to worship at Wesley's Chapel, the most famous of
the churches established by John Wesley, the inadvertent founder of
Methodism in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   I say inadvertent because Wesley, a 5-foot-4 cleric who
alienated church powers by fervently preaching to coal miners and
other English working people, never intended to start a new
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   He remained a priest in the Church of England throughout his 88
years. But English leaders gradually closed their church doors to
him. So, he began preaching outdoors under trees and in fields and
eventually built his own chapels.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley's actions coincided with a spiritual awakening in England
and the United States and resulted in the creation of Methodist
churches around the world.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to attend church where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   I was due to arrive in London early Sunday, but my flight was
more than an hour late, meaning I would have a hard time getting
into London in time for worship at Wesley's Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I decided to give it a try. It was almost noon by the
time I arrived by underground train at the Old Street station, near
Wesley's Chapel. I walked the few hundred yards to the church, sure
the worship would be concluded.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised to find the historic chapel filled with people
singing hymns and preparing to celebrate Communion. I slipped into
a back pew and was greeted by a man who handed me a hymn book.
</P>
<P>
   Male voices dominated the hymns, including some written by
Charles Wesley, brother of John. Charles wrote more than 5,500
hymns, including ``Hark the Herald Angels, Sing.'' On the Sunday I
attended, parishioners sang ``Just As I Am,'' ``Amazing Grace'' and
``Up From the Grave He Arose.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve young people in white robes were baptized by the pastor,
the Rev. Leslie J. Griffiths, a former president of the British
Methodist Conference who has been pastor for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has brought us alive,'' longtime member David Tee said
after the service.
</P>
<P>
   While smiling and hugging parishioners after church, Griffiths
refused to take full credit for the church's resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energies were just waiting to be tapped,'' said Griffiths,
who, coincidentally, will be in Texas on Sept. 17 to speak at the
First United Methodist Church of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths has reached out to people of all nationalities who
live in inner-city London. They include natives of the Caribbean,
South Africa, Japan, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Bolivia and the
Philippines; some wear the traditional dress of their native lands.
</P>
<P>
   Times haven't always been so good to Wesley's Chapel. Back in
the 1970s, some even suggested boarding up the church, which was in
disrepair. One bizarre plan called for selling the church brick by
brick, perhaps to someone in the United States interested in the
historic place, said Tee, who also is church treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans already have the old London Bridge (now in Lake
Havasu City, Ariz.), and the old Queen Mary cruise ship (docked in
Long Beach, Calif.), so buying Wesley's Chapel didn't seem too
far-fetched,'' Tee said.
</P>
<P>
   But other Englishmen _ and many Americans, Australians and
people from other nations _ were outraged by such a thought. More
than 1 million pounds was raised to refurbish the historic chapel
and John Wesley's home next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Elizabeth came here for the first time in 1978 to
celebrate our improvements,'' Tee said.
</P>
<P>
   During a London twilight, I also visited another special place
for Methodists. It is on Aldersgate Street where Wesley, on May 24,
1738, had a spiritual rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   In his journal, Wesley writes about ``very unwillingly'' going
to a nighttime society meeting on Aldersgate Street and listening
to a reading from Martin Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the
Romans ``describing the change which God works in the heart through
faith in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt my heart strangely warmed,'' Wesley wrote. ``I felt I
did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance
was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved
me from the law of sin and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the place is marked by a flame-shaped plaque standing 10
feet high on an upper-level walkway of the huge Barbican Centre;
the walkway has been named John Wesley Way.
</P>
<P>
   As I stood there, my heart was strangely warmed, too, as I
realized that despite the excessive secularization of society, John
Wesley's dream of reaching out to all of God's people still is very
much alive.

&HT;     BIKE GIVES RIDERS SOME EXTRA JUICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   It's as quiet as a whisper, emits zero pollutants and transports
one person from Point A to Point B in relative comfort _ as long as
it's not raining outside and the weather is neither too hot nor too
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Forget gasoline, tune-ups and oil changes, but don't forget to
bring along an extension cord.
</P>
<P>
   That's because after you have ridden your new E-bike to work,
you will need to hook it up to the nearest electrical outlet to
recharge its battery for the ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the latest twist in the environmentally friendly,
politically correct commute: the electric bicycle, a product of a
company founded and owned by automotive icon Lee Iacocca.
</P>
<P>
   After a failed attempt to buy the Chrysler Corp. after his 1993
retirement as the automaker's chairman, Iacocca turned to
alternative transportation as his newest business endeavor,
founding EV Global Motors Co. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The E-bike, a retro-looking bicycle similar to the Schwinns of
the '50s, has regular pedals and seven gears, so it can go almost
anywhere on human power, with virtually no limitations.
</P>
<P>
   But it comes with something extra: a 400-watt electric motor
built into the hub of the rear wheel, which allows the bike to
coast along at speeds up to 15 mph with the rider doing nothing but
steering and maintaining balance. And it even has cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   Iacocca's company believes that more people will turn to the
E-bike for at least some of their transportation needs. And the
bikes are good for more than just campground use, the company
insists. In fact, the company is developing an entire line of small
electric vehicles, including a scooter, similar to a Vespa, a
three-wheel bike, a ``pedicab,'' with a bike seat for the driver
and two covered seats for passengers, and an ``NEV,'' which is
short for ``neighborhood electric vehicle,'' which looks like a
miniature sports car and seats two people.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at $995 (plus $49 destination charge) for the
E-bike's standard model. There are two other versions: the Comfort
model, which includes a suspension seat, rear cargo rack with tote
bag and curved handle bars for $1,109 plus destination charge; and
the top-of-the-line Touring model, with disc brakes and more cargo
capacity, for $1,345 plus destination fee.
</P>
<P>
   If that seems pricey for a bicycle, remember that this one helps
you along on those grueling hill-climbs, and it's still not as
expensive as some of the mountain bicycles that have become popular
with sport riders. Those can cost $3,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The E-bike operates from a 24-volt battery pack built into the
frame. The pack has a built-in charger that needs only to be
plugged into any standard electrical outlet for recharging _ which
takes 4.5 hours. The range on a charge is just under 20 miles for a
200-pound rider averaging 10 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the bike by doing some pedaling can extend that range
quite a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The bike can be used in one of three modes: all electric power
with no pedaling; motor and pedaling together; or just pedaling
alone. Even with the 23-pound battery pack installed, the bike
weighs just 67 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It has a headlight and taillight for night riding, and there
also is a horn. Using these electrical accessories heavily can
decrease the range between charges, however. They are powered by
the same battery that the motor uses.
</P>
<P>
   For indoor charging, the battery pack can be lifted quickly out
of the bike and carried by its own handle.
</P>
<P>
   The battery pack is good for about 350 recharges, or about 7,000
miles, the company says. Replacement batteries cost $100 each.

LET'S ABOLISH EFFORT TO HALT EXECUTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The anti-capital-punishment crowd is spinning its wheels again.
When they tire of mourning the state-imposed deaths of serial
killers and other homicidal maniacs, it seems, death-penalty
opponents enjoy dabbling in politics.
</P>
<P>
   So. The New Hampshire Senate approved a bill last week that
would ban capital punishment in the Granite State. The House passed
the ban in March.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately (for the future of civilized society as well as for
the people of New Hampshire), Gov. Jeanne Shaheen supports capital
punishment and has promised to veto this preposterous piece of
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is apparently academic, anyway, seeing as how there are
no prisoners residing on New Hampshire's Death Row, and the
population is not expected to increase in the near future.
According to news reports, New Hampshire had the lowest homicide
rate in the United States in 1998 _ and hasn't executed anyone
since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bill isn't needed and the governor will refuse to sign
it, why in the world did New Hampshire lawmakers waste the public's
time and money enacting it? Just to make a point, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   This is the state, after all, where voters handed
flash-in-the-pan presidential candidate John McCain a victory in
the Republican primary _ for no apparent reason except to make a
point.
</P>
<P>
   The point in this case might be found in the reaction of Richard
C. Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information
Center in Washington. Dieter was quoted by The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
   ``For a state to take a totally different direction and vote to
abolish it is an indication of legislative and popular change.
There's a longer road ahead, but New Hampshire might be a
bellwether of where the country is going.''
</P>
<P>
   A bellwether? That would mean that New Hampshire is ahead of the
curve _ that state after state will be rushing to abolish capital
punishment, and everyone will look back one day and say, ``Wow, New
Hampshire was really on top of that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, the next thing New Hampshire's legislators might want to do
is change the state's nickname from the ``Granite State'' to the
``Bellwether State.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary certainly
has been a bellwether over the years. Remember President Gary Hart?
President Paul Tsongas? President Pat Buchanan?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he didn't mean to say ``bellwether''; maybe he meant to
say ``death knell.''
</P>
<P>
   How wonderful it would be for the cause of justice in this
country if chronically out-of-step New Hampshire's attack on the
death penalty were to actually signal the beginning of the end for
the anti-capital-punishment movement. We don't need to abolish
capital punishment in America; we need to abolish the notion that
it ought to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Right-thinking Americans whose hearts bleed not for killers but
for victims of killers have no interest whatsoever in doing away
with the ultimate punishment for those who commit the ultimate
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted New Hampshire's governor:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some murders so heinous that the death penalty is an
appropriate punishment and, accordingly, I will veto this
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for Shaheen, a Democrat _ as opposed to, let's
say, the Republican governor of Illinois, George Ryan, who declared
a moratorium on executions after some Death Row inmates in his
state were able to raise doubts about their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash, folks: The purpose of the appeals process
in the criminal justice system is to give persons found guilty of a
crime the opportunity to prove their innocence _ and Death Row
inmates all across America get plenty of chances to do exactly
that.
</P>
<P>
   If criminal suspects are being unfairly convicted, then let's
take a look at the process that leads to conviction, not at the
punishment imposed on the guilty.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that innocent people are being executed in
this country. And there's no reason to pass laws dealing with a
problem that does not exist.

GONZO ROCK JOURNALIST LIVES ON IN NEW BIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when the word ``gonzo'' mattered _ when gonzo,
for a nation of young journalists who devoured Rolling Stone, Creem
and a few other pop-culture mags, was the end-all: To put yourself
into a story and live in the brightly reflected light of a rock 'n'
roll tour, or a bunch of Hell's Angels, or a presidential campaign,
was better than winning a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   How gonzo was Lester Bangs? In a brilliant, one-time-only
rock-and-journalism summit meeting, he actually brought a
typewriter onstage at a J. Geils Band concert and pecked away while
the band was doing its encore. Which is as close to Hunter S.
Thompson territory as a rock writer could get.
</P>
<P>
   Bangs (real name, too) hailed from California, hit his stride
with the Detroit-based Creem, wrote for numerous publications _
Rolling Stone, The Village Voice _ did an odd but wonderful book
with Paul Nelson about Rod Stewart, and died _ reportedly of a drug
overdose _ in his adopted home of New York in April 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been a serious _ even legendary _ partyer for years, known
for his love of booze and cough syrup, and though it was sad to
hear he was gone, it wasn't at all surprising, even to me, a
college student who had only known him by his work and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Bangs was only 33, but he was THE rock 'n' roll writer:
Influenced most by Jack Kerouac and jazz musician Charles Mingus,
he had the insight into how pop culture and pop music influenced
each other. He had a nose for sniffing out what was going to matter
in the next few months or years and was willing to throw himself
into it (such as punk rock), churned out copy like crazy, knew just
how far to put himself into a story without intruding, and could be
surly or tender in equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   And in his relatively short life, he altered forever how pop
music would be covered: He gave Cameron Crowe, then 15, his first
magazine assignment (an interview with Humble Pie), chronicled how
American cult artists such as the Stooges and Lou Reed gave birth
to punk, and in general hit whatever targets he aimed at. He also
left an indelible stamp on English writers such as Nick Kent and
Charles Shaar Murray _ and basically anyone who has come along
since.
</P>
<P>
   And now Bangs is the subject of a biography, Jim DeRogatis'
``Let It Blurt'' (Broadway Books; $15.95). You may be thinking,
what's the point of a biography about a music journalist? Aren't
journalists supposed to write about other people?
</P>
<P>
   That's usually true, but not here. DeRogatis, the pop music
critic at the Chicago Sun-Times, has written a lively,
well-researched book about a guy whose life mirrored the craziness
and excesses of the '70s, who was a victim and chronicler of his
times and the ever-shifting music scene that greatly influences
what you hear on the radio today.
</P>
<P>
   His story may have ended sadly, but he never quit caring about
music _ discovering it, sharing it, and remembering the impact that
a great rock 'n' roll song or album or concert can have on a young
mind.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Bangs' work is as important now as it was then; the
force of personality that he brought to his writing is largely
absent these days, when Rolling Stone has basically become Tiger
Beat and one of the big stories in the all-music issue of Texas
Monthly is a boring rehash of Bobby Fuller's death. The best rock
magazines these days, Mojo and Q, hail from England.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're going to Lesterworld, and you should, it's best to
also get the 1988 collection titled ``Psychotic Reactions and
Carburetor Dung'' (Vintage Books, $16) as a companion piece. Edited
by Greil Marcus, ``Psychotic'' features many of Bangs' best pieces
and clearly shows his wide-ranging talent.
</P>
<P>
   The article that came from his onstage throwdown with Geils is
included; you'll also find hilarious reviews of records by Chicago,
the Guess Who and Slade; essays on the Clash and Van Morrison's
``Astral Weeks''; his famous sparring sessions with Lou Reed; and,
at the end, a brilliant, heart-tugging short story based on the
lyrics to Rod Stewart's ``Maggie May.''
</P>
<P>
   That Bangs could do all this _ and do it all brilliantly _ tells
us just how much we lost when he finally gave out in 1982. As much
as when he was writing these pieces, Lester Bangs' erratic, sloppy
legacy stands apart.

&HT;     CHRYSLER'S COOL CRUISER HAS BROAD APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, I'll have to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser is just about the coolest-looking
car to come along since, probably, the Plymouth Prowler in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's not quite as cool as the Prowler, and not nearly
as exciting, from a purely performance standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, it's a lot more practical than the Prowler.
</P>
<P>
   And above all, it's affordable, something that the Prowler will
never be. It's much cooler-looking than a lot of cars that you
would pay several thousand dollars more for, such as the Honda
Accord or Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   We tested the entry-level automatic-transmission model, whose
bottom line was just $17,790, including $550 transportation. When
you consider that the average cost of a new car is more than
$20,000, the PT Cruiser rings up as a real bargain, especially when
you get such a large measure of coolness in the package.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this was not the top-of-the-line special edition
that lists for about $22,000, our test car was fairly
well-equipped. Besides the four-speed automatic transmission, it
came with air-conditioning, power windows, and an AM/FM/cassette
audio system, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of items I would have added to make it a bit
more practical: power door locks (preferably with remote control)
and cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   Those items are available _ DaimlerChrysler just didn't put them
on the car they provided us for the test drive. But this little
baby did draw crowds and turn heads everywhere I drove it. The
styling is a mix of street rod (a la the Prowler) and '40s panel
truck.
</P>
<P>
   The car's broad appeal reaches all ages, from children and teens
to aging baby boomers and even to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   That's the charm of the PT Cruiser, and why it will be a
resounding success.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a great car from a mechanical or performance
standpoint; it's really only a Dodge Neon underneath, and it comes
with just a 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower four-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   That is enough power to satisfy most everyday driving needs, but
it won't be enough to win many races. Still, the PT Cruiser can
seat up to five adults (four comfortably) and provide room in the
rear for stuff, such as luggage or sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For practical matters, it is a cross between a sport-utility
vehicle and a minivan, but there is no four-wheel drive available;
just like the Neon and most of the Dodge/Chrysler minivans, the PT
comes with front-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   An associate who drove our test car as we went to lunch one day
summed it up in one sentence: ``It's really a neat-looking vehicle,
but it reminds me of driving my minivan.''
</P>
<P>
   You could do worse, of course. There are a whole lot of us
driving our minivans around every day, but when was the last time
you saw someone's head spin around to take another look at a
minivan?
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are flocking to the PT Cruiser like nothing that has
come before it except, perhaps, the 1964-1/2 Ford Mustang. Not even
did Volkswagen's New Beetle, introduced a couple of years ago,
cause this much excitement in the automotive world. Dealers aren't
even taking orders right now because orders have outstripped
manufacturing capacity for the calendar year, even though the PT
was introduced only about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   But whether consumers will continue to clamor for the PT Cruiser
in the years to come remains to be seen, and will depend on how
well these first few hundred-thousand hold up in real-world use. If
they start falling apart after a few thousand miles and owners have
to spend lots of time shuffling their vehicles back to dealers for
repairs, no manner of coolness will sustain today's runaway sales.
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting the Cruiser is built well enough to keep its owners
happy, and that sales will continue to be brisk enough to keep
supplies low and demand high. And it will still be cool to own a PT
Cruiser _ unless, of course, everyone on your street has one, and
all of a sudden we get tired of seeing these cars everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle is compact outside. Overall length is just over 14
feet _ 5.3 inches shorter than the Ford Focus compact sedan. But
inside there is 120 cubic feet of space, nearly as much as a
full-size sedan. There are two bucket seats up front, and a
60/40-split two-section rear seat that can be folded or removed in
sections to accommodate more cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment, besides the air conditioning and audio
system, includes five-speed manual transmission, power
rack-and-pinion steering, power front disc/rear drum brakes, tilt
steering wheel, rear-window defroster, floor mats, 15-inch wheels
with bolt-on wheel covers, and manual side mirrors. There are dual
air bags in the front.
</P>
<P>
   Base price for our test vehicle was $15,450 plus transportation.
Extras included the automatic transmission ($625), side air bags
for the front occupants ($350), and four-wheel antilock disc brakes
($790).
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 20 miles per gallon in the city and
25 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 15 gallons of gasoline, and
unleaded regular is recommended.

<P>
   Advanced degrees in physics come in different varieties. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students earn them by
writing a dissertation. At the Karate Institute in New York City,
they earn them by breaking 1-inch-thick pine boards. Lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Paris, a fourth-degree black belt in tae kwon do, is happy
to demonstrate his grasp of the scientific principles. First, he
adjusts his belt. Then he lets out a short, sharp yell, snaps his
left leg forward and smashes his foot through three boards,
showering the mat with splinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five boards is about the most I can break,'' Paris says. ``But
I'm not really limited by strength; I'm more or less limited by the
size of the hands holding the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Few things offer more visceral proof of the power of physics
than a karate chop. Punch a brick with your bare hand, untutored in
the martial arts, and you may break a finger. Punch it with the
proper force, momentum and positioning, and you break the brick
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazingly, there are no tricks involved at all,'' says Michael
Feld, a physicist at MIT. ``What you have here is one of the most
efficient human movements ever conceived. We've found nothing in
our studies to improve upon the art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, when Feld was earning a brown belt in karate,
his instructor, Ronald McNair, also happened to be his physics
student. (McNair later died tragically while working as a
scientist-astronaut aboard Space Shuttle Challenger)
</P>
<P>
   The secret to karate, both men agreed, lies in the speed and
exceptional focus of the strike. But just how fast does a karate
punch move?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, they joined with undergraduate Stephen Wilk and set
up a strobe light that flashed either 60 or 120 times per second.
Then they photographed McNair and others throwing various kicks and
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Once the film was developed, they could calculate the speed of a
punch by counting how many times the strobe flashed until the fist
hit its target.
</P>
<P>
   Feld and McNair found that beginning students can throw a karate
chop at about 20 feet per second _ just enough to break a 1-inch
board. But a black belt like McNair could chop at 46 feet per
second. At that speed, a 1.5-pound hand can deliver a wallop of up
to 2,800 newtons (one newton is roughly equal to the force exerted
by the weight of an apple). Splitting a typical concrete slab 1.5
inches thick takes on average only 1,900 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best boxers can punch as quickly and powerfully
as any black belt. Why can't they break concrete blocks too?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the nature of their punches. When a boxer
throws his fist, he usually ends the movement with follow-through.
This gives the punch maximum momentum (golf and tennis players
follow through for the same reason), and it can help knock an
opponent down. But the impact itself is diffuse: It's meant to jar
an opponent's brain, not crack his skull.
</P>
<P>
   A karate chop, on the other hand, has no follow-through at all:
It lashes out like a cobra and then withdraws instantly. When a
black belt hits a slab of concrete, for instance, his fist touches
the block for fewer than 5 milliseconds, and yet the block breaks
with a resounding crack.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how this works, Jearl Walker, a former tae kwon do
student who now teaches physics at Cleveland State University, set
up a study much like Feld and McNair's. A well-thrown fist, he
found, reaches its maximum velocity when the arm is about 80
percent extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what my tae kwon do master had taught me,''
Walker says. ``You learn to focus your punch in your imagination so
that it terminates inside your opponent's body, rather than on the
surface. To deliver the maximum power, you want to make contact
before the slowdown begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of all that focused power is brutally obvious: to
break bones and rupture tissue.
</P>
<P>
   But success also depends on more subtle forces. Solid as they
seem, all materials are at least slightly elastic. Whack them in
the right spot and they will start to oscillate. A punch with a
follow-through would dampen such oscillations, but a karate chop,
by pulling away at the last moment, lets them move freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tweak a rubber band it goes up and down, and the same
is true if you tweak a board or a brick with a much greater
force,'' Feld says. ``When they reach their elastic limits, they
start to yield. In other words, they break.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for most of us, reaching that limit in bones is no
easy matter. Feld says bone can withstand 40 times more force than
concrete, and a cylinder of bone less than an inch in diameter and
29 inches long can withstand a force of more than 25,000 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Hands and feet can withstand even more than that, because their
skin, muscles, ligaments, tendons and cartilage absorb a great deal
of impact. As a result, a well-kicked foot can absorb about 2,000
times as much force as concrete before breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Feld himself has never broken a finger in karate, even though he
once broke eight 1-inch-thick boards at a time. Still, good bones
and a Ph.D. in physics alone couldn't earn him a black belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods didn't just wake up one morning and start hitting
a ball 320 yards, and we don't just walk in and shatter a
cinderblock,'' says Shiak Henry Cho, grand master at the Karate
Institute. ``Everybody has to work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Students not only have to increase their speed and improve their
aim, they have to toughen up their hands and feet by striking them
against a post wrapped in foam and canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, your skin is so soft you may end up cutting
it. And then comes the blood,'' Cho says. ``This is not
recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the shuto, or knife-edge of the hand, develops a
callus that acts exactly like a car bumper, absorbing and diffusing
the force of the collision. ``You practice every day hitting harder
and harder and harder, and then you can hit as hard as you can
without really getting hurt,'' Cho says.

<P>
   Advanced degrees in physics come in different varieties. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students earn them by
writing a dissertation. At the Karate Institute in New York City,
they earn them by breaking 1-inch-thick pine boards. Lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Paris, a fourth-degree black belt in tae kwon do, is happy
to demonstrate his grasp of the scientific principles. First, he
adjusts his belt. Then he lets out a short, sharp yell, snaps his
left leg forward and smashes his foot through three boards,
showering the mat with splinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five boards is about the most I can break,'' Paris says. ``But
I'm not really limited by strength; I'm more or less limited by the
size of the hands holding the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Few things offer more visceral proof of the power of physics
than a karate chop. Punch a brick with your bare hand, untutored in
the martial arts, and you may break a finger. Punch it with the
proper force, momentum and positioning, and you break the brick
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazingly, there are no tricks involved at all,'' says Michael
Feld, a physicist at MIT. ``What you have here is one of the most
efficient human movements ever conceived. We've found nothing in
our studies to improve upon the art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, when Feld was earning a brown belt in karate,
his instructor, Ronald McNair, also happened to be his physics
student. (McNair later died tragically while working as a
scientist-astronaut aboard Space Shuttle Challenger)
</P>
<P>
   The secret to karate, both men agreed, lies in the speed and
exceptional focus of the strike. But just how fast does a karate
punch move?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, they joined with undergraduate Stephen Wilk and set
up a strobe light that flashed either 60 or 120 times per second.
Then they photographed McNair and others throwing various kicks and
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Once the film was developed, they could calculate the speed of a
punch by counting how many times the strobe flashed until the fist
hit its target.
</P>
<P>
   Feld and McNair found that beginning students can throw a karate
chop at about 20 feet per second _ just enough to break a 1-inch
board. But a black belt like McNair could chop at 46 feet per
second. At that speed, a 1.5-pound hand can deliver a wallop of up
to 2,800 newtons (one newton is roughly equal to the force exerted
by the weight of an apple). Splitting a typical concrete slab 1.5
inches thick takes on average only 1,900 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best boxers can punch as quickly and powerfully
as any black belt. Why can't they break concrete blocks too?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the nature of their punches. When a boxer
throws his fist, he usually ends the movement with follow-through.
This gives the punch maximum momentum (golf and tennis players
follow through for the same reason), and it can help knock an
opponent down. But the impact itself is diffuse: It's meant to jar
an opponent's brain, not crack his skull.
</P>
<P>
   A karate chop, on the other hand, has no follow-through at all:
It lashes out like a cobra and then withdraws instantly. When a
black belt hits a slab of concrete, for instance, his fist touches
the block for fewer than 5 milliseconds, and yet the block breaks
with a resounding crack.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how this works, Jearl Walker, a former tae kwon do
student who now teaches physics at Cleveland State University, set
up a study much like Feld and McNair's. A well-thrown fist, he
found, reaches its maximum velocity when the arm is about 80
percent extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what my tae kwon do master had taught me,''
Walker says. ``You learn to focus your punch in your imagination so
that it terminates inside your opponent's body, rather than on the
surface. To deliver the maximum power, you want to make contact
before the slowdown begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of all that focused power is brutally obvious: to
break bones and rupture tissue.
</P>
<P>
   But success also depends on more subtle forces. Solid as they
seem, all materials are at least slightly elastic. Whack them in
the right spot and they will start to oscillate. A punch with a
follow-through would dampen such oscillations, but a karate chop,
by pulling away at the last moment, lets them move freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tweak a rubber band it goes up and down, and the same
is true if you tweak a board or a brick with a much greater
force,'' Feld says. ``When they reach their elastic limits, they
start to yield. In other words, they break.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for most of us, reaching that limit in bones is no
easy matter. Feld says bone can withstand 40 times more force than
concrete, and a cylinder of bone less than an inch in diameter and
29 inches long can withstand a force of more than 25,000 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Hands and feet can withstand even more than that, because their
skin, muscles, ligaments, tendons and cartilage absorb a great deal
of impact. As a result, a well-kicked foot can absorb about 2,000
times as much force as concrete before breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Feld himself has never broken a finger in karate, even though he
once broke eight 1-inch-thick boards at a time. Still, good bones

<P>
   A thrum, low and insistent, emanated from the room next to
engineer Greg Swift's office at Los Alamos National Laboratory in
the late evening of May 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very weird,'' he recalls. ``Those guys had never made
any noise before.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift hurried next door and found postdoc Scott Backhaus in a
state of disbelief. Backhaus' experimental sound-powered engine,
wrapped in heater tape and suspended from a framework of steel
pipes, had suddenly fired up on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heating it up to test expansion and contraction,''
Backhaus says. ``I didn't expect it to start up at such a low
temperature.'' He was both surprised and relieved: ``My major
reaction was, `Thank God, it works.'''
</P>
<P>
   Backhaus' Thermoacoustic Stirling Hybrid Engine, which he
affectionately refers to as TASHE, performs the same basic job as
an ordinary car engine or gas-fired turbine: It converts heat into
motion. But the similarity ends there.
</P>
<P>
   TASHE operates entirely on pressure waves, using high-intensity
sound to do the work of steel. As a result, it has no moving parts,
can be constructed from cheap, basic materials, and yet it is just
as efficient as a typical modern internal combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, sound engines could take dozens of forms, from big
ones that liquefy plumes of natural gas to little ones laboring in
the cellar, that would provide supplemental home electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sound allows us to do is build invisible machinery. It's
the next level of mechanical engineering,'' says Tim Lucas,
president and CEO of Macrosonix Corp., a research and development
company in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of using sound to drive an engine is new,
TASHE relies on a mechanical blueprint that dates back to the era
of steam power. In 1816, Robert Stirling, a multitalented minister
of the Church of Scotland, patented a simple design for an external
combustion engine; unfortunately, it proved too costly to mass
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Stirling's engine consists of a sealed chamber filled with gas
that shuttles back and forth between a ``cold'' end, often at room
temperature, and a ``hot'' end, which can be heated by any energy
source.
</P>
<P>
   A displacer piston within the chamber moves the gas between the
two ends, while a power piston oscillates in response to the
movement of the gas as it expands when heated and cools when
chilled. The power iston can be attached to a crankshaft to do the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Time and the internal combustion engine passed the Stirling
engine by, but it continued to intrigue scientists and engineers.
Then, in 1979, Peter Ceperley, a physics professor at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., published a paper showing that the work
done by heat in a Stirling engine could also be carried out by a
sound wave. After all, sound is nothing but motion _ we hear
because pressure waves traveling through the air vibrate our
eardrums at varying frequencies. Those waves, Ceperley realized,
could bat a slug of gas back and forth in a Stirling-like cycle,
just as heat moves a piston back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people tried to put flesh on that idea, with limited
success,'' says Swift, a fellow at Los Alamos. ``About three years
ago, we said, `Let's put a postdoc on it full time.'''
</P>
<P>
   That postdoc was Scott Backhaus. To test Ceperley's ideas, he
built his own test engine, starting with a baseball-bat-shaped
resonator made from inexpensive steel pipe. The resonator
determines the operational frequency of the engine, in the same way
that the length of an organ's pipe determines its pitch.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``handle'' end of the bat, Backhaus bolted on a
doughnut-shaped metal chamber to hold the hot (about 1,300 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 700 degrees Celsius) and cold (70 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 20 degrees Celsius) heat exchangers. Then he filled
the device with compressed helium.
</P>
<P>
   The heat exchangers in TASHE act like a huge stereo speaker _
creating sound, sending it down the resonator, and amplifying the
feedback repeatedly until it becomes inconceivably powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in that wave, permanent hearing loss would be the
least of your problems. It's loud enough to set your hair on
fire,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   The operating engine is remarkably muted, however, quieter than
an idling car. Quarter-inch-thick steel walls, needed to contain
the highly compressed helium, maintain the silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cavity walls are extremely stiff. They don't flex, so the
sound wave hardly escapes,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Backhaus are just beginning to sort out what their sound
contraption can do. Soon it may provide a better way to recover
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of drilling, offshore oil rigs can liberate
natural gas, which is often just burned as a waste product. The
sound engine could provide a cost-effective way to capture and ship
the gas to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Cryenco Inc., a Denver gas-transport firm,
the Los Alamos engineers are building a huge model of the engine _
40 feet tall and 4 feet in diameter _ that can cool and liquefy 500
gallons of natural gas per day. The heat needed to run it will come
from burning a little of the cast-off fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both conserving a resource and cutting the pollution
caused by flaring off that gas,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   Sound engines could perform a similar conservation coup in the
home. Gas-fired hot-water heaters dump unused warmth into millions
of basements around the country. The sound engine could tap that
thermal waste and use it to move a spring-mounted piston driven by
acoustic waves. The piston, in turn, could run a household
generator.
</P>
<P>
   Swift has teamed up with the Clever Fellows Innovation
Consortium in Troy, N.Y., to develop such a hybrid device.
</P>
<P>
   ``You burn natural gas, and instead of putting the heat directly
into the water, your use that heat to run an acoustic engine to
make electricity,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more than one way to tap into the power of sound. At
Los Alamos in the late 1980s, Tim Lucas worked on a resonator
capable of creating far more intense sound waves than those
generated by devices like TASHE. By vibrating the resonator with an
electric motor, he generated sound waves having energy densities
thousands of times greater than had ever before been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   After forming Macrosonix in 1990, Lucas began exploring ways to
use extreme sound to perform a variety of jobs that normally
require complex machinery, such as manufacturing pharmaceuticals,
grinding up materials, mixing chemicals rapidly, compressing gas,
turbocharging engines and recycling plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a factory in a bottle. There's a level of control there
that has never existed before,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals can be heated and cooled 600 times per second over
temperature swings as large as hundreds of degrees Celsius, or
turbulently mixed 1,200 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can create a wide range of physical effects that were
simply impossible to attain before,'' Lucas says.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his sound-generating process resonant macrosonic
synthesis, and he thinks it will someday find applications as
diverse as the laser. But first the technology will show up in more
conventional applications, such as acoustic compressors, which can
be used in refrigerators, air conditioners and cooling systems for
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way this work is going, Backhaus' little experiment at
Los Alamos could soon become the thrum heard 'round the world.

</P>
<P>
   He and Backhaus are just beginning to sort out what their sound
contraption can do. Soon it may provide a better way to recover
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of drilling, offshore oil rigs can liberate
natural gas, which is often just burned as a waste product. The
sound engine could provide a cost-effective way to capture and ship
the gas to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Cryenco Inc., a Denver gas-transport firm,
the Los Alamos engineers are building a huge model of the engine _
40 feet tall and 4 feet in diameter _ that can cool and liquefy 500
gallons of natural gas per day. The heat needed to run it will come
from burning a little of the cast-off fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both conserving a resource and cutting the pollution
caused by flaring off that gas,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   Sound engines could perform a similar conservation coup in the
home. Gas-fired hot-water heaters dump unused warmth into millions
of basements around the country. The sound engine could tap that
thermal waste and use it to move a spring-mounted piston driven by
acoustic waves. The piston, in turn, could run a household
generator.
</P>
<P>
   Swift has teamed up with the Clever Fellows Innovation
Consortium in Troy, N.Y., to develop such a hybrid device.
</P>
<P>
   ``You burn natural gas, and instead of putting the heat directly
into the water, your use that heat to run an acoustic engine to
make electricity,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more than one way to tap into the power of sound. At
Los Alamos in the late 1980s, Tim Lucas worked on a resonator
capable of creating far more intense sound waves than those
generated by devices like TASHE. By vibrating the resonator with an
electric motor, he generated sound waves having energy densities
thousands of times greater than had ever before been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   After forming Macrosonix in 1990, Lucas began exploring ways to
use extreme sound to perform a variety of jobs that normally
require complex machinery, such as manufacturing pharmaceuticals,
grinding up materials, mixing chemicals rapidly, compressing gas,
turbocharging engines and recycling plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a factory in a bottle. There's a level of control there
that has never existed before,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals can be heated and cooled 600 times per second over
temperature swings as large as hundreds of degrees Celsius, or
turbulently mixed 1,200 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can create a wide range of physical effects that were
simply impossible to attain before,'' Lucas says.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his sound-generating process resonant macrosonic
synthesis, and he thinks it will someday find applications as
diverse as the laser. But first the technology will show up in more
conventional applications, such as acoustic compressors, which can
be used in refrigerators, air conditioners and cooling systems for
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way this work is going, Backhaus' little experiment at
Los Alamos could soon become the thrum heard 'round the world.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Christy's parents were at their wits' end. About two months
before, she had been fine, walking and talking like any 2-year-old.
Then she got a cold. First her eyes started jiggling; then her body
began jerking. The twitches were so strong she couldn't talk or
walk. She fell often, was covered with bruises and had trouble
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents had taken her to a pediatrician, who referred them
to a neurologist. He said Christy was still fighting a virus and
would get better. When she didn't, her parents brought her to me
for another opinion.
</P>
<P>
   My physical examination included tests of balance and
coordination. From Christy's responses I could see she had suffered
an injury to her cerebellum, a fist-sized structure at the base of
the brain that helps execute movements.
</P>
<P>
   But I also knew that her jerks and eye movements had to
originate in the brain stem, a slender stalk of tissue that
connects the brain to the spinal cord. Her problems with language
and behavior probably meant other brain structures were involved
too.
</P>
<P>
   I told the parents that Christy had OMS _ opsoclonus-myoclonus
syndrome. The name is simply a description of the symptoms.
Opsoclonus refers to the jiggling eye movements, and myoclonus is a
term for the muscle jerks.
</P>
<P>
   OMS is caused by a brain injury, but the problem can't be easily
detected on brain scans. The brain contains a staggering thousand
trillion junctions between neurons. It would take a malfunction in
only a small percentage of neurons to produce Christy's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can this be cured?'' her mother asked. I shook my head. ``I'm
talking about treatment, not cures.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents seemed incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   I explained that in about half the known cases, the cause is
thought to be a viral infection. The other half are caused by a
tumor called a neuroblastoma in the chest or abdomen. This type of
pediatric tumor accounts for about 8 percent of cancers in
children, and it occurs most often in toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 4 percent of those children _ roughly 30 U.S. cases
each year _ develop opsoclonus-myoclonus. We needed to do more
tests on Christy to know if her OMS was caused by a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Her blood tests, X-rays, electroencephalogram and urine sample
showed nothing unusual, but I ordered a CAT scan just to make sure.
A tumor of only millimeters in diameter can be extremely difficult
to detect.
</P>
<P>
   When the CAT scan was completed, the radiologist pointed out a
small blotch in the chest _ a tumor. Within a week Christy was in
the operating room and a surgeon cut out the mass. Lab results
confirmed it had not spread to other parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the tumor itself is not directly responsible
for OMS symptoms. Christy's immune system was getting a message to
strike the tumor, and the message was prompting an attack on a
protein in her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the immune system assail the very constituents it is
designed to protect? The explanation begins with the maturing
immune system. During fetal development, it tries to eliminate the
immune cells that can recognize proteins the body manufactures
itself _ the so-called self proteins. The problem is that the
system of elimination is not foolproof. Some sequestered tissues _
like brain cells _ remain vulnerable to immune-cell activity. So if
a tumor or virus makes a protein that also appears on brain cells,
the immune system will hunt down and attack those cells as well.
It's a biological version of friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   In Christy's case, the tumor had primed her immune system to
attack a protein on the cerebellum's Purkinje cells, which connect
with neurons in other parts of the brain to coordinate movement and
aid learning.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after Christy's surgery, her neurological condition
worsened. I explained to her stunned parents that we could try to
weaken the immune response by treating her with adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), the same hormone secreted by the pituitary gland.
ACTH would prompt her adrenal glands to produce steroids, and
steroids help rein in immune-cell activity.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have more questions than answers when treating OMS.
Should we give Christy chemotherapy to kill her immune cells, even
though her tumor was benign? Should we try filtering the attacking
antibodies from her blood, even though we don't know if it will
work in kids her age?
</P>
<P>
   Christy's parents were taught how to give her daily ACTH
injections and how to monitor side effects, which can include fluid
retention, behavioral problems and sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she was much better, and she could walk if she
kept her legs apart for better balance. She still couldn't talk,
but she suffered fewer jerks and eye abnormalities. Her parents'
sense of hope made me feel like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Christy's mother called. She was frantic.
``Christy's worse. We were down to the lowest dose of ACTH, and she
was due to come off the medication at the end of the week. Then she
got a cold and deteriorated.''
</P>
<P>
   The panic in her voice frightened me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring her in,'' I said, wondering what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to avoid conventional treatments, such as
immunosuppressants or chemotherapy, because they inflict widespread
destruction on the immune system. By the time the family arrived, I
had a plan. I said we would give Christy an intravenous dose of
immunoglobulins (IVIG), or antibodies. By flooding her blood with
so many normal antibodies, we might be able to throw off the
signaling that was directing the attack. If it worked, I explained,
we'd give it to Christy once a month for several months.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure costs as much as $20,000, so I had to convince
Christy's insurance company of its worth. The representative had
never heard of opsoclonus-myoclonus. Was the treatment standard
care or research, he asked. I said I would fax reports on the few
published cases of IVIG treatment that I knew of. We waited. Two
weeks passed. Approval came _ for one dose.
</P>
<P>
   Christy returned to the clinic, and the nurse infused her with
IVIG. The procedure took three hours. While everyone else worried,
Christy fell asleep in her mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Later the father took me aside. If Christy's OMS had been
treated earlier, he asked, could she have recovered? I said that
although the syndrome has been known for at least 40 years, few
physicians are aware of it. Too often the telltale eye movements
and muscle jerks are mistaken for symptoms of a simple viral
infection. So no one gets treated for OMS right away.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hit on the head with a brick, we are quick to follow
certain protocols. But we are only beginning to realize that when
the immune system attacks brain cells, the consequences can be just
as serious.
</P>
<P>
   The antibodies seemed to work, and Christy soon regained lost
ground. I decided to reduce the ACTH dosage but not stop it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That was months ago. I recently received a birthday announcement
from the family. Christy had turned 3. Her cheeks were puffy from
steroids, but she was running. Smiling faces in the family photo
told me everything I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Christy's future is uncertain. I don't know if she will
ever be able to live independently or hold a job. I don't know if
she'll have learning disabilities or mental retardation. I do know
that relapses will be likely.
</P>
<P>
   ACTH withdrawal and childhood infections _ particularly those
that produce a fever _ could provoke her immune system into another
rampage. I worried that using drugs to subdue her immune system
might weaken her resistance to serious infections or even another
kind of tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Although we take precautions, the hormone, too, could stunt her
growth and harm her health. And nobody knows how long children who
suffer from OMS need to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, do no harm _ the tenet of my medical education _
echoed in my thoughts. But there were no better options for
treating OMS.
</P>
<P>
   At least Christy's brain had an opportunity to resume its
critical development. The rest was up to the plasticity and
resilience of youth.

   &UR; BATTLE FATIGUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Munroe spends his days thinking about how to avoid getting
killed in the new millennium. He's not paranoid _ he's doing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   As warrior systems integration team leader at the Natick Soldier
Center in Massachusetts, Munroe is developing a vision of what
American soldiers will be wearing in combat a quarter century
hence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army is preparing to roll out uniforms that include
video-display goggles and a chest-mounted mouse for weapons and
radio controls.
</P>
<P>
   Munroe's Future Warrior 2025 concept draws on much more far-out
engineering. Night-vision glasses correct for the distortion caused
by the curvature of the visor. The helmet, called ``headgear
subsystem-information central,'' links with the soldier's suit and
firearm so that the soldier need only look at a target and the
voice-activated gun is locked on and ready to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The suit itself is a bullet-resistant mesh of carbon nanotubes.
It circulates hot or cold water to keep the wearer comfortable and
contains embedded enzymes to neutralize biological or chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Future Warrior 2025 is just a dream _ or a nightmare.
The necessary technology is years off, and the mockup at the Natick
Soldier Center isn't a working prototype _ it's a ``conceptual
simulation'' to stimulate the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one decide what a conceptual simulation of
tomorrow's soldier should look like?
</P>
<P>
   ``The black suit shows you he's of the future,'' Munroe
explains.
</P>

 &UR; DINOSAUR ON THE GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duck-billed dinosaurs, 30-foot-long plant-eaters that once
roamed much of North America, were hardly bigger than toy poodles
when they hatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost nothing you can think of as vulnerable as a
16-inch-tall duck-billed dinosaur,'' says paleontologist Jack
Horner of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a tiny baby dino to do? Grow fast like a bird, not
slowly like a lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Horner, paleontologist Kevin Padian of the University of
California at Berkeley, and their colleagues examined fossil
embryos and hatchlings from three types of duck-bills to figure out
how they matured. The researchers counted the number of microscopic
blood vessels in the part of the bone surrounding the marrow _ a
large blood supply denotes fast growth. They also examined
embryonic bone from modern alligators, ostriches and emus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinosaurs had even more vascular space than the birds. It
looks like they grew up to somewhere between nine and 12 feet long
in just one year,'' Horner says.
</P>
<P>
   They may have looked like lizards, but Horner finds that
dinosaurs had evolved a birdlike, fast-paced development style to

invent this method of growth. It was invented by their dinosaur

 &UR; TRAFFIC WITH THE WEATHER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morning newscasters give a fairly accurate prediction of the
day's weather. Wouldn't it be nice if they could also give
forecasts of traffic jams?
</P>
<P>
   Civil engineer John Leonard of the Georgia Institute of
Technology has created a set of computer programs to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard collects car speeds from automated roadway cameras and
feeds the numbers into the program, which turns them into
color-coded maps showing how long it takes to travel from a given
starting point to more than 5,000 destinations.
</P>
<P>
   He has also created a database summarizing the past two years of
traffic speeds. When this database is combined with information on
current happenings, such as special events in town or holidays,
Leonard can anticipate what commuters should prepare for.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard expresses traffic on a numerical scale. An open
interstate would rate a 30, while heavy congestion might rate a
100. Many people could leave for work 15 minutes earlier, if they
knew they were facing a messy drive. That small change, he says,
could decrease congestion and frustration.

 &UR; GENE-IUS COMPUTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Engineers planning tomorrow's supercomputers are finding it hard
to beat the power of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   DNA expresses information as a sequence of molecules along the
double helix in much the same way that silicon chips process
information as zeroes and ones, but DNA is far more efficient: One
gram of the molecules could hold as much data as a trillion CDs.
</P>
<P>
   So two research groups have turned to DNA to crack math problems
containing so many variables that they overwhelm conventional
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Chemist Robert Corn of the University of Wisconsin in Madison
likens the problem to finding pizza that will satisfy everyone in a
group. If there were two possible toppings the task would be
simple, but even a hundred would be unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and his colleagues began their attack by covering a glass
surface with individual DNA strands, each one a genetic sequence
describing one possible solution (a unique combination of toppings,
for instance). Then the researchers repeatedly dipped the glass in
a beaker containing complementary snippets of DNA, which
represented one set of correct options (mushrooms or olives, no
anchovies, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   When the floating bits of DNA found matching strands on the
glass, the two linked up. Unmatched strands were destroyed; then
the process was repeated with a new set of options. Eventually, the
process produced genetic sequences that satisfied all the
variables.
</P>
<P>
   Another team led by Michael Pirrung, a chemist at Duke
University in Durham, N.C., followed the same general procedure but
added an enzyme that attached a glowing molecule to the winning set
of DNA strands instead of destroying the losers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, DNA computers are slow and clumsy, but their logic
applies to everything from codebreaking to finding the most
efficient way to visit multiple destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can solve this problem, it's proof of the principle
that you can solve any problem,'' Corn says.

   &UR; BATTLE FATIGUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Munroe spends his days thinking about how to avoid getting
killed in the new millennium. He's not paranoid _ he's doing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   As warrior systems integration team leader at the Natick Soldier
Center in Massachusetts, Munroe is developing a vision of what
American soldiers will be wearing in combat a quarter century
hence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army is preparing to roll out uniforms that include
video-display goggles and a chest-mounted mouse for weapons and
radio controls.
</P>
<P>
   Munroe's Future Warrior 2025 concept draws on much more far-out
engineering. Night-vision glasses correct for the distortion caused
by the curvature of the visor. The helmet, called ``headgear
subsystem-information central,'' links with the soldier's suit and
firearm so that the soldier need only look at a target and the
voice-activated gun is locked on and ready to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The suit itself is a bullet-resistant mesh of carbon nanotubes.
It circulates hot or cold water to keep the wearer comfortable and
contains embedded enzymes to neutralize biological or chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Future Warrior 2025 is just a dream _ or a nightmare.
The necessary technology is years off, and the mockup at the Natick
Soldier Center isn't a working prototype _ it's a ``conceptual
simulation'' to stimulate the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one decide what a conceptual simulation of
tomorrow's soldier should look like?
</P>
<P>
   ``The black suit shows you he's of the future,'' Munroe
explains.
</P>

 &UR; DINOSAUR ON THE GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duck-billed dinosaurs, 30-foot-long plant-eaters that once
roamed much of North America, were hardly bigger than toy poodles
when they hatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost nothing you can think of as vulnerable as a
16-inch-tall duck-billed dinosaur,'' says paleontologist Jack
Horner of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a tiny baby dino to do? Grow fast like a bird, not
slowly like a lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Horner, paleontologist Kevin Padian of the University of
California at Berkeley, and their colleagues examined fossil
embryos and hatchlings from three types of duck-bills to figure out
how they matured. The researchers counted the number of microscopic
blood vessels in the part of the bone surrounding the marrow _ a
large blood supply denotes fast growth. They also examined
embryonic bone from modern alligators, ostriches and emus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinosaurs had even more vascular space than the birds. It
looks like they grew up to somewhere between nine and 12 feet long
in just one year,'' Horner says.
</P>
<P>
   They may have looked like lizards, but Horner finds that
dinosaurs had evolved a birdlike, fast-paced development style to
survive the cretaceous competition. ``In other words, birds didn't
invent this method of growth. It was invented by their dinosaur
ancestors.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Advanced degrees in physics come in different varieties. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students earn them by
writing a dissertation. At the Karate Institute in New York City,
they earn them by breaking 1-inch-thick pine boards. Lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Paris, a fourth-degree black belt in tae kwon do, is happy
to demonstrate his grasp of the scientific principles. First, he
adjusts his belt. Then he lets out a short, sharp yell, snaps his
left leg forward and smashes his foot through three boards,
showering the mat with splinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five boards is about the most I can break,'' Paris says. ``But
I'm not really limited by strength; I'm more or less limited by the
size of the hands holding the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Few things offer more visceral proof of the power of physics
than a karate chop. Punch a brick with your bare hand, untutored in
the martial arts, and you may break a finger. Punch it with the
proper force, momentum and positioning, and you break the brick
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazingly, there are no tricks involved at all,'' says Michael
Feld, a physicist at MIT. ``What you have here is one of the most
efficient human movements ever conceived. We've found nothing in
our studies to improve upon the art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, when Feld was earning a brown belt in karate,
his instructor, Ronald McNair, also happened to be his physics
student. (McNair later died tragically while working as a
scientist-astronaut aboard Space Shuttle Challenger)
</P>
<P>
   The secret to karate, both men agreed, lies in the speed and
exceptional focus of the strike. But just how fast does a karate
punch move?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, they joined with undergraduate Stephen Wilk and set
up a strobe light that flashed either 60 or 120 times per second.
Then they photographed McNair and others throwing various kicks and
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Once the film was developed, they could calculate the speed of a
punch by counting how many times the strobe flashed until the fist
hit its target.
</P>
<P>
   Feld and McNair found that beginning students can throw a karate
chop at about 20 feet per second _ just enough to break a 1-inch
board. But a black belt like McNair could chop at 46 feet per
second. At that speed, a 1.5-pound hand can deliver a wallop of up
to 2,800 newtons (one newton is roughly equal to the force exerted
by the weight of an apple). Splitting a typical concrete slab 1.5
inches thick takes on average only 1,900 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best boxers can punch as quickly and powerfully
as any black belt. Why can't they break concrete blocks too?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the nature of their punches. When a boxer
throws his fist, he usually ends the movement with follow-through.
This gives the punch maximum momentum (golf and tennis players
follow through for the same reason), and it can help knock an
opponent down. But the impact itself is diffuse: It's meant to jar
an opponent's brain, not crack his skull.
</P>
<P>
   A karate chop, on the other hand, has no follow-through at all:
It lashes out like a cobra and then withdraws instantly. When a
black belt hits a slab of concrete, for instance, his fist touches
the block for fewer than 5 milliseconds, and yet the block breaks
with a resounding crack.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how this works, Jearl Walker, a former tae kwon do
student who now teaches physics at Cleveland State University, set
up a study much like Feld and McNair's. A well-thrown fist, he
found, reaches its maximum velocity when the arm is about 80
percent extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what my tae kwon do master had taught me,''
Walker says. ``You learn to focus your punch in your imagination so
that it terminates inside your opponent's body, rather than on the
surface. To deliver the maximum power, you want to make contact
before the slowdown begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of all that focused power is brutally obvious: to
break bones and rupture tissue.
</P>
<P>
   But success also depends on more subtle forces. Solid as they
seem, all materials are at least slightly elastic. Whack them in
the right spot and they will start to oscillate. A punch with a
follow-through would dampen such oscillations, but a karate chop,
by pulling away at the last moment, lets them move freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tweak a rubber band it goes up and down, and the same
is true if you tweak a board or a brick with a much greater
force,'' Feld says. ``When they reach their elastic limits, they
start to yield. In other words, they break.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for most of us, reaching that limit in bones is no
easy matter. Feld says bone can withstand 40 times more force than
concrete, and a cylinder of bone less than an inch in diameter and
29 inches long can withstand a force of more than 25,000 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Hands and feet can withstand even more than that, because their
skin, muscles, ligaments, tendons and cartilage absorb a great deal
of impact. As a result, a well-kicked foot can absorb about 2,000
times as much force as concrete before breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Feld himself has never broken a finger in karate, even though he
once broke eight 1-inch-thick boards at a time. Still, good bones
and a Ph.D. in physics alone couldn't earn him a black belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods didn't just wake up one morning and start hitting
a ball 320 yards, and we don't just walk in and shatter a
cinderblock,'' says Shiak Henry Cho, grand master at the Karate
Institute. ``Everybody has to work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Students not only have to increase their speed and improve their
aim, they have to toughen up their hands and feet by striking them
against a post wrapped in foam and canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, your skin is so soft you may end up cutting
it. And then comes the blood,'' Cho says. ``This is not
recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the shuto, or knife-edge of the hand, develops a
callus that acts exactly like a car bumper, absorbing and diffusing
the force of the collision. ``You practice every day hitting harder
and harder and harder, and then you can hit as hard as you can
without really getting hurt,'' Cho says.

   The answer lies in the nature of their punches. When a boxer

follow through for the same reason), and it can help knock an

concrete, and a cylinder of bone less than an inch in diameter and
29 inches long can withstand a force of more than 25,000 newtons.
</P>
<P>
   Hands and feet can withstand even more than that, because their
skin, muscles, ligaments, tendons and cartilage absorb a great deal

times as much force as concrete before breaking.

   A thrum, low and insistent, emanated from the room next to
engineer Greg Swift's office at Los Alamos National Laboratory in
the late evening of May 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very weird,'' he recalls. ``Those guys had never made
any noise before.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift hurried next door and found postdoc Scott Backhaus in a
state of disbelief. Backhaus' experimental sound-powered engine,
wrapped in heater tape and suspended from a framework of steel
pipes, had suddenly fired up on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heating it up to test expansion and contraction,''
Backhaus says. ``I didn't expect it to start up at such a low
temperature.'' He was both surprised and relieved: ``My major
reaction was, `Thank God, it works.'''
</P>
<P>
   Backhaus' Thermoacoustic Stirling Hybrid Engine, which he
affectionately refers to as TASHE, performs the same basic job as
an ordinary car engine or gas-fired turbine: It converts heat into
motion. But the similarity ends there.
</P>
<P>
   TASHE operates entirely on pressure waves, using high-intensity
sound to do the work of steel. As a result, it has no moving parts,
can be constructed from cheap, basic materials, and yet it is just
as efficient as a typical modern internal combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, sound engines could take dozens of forms, from big
ones that liquefy plumes of natural gas to little ones laboring in
the cellar, that would provide supplemental home electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sound allows us to do is build invisible machinery. It's
the next level of mechanical engineering,'' says Tim Lucas,
president and CEO of Macrosonix Corp., a research and development
company in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of using sound to drive an engine is new,
TASHE relies on a mechanical blueprint that dates back to the era
of steam power. In 1816, Robert Stirling, a multitalented minister
of the Church of Scotland, patented a simple design for an external
combustion engine; unfortunately, it proved too costly to mass
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Stirling's engine consists of a sealed chamber filled with gas
that shuttles back and forth between a ``cold'' end, often at room
temperature, and a ``hot'' end, which can be heated by any energy
source.
</P>
<P>
   A displacer piston within the chamber moves the gas between the
two ends, while a power piston oscillates in response to the
movement of the gas as it expands when heated and cools when
chilled. The power piston can be attached to a crankshaft to do the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Time and the internal combustion engine passed the Stirling
engine by, but it continued to intrigue scientists and engineers.
Then, in 1979, Peter Ceperley, a physics professor at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., published a paper showing that the work
done by heat in a Stirling engine could also be carried out by a
sound wave. After all, sound is nothing but motion _ we hear
because pressure waves traveling through the air vibrate our
eardrums at varying frequencies. Those waves, Ceperley realized,
could bat a slug of gas back and forth in a Stirling-like cycle,
just as heat moves a piston back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people tried to put flesh on that idea, with limited
success,'' says Swift, a fellow at Los Alamos. ``About three years
ago, we said, `Let's put a postdoc on it full time.'''
</P>
<P>
   That postdoc was Scott Backhaus. To test Ceperley's ideas, he
built his own test engine, starting with a baseball-bat-shaped
resonator made from inexpensive steel pipe. The resonator
determines the operational frequency of the engine, in the same way
that the length of an organ's pipe determines its pitch.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``handle'' end of the bat, Backhaus bolted on a
doughnut-shaped metal chamber to hold the hot (about 1,300 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 700 degrees Celsius) and cold (70 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 20 degrees Celsius) heat exchangers. Then he filled
the device with compressed helium.
</P>
<P>
   The heat exchangers in TASHE act like a huge stereo speaker _
creating sound, sending it down the resonator, and amplifying the
feedback repeatedly until it becomes inconceivably powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in that wave, permanent hearing loss would be the
least of your problems. It's loud enough to set your hair on
fire,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   The operating engine is remarkably muted, however, quieter than
an idling car. Quarter-inch-thick steel walls, needed to contain
the highly compressed helium, maintain the silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cavity walls are extremely stiff. They don't flex, so the
sound wave hardly escapes,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Backhaus are just beginning to sort out what their sound
contraption can do. Soon it may provide a better way to recover
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of drilling, offshore oil rigs can liberate
natural gas, which is often just burned as a waste product. The
sound engine could provide a cost-effective way to capture and ship
the gas to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Cryenco Inc., a Denver gas-transport firm,
the Los Alamos engineers are building a huge model of the engine _
40 feet tall and 4 feet in diameter _ that can cool and liquefy 500
gallons of natural gas per day. The heat needed to run it will come
from burning a little of the cast-off fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both conserving a resource and cutting the pollution
caused by flaring off that gas,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   Sound engines could perform a similar conservation coup in the
home. Gas-fired hot-water heaters dump unused warmth into millions
of basements around the country. The sound engine could tap that
thermal waste and use it to move a spring-mounted piston driven by
acoustic waves. The piston, in turn, could run a household
generator.
</P>
<P>
   Swift has teamed up with the Clever Fellows Innovation
Consortium in Troy, N.Y., to develop such a hybrid device.
</P>
<P>
   ``You burn natural gas, and instead of putting the heat directly
into the water, your use that heat to run an acoustic engine to
make electricity,'' Swift says.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more than one way to tap into the power of sound. At
Los Alamos in the late 1980s, Tim Lucas worked on a resonator
capable of creating far more intense sound waves than those
generated by devices like TASHE. By vibrating the resonator with an
electric motor, he generated sound waves having energy densities
thousands of times greater than had ever before been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   After forming Macrosonix in 1990, Lucas began exploring ways to
use extreme sound to perform a variety of jobs that normally
require complex machinery, such as manufacturing pharmaceuticals,
grinding up materials, mixing chemicals rapidly, compressing gas,
turbocharging engines and recycling plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a factory in a bottle. There's a level of control there
that has never existed before,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals can be heated and cooled 600 times per second over
temperature swings as large as hundreds of degrees Celsius, or
turbulently mixed 1,200 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can create a wide range of physical effects that were
simply impossible to attain before,'' Lucas says.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his sound-generating process resonant macrosonic
synthesis, and he thinks it will someday find applications as
diverse as the laser. But first the technology will show up in more
conventional applications, such as acoustic compressors, which can
be used in refrigerators, air conditioners and cooling systems for
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way this work is going, Backhaus' little experiment at
Los Alamos could soon become the thrum heard 'round the world.

 By MICHAEL PRANZATELLI  
 c.2000 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Christy's parents were at their wits' end. About two months
before, she had been fine, walking and talking like any 2-year-old.
Then she got a cold. First her eyes started jiggling; then her body
began jerking. The twitches were so strong she couldn't talk or
walk. She fell often, was covered with bruises and had trouble
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents had taken her to a pediatrician, who referred them
to a neurologist. He said Christy was still fighting a virus and
would get better. When she didn't, her parents brought her to me
for another opinion.
</P>
<P>
   My physical examination included tests of balance and
coordination. From Christy's responses I could see she had suffered
an injury to her cerebellum, a fist-sized structure at the base of
the brain that helps execute movements.
</P>
<P>
   But I also knew that her jerks and eye movements had to
originate in the brain stem, a slender stalk of tissue that
connects the brain to the spinal cord. Her problems with language
and behavior probably meant other brain structures were involved
too.
</P>
<P>
   I told the parents that Christy had OMS _ opsoclonus-myoclonus
syndrome. The name is simply a description of the symptoms.
Opsoclonus refers to the jiggling eye movements, and myoclonus is a
term for the muscle jerks.
</P>
<P>
   OMS is caused by a brain injury, but the problem can't be easily
detected on brain scans. The brain contains a staggering thousand
trillion junctions between neurons. It would take a malfunction in
only a small percentage of neurons to produce Christy's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can this be cured?'' her mother asked. I shook my head. ``I'm
talking about treatment, not cures.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents seemed incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   I explained that in about half the known cases, the cause is
thought to be a viral infection. The other half are caused by a
tumor called a neuroblastoma in the chest or abdomen. This type of
pediatric tumor accounts for about 8 percent of cancers in
children, and it occurs most often in toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 4 percent of those children _ roughly 30 U.S. cases
each year _ develop opsoclonus-myoclonus. We needed to do more
tests on Christy to know if her OMS was caused by a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Her blood tests, X-rays, electroencephalogram and urine sample
showed nothing unusual, but I ordered a CAT scan just to make sure.
A tumor of only millimeters in diameter can be extremely difficult
to detect.
</P>
<P>
   When the CAT scan was completed, the radiologist pointed out a
small blotch in the chest _ a tumor. Within a week Christy was in
the operating room and a surgeon cut out the mass. Lab results
confirmed it had not spread to other parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the tumor itself is not directly responsible
for OMS symptoms. Christy's immune system was getting a message to
strike the tumor, and the message was prompting an attack on a
protein in her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the immune system assail the very constituents it is
designed to protect? The explanation begins with the maturing
immune system. During fetal development, it tries to eliminate the
immune cells that can recognize proteins the body manufactures
itself _ the so-called self proteins. The problem is that the
system of elimination is not foolproof. Some sequestered tissues _
like brain cells _ remain vulnerable to immune-cell activity. So if
a tumor or virus makes a protein that also appears on brain cells,
the immune system will hunt down and attack those cells as well.
It's a biological version of friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   In Christy's case, the tumor had primed her immune system to
attack a protein on the cerebellum's Purkinje cells, which connect
with neurons in other parts of the brain to coordinate movement and
aid learning.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after Christy's surgery, her neurological condition
worsened. I explained to her stunned parents that we could try to
weaken the immune response by treating her with adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), the same hormone secreted by the pituitary gland.
ACTH would prompt her adrenal glands to produce steroids, and
steroids help rein in immune-cell activity.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have more questions than answers when treating OMS.
Should we give Christy chemotherapy to kill her immune cells, even
though her tumor was benign? Should we try filtering the attacking
antibodies from her blood, even though we don't know if it will
work in kids her age?
</P>
<P>
   Christy's parents were taught how to give her daily ACTH
injections and how to monitor side effects, which can include fluid
retention, behavioral problems and sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she was much better, and she could walk if she
kept her legs apart for better balance. She still couldn't talk,
but she suffered fewer jerks and eye abnormalities. Her parents'
sense of hope made me feel like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Christy's mother called. She was frantic.
``Christy's worse. We were down to the lowest dose of ACTH, and she
was due to come off the medication at the end of the week. Then she
got a cold and deteriorated.''
</P>
<P>
   The panic in her voice frightened me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring her in,'' I said, wondering what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to avoid conventional treatments, such as
immunosuppressants or chemotherapy, because they inflict widespread
destruction on the immune system. By the time the family arrived, I
had a plan. I said we would give Christy an intravenous dose of
immunoglobulins (IVIG), or antibodies. By flooding her blood with
so many normal antibodies, we might be able to throw off the
signaling that was directing the attack. If it worked, I explained,
we'd give it to Christy once a month for several months.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure costs as much as $20,000, so I had to convince
Christy's insurance company of its worth. The representative had
never heard of opsoclonus-myoclonus. Was the treatment standard
care or research, he asked. I said I would fax reports on the few
published cases of IVIG treatment that I knew of. We waited. Two
weeks passed. Approval came _ for one dose.
</P>
<P>
   Christy returned to the clinic, and the nurse infused her with
IVIG. The procedure took three hours. While everyone else worried,
Christy fell asleep in her mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Later the father took me aside. If Christy's OMS had been
treated earlier, he asked, could she have recovered? I said that
although the syndrome has been known for at least 40 years, few
physicians are aware of it. Too often the telltale eye movements
and muscle jerks are mistaken for symptoms of a simple viral
infection. So no one gets treated for OMS right away.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hit on the head with a brick, we are quick to follow
certain protocols. But we are only beginning to realize that when
the immune system attacks brain cells, the consequences can be just
as serious.
</P>
<P>
   The antibodies seemed to work, and Christy soon regained lost
ground. I decided to reduce the ACTH dosage but not stop it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That was months ago. I recently received a birthday announcement
from the family. Christy had turned 3. Her cheeks were puffy from
steroids, but she was running. Smiling faces in the family photo
told me everything I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Christy's future is uncertain. I don't know if she will
ever be able to live independently or hold a job. I don't know if
she'll have learning disabilities or mental retardation. I do know
that relapses will be likely.
</P>
<P>
   ACTH withdrawal and childhood infections _ particularly those
that produce a fever _ could provoke her immune system into another
rampage. I worried that using drugs to subdue her immune system
might weaken her resistance to serious infections or even another
kind of tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Although we take precautions, the hormone, too, could stunt her
growth and harm her health. And nobody knows how long children who
suffer from OMS need to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, do no harm _ the tenet of my medical education _
echoed in my thoughts. But there were no better options for
treating OMS.
</P>

 c.2000 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Christy's parents were at their wits' end. About two months
before, she had been fine, walking and talking like any 2-year-old.
Then she got a cold. First her eyes started jiggling; then her body
began jerking. The twitches were so strong she couldn't talk or
walk. She fell often, was covered with bruises and had trouble
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents had taken her to a pediatrician, who referred them
to a neurologist. He said Christy was still fighting a virus and
would get better. When she didn't, her parents brought her to me
for another opinion.
</P>
<P>
   My physical examination included tests of balance and
coordination. From Christy's responses I could see she had suffered
an injury to her cerebellum, a fist-sized structure at the base of
the brain that helps execute movements.
</P>
<P>
   But I also knew that her jerks and eye movements had to
originate in the brain stem, a slender stalk of tissue that
connects the brain to the spinal cord. Her problems with language
and behavior probably meant other brain structures were involved
too.
</P>
<P>
   I told the parents that Christy had OMS _ opsoclonus-myoclonus
syndrome. The name is simply a description of the symptoms.
Opsoclonus refers to the jiggling eye movements, and myoclonus is a
term for the muscle jerks.
</P>
<P>
   OMS is caused by a brain injury, but the problem can't be easily
detected on brain scans. The brain contains a staggering thousand
trillion junctions between neurons. It would take a malfunction in
only a small percentage of neurons to produce Christy's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can this be cured?'' her mother asked. I shook my head. ``I'm
talking about treatment, not cures.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents seemed incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   I explained that in about half the known cases, the cause is
thought to be a viral infection. The other half are caused by a
tumor called a neuroblastoma in the chest or abdomen. This type of
pediatric tumor accounts for about 8 percent of cancers in
children, and it occurs most often in toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 4 percent of those children _ roughly 30 U.S. cases
each year _ develop opsoclonus-myoclonus. We needed to do more
tests on Christy to know if her OMS was caused by a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Her blood tests, X-rays, electroencephalogram and urine sample
showed nothing unusual, but I ordered a CAT scan just to make sure.
A tumor of only millimeters in diameter can be extremely difficult
to detect.
</P>
<P>
   When the CAT scan was completed, the radiologist pointed out a
small blotch in the chest _ a tumor. Within a week Christy was in
the operating room and a surgeon cut out the mass. Lab results
confirmed it had not spread to other parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the tumor itself is not directly responsible
for OMS symptoms. Christy's immune system was getting a message to
strike the tumor, and the message was prompting an attack on a
protein in her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the immune system assail the very constituents it is
designed to protect? The explanation begins with the maturing
immune system. During fetal development, it tries to eliminate the
immune cells that can recognize proteins the body manufactures
itself _ the so-called self proteins. The problem is that the
system of elimination is not foolproof. Some sequestered tissues _
like brain cells _ remain vulnerable to immune-cell activity. So if
a tumor or virus makes a protein that also appears on brain cells,
the immune system will hunt down and attack those cells as well.
It's a biological version of friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   In Christy's case, the tumor had primed her immune system to
attack a protein on the cerebellum's Purkinje cells, which connect
with neurons in other parts of the brain to coordinate movement and
aid learning.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after Christy's surgery, her neurological condition
worsened. I explained to her stunned parents that we could try to
weaken the immune response by treating her with adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), the same hormone secreted by the pituitary gland.
ACTH would prompt her adrenal glands to produce steroids, and
steroids help rein in immune-cell activity.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have more questions than answers when treating OMS.
Should we give Christy chemotherapy to kill her immune cells, even
though her tumor was benign? Should we try filtering the attacking
antibodies from her blood, even though we don't know if it will
work in kids her age?
</P>
<P>
   Christy's parents were taught how to give her daily ACTH
injections and how to monitor side effects, which can include fluid
retention, behavioral problems and sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she was much better, and she could walk if she
kept her legs apart for better balance. She still couldn't talk,
but she suffered fewer jerks and eye abnormalities. Her parents'
sense of hope made me feel like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Christy's mother called. She was frantic.
``Christy's worse. We were down to the lowest dose of ACTH, and she
was due to come off the medication at the end of the week. Then she
got a cold and deteriorated.''
</P>
<P>
   The panic in her voice frightened me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring her in,'' I said, wondering what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to avoid conventional treatments, such as
immunosuppressants or chemotherapy, because they inflict widespread
destruction on the immune system. By the time the family arrived, I
had a plan. I said we would give Christy an intravenous dose of
immunoglobulins (IVIG), or antibodies. By flooding her blood with
so many normal antibodies, we might be able to throw off the
signaling that was directing the attack. If it worked, I explained,
we'd give it to Christy once a month for several months.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure costs as much as $20,000, so I had to convince
Christy's insurance company of its worth. The representative had
never heard of opsoclonus-myoclonus. Was the treatment standard
care or research, he asked. I said I would fax reports on the few
published cases of IVIG treatment that I knew of. We waited. Two
weeks passed. Approval came _ for one dose.
</P>
<P>
   Christy returned to the clinic, and the nurse infused her with
IVIG. The procedure took three hours. While everyone else worried,
Christy fell asleep in her mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Later the father took me aside. If Christy's OMS had been
treated earlier, he asked, could she have recovered? I said that
although the syndrome has been known for at least 40 years, few
physicians are aware of it. Too often the telltale eye movements
and muscle jerks are mistaken for symptoms of a simple viral
infection. So no one gets treated for OMS right away.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hit on the head with a brick, we are quick to follow
certain protocols. But we are only beginning to realize that when
the immune system attacks brain cells, the consequences can be just
as serious.
</P>
<P>
   The antibodies seemed to work, and Christy soon regained lost
ground. I decided to reduce the ACTH dosage but not stop it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That was months ago. I recently received a birthday announcement
from the family. Christy had turned 3. Her cheeks were puffy from
steroids, but she was running. Smiling faces in the family photo
told me everything I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Christy's future is uncertain. I don't know if she will
ever be able to live independently or hold a job. I don't know if
she'll have learning disabilities or mental retardation. I do know
that relapses will be likely.
</P>
<P>
   ACTH withdrawal and childhood infections _ particularly those
that produce a fever _ could provoke her immune system into another
rampage. I worried that using drugs to subdue her immune system
might weaken her resistance to serious infections or even another
kind of tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Although we take precautions, the hormone, too, could stunt her
growth and harm her health. And nobody knows how long children who
suffer from OMS need to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, do no harm _ the tenet of my medical education _
echoed in my thoughts. But there were no better options for
treating OMS.
</P>
<P>
   At least Christy's brain had an opportunity to resume its
critical development. The rest was up to the plasticity and
resilience of youth.

   &UR; BATTLE FATIGUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Munroe spends his days thinking about how to avoid getting
killed in the new millennium. He's not paranoid _ he's doing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   As warrior systems integration team leader at the Natick Soldier
Center in Massachusetts, Munroe is developing a vision of what
American soldiers will be wearing in combat a quarter century
hence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army is preparing to roll out uniforms that include
video-display goggles and a chest-mounted mouse for weapons and
radio controls.
</P>
<P>
   Munroe's Future Warrior 2025 concept draws on much more far-out
engineering. Night-vision glasses correct for the distortion caused
by the curvature of the visor. The helmet, called ``headgear
subsystem-information central,'' links with the soldier's suit and
firearm so that the soldier need only look at a target and the
voice-activated gun is locked on and ready to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The suit itself is a bullet-resistant mesh of carbon nanotubes.
It circulates hot or cold water to keep the wearer comfortable and
contains embedded enzymes to neutralize biological or chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Future Warrior 2025 is just a dream _ or a nightmare.
The necessary technology is years off, and the mockup at the Natick
Soldier Center isn't a working prototype _ it's a ``conceptual
simulation'' to stimulate the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one decide what a conceptual simulation of
tomorrow's soldier should look like?
</P>
<P>
   ``The black suit shows you he's of the future,'' Munroe
explains.

 &UR; DINOSAUR ON THE GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duck-billed dinosaurs, 30-foot-long plant-eaters that once
roamed much of North America, were hardly bigger than toy poodles
when they hatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost nothing you can think of as vulnerable as a
16-inch-tall duck-billed dinosaur,'' says paleontologist Jack
Horner of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a tiny baby dino to do? Grow fast like a bird, not
slowly like a lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Horner, paleontologist Kevin Padian of the University of
California at Berkeley, and their colleagues examined fossil
embryos and hatchlings from three types of duck-bills to figure out
how they matured. The researchers counted the number of microscopic
blood vessels in the part of the bone surrounding the marrow _ a
large blood supply denotes fast growth. They also examined
embryonic bone from modern alligators, ostriches and emus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinosaurs had even more vascular space than the birds. It
looks like they grew up to somewhere between nine and 12 feet long
in just one year,'' Horner says.
</P>
<P>
   They may have looked like lizards, but Horner finds that
dinosaurs had evolved a birdlike, fast-paced development style to
survive the cretaceous competition. ``In other words, birds didn't
invent this method of growth. It was invented by their dinosaur
ancestors.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; TRAFFIC WITH THE WEATHER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morning newscasters give a fairly accurate prediction of the
day's weather. Wouldn't it be nice if they could also give
forecasts of traffic jams?
</P>
<P>
   Civil engineer John Leonard of the Georgia Institute of
Technology has created a set of computer programs to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard collects car speeds from automated roadway cameras and
feeds the numbers into the program, which turns them into
color-coded maps showing how long it takes to travel from a given
starting point to more than 5,000 destinations.
</P>
<P>
   He has also created a database summarizing the past two years of
traffic speeds. When this database is combined with information on
current happenings, such as special events in town or holidays,
Leonard can anticipate what commuters should prepare for.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard expresses traffic on a numerical scale. An open
interstate would rate a 30, while heavy congestion might rate a
100. Many people could leave for work 15 minutes earlier, if they
knew they were facing a messy drive. That small change, he says,
could decrease congestion and frustration.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; GENE-IUS COMPUTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Engineers planning tomorrow's supercomputers are finding it hard
to beat the power of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   DNA expresses information as a sequence of molecules along the
double helix in much the same way that silicon chips process
information as zeroes and ones, but DNA is far more efficient: One
gram of the molecules could hold as much data as a trillion CDs.
</P>
<P>
   So two research groups have turned to DNA to crack math problems
containing so many variables that they overwhelm conventional
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Chemist Robert Corn of the University of Wisconsin in Madison
likens the problem to finding pizza that will satisfy everyone in a
group. If there were two possible toppings the task would be
simple, but even a hundred would be unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and his colleagues began their attack by covering a glass
surface with individual DNA strands, each one a genetic sequence
describing one possible solution (a unique combination of toppings,
for instance). Then the researchers repeatedly dipped the glass in
a beaker containing complementary snippets of DNA, which
represented one set of correct options (mushrooms or olives, no
anchovies, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   When the floating bits of DNA found matching strands on the
glass, the two linked up. Unmatched strands were destroyed; then
the process was repeated with a new set of options. Eventually, the
process produced genetic sequences that satisfied all the
variables.
</P>
<P>
   Another team led by Michael Pirrung, a chemist at Duke
University in Durham, N.C., followed the same general procedure but
added an enzyme that attached a glowing molecule to the winning set
of DNA strands instead of destroying the losers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, DNA computers are slow and clumsy, but their logic
applies to everything from codebreaking to finding the most
efficient way to visit multiple destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can solve this problem, it's proof of the principle
that you can solve any problem,'' Corn says.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I make stuffed animals with a college theme and want to
market them. The pattern I use is copyrighted. Does that mean the
finished product is also? Do I need permission from a college to
sell something with its logo? How about if I use the college colors
and include a manufactured pin or what-not? Do I need to copyright
my finished product?
</P>
<P>
   _ L. J
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Purchasing the pattern undoubtedly gives you a license to
make, use or sell items made from it,'' says Andrew Dillon, patent
attorney at Felsman, Bradley, Vaden, Gunter &AMP; Dillon. Generally the
logos, colors, etc. of colleges are copyrighted and licensed to
others for commercial use. So yes, you need permission for an
official product. Simply making an animal of the school colors and
then putting on a licensed school pin or clip would be OK, adds
Dillon. Registering a copyright is not necessary. Put an
appropriate copyright notice (''copyright'' or the circled ``c'',
the year of first publication and your name) in order to avoid
someone alleging that they are an ``innocent infringer.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: An over-friendly bird spends hours each day flying directly
into a window. The noise is heard throughout the house. Can you
help us save this bird and our window?
</P>
<P>
   _ Felicity M.
</P>
<P>
   A: This bird sees its own reflection, and either thinks this
other bird is competition or a conceivable mate. It is defending
territory or trying to meet a possible prom date. Cover the window
with cardboard to eliminate the reflection or place a rubber snake
or plastic owl on the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, a funeral procession was on a small two-lane road
leading to the cemetery. What is the proper thing to do when a
procession passes?
</P>
<P>
   _ Debra T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Pull over, stop and let the cortege pass in an unbroken line.
This shows respect for the family and the occasion. In addition,
out-of-town attendees may get lost unless they stay with the
procession. What's the harm in a few idle moments?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have always stored my mink coat with a professional, but a
friend told me I don't need to. She said as long as I keep the
house cool, the coat would be fine. I certainly don't want to
damage my fur in any way, but saving this money and time would be
nice. Is this correct? Can I store the coat at home, and if so,
what room temperature would be safe? Other tips?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Really want to keep your home at 45 degrees, 50 percent
humidity this summer? Nippy and expensive. That is the recommended
climate for fur storage, according to the Fur Information Council.
Remember, closets are usually 10 degrees warmer than the rest of
the house. Improper storage will shorten the life of your fur by
drying out the natural oils in the leather. In addition,
professional storage is an opportunity to have your fur cleaned and
mended if necessary. Furs should be stored on a broad-shouldered
hanger out of direct sunlight (not in a cedar chest).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have shredded years of old records _ paid bills, bank
statements, etc. _ as I don't want everybody to know our account
numbers and business. I put two of the large brown paper bags (used
for lawn clippings) full of shredded paper and the recycling guys
never took them. Can you advise me what to do to get rid of this
paper?
</P>
<P>
   _ Pat D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write ``recycled paper'' on the front or top of the bag.
Perhaps the recyclers weren't sure what the bags contained. More
recycling questions? Contact Solid Waste Services at 499-2111.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My back yard is full of snails. Some are bigger than a
half-dollar. What kind of snails are they? What do they eat besides
my aloe vera plant?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably the brown garden snail, says entomologist John
Jackman, of Texas A&AMP;M Extension Service. They eat almost anything
and love humidity. Baits work to control them, but so does a saucer
of beer (they sip, then drown). Copper strips are sometimes used as
snail barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time we travel to Europe we run into different
holidays. That puts a damper on shopping as the stores are all
closed! Is there a list of foreign holidays?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Shopkeepers in European countries often have a fairly
cavalier attitude about hours. So, verify museum and shop hours
with the concierge when you arrive. In general, museums are closed
on Monday, and many shops close daily for a long lunch break. Visit
tyzo.com for info on scheduled holidays. Tyzo.com also offers
information on time zones, dialing codes and currency for world
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a pair of vintage Levi's that I would like hemmed.
Vintage Levi's have a special hem stitch called a chain stitch. Do
you know of anyone that can do it? I would really like to keep
these authentic.
</P>
<P>
   _ P.M. A: You need Denim Doctors. Holes to hems are repaired
with strict attention to authenticity. Send your Levis to Denim
Doctors Repairs, 8044 West Third St., Los Angeles, Calif. 90048.
Include your name, return address and telephone number. Want to
discuss your beloved jeans? Call (800) JEANSDR. Q: My son and I are
at odds, and hopefully you can settle things. I say Haley Joel
Osment, the great young actor who played Cole in ``The Sixth
Sense,'' is the same kid who leads the classroom uprising in the
Pizza Hut commercial where he rallies his classmates to ``The
Edge.'' Nothing but family honor riding on this, but it's driving
me NUTS!
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeff R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your son wins. Pizza Hut's spokeswoman Patty Sullivan says
``The Edge'' ad features ``just a child actor, not Osment.'' But I
understand your confusion. The 12-year-old is ubiquitous _
``Forrest Gump'' (the child) to the ``Jeff Foxworthy Show'' (Matt),
and at the tender age of 4 appeared in a 1992 series of Pizza Hut
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our entire new deck was built with treated wood. Now I worry
that the whole family and pets are tracking toxins (I know they use
a percentage of arsenic, etc., in the treatment), into our home and
carpets and beds from our bare feet, etc. Can you find out for me?
</P>
<P>
   _ Loree G,
</P>
<P>
   A: The wood has probably been treated with chromated copper
arsenate (CCA), which does not present a problem to your family
through direct contact, says Texas Department of Health's John F.
Villanacci. CCA can leach into the soil. Unless your pets or
children ingest substantial amounts of the soil, CCA will not cause
a problem. The major concern surrounding CCA-treated lumber is its
disposal. Such wood should not be burned. Concerns about landfill
disposal of this lumber (will the chemicals leach into the
groundwater?) also exist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a poem along the lines of the ``Last Leaf on
the Tree.'' I think it's about growing old and losing all your
friends over the years until you are the last leaf left. Ever heard
of it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ali T.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Last Leaf,'' by Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) _
Harvard Medical School anatomy professor and father of the Supreme
Court justice who penned the phrase ``clear and present danger.''
Written around 1831, this poem is a salute to Maj. Thomas Melville,
grandfather of Herman Melville, author of ``Moby Dick.'' The last
leaf (line) refers to Melville's interactions with a younger
generation: ``And if I should live to be, The last leaf upon the
tree, In the spring, Let them smile, as I do now, At the old
forsaken bough, Where I cling.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is hard money? Soft money?
</P>
<P>
   _ Louis P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hard money is money raised and spent according to federal
regulations and restrictions. This money is used to advocate a
specific candidacy. Unions and corporations cannot contribute to a
hard-money fund. In addition, federal law limits contributions to
$1,000 per voter and $5,000 a year per political action committee
per election.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is essentially everything else. Soft money
contributions are to be used for generic party-building activities
as well as local and state political activities (e.g.
get-out-the-vote drives), notes the Center for Responsible
Politics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I make stuffed animals with a college theme and want to
market them. The pattern I use is copyrighted. Does that mean the
finished product is also? Do I need permission from a college to
sell something with its logo? How about if I use the college colors
and include a manufactured pin or what-not? Do I need to copyright
my finished product?
</P>
<P>
   _ L. J
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Purchasing the pattern undoubtedly gives you a license to
make, use or sell items made from it,'' says Andrew Dillon, patent
attorney at Felsman, Bradley, Vaden, Gunter &AMP; Dillon. Generally the
logos, colors, etc. of colleges are copyrighted and licensed to
others for commercial use. So yes, you need permission for an
official product. Simply making an animal of the school colors and
then putting on a licensed school pin or clip would be OK, adds
Dillon. Registering a copyright is not necessary. Put an
appropriate copyright notice (''copyright'' or the circled ``c'',

 &HT;    What is technology doing to kids' minds? It's creating a new way
of thinking
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ These children, they used to call them nerds.
</P>
<P>
   As they tap-tap-tapped on midget keyboards, eyesight weakened
from pre-EPA-approved, radiation-spewing monitors, the kids spoke
of their love of computers in secret. They joined computer clubs
that met after class, a refuge from the after-school-bell bullies _
because what they were doing didn't remotely approach a state of
acceptable coolness.
</P>
<P>
   They wore corduroy. They might have liked it.
</P>
<P>
   And then the revolution came, quietly in the '80s, then loudly
through the '90s, making a lot of people rich, and putting the
hobby tools of their youth into every home, every low-rent hotel,
on the counters of gas stations, until the computers were
everywhere. Until it was OK.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and modems and the mighty Web are as ubiquitous in a
child's vocabulary as the multiplication table. The geeks did
inherit the Earth. The archaic DOS became the unstable Windows, and
every barely computer-literate person who wasn't a gifted and
talented child could shove a mouse around and feel wired. Now
parents fret about digital divides and computers in the classroom.
Are they learning online? Will they know enough?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that computers, and more importantly, the Internet,
are changing the way children learn, develop and think. Today's
technotykes will be tomorrow's information wranglers. They'll work
in real-time, though hopefully not by speaking in useless info-age
buzzwords. They will think in multidimensions, incorporating
hyperlinks, sound and video into their everyday communication. The
adults of tomorrow will learn to work as teams, pushing gigabytes
of information around like scraps of Post-It notes. No, forget
tomorrow. They're doing it now.
</P>
<P>
   GALS AND THEIR WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Stanley had a computer in her home even when her family
chose not to keep a TV or radio in the house. ``I've been around
computers all my life,'' she said. The 13-year-old, who comes from
a family of computer enthusiasts, learned how to paint jeans at a
camp last summer. Now she wants to sell her wearable art online.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda's curious eyes and chatty conversation belie a mind built
for multitasking. She is enrolled in Giga Gals, a program that
started at the Austin Children's Museum in February. Web designers
help 9- to 18-year-olds get online and start their own sites, from
Web diaries to e-commerce ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Evans, co-owner of Austin's Digital Voodoo, a Web
design firm, has been helping Amanda get her site up and running.
And, it turns out, they were perfectly matched. ``I used to paint
jeans in college,'' Evans said. ``It's a total coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said she's been surprised by the pace of Amanda's work.
While Evans gets a crash course in pop culture from the teenager,
her student is picking up Web skills at a rate much faster than
most adults could, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has no fear,'' Evans said. ``Kids are faster at absorbing
the technology. The interest level is higher and they're closer to
the technology. Some adults don't want to be a part of the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids and young adults coming of age just as Internet access has
become cheap and commonly available may have an advantage in the
information age over adults who approach new technologies as if
they're learning a new language.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Sams, who coordinates Giga Gals, said that's because kids
have become accustomed to a time when information is available at
their fingertips. Instead of cracking dusty encyclopedias, they
consult CD-ROMs and search engines. ``I'm always shocked,'' Sams
said. ``They have a whole world of information and it's made their
world a lot smaller than ours. I think it's really changing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sams, who with her nose ring and bright flower-shaped hair clips
looks like an enthusiastic teenager herself, says she doesn't think
today's kids are any smarter. ``They're still beating the hell out
of each other and running wild,'' she said. But they are savvier.
``There's the opportunity for them to be more creative as
technology becomes more affordable. There are just more things to
stimulate how smart they are.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the digital divide that sociologists fear will
keep that technology away from kids who need it most?
</P>
<P>
   Sams once taught a class of Spanish-speaking students who had
had little or no contact with the Net. Given the opportunity, they
quickly caught up, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids could hardly speak English,'' she said, ``but they
knew how to get around the Internet. We communicated that way.''
</P>
<P>
   THE WEB _ 'IT JUST IS'
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Human Code, an Austin multimedia company, hosted a
forum on the future of education that aired locally on KLRU. Titled
``Class of 2012,'' the show brought together four experts,
including Brenda Laurel, co-founder of Purple Moon, a now-defunct
kids' software developer, and Elliot Soloway of the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the role of teachers, computers and privatization for
the future of education, the talk came back again and again to the
subject of kids and technology. Will computers and the Web act as
substitutes for teachers, or will they aid students in learning
necessary skills for a quickly changing world?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, one panelist concluded, ``It's not a question of (if
technology is) good or bad,'' said Milton Glick, a provost at
Arizona State University. ``It just is.''
</P>
<P>
   Children, the panelists said, are becoming gatherers of
information, sometimes beating teachers to the punch and bringing
their own research and data to the classroom. And while the
Internet may not give them the humanistic skills they need _
communication with others and work ethics, for instance _
technology may help amplify the skills they will need for the jobs
they take on, many of which haven't been invented yet. In a world
where even the most trivial bit of data is available with a mouse
click, will kids need memorization skills?
</P>
<P>
   A surprising side-effect of the Internet's growth may be on
basic learning. Sue Cole, a computer class teacher at Mendez Middle
School and instructor at River City Youth Foundation's after-school
computer lab, said kids are suddenly becoming interested in good
spelling. ``One of the first things I saw was that the Internet
requires students to focus on their spelling. If you don't spell it
right, you don't get there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole has watched her students embrace the Net, and that has
changed their relationships with friends, parents and relatives.
``They're finding new ways to communicate with each other using the
written expression,'' she said. ``They're searching the Net and
looking for lost relatives and the origins of their names.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems, she finds, is the one that's been
around since the Web took off _ shielding kids from pornography and
hate sites. But almost as bad, she said, is that kids have to be
weaned from quick-developing addictions to the Internet. ``Once
they find out how exciting it is, that's all they want to do. We
have to remind students that they have a life outside the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing presence of computers and the Internet at
schools, traditional teaching may not harness the power of the new
technology, some say. Arthur VanderVeen, chief executive of
Austin-based ActiveInk Corp., believes children can learn best by
solving real-world problems and becoming active participants in
what they study.
</P>
<P>
   His company produces Internet educational software for
kindergarten through 12th grades. While the firm doesn't yet sell
its services to the Austin Independent School District, VanderVeer
said ActiveInk is working with 22 other school districts in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Using ActiveInk, students take on projects, working in teams and
using spreadsheets, databases and computer simulations to create
plans of action. If it sounds like the inner workings of a
high-tech firm, that's intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create an environment, replicating the
processes that come up in work environments,'' he said. ``We've
gone to the corporate environment to find out 'what are the skills
students need to succeed in the new economy?' Traditional education
is not preparing students for those skills.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wright, who with his wife, Aletha Houston, runs the
University of Texas Center for Research for the Influences of
Television on Children, has been turning his attention to
interactive entertainment. Teaching kids using models of real-world
events can help them engage in non-linear thinking, he said. And
computers are helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a wonderful educational thing,'' Wright said.
``It facilitates thinking in larger concepts and bigger language.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright is not so optimistic for kids who don't have
computers or Internet access. ``Can you take kids from an
environment where the parents didn't have any interactive
electronic experience and have them, in a single generation, join
the digital world? For children of color, the lag is getting worse,
but only because others are advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIDGING THE MATH GAP
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday morning, in a cheery house near the University of
Texas, a group of mothers and their daughters are looking at a
dismantled computer, learning the difference between RAM and a hard
drive after a snack of powdered donuts and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, they're putting together their own Web pages,
coding background colors and choosing clip art. It's part of a
program begun by Girlstart, a local non-profit group aimed at
helping another kind of digital divide _ the one that founder
Rachel Muir says is widening between girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
   Muir, a 26-year-old who began Girlstart as Smartgirls two years
ago, said research suggests girls often lose interest in technology
during middle school, veering off from possible careers in math and
computer sciences. That's why, she said, a major gender gap exists
in the mostly male high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls start off with a strong sense of entitlement, but we see
that diminish substantially between sixth and seventh grade,'' Muir
said. ``If a girl doesn't select a path in math or science in
middle school, she won't have the building blocks to pursue it in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   So, using weekend courses and summer camps, Girlstart has tried
to bridge that gap, a few students at a time. Kids by nature are
curious and want to take apart technology and learn how it works,
Muir said. ``We teach girls not to be afraid to take things apart
and break stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Like another Austin stalwart, software company Girl Games, Inc.,
the group is trying to educate girls and make technology more
accessible to them.
</P>
<P>
   The real-world implications are quickly apparent. The girls
learn desktop publishing and immediately see the results of their
work when their Web pages go live on the Internet or when they can
see a piece of video they've digitally edited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're teaching them to master their physical world,'' Muir
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Overton, a 9-year-old at the Saturday class, wanted to
publish a Web page after months of using the Web on her Dell home
computer and listening to Internet radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Shirley Overton, said she is constantly surprised by
the information absorbed by her daughters, including Sarah's older
sister, a Web designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime she needs to know anything, if I don't have an answer,
she goes to the Internet,'' Overton said. ``It's opened up the
whole world.''

 &HT;    Flash back to the '60s with Beetle Buggin
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Offering instant gratification appeal with its ease of play,
decent price point and rock solid arcade racing action, Beetle
Buggin ($20; www.infogrames. com; for the PC) is a hit. Add to that
a variety of fantastically fun play modes and the fact that you
really can't go wrong with those cuddly/funky cool Volkswagen
go-buggies, and you've got a must-have title. Targeted at the
``casual gamer,'' Beetle Buggin is all about fun in a '60s laden,
dope-smokin', love child world and less about complicated submenus,
upgrades and reward systems of driving ``simulations.'' Just hip,
groovy, romping and racing, baby. Lots of it. Go nuts.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Extending an elemental law of physics to include ``what goes up
must pull off a Varial before it comes down,'' Tony Hawk's Pro
Skater ($50; www.activision.com; for the Nintendo 64) brings all
the superlative joyousness from the outstanding Playstation game to
the N64. Essentially a direct port, world skate champ Tony Hawk and
nine of his cronies do the virtual vert and street skate thing with
unsurpassed fluidity and style. Faithful to its Playstation
counterpart, Tony 64 includes the same nine fully interactive
sprawling 3-D levels and a challenging reward system promising
long-term gameplay, especially in Career Mode. Control
configuration is deceptively sparse with an exponentially varied
number of moves and combos making for a long, steep learning curve.
It's novice friendly, nonetheless, as each rider comes complete
with the essential balance and trick skills of the real pros. The
gamer must learn to utilize said skills to their fullest in order
to earn points and capture pick-ups. Sadly softened, this N64
version has neither the thud-piddle-piddle skull smacks nor the
smatter of blood accompanied by a virtual crash and bail _and the
soundtrack is incomplete, stymied by the cartridge's limitation to
looped musical samples. But if you're really into excellent extreme
sports games such as this, you probably own a Playstation anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its hardware power, one of the best games currently
available for the Sega Dreamcast is a simple 2-D game that is as
addictive as ``Tetris.'' Chu Chu Rocket ($30, www.sega.com) is a
fast and frenetic party game in which you try to corral many
wandering mice into your home base rocket by placing arrows on a
simple grid while marauding cats try to attack . It sounds simple,
but in multi-player mode, you're fighting for real estate and mice
against up to three other players. When the game is in full swing,
you'll be cursing those orange cats and your devious fellow
players. Chu Chu is also the first game you can play over Sega's
network. Simple and fun, it's the year's best console party game.

 &HT;    Tetris for tots
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   The classic, all consuming, highly addictive Tetris has been
reworked and specifically revamped for preschoolers as Kids Tetris
($30; www. hasbro-interactive. com; for the PC). Still utilizing
the familiar falling multi-gonal block shapes, Kids Tetris has
those traditional, ``elaborate'' puzzle pieces pre-fastened to form
more rudimentary block shapes that fall at a leisurely pace. More
importantly, the blocks are animated with happy cartoon faces that
actually talk to the player, giving hints, suggestions and joyful
words of encouragement. Fun, funny and rewarding gameplay, while
still offering elemental lessons in problem solving and motor
skills.

 &HT;    Quick View offers virus protection
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   When the Love Bug dominated the news, there was an article in
the paper suggesting protections. Something called Quick View was
mentioned, which allows you to view e-mail without launching a worm
or virus. What is Quickview?
</P>
<P>
   _ Stephen Wiesner, Parma, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Quick View Plus is a robust file-viewing utility for the
PC, with a neat little twist. It gained popularity as a shield
against viruses during the outbreak of Melissa in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Besides saving the frustration and time spent converting
files or fretting over files you can't open at all, Quick View Plus
is a great safety net against those nasty little intruders. By
using the utility to view file attachments, you can access contents
of a file without triggering a virus that might be lurking.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It packs a lot of muscle for $59, considering you can view
files downloaded from the Web and e-mail attachments, including
photos and graphics, in a heartbeat. Text, spreadsheets, database
files, presentations, compressed files, HTML. You name it. The
utility supports more than 200 file formats.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Mac and PC file-type incompatibilities don't get in its
way either. Plus, you don't spend big bucks on multiple software
packages. Surf to jasc.com and click the Products link.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking for a Web site that gives the names and addresses of
people living on the same street. I know the site exists because
I've been there before, but I don't remember how I got there. Can
you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ John Koval, Lorain, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Try out AT&AMP;T AnyWho Info at anywho.com or InfoSpace at
infospace.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: What a great way to get to know your neighbors and
organize a block party. Both sites were easy to use, but navigation
came easier with AnyWho. You can type the info on the first page
and get a pretty good listing. According to Alice, none of these
sites has comprehensive lists. Getting accurate lists depends on
where the site is getting its info and how often it's updated.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: InfoSpace requires a couple of extra clicks. Once you
navigate to InfoSpace, click on the White Pages link. At the bottom
of the page, click on Reverse Lookup for Address. Type in the
street name, city and state and get a listing.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Of course, if someone's personal information is unlisted,
you won't find them anywhere. Also, if you are attempting an e-mail
search for someone who is using AOL, they will not be listed
either.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd write for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ www.telenaut.com/gst _ Post your original
artwork and view other kids' art in virtual galleries on the Global
Show-'n-Tell home page. Each of the five galleries, organized by
age group, are named after an endangered species with links to
learn more about those species. The artwork, however, doesn't seem
to be restricted to nature motifs.
</P>
<P>
   www.kidlink.org _ The well-established site based in Norway is
celebrating its 10th anniversary this month. It claims more than
135,000 kids from 135 countries have participated over the years.
The site aims to facilitate a global dialogue for children over the
Internet _ through e-mail lists, chat rooms and various Web-based
dialogues in 15 languages _ in an effort to engender understanding
among cultures and, simply, to make new friends. To participate, a
child must answer these four questions: Who am I? What do I want to
be when I grow up? How do I want the world to be better when I grow
up? What can I do now to make this happen?

 &HT;    Plenty of sites profess to track your lucky stars
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of you almost certainly use the Web for scholarly
pursuits _ happily researching the gross national product for
Brazil, or finding a great vendor for epoxy cement, or perhaps
gauging the influence of epic poems on modern literature.
</P>
<P>
   But some people use the Web to check their horoscopes. If you
think that's in the stars for you, then today you'll find enough
sites to preserve your peace of mind. The notion is this: If you
don't like the horoscope you find on one site, simply continue down
the list until you find a prediction that suits you.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best horoscope sites on the Web _ there seems little
argument to the contrary _ is the product of an astrologer called
Jonathan Cainer who writes for a London newspaper. His Web site at
www.bubble.com/webstars/ is often a bit slow because of that
popularity. That's why you might want to note a ``mirror site''
that offers the same Web pages at www.cainer.com/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the expected daily and weekly horoscopes here, as
well as predictions for the year; general information about each
astrological sign; a way to check for astrological compatibility
with other signs; and RealAudio files that deliver a longer audio
version of your horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the content on this page _ including everything listed
above _ is free, but Cainer does sell some astrological reports.
The commercial content here isn't blatant and, if you just come to
check your horoscope, you'll never notice it (which probably would
dismay Cainer).
</P>
<P>
   AstroNet, at www.astronet.com/, is one of the slickest horoscope
sites on the Web. Again, you'll find free daily and weekly
horoscopes and other standard features. And that's probably what
most people are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who are truly interested in astrology, this site
has articles that discuss various trends in depth. You'll find
links to these articles on the opening page.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good Australian site for astrology called Blackstump
Horoscope Leader at www.blackstump.com.au/horo.htm. It's a fun stop
since, once you've checked out your stars, you can also find the
latest scores for Australian Rules Football or just browse the
headlines from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The actual horoscope information is a collection of links to
other sites, including Cainer's. But there are some unusual links
here, including one to a Chinese astrology site.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, of course, follow their horoscopes using the daily
newspaper. And Sydney Omarr is a popular columnist in many papers.
If you're away from the newspaper but still want to see that
horoscope, you can find Omarr's predictions at
washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/ style/columns/horoscope.htm.
</P>
<P>
   As at many of the sites, you'll also be able to check out your
compatibility _ at least where astrology is concerned _ with a
potential mate. And you'll get advice on choosing a real-world
astrologer as well as health tips based on your sign.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Fox, another well-known astrologer, runs a site called
Astrology.com, which is located, logically enough, at
www.astrology.com. You'll find fairly detailed astrological
forecasts here and _ just as is true with Cainer's site _ also find
a commercial section where you can buy full-blown charts.

 &HT;    Fax machine saves its owners money
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A new fax machine from Sharp Document and Network
Systems of America can cut the cost of running a home business by
finding the cheapest available phone company to handle any fax or
telephone call to another state.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L is one of the first fax machines on the market to
utilize low-cost routing technology, according to a press release
from the office product division of Sharp Electronics Corp. The
product is made possible by a collaboration between Sharp and
openLCR.com, a Web-based telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy the UX-345L, you link the machine to the
openLCR.com Web site to prepare it to work. From the site, the fax
machine downloads a listing of all pricing information for the
available long-distance companies to a chip in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   When the user dials an area code and the first three digits of
the number being called, the UX-345L checks its list and picks the
company with the lowest rate for that day of the week and time of
day.
</P>
<P>
   Users don't have to remember access codes for different
long-distance services or sign up with new long-distance carriers.
They also retain their current telephone billing system; the calls
directed by the UX-345L will be itemized on the customers' regular
phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The machine links to the openLCR.com Web site once a month to
get the latest rate information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the low-cost routing feature, the UX-345L has all
the bells and whistles found on other moderately priced plain-paper
fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   It has a 60-sheet paper cassette and about 28 pages of built-in
memory that can store incoming faxes when the paper cassette is
empty.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L has distinctive ring detection that allows up to
four telephone numbers to ring on one telephone line, a caller ID
that displays the name and number of the caller, anti-junk fax
settings to block unwanted transmissions and a copier function.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a 10-page document feeder and an automatic cover
sheet writer, and it transmits an average page in about 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L sells for $129.99 at www.sharpoffice.com, and it's
available where office supplies are sold. For additional
information, call Sharp at (800) 237-4277 (BE-SHARP) or log on to
the www.sharpoffice.com site.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on the low-cost routing service,
visit www.openLCR.com.

 &HT;    Many browsing Web before heading to mall
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``No, thanks. Just looking.''
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you uttered or sneered or snapped that
phrase at some well-meaning salesperson at the mall determined to
separate you from your money? While you may make a purchase
eventually, first you have to decide which set of lawn furniture
will look best on your deck or if you really need a new teakettle
that whistles when the water's boiling.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about this: you want to buy a car but you have no idea if
the window sticker or the salesman are giving you the information
you need to make an informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and electronic commerce have turned on the lights
for uneducated consumers, giving us access to product information
we never had. Millions of wired users have gone online, many to
make purchases but many more just to look at manufacturers' Web
sites and product comparison sites like MySimon (www.mysimon.com)
or Bottom Dollar (www.bottomdollar.com) to research before they
buy.
</P>
<P>
   A new study from Internet research firm Jupiter Communications
suggests that e-commerce is not limited to online purchases, which
Jupiter estimates will hit about $200 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In its most interesting finding, the study also says consumers
will spend three times that amount offline in brick-and-mortar
retail outlets, catalogs or other traditional shopping outlets
armed with the research they have done on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggests that e-commerce isn't just about selling
merchandise online, it's about educating consumers. Jupiter says
there is no doubt the Web will generate millions in sales in the
years to come, but the actual transaction could come from any
established retail channel _ the Web, the mall or even the catalog
that just came in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta start-up company called Figleaves.com sells men's and
women's undergarments online but also plans to open a
brick-and-mortar store in New York later this year. The company
says users shouldn't be limited to having just one outlet to
purchase its products.
</P>
<P>
   Upscale retailer Neiman Marcus is working with another Atlanta
company to bring a multidimensional approach to the online shopping
experience. Users will be able to visit a virtual Manolo Blahnik
shoe salon and examine the pricey footwear from a variety of
angles. But it's the rare customer who will spend upwards of $500
for a product only seen online, although online ordering is
possible. Many shoe lovers will head directly to the nearest
Neiman's and request the shoes they admired on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter says the Web offers a world of opportunity to display
products and educate users, thus generating sales. Jupiter's study
says the Web actually exerts a tremendous influence over purchases
made in the real world as well as online.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Jupiter uses Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines as a
prime example of Web browsing. Users may visit the cruise line's
site to research a trip to Alaska and decide when they want to go
and what type of cabin they would like, based on factors such as
availability and price.
</P>
<P>
   While the user may not make an online reservation, Jupiter says
the customer has practically completed the ``buying cycle'' and
that the travel agent or telephone representative who does make the
reservation will complete the sale much more quickly as a result.
The actual purchase of items could be called ``the last mile'' of
electronic commerce. If all the work is done online, where the
actual dollars change hands isn't that important in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Browsers'' is the term Jupiter applies to consumers who do
extensive research on products and services online but have yet to
make an online purchase, and most browsers will spend money on the
items they are researching.
</P>
<P>
   I know several people who have spent weeks researching
everything from Saturn automobiles to Oriental rugs online. None of
them plan to make online purchases of those items, but they say the
knowledge they've gained from their research has been invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   One walked into the car dealership armed with the ``blue book''
price of her current car and the exact location and price of the
car she wanted. Another says she now knows what a good Oriental rug
should cost and how to distinguish quality. Another acquaintance
has been spending hours online researching the perfect home theater
system.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to making an actual purchase, all three say
they will go to a traditional real-world retailer.
</P>
<P>
   And Jupiter's study would agree with comic Jerry Seinfeld's
line: ``Not that there's anything wrong with that.''

 &HT;    `Jet Grind Radio' among console games that will be hot this year
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the Sega booth during the E3Expo in Los Angeles
recently, the line to play ``Jet Grind Radio'' was so long company
officials sometimes had to ask enthusiasts to stop so others could
play the new video game.
</P>
<P>
   The highly anticipated game is for the Sega Dreamcast and will
be released this fall. Here are 10 of the top non-sports games on
all the consoles _ PlayStation 2, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and
Dreamcast _ that will go on sale before the holiday season:
</P>
<P>
   ``Conker's Bad Fur Day'' (N64): This was the biggest surprise
for Nintendo at the convention. Story line: Conker the squirrel had
a bad night and, equipped with only a frying pan and hangover, is
about to experience the worst day of his life. The cute little
animal shows his dark side by doing his best to ruin the daily
activities of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Cloud'' (PS2): Many journalists studied this game at the
E3Expo to fully comprehend the graphic capabilities of Sony's new
system. In this role-playing game, young hero Toran finds that an
evil spirit has wreaked destruction on all living things. The
beauty and detail of the landscapes are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead or Alive 2'' (DC, PS2): Even though the game has been out
for a month on Sega, it has been almost impossible to find a copy
in stores. The Tecmo-produced fighting game has been No. 1 in
Dreamcast sales for the past three weeks. The reason? Graphically
rich fighting locations, ranging from a lush opera house to a
moving elevator cage and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvel vs. Capcom 2'' (DC): Capcom Entertainment is releasing
its No. 1 arcade hit to the console market. The game features a
record number of playable characters (more than 50) for pure action
fighting, including special three-on-three battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gorkamorka'' (DC): Ripcord Games recently formed a partnership
with Sega and unveiled four upcoming games for the system,
including this one. The game is a rarity, as it combines
combat-style action with racing. It's best in the two-player mode,
where one can race the vehicle while the partner focuses on blowing
up the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jet Grind Radio'' (DC): Based on its popularity at the E3Expo,
this might be Sega's best-selling game of the fall. The plot is
simple: The city government has set forth a plan to keep kids from
expressing themselves in any way, shape or form. The kids rally
behind special skating shoes and spray paint to design their own
graffiti art. The colorful graphics are amazing, with characters in
full 3-D and everything else in 2-D.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Dark'' (N64): It's tough to follow the classic
``Golden Eye 007,'' but Rare far exceeded expectations with this
sequel. James Bond is no longer the central character, but rather
Joanna Perfect Dark _ who was the perfect student at spy school and
now has to face real-life espionage. The most fun part of game is
the four-player matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``SimTheme Park'' (PS2): Using the power of Sony's new system,
Electronic Arts takes this game great strides past the PlayStation
version. Players can wander through theme parks they create and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spyro: Year of the Dragon'' (PS): Spyro and Sparx are back in
a new adventure, faced with the challenge of defeating an evil
sorceress who has kidnapped all the dragon eggs. Skills required
include boxing, skateboarding, sharpshooting and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' (PS): Everyone's favorite
television game show set records for sales on the PC, and host
Regis Philbin was at the E3Expo to personally introduce the console
version.

 &HT;    Cell phones expand users opportunities
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember that famous line from the old ``Saturday
Night Live'' skit: It's a floor wax and a dessert topping. Only in
this case it's a telephone and a Web browser all rolled up in the
same neat package.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a wireless Web cellular phone, you can order a
book, check sports scores or get the latest news from CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and if you want to make a phone call, you can do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The newest generation of cellular phones has matchbook-sized
screens and built-in Internet browsers that let users access
everything from CNN to Yahoo to Amazon.com. Industry analysts
expect that most cellular phones will be Web-ready by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Users of wireless Web cell phone service can check e-mail, make
travel arrangements, get the latest stock quotes and even make a
phone call. Unlike personal digital assistants, interactive pagers
or other wireless devices, the wireless Web phone lets you do all
that without having a plethora of interactive devices strapped to
your belt or tucked into your purse.
</P>
<P>
   A Web phone is a handy thing to have. While sitting at an
airport, for example, you can log on to the Delta Air Lines Web
site, enter your flight number, discover that your plane has been
delayed by 45 minutes and either book another flight or just sit
back and have another cup of coffee in the lounge. While you're at
it, you can call your family and friends and tell them not to rush
to the airport to pick you up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as you wait patiently for your plane, you can do
everything from buy books at Amazon.com to check your e-mail.
Americans are now finding out what the folks in Scandinavia have
known for quite some time. Being able to go online from your phone,
your pager or any other hand-held device is pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can use your Web phone to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Deanna Sanford said one of her colleagues went
shopping with a list his wife e-mailed to his Hotmail account. He
was able to wander the supermarket aisles while consulting the
e-mail message he retrieved on his cell phone to tell him which
groceries to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless technologies are the next Internet,'' said Debora
Wilson, president and chief executive of Weather.com, the online
offering by the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the same feeling about wireless that I had five years
ago about the Internet. The ability to receive information on
devices you carry around with you all day is the next wave of
things. It's like history repeating itself,'' she said. ``A year
ago, everyone wondered what would happen with wireless. It's been
so slow, because the Internet is such a force, but it's the next
wave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much potential (with wireless Web phones), but most
customers really haven't gotten into using their phones for data
yet,'' said EarthLink's vice president of product management, Tom
Andrus. He said educating consumers is the next step in the
development of the wireless Web phones and other wireless products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to education, there are other problems with this
early generation of Web phones. Even though there are people
happily devoted to Web phones, there are others who gripe that the
two- to five-line text-only messages most Web phones can handle are
hard to read and often useless.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the problem, many popular Web sites are not yet
optimized for Web phone users. For example, if you type in the Web
address for Salon using a Web phone, you will receive an error
message telling you the site isn't yet phone-ready. Similarly, if
you want to send e-mail, you'll have to do it over the Web-based
application that comes with your phone, typically Yahoo Mail or
Microsoft's Hotmail.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem are the extra buttons, toggle switches
and other gizmos added to cellular phones to give them Web
capability. The wireless Web is a handy add-on to a cellular phone,
but already there are plenty of users who can't figure out how to
make a local phone call, never mind surf the Web with their phones.
</P>
<P>
   Xcelerate, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company, operates a
``usability center'' in Atlanta where groups of experienced and
novice users are brought in to test the newest cellular
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Fawad Ahmad, managing director for wireless services at the
center, said the usability lab tries to find out how easy or
complicated it is for users to actually use the Web via the cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, we ask them to perform eight to 15 different
tests,'' he said. ``Let's say we are doing a test for Amazon.com.
We'll ask users to buy a book, and we'll tell them the title of the
book they're going to buy,'' he said. ``Then we see which phone
it's easiest to do it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said Xcelerate watches every move the testers make and
examines virtually every button on every phone. ``We observe their
body language, and we look at the screens on the phones and how
friendly they are to a Web-based application. It's pretty extensive
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said Web phone users must be comfortable using the Web via
a wireless device, and that it can take some time. He recommends
newer phones, which have larger screens than some of the earliest
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some newer phones have a separate keypad or three to four
buttons to use (to access the Web) and are much more
user-friendly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad believes the biggest problem now is that the tiny
telephone screen isn't big enough for most people who are used to a
17-inch color monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key assumption,'' Ahmad said, ``is that screen is not wide
enough or not long enough and you can't do Web browsing on a
two-line display. That drives people crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   While new cell phone technology is making it easier for users to
navigate their way around the Web, Internet companies developing
services for the wireless Web should keep several things in mind,
according to Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to be a leader in the wireless space, you
have to be innovative,'' he said. ``Your top three lines are your
best real estate. Put the stuff you know users want at the top so
people can read it without scrolling. You won't have as much
information as you have on the Web site, but people just want to
get to your site to use it. Don't give them ads, because then they
won't be able to do the actual task. ``
</P>
<P>
   One of the most active companies in the wireless area today is
Microsoft. It rolled out MSN Mobile 2.0 service in March as part of
its ``Everyday Web'' strategy. The thinking is that users of the
Microsoft Network and its family of Web sites aren't chained to
their PCs all day and will look to other devices for Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The MSN Mobile service allows users to access most of the MSN
Web sites including Hotmail, MoneyCentral, Expedia travel
information and even horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Sanford said MSN's mobile initiatives, including the
MSN Mobile 2.0 cell phone product, are part of the company's
Internet strategy to provide users a satisfying MSN experience on a
variety of devices. She said it's a strategy that's been in the
works for a long time. ``This isn't something you can do
overnight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's investment with wireless phone provider Nextel in
February 1999 got the MSN team thinking about the best way to
deliver MSN content to cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real challenge,'' Sanford said. ``There is limited
screen space, and people use their phones differently from how they
use the PC-based Web. People don't want to just surf. They want a
more focused experience. We approach it from making things really
timely and really relevant to make things right for the right
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things MSN did when developing products for
wireless devices was to make sure users could keep the passwords
they already use on the Web. Sanford said the key to a positive
wireless Web phone experience is to develop products that are
relevant for the phone, such as travel, maps and e-mail, some of
the most popular wireless Web services.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said getting Web-based information to customers quickly
is one of the biggest challenges so far. She said Microsoft uses
XML technology to strip the data from the Web pages and put it into
a format that mobile phone users can access quickly and easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the data network on the phone is slow,''
she said. ``But a lot of the lag time depends on how fast the site
can deliver information across the wireless network. You have to
employ the same kind of technology that Web sites already use to
optimize their pages so they'll load faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the Internet companies, Microsoft is trying to
develop applications for the Web phones that make sense for users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about a lot of things when we think about the
future of MSN Mobile,'' Sanford said. And she echoes the rest of
the industry that's still trying to tame a new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all so new,'' she said. ``We're all trying to figure out
what people want when they choose to stay connected with these
devices. We still don't know what people really want because the
phones are just coming out. We are trying to get at what people
would want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around for a year, so we have a slight advantage.
We know the Web phone should be able to give people things they can
use when they are out and about. We want to give them the ability
to get things done on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink Vice President Erika Jolly, who heads up EarthLink's
wireless Web phone efforts, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to think differently, because it's a totally
different environment. People are used to pictures and colors, so
we have to work to develop something that's still visually
appealing to the customer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not want a stock chart, but you may want to see the
stock price for that day. You may not want to see all your e-mail,
but maybe you'll want to flag e-mail from your boss or some of your
friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly said wireless Web users want information that's useful and
accessible, but that there's still a long way to go in terms of
development and ease of use. ``It's like the 9,600-baud modems when
they first came out,'' she said. ``Everyone thought they were lame.
There are some limitations on the phones right now, but we have to
be patient.''

 &HT;    That purring sound is coming from your PC
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Keep your home computer spiffed up and running
on all cylinders with Iolo Technologies' System Mechanic 3.2
(Shareware/30 days free, $20-$60; www.iolo.com, for Windows PCs). A
cadre of 12 powerful tools, this utility will optimize your PC's
Internet and network speed and security settings, remove invalid,
orphaned, obsolete and nonsense files, then find and fix broken
shortcuts. Also included is an easy-to-understand start-up manager,
a safe installation feature that tells you exactly what's been
altered after new programs are added, and even an incinerator as a
companion to the recycle bin for total obliteration of sensitive
files. System Mechanic did somehow allow this particular
click-happy user to lose track of his word processor, but for the
most part the cleaning machine is idiot friendly if not idiot
proof. The free and fully functioning 30-day-demo enticement is the
real kicker here. Try it out. As those holistic folks like to say,
there's nothing like a good purge to keep you spiffed.

 &HT;    Anyone can play guitar
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Look, you're never going be a true Austinite until you've
learned a few chords and opened for Jerry Jeff Walker. But, what's
that? You don't know how to play guitar? Before you sign up for
lessons, check out eMedia Guitar Method CD-ROM ($60 for Windows and
Macintosh, www.emedia.org). The CD-ROM teaches you guitar basics
with features like an animated fretboard, fretronome, a ``virtual''
guitar neck that illustrates where to put your fingers and a
selection of classic songs to practice, such as ``La Bamba'' and
``House of the Rising Sun.'' Other volumes of the software include
a roster of new songs and help from guitar whiz Peter Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN KICK IT, THIS WILL RECORD IT
</P>
<P>
   OK, you've learned how to play the guitar and you've put
together a band. The problem is that the major record labels aren't
calling. What do you do? You make your own garage-band-grunge CD.
Helping you in this is Sony's new ECM-MS907 one-point stereo
microphone ($100, www.sony.com). The microphone fits all Sony
minidisc and DAT players and offers superior sound recording in the
right situations, such as recording instruments. However, it didn't
work well in picking up vocals. It also boasts 90- and 120-degree
recording so you can bring the whole orchestra. A piece of advice:
Invite the whole band, can the droning lyrics and get right to the
guitar solo.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK GOOD WHILE YOU LISTEN
</P>
<P>
   You want to look good while listening to your tunes. That's why
you need to pick up Sony's Street Style Discman ($160,
www.sony.com). The industrial-looking Discman is a must-have for
the trendy, on-the-go set. The device is finished in chrome and red
translucent plastic and has a carrying strap, making it the
ultimate accoutrement to a rollerblading escapade. The Street Style
Discman also comes with Street Style headphones, which wrap around
the back of the head and provide awesome sound. If you think this
portable CD player just looks good, think again. This Discman is
equipped with Sony's patented ESP2, which is some of the best skip
protection on the market. With ESP2 and the Street Style Discman,
you'll never miss a beat _ and look good in the process.

 &HT;    Combatting viruses a never-ending task
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are times, like a couple of weeks ago, when it's
nice not to be on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to the weekend when most of the computerized world was
struggling with the I Love You virus. Yours truly was also
struggling, of course, but with an older and evidently lesser
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody sent me the I Love You virus. There would have been no
point in it. The memsahib and I have been married 43 years now, and
we don't exchange e-mails with I Love You in the header. Call us
unromantic if you will, but e-mail seems to lack something in terms
of intimacy. I can still recall those lightly perfumed letters I
got from her during our courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, if I should see ``I Love You'' amongst my messages,
at home or at work, I would assume it to be from a child seeking
money or an ad for a porno site. While it has been one of my
lifelong ambitions to be a sex object, only dogs and an amorous
goat in North Georgia have shown any inclination to follow me
around.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, I'm also leery of opening attachments
unless I know who they're from. Eudora Pro automatically saves
every attachment I get at home, so every so often I go through and
dump them all. Unfortunately, since I subscribe to several busy
mailing lists, there are a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the I Love You virus reminded me that it's been
awhile since I updated my Norton Anti-Virus protection. Upon doing
that, the system informed my that FNEBJ.EXE, in the Windows/System
directory, was infected with a virus called Back Door SubSeven22.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how long this little fellow has been lurking in my
computer, but he didn't seem to cause any trouble until he was
found. After many system lockups and reboots, Norton agreed to try
to repair the file but could not, suggesting quarantine instead.
</P>
<P>
   The program reports that Back Door SubSeven22 is a rare virus, a
``Trojan horse that creates a security hole into your system.'' Now
that the file is in quarantine, Windows squawks about it every time
the system is booted. Removal from WIN.INI helped, but Windows
still complains.
</P>
<P>
   Try as I might, I couldn't find FNEBJ.EXE anywhere on the
Windows 98 install disk, so one assumes it is created upon
installation. Whatever the case, Windows seems to run all right
without it.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after updating the virus information, Back Door
SubSeven22 showed up again, but this time Norton grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   The moral? Update your virus definitions regularly.

 &HT;    Atlanta to get preview of PlayStation 2
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Millions of video game gearheads are twiddling
their thumbs until October waiting for Sony's PlayStation 2. But
Atlanta gamers will get a hands-on test drive by early summer.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a $10 million promotional blitz for the sleek device
_ which has an upgraded video processor, DVD drive and expansion
slots for a broadband modem and hard drive _ Sony will bring the
game to Atlanta for Major League Baseball's Fan Fest 2000, July
7-11.
</P>
<P>
   Those who get a sneak peek of PS2 may be disappointed at first.
It's not much to look at. With a minimalist vertical design, it
looks like a nondescript black book sitting upright on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the new game platform has already become a media darling and
emerged as the Holy Grail for consumer electronic enthusiasts known
as ``early adopters'' who are already lining up to buy it. PS2 will
retail for about $300.
</P>
<P>
   The console has already been released in Japan, where it sold a
million units in the first week. It was also among the hottest new
products unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo held here
recently.
</P>
<P>
   PS2 promises to merge the features of a game console, a DVD
player and a desktop computer. But the computer features _ an
optional add-on broadband modem and hard drive _ won't be available
in October. Sony says peripherals will be available by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drive will allow gamers to more easily play software
that requires more than one disc. The modem will permit players to
compete over the Net _ and maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't outlined all the uses yet,'' said Ryan Bowling, a
spokesman for Sony. ``A lot of what we're going to do is still in
the works.''
</P>
<P>
   There are doubts the PS2 can live up to pre-release hype. Rick
Mears, an editor for a magazine called Gamefan, said he was
disappointed after paying $700 _ his own funds, not the magazine's
_ to get an early Japanese version.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling everybody it's this super gaming platform, but
it's not,'' Mears said. ``They'll probably sell a million of them,
but I already sold mine to someone else. It's not even better than
Sega Dreamcast, and that's been out for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mears added that while Sony is using PS2's expandability as a
major selling point, consumers may not be willing to wait or pay
extra money to use the additional features.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that Sony releases the (crummy) stuff
in Japan, but by the time it gets to America they will have fixed
all the bugs and flaws,'' Burney said. ``In the next year, it will
blow all the other game platforms away.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Sony PlayStation, which only played video games,
ranks as one of the biggest success stories in the $6.1 billion
video game industry. Since it was introduced in 1994, more than 26
million PlayStation units have been sold in North America. The new
unit will be able to play games designed for the older console.
</P>
<P>
   In a breathless, two-hour news conference in Los Angeles,
executives from Sony Computer Entertainment America announced their
plans for launching PS2 in North America in late October.
</P>
<P>
   ``PlayStation 2 is not the future of video game entertainment,''
said Kazuo Hirai, president and chief operating officer of the
company. ``It's the future of entertainment. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hirai may not have the last word. Industry rival Nintendo is
also developing a new entertainment console called Dolphin. And by
next year Microsoft is expected to release its X-box, yet another
high-powered gaming device with Internet capability.

 &HT;    What is technology doing to kids' minds? It's creating a new way
of thinking
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ These children, they used to call them nerds.
</P>
<P>
   As they tap-tap-tapped on midget keyboards, eyesight weakened
from pre-EPA-approved, radiation-spewing monitors, the kids spoke
of their love of computers in secret. They joined computer clubs
that met after class, a refuge from the after-school-bell bullies _
because what they were doing didn't remotely approach a state of
acceptable coolness.
</P>
<P>
   They wore corduroy. They might have liked it.
</P>
<P>
   And then the revolution came, quietly in the '80s, then loudly
through the '90s, making a lot of people rich, and putting the
hobby tools of their youth into every home, every low-rent hotel,
on the counters of gas stations, until the computers were
everywhere. Until it was OK.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and modems and the mighty Web are as ubiquitous in a
child's vocabulary as the multiplication table. The geeks did
inherit the Earth. The archaic DOS became the unstable Windows, and
every barely computer-literate person who wasn't a gifted and
talented child could shove a mouse around and feel wired. Now
parents fret about digital divides and computers in the classroom.
Are they learning online? Will they know enough?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that computers, and more importantly, the Internet,
are changing the way children learn, develop and think. Today's
technotykes will be tomorrow's information wranglers. They'll work
in real-time, though hopefully not by speaking in useless info-age
buzzwords. They will think in multidimensions, incorporating
hyperlinks, sound and video into their everyday communication. The
adults of tomorrow will learn to work as teams, pushing gigabytes
of information around like scraps of Post-It notes. No, forget
tomorrow. They're doing it now.
</P>
<P>
   GALS AND THEIR WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Stanley had a computer in her home even when her family
chose not to keep a TV or radio in the house. ``I've been around
computers all my life,'' she said. The 13-year-old, who comes from
a family of computer enthusiasts, learned how to paint jeans at a
camp last summer. Now she wants to sell her wearable art online.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda's curious eyes and chatty conversation belie a mind built
for multitasking. She is enrolled in Giga Gals, a program that
started at the Austin Children's Museum in February. Web designers
help 9- to 18-year-olds get online and start their own sites, from
Web diaries to e-commerce ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Evans, co-owner of Austin's Digital Voodoo, a Web
design firm, has been helping Amanda get her site up and running.
And, it turns out, they were perfectly matched. ``I used to paint
jeans in college,'' Evans said. ``It's a total coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said she's been surprised by the pace of Amanda's work.
While Evans gets a crash course in pop culture from the teenager,
her student is picking up Web skills at a rate much faster than
most adults could, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has no fear,'' Evans said. ``Kids are faster at absorbing
the technology. The interest level is higher and they're closer to
the technology. Some adults don't want to be a part of the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids and young adults coming of age just as Internet access has
become cheap and commonly available may have an advantage in the
information age over adults who approach new technologies as if
they're learning a new language.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Sams, who coordinates Giga Gals, said that's because kids
have become accustomed to a time when information is available at
their fingertips. Instead of cracking dusty encyclopedias, they
consult CD-ROMs and search engines. ``I'm always shocked,'' Sams
said. ``They have a whole world of information and it's made their
world a lot smaller than ours. I think it's really changing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sams, who with her nose ring and bright flower-shaped hair clips
looks like an enthusiastic teenager herself, says she doesn't think
today's kids are any smarter. ``They're still beating the hell out
of each other and running wild,'' she said. But they are savvier.
``There's the opportunity for them to be more creative as
technology becomes more affordable. There are just more things to
stimulate how smart they are.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the digital divide that sociologists fear will
keep that technology away from kids who need it most?
</P>
<P>
   Sams once taught a class of Spanish-speaking students who had
had little or no contact with the Net. Given the opportunity, they
quickly caught up, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids could hardly speak English,'' she said, ``but they
knew how to get around the Internet. We communicated that way.''
</P>
<P>
   THE WEB _ 'IT JUST IS'
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Human Code, an Austin multimedia company, hosted a
forum on the future of education that aired locally on KLRU. Titled
``Class of 2012,'' the show brought together four experts,
including Brenda Laurel, co-founder of Purple Moon, a now-defunct
kids' software developer, and Elliot Soloway of the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the role of teachers, computers and privatization for
the future of education, the talk came back again and again to the
subject of kids and technology. Will computers and the Web act as
substitutes for teachers, or will they aid students in learning
necessary skills for a quickly changing world?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, one panelist concluded, ``It's not a question of (if
technology is) good or bad,'' said Milton Glick, a provost at
Arizona State University. ``It just is.''
</P>
<P>
   Children, the panelists said, are becoming gatherers of
information, sometimes beating teachers to the punch and bringing
their own research and data to the classroom. And while the
Internet may not give them the humanistic skills they need _
communication with others and work ethics, for instance _
technology may help amplify the skills they will need for the jobs
they take on, many of which haven't been invented yet. In a world
where even the most trivial bit of data is available with a mouse
click, will kids need memorization skills?
</P>
<P>
   A surprising side-effect of the Internet's growth may be on
basic learning. Sue Cole, a computer class teacher at Mendez Middle
School and instructor at River City Youth Foundation's after-school
computer lab, said kids are suddenly becoming interested in good
spelling. ``One of the first things I saw was that the Internet
requires students to focus on their spelling. If you don't spell it
right, you don't get there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole has watched her students embrace the Net, and that has
changed their relationships with friends, parents and relatives.
``They're finding new ways to communicate with each other using the
written expression,'' she said. ``They're searching the Net and
looking for lost relatives and the origins of their names.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems, she finds, is the one that's been
around since the Web took off _ shielding kids from pornography and
hate sites. But almost as bad, she said, is that kids have to be
weaned from quick-developing addictions to the Internet. ``Once
they find out how exciting it is, that's all they want to do. We
have to remind students that they have a life outside the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing presence of computers and the Internet at
schools, traditional teaching may not harness the power of the new
technology, some say. Arthur VanderVeen, chief executive of
Austin-based ActiveInk Corp., believes children can learn best by
solving real-world problems and becoming active participants in
what they study.
</P>
<P>
   His company produces Internet educational software for
kindergarten through 12th grades. While the firm doesn't yet sell
its services to the Austin Independent School District, VanderVeer
said ActiveInk is working with 22 other school districts in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Using ActiveInk, students take on projects, working in teams and
using spreadsheets, databases and computer simulations to create
plans of action. If it sounds like the inner workings of a
high-tech firm, that's intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create an environment, replicating the
processes that come up in work environments,'' he said. ``We've
gone to the corporate environment to find out 'what are the skills
students need to succeed in the new economy?' Traditional education
is not preparing students for those skills.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wright, who with his wife, Aletha Houston, runs the
University of Texas Center for Research for the Influences of
Television on Children, has been turning his attention to
interactive entertainment. Teaching kids using models of real-world
events can help them engage in non-linear thinking, he said. And
computers are helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a wonderful educational thing,'' Wright said.
``It facilitates thinking in larger concepts and bigger language.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright is not so optimistic for kids who don't have
computers or Internet access. ``Can you take kids from an
environment where the parents didn't have any interactive
electronic experience and have them, in a single generation, join
the digital world? For children of color, the lag is getting worse,
but only because others are advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIDGING THE MATH GAP
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday morning, in a cheery house near the University of
Texas, a group of mothers and their daughters are looking at a
dismantled computer, learning the difference between RAM and a hard
drive after a snack of powdered donuts and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, they're putting together their own Web pages,
coding background colors and choosing clip art. It's part of a
program begun by Girlstart, a local non-profit group aimed at
helping another kind of digital divide _ the one that founder
Rachel Muir says is widening between girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
   Muir, a 26-year-old who began Girlstart as Smartgirls two years
ago, said research suggests girls often lose interest in technology
during middle school, veering off from possible careers in math and
computer sciences. That's why, she said, a major gender gap exists
in the mostly male high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls start off with a strong sense of entitlement, but we see
that diminish substantially between sixth and seventh grade,'' Muir
said. ``If a girl doesn't select a path in math or science in
middle school, she won't have the building blocks to pursue it in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   So, using weekend courses and summer camps, Girlstart has tried
to bridge that gap, a few students at a time. Kids by nature are
curious and want to take apart technology and learn how it works,
Muir said. ``We teach girls not to be afraid to take things apart
and break stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Like another Austin stalwart, software company Girl Games, Inc.,
the group is trying to educate girls and make technology more
accessible to them.
</P>
<P>
   The real-world implications are quickly apparent. The girls
learn desktop publishing and immediately see the results of their
work when their Web pages go live on the Internet or when they can
see a piece of video they've digitally edited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're teaching them to master their physical world,'' Muir
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Overton, a 9-year-old at the Saturday class, wanted to
publish a Web page after months of using the Web on her Dell home
computer and listening to Internet radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Shirley Overton, said she is constantly surprised by
the information absorbed by her daughters, including Sarah's older
sister, a Web designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime she needs to know anything, if I don't have an answer,
she goes to the Internet,'' Overton said. ``It's opened up the
whole world.''

 &HT;    Many browsing Web before heading to mall
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``No, thanks. Just looking.''
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you uttered or sneered or snapped that
phrase at some well-meaning salesperson at the mall determined to
separate you from your money? While you may make a purchase
eventually, first you have to decide which set of lawn furniture
will look best on your deck or if you really need a new teakettle
that whistles when the water's boiling.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about this: you want to buy a car but you have no idea if
the window sticker or the salesman are giving you the information
you need to make an informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and electronic commerce have turned on the lights
for uneducated consumers, giving us access to product information
we never had. Millions of wired users have gone online, many to
make purchases but many more just to look at manufacturers' Web
sites and product comparison sites like MySimon (www.mysimon.com)
or Bottom Dollar (www.bottomdollar.com) to research before they
buy.
</P>
<P>
   A new study from Internet research firm Jupiter Communications
suggests that e-commerce is not limited to online purchases, which
Jupiter estimates will hit about $200 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In its most interesting finding, the study also says consumers
will spend three times that amount offline in brick-and-mortar
retail outlets, catalogs or other traditional shopping outlets
armed with the research they have done on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggests that e-commerce isn't just about selling
merchandise online, it's about educating consumers. Jupiter says
there is no doubt the Web will generate millions in sales in the
years to come, but the actual transaction could come from any
established retail channel _ the Web, the mall or even the catalog
that just came in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta start-up company called Figleaves.com sells men's and
women's undergarments online but also plans to open a
brick-and-mortar store in New York later this year. The company
says users shouldn't be limited to having just one outlet to
purchase its products.
</P>
<P>
   Upscale retailer Neiman Marcus is working with another Atlanta
company to bring a multidimensional approach to the online shopping
experience. Users will be able to visit a virtual Manolo Blahnik
shoe salon and examine the pricey footwear from a variety of
angles. But it's the rare customer who will spend upwards of $500
for a product only seen online, although online ordering is
possible. Many shoe lovers will head directly to the nearest
Neiman's and request the shoes they admired on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter says the Web offers a world of opportunity to display
products and educate users, thus generating sales. Jupiter's study
says the Web actually exerts a tremendous influence over purchases
made in the real world as well as online.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Jupiter uses Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines as a
prime example of Web browsing. Users may visit the cruise line's
site to research a trip to Alaska and decide when they want to go
and what type of cabin they would like, based on factors such as
availability and price.
</P>
<P>
   While the user may not make an online reservation, Jupiter says
the customer has practically completed the ``buying cycle'' and
that the travel agent or telephone representative who does make the
reservation will complete the sale much more quickly as a result.
The actual purchase of items could be called ``the last mile'' of
electronic commerce. If all the work is done online, where the
actual dollars change hands isn't that important in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Browsers'' is the term Jupiter applies to consumers who do
extensive research on products and services online but have yet to
make an online purchase, and most browsers will spend money on the
items they are researching.
</P>
<P>
   I know several people who have spent weeks researching
everything from Saturn automobiles to Oriental rugs online. None of
them plan to make online purchases of those items, but they say the
knowledge they've gained from their research has been invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   One walked into the car dealership armed with the ``blue book''
price of her current car and the exact location and price of the
car she wanted. Another says she now knows what a good Oriental rug
should cost and how to distinguish quality. Another acquaintance
has been spending hours online researching the perfect home theater
system.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to making an actual purchase, all three say
they will go to a traditional real-world retailer.
</P>
<P>
   And Jupiter's study would agree with comic Jerry Seinfeld's
line: ``Not that there's anything wrong with that.''

Republican panel proposes to tinker with the present front-loaded
primary system, which nobody likes very much. But the proposed
alternative and other ideas such as a national primary have their
own problems. Maybe it is not necessary to change. By MARIANNE
MEANS

 &HT;    Plenty of sites profess to track your lucky stars
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of you almost certainly use the Web for scholarly
pursuits _ happily researching the gross national product for
Brazil, or finding a great vendor for epoxy cement, or perhaps
gauging the influence of epic poems on modern literature.
</P>
<P>
   But some people use the Web to check their horoscopes. If you
think that's in the stars for you, then today you'll find enough
sites to preserve your peace of mind. The notion is this: If you
don't like the horoscope you find on one site, simply continue down
the list until you find a prediction that suits you.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best horoscope sites on the Web _ there seems little
argument to the contrary _ is the product of an astrologer called
Jonathan Cainer who writes for a London newspaper. His Web site at
www.bubble.com/webstars/ is often a bit slow because of that
popularity. That's why you might want to note a ``mirror site''
that offers the same Web pages at www.cainer.com/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the expected daily and weekly horoscopes here, as
well as predictions for the year; general information about each
astrological sign; a way to check for astrological compatibility
with other signs; and RealAudio files that deliver a longer audio
version of your horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the content on this page _ including everything listed
above _ is free, but Cainer does sell some astrological reports.
The commercial content here isn't blatant and, if you just come to
check your horoscope, you'll never notice it (which probably would
dismay Cainer).
</P>
<P>
   AstroNet, at www.astronet.com/, is one of the slickest horoscope
sites on the Web. Again, you'll find free daily and weekly
horoscopes and other standard features. And that's probably what
most people are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who are truly interested in astrology, this site
has articles that discuss various trends in depth. You'll find
links to these articles on the opening page.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good Australian site for astrology called Blackstump
Horoscope Leader at www.blackstump.com.au/horo.htm. It's a fun stop
since, once you've checked out your stars, you can also find the
latest scores for Australian Rules Football or just browse the
headlines from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The actual horoscope information is a collection of links to
other sites, including Cainer's. But there are some unusual links
here, including one to a Chinese astrology site.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, of course, follow their horoscopes using the daily
newspaper. And Sydney Omarr is a popular columnist in many papers.
If you're away from the newspaper but still want to see that
horoscope, you can find Omarr's predictions at
washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/ style/columns/horoscope.htm.
</P>
<P>
   As at many of the sites, you'll also be able to check out your
compatibility _ at least where astrology is concerned _ with a
potential mate. And you'll get advice on choosing a real-world
astrologer as well as health tips based on your sign.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Fox, another well-known astrologer, runs a site called
Astrology.com, which is located, logically enough, at
www.astrology.com. You'll find fairly detailed astrological
forecasts here and _ just as is true with Cainer's site _ also find
a commercial section where you can buy full-blown charts.

 &HT;    Fax machine saves its owners money
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A new fax machine from Sharp Document and Network
Systems of America can cut the cost of running a home business by
finding the cheapest available phone company to handle any fax or
telephone call to another state.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L is one of the first fax machines on the market to
utilize low-cost routing technology, according to a press release
from the office product division of Sharp Electronics Corp. The
product is made possible by a collaboration between Sharp and
openLCR.com, a Web-based telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy the UX-345L, you link the machine to the
openLCR.com Web site to prepare it to work. From the site, the fax
machine downloads a listing of all pricing information for the
available long-distance companies to a chip in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   When the user dials an area code and the first three digits of
the number being called, the UX-345L checks its list and picks the
company with the lowest rate for that day of the week and time of
day.
</P>
<P>
   Users don't have to remember access codes for different
long-distance services or sign up with new long-distance carriers.
They also retain their current telephone billing system; the calls
directed by the UX-345L will be itemized on the customers' regular
phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The machine links to the openLCR.com Web site once a month to
get the latest rate information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the low-cost routing feature, the UX-345L has all
the bells and whistles found on other moderately priced plain-paper
fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   It has a 60-sheet paper cassette and about 28 pages of built-in
memory that can store incoming faxes when the paper cassette is
empty.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L has distinctive ring detection that allows up to
four telephone numbers to ring on one telephone line, a caller ID
that displays the name and number of the caller, anti-junk fax
settings to block unwanted transmissions and a copier function.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a 10-page document feeder and an automatic cover
sheet writer, and it transmits an average page in about 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The UX-345L sells for $129.99 at www.sharpoffice.com, and it's
available where office supplies are sold. For additional
information, call Sharp at (800) 237-4277 (BE-SHARP) or log on to
the www.sharpoffice.com site.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on the low-cost routing service,
visit www.openLCR.com.

 &HT;    Cell phones expand users opportunities
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember that famous line from the old ``Saturday
Night Live'' skit: It's a floor wax and a dessert topping. Only in
this case it's a telephone and a Web browser all rolled up in the
same neat package.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a wireless Web cellular phone, you can order a
book, check sports scores or get the latest news from CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and if you want to make a phone call, you can do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The newest generation of cellular phones has matchbook-sized
screens and built-in Internet browsers that let users access
everything from CNN to Yahoo to Amazon.com. Industry analysts
expect that most cellular phones will be Web-ready by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Users of wireless Web cell phone service can check e-mail, make
travel arrangements, get the latest stock quotes and even make a
phone call. Unlike personal digital assistants, interactive pagers
or other wireless devices, the wireless Web phone lets you do all
that without having a plethora of interactive devices strapped to
your belt or tucked into your purse.
</P>
<P>
   A Web phone is a handy thing to have. While sitting at an
airport, for example, you can log on to the Delta Air Lines Web
site, enter your flight number, discover that your plane has been
delayed by 45 minutes and either book another flight or just sit
back and have another cup of coffee in the lounge. While you're at
it, you can call your family and friends and tell them not to rush
to the airport to pick you up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as you wait patiently for your plane, you can do
everything from buy books at Amazon.com to check your e-mail.
Americans are now finding out what the folks in Scandinavia have
known for quite some time. Being able to go online from your phone,
your pager or any other hand-held device is pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can use your Web phone to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Deanna Sanford said one of her colleagues went
shopping with a list his wife e-mailed to his Hotmail account. He
was able to wander the supermarket aisles while consulting the
e-mail message he retrieved on his cell phone to tell him which
groceries to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless technologies are the next Internet,'' said Debora
Wilson, president and chief executive of Weather.com, the online
offering by the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the same feeling about wireless that I had five years
ago about the Internet. The ability to receive information on
devices you carry around with you all day is the next wave of
things. It's like history repeating itself,'' she said. ``A year
ago, everyone wondered what would happen with wireless. It's been
so slow, because the Internet is such a force, but it's the next
wave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much potential (with wireless Web phones), but most
customers really haven't gotten into using their phones for data
yet,'' said EarthLink's vice president of product management, Tom
Andrus. He said educating consumers is the next step in the
development of the wireless Web phones and other wireless products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to education, there are other problems with this
early generation of Web phones. Even though there are people
happily devoted to Web phones, there are others who gripe that the
two- to five-line text-only messages most Web phones can handle are
hard to read and often useless.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the problem, many popular Web sites are not yet
optimized for Web phone users. For example, if you type in the Web
address for Salon using a Web phone, you will receive an error
message telling you the site isn't yet phone-ready. Similarly, if
you want to send e-mail, you'll have to do it over the Web-based
application that comes with your phone, typically Yahoo Mail or
Microsoft's Hotmail.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem are the extra buttons, toggle switches
and other gizmos added to cellular phones to give them Web
capability. The wireless Web is a handy add-on to a cellular phone,
but already there are plenty of users who can't figure out how to
make a local phone call, never mind surf the Web with their phones.
</P>
<P>
   Xcelerate, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company, operates a
``usability center'' in Atlanta where groups of experienced and
novice users are brought in to test the newest cellular
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Fawad Ahmad, managing director for wireless services at the
center, said the usability lab tries to find out how easy or
complicated it is for users to actually use the Web via the cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, we ask them to perform eight to 15 different
tests,'' he said. ``Let's say we are doing a test for Amazon.com.
We'll ask users to buy a book, and we'll tell them the title of the
book they're going to buy,'' he said. ``Then we see which phone
it's easiest to do it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said Xcelerate watches every move the testers make and
examines virtually every button on every phone. ``We observe their
body language, and we look at the screens on the phones and how
friendly they are to a Web-based application. It's pretty extensive
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad said Web phone users must be comfortable using the Web via
a wireless device, and that it can take some time. He recommends
newer phones, which have larger screens than some of the earliest
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some newer phones have a separate keypad or three to four
buttons to use (to access the Web) and are much more
user-friendly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad believes the biggest problem now is that the tiny
telephone screen isn't big enough for most people who are used to a
17-inch color monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key assumption,'' Ahmad said, ``is that screen is not wide
enough or not long enough and you can't do Web browsing on a
two-line display. That drives people crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   While new cell phone technology is making it easier for users to
navigate their way around the Web, Internet companies developing
services for the wireless Web should keep several things in mind,
according to Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to be a leader in the wireless space, you
have to be innovative,'' he said. ``Your top three lines are your
best real estate. Put the stuff you know users want at the top so
people can read it without scrolling. You won't have as much
information as you have on the Web site, but people just want to
get to your site to use it. Don't give them ads, because then they
won't be able to do the actual task. ``
</P>
<P>
   One of the most active companies in the wireless area today is
Microsoft. It rolled out MSN Mobile 2.0 service in March as part of
its ``Everyday Web'' strategy. The thinking is that users of the
Microsoft Network and its family of Web sites aren't chained to
their PCs all day and will look to other devices for Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The MSN Mobile service allows users to access most of the MSN
Web sites including Hotmail, MoneyCentral, Expedia travel
information and even horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Sanford said MSN's mobile initiatives, including the
MSN Mobile 2.0 cell phone product, are part of the company's
Internet strategy to provide users a satisfying MSN experience on a
variety of devices. She said it's a strategy that's been in the
works for a long time. ``This isn't something you can do
overnight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's investment with wireless phone provider Nextel in
February 1999 got the MSN team thinking about the best way to
deliver MSN content to cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real challenge,'' Sanford said. ``There is limited
screen space, and people use their phones differently from how they
use the PC-based Web. People don't want to just surf. They want a
more focused experience. We approach it from making things really
timely and really relevant to make things right for the right
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things MSN did when developing products for
wireless devices was to make sure users could keep the passwords
they already use on the Web. Sanford said the key to a positive
wireless Web phone experience is to develop products that are
relevant for the phone, such as travel, maps and e-mail, some of
the most popular wireless Web services.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said getting Web-based information to customers quickly
is one of the biggest challenges so far. She said Microsoft uses
XML technology to strip the data from the Web pages and put it into
a format that mobile phone users can access quickly and easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the data network on the phone is slow,''
she said. ``But a lot of the lag time depends on how fast the site
can deliver information across the wireless network. You have to
employ the same kind of technology that Web sites already use to
optimize their pages so they'll load faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the Internet companies, Microsoft is trying to
develop applications for the Web phones that make sense for users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about a lot of things when we think about the
future of MSN Mobile,'' Sanford said. And she echoes the rest of
the industry that's still trying to tame a new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all so new,'' she said. ``We're all trying to figure out
what people want when they choose to stay connected with these
devices. We still don't know what people really want because the
phones are just coming out. We are trying to get at what people
would want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around for a year, so we have a slight advantage.
We know the Web phone should be able to give people things they can
use when they are out and about. We want to give them the ability
to get things done on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink Vice President Erika Jolly, who heads up EarthLink's
wireless Web phone efforts, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to think differently, because it's a totally
different environment. People are used to pictures and colors, so
we have to work to develop something that's still visually
appealing to the customer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not want a stock chart, but you may want to see the
stock price for that day. You may not want to see all your e-mail,
but maybe you'll want to flag e-mail from your boss or some of your
friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly said wireless Web users want information that's useful and
accessible, but that there's still a long way to go in terms of
development and ease of use. ``It's like the 9,600-baud modems when
they first came out,'' she said. ``Everyone thought they were lame.
There are some limitations on the phones right now, but we have to
be patient.''

 &HT;    Flash back to the '60s with Beetle Buggin
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Offering instant gratification appeal with its ease of play,
decent price point and rock solid arcade racing action, Beetle
Buggin ($20; www.infogrames. com; for the PC) is a hit. Add to that
a variety of fantastically fun play modes and the fact that you
really can't go wrong with those cuddly/funky cool Volkswagen
go-buggies, and you've got a must-have title. Targeted at the
``casual gamer,'' Beetle Buggin is all about fun in a '60s laden,
dope-smokin', love child world and less about complicated submenus,
upgrades and reward systems of driving ``simulations.'' Just hip,
groovy, romping and racing, baby. Lots of it. Go nuts.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Extending an elemental law of physics to include ``what goes up
must pull off a Varial before it comes down,'' Tony Hawk's Pro
Skater ($50; www.activision.com; for the Nintendo 64) brings all
the superlative joyousness from the outstanding Playstation game to
the N64. Essentially a direct port, world skate champ Tony Hawk and
nine of his cronies do the virtual vert and street skate thing with
unsurpassed fluidity and style. Faithful to its Playstation
counterpart, Tony 64 includes the same nine fully interactive
sprawling 3-D levels and a challenging reward system promising
long-term gameplay, especially in Career Mode. Control
configuration is deceptively sparse with an exponentially varied
number of moves and combos making for a long, steep learning curve.
It's novice friendly, nonetheless, as each rider comes complete
with the essential balance and trick skills of the real pros. The
gamer must learn to utilize said skills to their fullest in order
to earn points and capture pick-ups. Sadly softened, this N64
version has neither the thud-piddle-piddle skull smacks nor the
smatter of blood accompanied by a virtual crash and bail _and the
soundtrack is incomplete, stymied by the cartridge's limitation to
looped musical samples. But if you're really into excellent extreme
sports games such as this, you probably own a Playstation anywy.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its hardware power, one of the best games currently
available for the Sega Dreamcast is a simple 2-D game that is as
addictive as ``Tetris.'' Chu Chu Rocket ($30, www.sega.com) is a
fast and frenetic party game in which you try to corral many
wandering mice into your home base rocket by placing arrows on a
simple grid while marauding cats try to attack . It sounds simple,
but in multi-player mode, you're fighting for real estate and mice
against up to three other players. When the game is in full swing,
you'll be cursing those orange cats and your devious fellow
players. Chu Chu is also the first game you can play over Sega's
network. Simple and fun, it's the year's best console party game.

 &HT;    That purring sound is coming from your PC
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Keep your home computer spiffed up and running
on all cylinders with Iolo Technologies' System Mechanic 3.2
(Shareware/30 days free, $20-$60; www.iolo.com, for Windows PCs). A
cadre of 12 powerful tools, this utility will optimize your PC's
Internet and network speed and security settings, remove invalid,
orphaned, obsolete and nonsense files, then find and fix broken
shortcuts. Also included is an easy-to-understand start-up manager,
a safe installation feature that tells you exactly what's been
altered after new programs are added, and even an incinerator as a
companion to the recycle bin for total obliteration of sensitive
files. System Mechanic did somehow allow this particular
click-happy user to lose track of his word processor, but for the
most part the cleaning machine is idiot friendly if not idiot
proof. The free and fully functioning 30-day-demo enticement is the
real kicker here. Try it out. As those holistic folks like to say,
there's nothing like a good purge to keep you spiffed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   The classic, all consuming, highly addictive Tetris has been
reworked and specifically revamped for preschoolers as Kids Tetris
($30; www. hasbro-interactive. com; for the PC). Still utilizing
the familiar falling multi-gonal block shapes, Kids Tetris has
those traditional, ``elaborate'' puzzle pieces pre-fastened to form
more rudimentary block shapes that fall at a leisurely pace. More
importantly, the blocks are animated with happy cartoon faces that
actually talk to the player, giving hints, suggestions and joyful
words of encouragement. Fun, funny and rewarding gameplay, while
still offering elemental lessons in problem solving and motor
skills.

 &HT;    Anyone can play guitar

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Look, you're never going be a true Austinite until you've
learned a few chords and opened for Jerry Jeff Walker. But, what's
that? You don't know how to play guitar? Before you sign up for
lessons, check out eMedia Guitar Method CD-ROM ($60 for Windows and
Macintosh, www.emedia.org). The CD-ROM teaches you guitar basics
with features like an animated fretboard, fretronome, a ``virtual''
guitar neck that illustrates where to put your fingers and a
selection of classic songs to practice, such as ``La Bamba'' and
``House of the Rising Sun.'' Other volumes of the software include
a roster of new songs and help from guitar whiz Peter Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN KICK IT, THIS WILL RECORD IT
</P>
<P>
   OK, you've learned how to play the guitar and you've put
together a band. The problem is that the major record labels aren't
calling. What do you do? You make your own garage-band-grunge CD.
Helping you in this is Sony's new ECM-MS907 one-point stereo
microphone ($100, www.sony.com). The microphone fits all Sony
minidisc and DAT players and offers superior sound recording in the
right situations, such as recording instruments. However, it didn't
work well in picking up vocals. It also boasts 90- and 120-degree
recording so you can bring the whole orchestra. A piece of advice:
Invite the whole band, can the droning lyrics and get right to the
guitar solo.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK GOOD WHILE YOU LISTEN
</P>
<P>
   You want to look good while listening to your tunes. That's why
you need to pick up Sony's Street Style Discman ($160,
www.sony.com). The industrial-looking Discman is a must-have for
the trendy, on-the-go set. The device is finished in chrome and red
translucent plastic and has a carrying strap, making it the
ultimate accoutrement to a rollerblading escapade. The Street Style
Discman also comes with Street Style headphones, which wrap around
the back of the head and provide awesome sound. If you think this
portable CD player just looks good, think again. This Discman is
equipped with Sony's patented ESP2, which is some of the best skip
protection on the market. With ESP2 and the Street Style Discman,
you'll never miss a beat _ and look good in the process.

 &HT;    Quick View offers virus protection
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   When the Love Bug dominated the news, there was an article in
the paper suggesting protections. Something called Quick View was
mentioned, which allows you to view e-mail without launching a worm
or virus. What is Quickview?
</P>
<P>
   _ Stephen Wiesner, Parma, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Quick View Plus is a robust file-viewing utility for the
PC, with a neat little twist. It gained popularity as a shield
against viruses during the outbreak of Melissa in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Besides saving the frustration and time spent converting
files or fretting over files you can't open at all, Quick View Plus
is a great safety net against those nasty little intruders. By
using the utility to view file attachments, you can access contents
of a file without triggering a virus that might be lurking.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It packs a lot of muscle for $59, considering you can view
files downloaded from the Web and e-mail attachments, including
photos and graphics, in a heartbeat. Text, spreadsheets, database
files, presentations, compressed files, HTML. You name it. The
utility supports more than 200 file formats.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Mac and PC file-type incompatibilities don't get in its
way either. Plus, you don't spend big bucks on multiple software
packages. Surf to jasc.com and click the Products link.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking for a Web site that gives the names and addresses of
people living on the same street. I know the site exists because
I've been there before, but I don't remember how I got there. Can
you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ John Koval, Lorain, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Try out AT&AMP;T AnyWho Info at anywho.com or InfoSpace at
infospace.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: What a great way to get to know your neighbors and
organize a block party. Both sites were easy to use, but navigation
came easier with AnyWho. You can type the info on the first page
and get a pretty good listing. According to Alice, none of these
sites has comprehensive lists. Getting accurate lists depends on
where the site is getting its info and how often it's updated.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: InfoSpace requires a couple of extra clicks. Once you
navigate to InfoSpace, click on the White Pages link. At the bottom
of the page, click on Reverse Lookup for Address. Type in the
street name, city and state and get a listing.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Of course, if someone's personal information is unlisted,
you won't find them anywhere. Also, if you are attempting an e-mail
search for someone who is using AOL, they will not be listed
either.

 &HT;    Combatting viruses a never-ending task
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are times, like a couple of weeks ago, when it's
nice not to be on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to the weekend when most of the computerized world was
struggling with the I Love You virus. Yours truly was also
struggling, of course, but with an older and evidently lesser
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody sent me the I Love You virus. There would have been no
point in it. The memsahib and I have been married 43 years now, and
we don't exchange e-mails with I Love You in the header. Call us
unromantic if you will, but e-mail seems to lack something in terms
of intimacy. I can still recall those lightly perfumed letters I
got from her during our courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, if I should see ``I Love You'' amongst my messages,
at home or at work, I would assume it to be from a child seeking
money or an ad for a porno site. While it has been one of my
lifelong ambitions to be a sex object, only dogs and an amorous
goat in North Georgia have shown any inclination to follow me
around.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, I'm also leery of opening attachments
unless I know who they're from. Eudora Pro automatically saves
every attachment I get at home, so every so often I go through and
dump them all. Unfortunately, since I subscribe to several busy
mailing lists, there are a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the I Love You virus reminded me that it's been
awhile since I updated my Norton Anti-Virus protection. Upon doing
that, the system informed my that FNEBJ.EXE, in the Windows/System
directory, was infected with a virus called Back Door SubSeven22.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how long this little fellow has been lurking in my
computer, but he didn't seem to cause any trouble until he was
found. After many system lockups and reboots, Norton agreed to try
to repair the file but could not, suggesting quarantine instead.
</P>
<P>
   The program reports that Back Door SubSeven22 is a rare virus, a
``Trojan horse that creates a security hole into your system.'' Now
that the file is in quarantine, Windows squawks about it every time
the system is booted. Removal from WIN.INI helped, but Windows
still complains.
</P>
<P>
   Try as I might, I couldn't find FNEBJ.EXE anywhere on the
Windows 98 install disk, so one assumes it is created upon
installation. Whatever the case, Windows seems to run all right
without it.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after updating the virus information, Back Door
SubSeven22 showed up again, but this time Norton grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   The moral? Update your virus definitions regularly.

 &HT;    Atlanta to get preview of PlayStation 2
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Millions of video game gearheads are twiddling
their thumbs until October waiting for Sony's PlayStation 2. But
Atlanta gamers will get a hands-on test drive by early summer.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a $10 million promotional blitz for the sleek device
_ which has an upgraded video processor, DVD drive and expansion
slots for a broadband modem and hard drive _ Sony will bring the
game to Atlanta for Major League Baseball's Fan Fest 2000, July
7-11.
</P>
<P>
   Those who get a sneak peek of PS2 may be disappointed at first.
It's not much to look at. With a minimalist vertical design, it
looks like a nondescript black book sitting upright on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the new game platform has already become a media darling and
emerged as the Holy Grail for consumer electronic enthusiasts known
as ``early adopters'' who are already lining up to buy it. PS2 will
retail for about $300.
</P>
<P>
   The console has already been released in Japan, where it sold a
million units in the first week. It was also among the hottest new
products unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo held here
recently.
</P>
<P>
   PS2 promises to merge the features of a game console, a DVD
player and a desktop computer. But the computer features _ an
optional add-on broadband modem and hard drive _ won't be available
in October. Sony says peripherals will be available by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drive will allow gamers to more easily play software
that requires more than one disc. The modem will permit players to
compete over the Net _ and maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't outlined all the uses yet,'' said Ryan Bowling, a
spokesman for Sony. ``A lot of what we're going to do is still in
the works.''
</P>
<P>
   There are doubts the PS2 can live up to pre-release hype. Rick
Mears, an editor for a magazine called Gamefan, said he was
disappointed after paying $700 _ his own funds, not the magazine's
_ to get an early Japanese version.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling everybody it's this super gaming platform, but
it's not,'' Mears said. ``They'll probably sell a million of them,
but I already sold mine to someone else. It's not even better than
Sega Dreamcast, and that's been out for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mears added that while Sony is using PS2's expandability as a
major selling point, consumers may not be willing to wait or pay
extra money to use the additional features.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that Sony releases the (crummy) stuff
in Japan, but by the time it gets to America they will have fixed
all the bugs and flaws,'' Burney said. ``In the next year, it will
blow all the other game platforms away.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Sony PlayStation, which only played video games,
ranks as one of the biggest success stories in the $6.1 billion
video game industry. Since it was introduced in 1994, more than 26
million PlayStation units have been sold in North America. The new
unit will be able to play games designed for the older console.
</P>
<P>
   In a breathless, two-hour news conference in Los Angeles,
executives from Sony Computer Entertainment America announced their
plans for launching PS2 in North America in late October.
</P>
<P>
   ``PlayStation 2 is not the future of video game entertainment,''
said Kazuo Hirai, president and chief operating officer of the
company. ``It's the future of entertainment. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hirai may not have the last word. Industry rival Nintendo is
also developing a new entertainment console called Dolphin. And by
next year Microsoft is expected to release its X-box, yet another
high-powered gaming device with Internet capability.

 &HT;    This week, TV says goodbye to a towering talent
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We shouldn't get all misty and maudlin. He is,
after all, just a funny guy on a medium-rated TV show. And he's
stepping down, not crawling off to die.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I'm compelled to pause and pay tribute to Michael
J. Fox, who takes his final bow on ``Spin City'' this week. As the
world surely knows by now, Fox is battling Parkinson's disease and
has decided the weekly grind of a TV series is not the best use of
his depleted energy. He wants to spend more time with his family
and speak out about his disease. He may also do some acting or
directing from time to time, but that's uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong ``Spin City'' finale Wednesday is not Fox's best
work. The episode moves too slowly and lingers too long with too
many goodbyes and not enough of the guffaw-producing scenes that
have been this gifted funnyman's trademark. It was a nice touch
having Michael Gross, who played Fox's father on ``Family Ties,''
pop in as the deputy mayor's shrink. But the story line that has
Mike resigning after taking the fall for a mob scandal involving
the mayor is lame.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? Not even a lackluster farewell can tarnish Fox's
distinguished comedic career. He's proof-positive that Randy
Newman's claim that ``short people got no reason to live'' is
stupid. It's a testimony to the gigantic appeal of tiny Fox (5 feet
4 inches officially, but that may be stretching it) that movies
like ``Doc Hollywood'' and ``Life with Mikey'' didn't blot out the
good films like ``Back to the Future'' and ``Teen Wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   He made only two TV series _ ``Family Ties'' and ``Spin City'' _
but Fox left his mark on both as a quick wit and fearless
pratfaller. He couId romp through complicated dialogue at a
breakneck pace, whether espousing Reaganomics as the button-down
Alex P. Keaton or spewing liberal New York politics as spinmeister
Michael Flaherty. In the grown-up role of Flaherty, Fox relished
zinging sexual banter and double entendres. That innocent face made
them seem even funnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the aforementioned constituent could be polled over
lunch,'' said Nikki, Mike's love interest last season, in a scene
that fairly dripped with lust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds great,'' Mike replied, licking his lips. ``I'm gonna
get on the horn and make the arrangements. You prepare the, uh,
spreadsheets.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyishly handsome at 38, Fox has always used his looks and
diminutive size to his advantage. He was happy to let Tracy Pollan
(now his wife) tower over him when she played his girlfriend on
``Family Ties'' and has been known to jump into the arms of the
mayor, played by 6-feet, 6-inch tall Barry Bostwick, on ``Spin
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's fearless instinct for slapstick is legendary. Long after
he was diagnosed with Parkinson's, he joyfully jumped into the
Hudson River for a scene with Bostwick, and zoomed around the
office on in-line skates. Even in this week's swan song, he bounds
around in boxer shorts, panting after Heather Locklear like a rabid
puppy.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian-born hockey fanatic, Fox came to Hollywood at 18 and
landed ``Family Ties'' (1982-89) at 20. The sitcom was conceived by
Gary David Goldberg as a generational clash between hippie parents,
played by Meredith Baxter and Gross, and their Reaganite son Alex,
who had a poster of William F. Buckley over his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was such a hit in the role that the focus shifted to him by
the end of the first season. He became a brand-new golden boy,
respected in Hollywood and beloved everywhere else. When movie
offers started pouring in, Fox could have weaseled out of his
seven-year contract, but he told Goldberg and the cast he had no
intention of leaving. He stayed on and made a graceful exit with
his colleagues at the show's end.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is Fox is loved as much for his core values as for his
talent. He is a devoted husband and father who has faced illness
with courage, humor and determination. OK, he's not perfect. He
still smokes like a chimney, but that's about the only dirt anyone
can dig up on him. To avoid years of pity, he chose not to reveal
his illness until last year, although he was diagnosed more than
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After going public, Fox testified before Congress on the need
for increased funding for Parkinson's research, and he intends to
become an activist after his TV retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do firmly believe that there will be a cure by the time I am
50,'' he told Diane Sawyers in an interview last week on ``20/20.''
``If I'm not cured, it's a personal disappointment, but you really
get past the personal agenda when you make this step (becoming a
spokesman).''
</P>
<P>
   Although he may no longer be at the top of his acting game, he's
still got game, as viewers know from this season's fast-paced
episodes. It came as a surprise when he told the cast, crew and ABC
that this would be his last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much what I couldn't do on the show,'' Fox told
Sawyer. ``It's what I couldn't do outside of it, because I was
tired. I loved it very much, but it was just too much energy to
spend in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   In a stunningly bad move, ABC has decided to continue ``Spin
City'' next year with Charlie Sheen as the new deputy mayor. Sheen
is clean and sober these days but doesn't have a track record in
smart comedy. (``Hot Shots'' and ``Major League'' don't count.)
Besides, he's got enormous (about a size 7, actually) shoes to
fill. Since Fox is probably irreplaceable, ABC should let the show
bow out along with its star.

 &HT;    Trendies ruin Hawaiian-shirt mystique
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I am no slave to fashion. I am not even
its lawn-guy. Yet every spring, clothing catalogs sprout in my
mailbox. They are sent to me by sophisticated retailers.
Sophisticated retailers who have used sophisticated marketing
techniques and sophisticated database creation to determine that I
am the sort of person who is now fretting over his summer wardrobe.
It cracks me up every time. Lately, though, some of the catalogue
photos have alarmed me.
</P>
<P>
   For eons, my off-duty summer wardrobe has consisted largely of
clunky sandals of the kind that scuff the floors in health-food
stores, jeans that still have another year in them if I watch the
beer, and ugly Hawaiian shirts. A timeless leisurewear ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tourist-town look exempt from the vagaries and
stresses of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But now I open these catalogues, and what do I see? Broad-
shouldered men with jaws like Dick Tracy wearing _ it pains me to
say this _ ugly Hawaiian shirts.
</P>
<P>
   These are tasteful catalogues geared to people who have real
jobs. They show men with their willowy cotton-clad, blunt-cut
blonde counterparts on rocky New England shorelines and in the
shade of graceful summer home verandahs. These are not the people
for whom ugly Hawaiian shirts were intended.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, fashion has a nasty way of overtaking the
fashion-resistant. These catalogue people are trying to pretend
they are one of us. And I don't like it one little bit.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few guidelines for separating the faux
Hawaiian-shirt wearer from people who live the way people in ugly
Hawaiian shirts are supposed to:
</P>
<P>
   _ An ugly Hawaiian shirt should not cost more than $20. A $50
shirt is, by definition, formal wear. You wouldn't use the
shirttail of a $50 shirt to wipe melted ice cream off a car seat,
so why wear it on a Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   _ An ugly Hawaiian shirt is not forever. It is rayon or thin
cotton. An object that lasts no longer than a summer romance.
That's part of its mystique. (And a reason for the $20 rule.)
</P>
<P>
   _ An ugly Hawaiian shirt cannot be ironed except when worn as
evening wear.
</P>
<P>
   _ An ugly Hawaiian shirt must be busy enough that the casual
observer would assume any stain to be part of the shirt's design.
</P>
<P>
   _ An ugly Hawaiian shirt should be in a pattern you cannot
imagine on any other manner of textile or life-form.
</P>
<P>
   _ But an ugly Hawaiian shirt does not cross the line into self-
parody. A shirt that mocks the venerable conventions of Hawaiian
shirt design marks the wearer as a poser, a tourist, a mere
wannabe. Someone trying to look retro-cool.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the creeping trendiness of ugly Hawaiian shirts, I've
tried buying progressively cheaper and uglier Hawaiian shirts. I
thought I could combat this fashion shift by example. No luck. It's
a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   More's the pity.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who advocate buying less to live better _
``voluntary simplicity'' as the magazines call it _ seem to
describe a dreary monochrome T-shirt-and-bandanna existence. A
cheap Hawaiian shirt, however, is an attractive alternative.
Voluntary simplicity with cheap panache.
</P>
<P>
   This is not mere cheapness. It is a life-choice.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Stein, when showing off her impressive art collection
to a young Earnest Hemingway told him: ``You can either buy clothes
or buy pictures. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   She dressed in ``strange steerage clothes'' Hemingway said, and
she owned the great names in big frames.
</P>
<P>
   From the photographs I've seen, the writer took her advice on
clothing, but didn't get around to the paintings. He collected ex-
wives, instead.
</P>
<P>
   I don't own Picassos. But I also suspect you can either buy
clothes or buy computers and books. It works the same way.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, I like to imagine my weekend wear suggests a
wearer who possess A Rich Inner Life.
</P>
<P>
   Or it did until it started turning up in all the catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   What will Tracy-jawed models spoil next? Please not the bowling
shirts and guayaberas.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but them.

 &HT;    2 charged in '63 bombing
 &HT;    By By Staff Reports

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two former Ku Klux Klansmen were jailed last week over
the bombing of a Birmingham church 37 years ago. The dynamite blast
on Sept. 15, 1963, killed four black girls.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry were charged with
first-degree murder by an Alabama grand jury. Through lawyers, the
men said they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has been opened and closed several times since
the bombing. One suspect was convicted of murder in the 1970s, and
another suspect has died.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Langford, former FBI special agent in charge of the
Birmingham bureau, said agents were able to gather new information
on the crime recently. ``There were witnesses who would talk now
who wouldn't talk back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Blanton and Cherry, who are in their 60s, could
face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS TO RATE PARENTS
</P>
<P>
   Are your parents helping you become a good student?
</P>
<P>
   Parents in Chicago will be graded next year on whether they're
assisting their kids enough with homework, getting them to school
on time and making sure they are rested for the day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The parents won't receive a letter grade from teachers. Instead,
every five weeks they'll receive a checklist. Parents with low
marks could be referred to a parent training academy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say schools should be focusing on the performance of
teachers _ not parents. Requests for information such as a child's
bedtime are seen as an invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMALS' HOMES EXPAND
</P>
<P>
   Three African governments plan to team up to create the largest
wildlife park in the world. South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe
are to sign a formal agreement next month.
</P>
<P>
   The park will link South Africa's Kruger National Park with the
Gaza province in Mozambique and Gonarezhou National Park in
Zimbabwe. Animals and visitors will be allowed to roam free in the
7.5 million-acre area.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller African park opened last week in South Africa and
Botswana.

 &HT;    `Jet Grind Radio' among console games that will be hot this year
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the Sega booth during the E3Expo in Los Angeles
recently, the line to play ``Jet Grind Radio'' was so long company
officials sometimes had to ask enthusiasts to stop so others could
play the new video game.
</P>
<P>
   The highly anticipated game is for the Sega Dreamcast and will
be released this fall. Here are 10 of the top non-sports games on
all the consoles _ PlayStation 2, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and
Dreamcast _ that will go on sale before the holiday season:
</P>
<P>
   ``Conker's Bad Fur Day'' (N64): This was the biggest surprise
for Nintendo at the convention. Story line: Conker the squirrel had
a bad night and, equipped with only a frying pan and hangover, is
about to experience the worst day of his life. The cute little
animal shows his dark side by doing his best to ruin the daily
activities of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Cloud'' (PS2): Many journalists studied this game at the
E3Expo to fully comprehend the graphic capabilities of Sony's new
system. In this role-playing game, young hero Toran finds that an
evil spirit has wreaked destruction on all living things. The
beauty and detail of the landscapes are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead or Alive 2'' (DC, PS2): Even though the game has been out
for a month on Sega, it has been almost impossible to find a copy
in stores. The Tecmo-produced fighting game has been No. 1 in
Dreamcast sales for the past three weeks. The reason? Graphically
rich fighting locations, ranging from a lush opera house to a
moving elevator cage and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvel vs. Capcom 2'' (DC): Capcom Entertainment is releasing
its No. 1 arcade hit to the console market. The game features a
record number of playable characters (more than 50) for pure action
fighting, including special three-on-three battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gorkamorka'' (DC): Ripcord Games recently formed a partnership
with Sega and unveiled four upcoming games for the system,
including this one. The game is a rarity, as it combines
combat-style action with racing. It's best in the two-player mode,
where one can race the vehicle while the partner focuses on blowing
up the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jet Grind Radio'' (DC): Based on its popularity at the E3Expo,
this might be Sega's best-selling game of the fall. The plot is
simple: The city government has set forth a plan to keep kids from
expressing themselves in any way, shape or form. The kids rally
behind special skating shoes and spray paint to design their own
graffiti art. The colorful graphics are amazing, with characters in
full 3-D and everything else in 2-D.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Dark'' (N64): It's tough to follow the classic
``Golden Eye 007,'' but Rare far exceeded expectations with this
sequel. James Bond is no longer the central character, but rather
Joanna Perfect Dark _ who was the perfect student at spy school and
now has to face real-life espionage. The most fun part of game is
the four-player matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``SimTheme Park'' (PS2): Using the power of Sony's new system,
Electronic Arts takes this game great strides past the PlayStation
version. Players can wander through theme parks they create and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spyro: Year of the Dragon'' (PS): Spyro and Sparx are back in
a new adventure, faced with the challenge of defeating an evil
sorceress who has kidnapped all the dragon eggs. Skills required
include boxing, skateboarding, sharpshooting and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' (PS): Everyone's favorite
television game show set records for sales on the PC, and host
Regis Philbin was at the E3Expo to personally introduce the console
version.

 &HT;    What people do all day
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's sunny and 60-degrees outside. Not a
cloud in sight. Trees and grass are storybook green from all the
rain we've had this week. There's still a puddle beside the curb
across the street, and no matter how many times Kevin and his
village helpers clean it out, it grows to small-lake proportion
after a rain, tempting youngsters and, on occasion a grownup or
two, in for a wade.
</P>
<P>
   Birds are swinging on feeders in the side yard while three
squirrels compete for sole rights to the two terra cotta saucers
filled with sunflower seeds. A fourth is trying to bring down a
suet cage. The shiny green birdbath I lugged home from the nursery
glistens in a newly-planted flower bed.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like perfection, doesn't it? A real Shangri-La.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the rest of my yard looks a whole lot like an
illustration from the Richard Scarry book I used to read to my son,
Kristofor _ ``What Do People Do All Day?'' They're all out there _
just like the folks in the book. And I'm sure Lowly Worm is mucking
about in the mulch as well.
</P>
<P>
   For readers who were at a different time in their lives and not
reading Scarry to their kids, Lowly Worm appeared, although rather
obscurely, on every page in the book and before I could read the
text to him, Kristofor had to find the worm. His rule. Our delight.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's how my yard looks today. BUSY.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Druckenmiller is out front with a shrieking drill that's
chewing its way into the ancient mortar, or what's left of it, that
holds up the bricks in the pillar at the sidewalk edge of the long,
low wall that surrounds my yard. It didn't make it through last
winter's freezes and thaws.
</P>
<P>
   Little kids have been walking that wall since 1916, and it's my
solemn responsibility to maintain the tradition. Besides, I've
walked it a few times myself just so I wouldn't forget how much fun
they're having. Lucky for all of us wall-walkers Mr. D. is around
to save the day _ and the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tom Younker is out back _ I can hear his extension
ladder bumping against the upstairs back porch roof where he's busy
mending a downspout that was shoved away from its gutter by winter
ice. When he's finished, he'll move on around the house, and
eventually out to the garage, scraping, patching, and painting.
</P>
<P>
   The gutters and downspouts are original to the house _ 84 years
old. The alternative to the annual spring restoration would be new
ones, but they wouldn't match the graceful, half-barrel shapes of
the old ones, so we've nixed that idea.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bryan Reynolds is churning up an old flower
bed with his roto-tiller. A friend in the country supplies us with
all the manure we need _ free for the hauling _ and when she's not
out carrying brides to the church in her horse-drawn surrey, she
even helps load.
</P>
<P>
   Around back, another friend with an old pickup truck has just
dropped one-and-a-third cubic yards of hardwood mulch onto the
driveway _ the second load in two days. And there's more to go.
Now, it's holes to dig and flowers to plant _ a regular Midwestern
spring frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   This is my storybook _ kind of a homegrown response to Mr.
Scarry's question. This is what people do all day _ if they're
lucky like me.

SUMMER'S SPELL WEARS OFF ALL TOO QUICKLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whoopee! This is the last week of school. I won't have any more
homework to do. I can spend my evenings reading a book or watching
television or just doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I can talk with my husband, take long baths and actually sit
long enough to enjoy my dinner. I can talk to my daughters or
stroll through the mall or both.
</P>
<P>
   I won't have to add or subtract or multiply. I won't have to
read another confusing history or science text. There will be no
more book reports or science projects, the latter of which always
gave me nightmares. Best of all, I won't have to worry that my
daughters will come home at the end of yet another long, hard day
and tell me how inept I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, you changed it and it was wrong,'' one of them would
say with the disgust glaring from their big brown eyes. ``I thought
you were a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am,'' I'd say.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you got it wrong,'' one of them would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, let me see that,'' I'd demand. ``No, I didn't. That can't
be right. It's your teacher. She got it wrong. Is this her first
teaching job? She'll get better.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, somewhere between late August and this week, the
teacher has gained stature in my daughters' eyes and displaced me
as the know-it-all in their lives. You have to wonder if this
happened by accident or whether my daughters had a part in
dethroning me.
</P>
<P>
   I've gone from exemplary cool mom to merely an acceptable
dimwit. And in just nine months. I don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   After this week, I'll start to deprogram them, to have my little
darlings back, drinking from my head, so to speak. Yes, mark my
words. Solomon's wisdom will seem like mere horse sense compared
with my learning.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever I tell my daughters between now and the next August
will be gospel. That system of checks and balances that sometimes
seems to divide my home will have shut down. The windows and the
books will be closed. For two whole months.
</P>
<P>
   Just the thought makes me tingle all the way from the top of my
empty head to the bottom of my feet.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to a whole other matter. My empty bank account.
By summer's end, that little jingle in my pocket will have been
completely silenced, compliments of TXU and summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred dollars a week, they want for the pleasure of having
my girls. That's the low bid. The high looks something like $185 a
week. That alone will make you rethink your feelings about
homework, make you want to beg for it.
</P>
<P>
   So will the $300 a month TXU will demand for keeping my home
air-conditioned. Next to suffocating from the heat, helping my
daughters with their homework seems like a breath of fresh air, a
walk in the park, a piece of my cake.
</P>
<P>
   I can see myself now, longing for the end of summer and the
sight of that big yellow school bus rumbling through the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The very things I hated, I will think of lovingly. Days like
``muffins with mom'' and ``doughnuts for dad'' will seem like sheer
pleasure. So will the school carnival and teacher-parent
conferences. I'll learn to live again with my daughters' fondness
for the teacher. And I'll tolerate the homework.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say that?  suppose I should be honest.
</P>
<P>
   On curriculum night, I'll be the parent in the back of the room
making the futile plea for a little less homework.
</P>
<P>
   I know I made the same pitiful pitch last year, but you never
know when you might get lucky.
</P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the surface, it looks like a simple equation:
Women play sports, and they like to shop.
</P>
<P>
   But selling activewear to women and getting it right is
something that retailers _ especially sporting goods and athletic
specialty stores _ have wrestled with for years.
</P>
<P>
   There's no disputing women's activewear represents a growth
opportunity. But tackling the issue continues to plague focus
groups and executives alike. Some say the challenge stems from
increased competition from nonathletic brands and stores, the
popularity of sharp-priced private-label goods, lack of innovation
and old stereotypes in the male-dominated sporting goods industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic area is a very tough business on the women's side
because of the fashion component,'' said John Shanley, senior vice
president of First Security Van Kasper. ``A lot of women are buying
perfectly fine private-label exercise apparel at lower price
points. On the upper end, they're buying performance-oriented
apparel. But it's hard to tell if they're buying it for their
performance characteristics or fashion ones. If it's for fashion,
they're dealing with so many other options.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer snickering at the likes of The Gap, Old Navy and
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch for their inauthentic athletic looks, sporting
goods stores recognize them as serious competitors. Making matters
more complicated is the influx of e-tailers going after the women's
business. Lucy.com, womenoutdoors.com, venussports.com and
geargoddess.com are among the new players that aim to steal more
market share from traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a running joke with my friends who work in the
sporting goods industry. We couldn't understand why women's is
listed as a category. It's not a category _ it's half the
population,'' said Vicki Reed, marketing director of Lucy.com. ``If
you start off lumping too many things into one basket, you can't
reach all women. And you can't talk to them with the most relevant
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it's not surprising that retailers are not sold on
any particular strategy; they're trying them as they go.
</P>
<P>
   Having tried two different formats for women's stores, The
Athlete's Foot now plans to test a third prototype with next
month's opening of a 2,000-square-foot store in Nashville, Tenn.
Robert Corliss, president and chief executive officer of the
company, said the new one was developed because the other two
concepts are not doing that well. Being located in malls with a
traditional Athlete's Foot store has detracted from the business,
he said. The women's stores are called The Athlete's Foot for Her,
and the new prototype will also carry that banner.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
new store type. Designed to be more of a lifestyle store, there
will be added seating, nutritional products and sports-related
literature, a few new labels, more technical-oriented products and
head-to-toe displays. Fit Print, a proprietary foot-scanning
technique that measures a shopper's size and gait, will also be
offered in the new store.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlete's Foot is also rolling out a pilot program for
training supplied by Knowoyourstuff.com. With the use of the
Internet, employees will be able to measure their performance,
check their compensation and obtain product information.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss noted that women's sales, which account for 25 percent
of the company's volume, have increased slightly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking at the women's business. Women are about
51 percent of the population, they make 70 to 80 percent of the
buying decisions and they represent 30 percent of [sporting goods]
stores' sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss praised Lady Foot Locker ``for making a market out of
the women's business,'' and he also gave kudos to Nordstrom for its
merchandising and customer service. The Gap, The Limited and
Talbots have done a good job of serving women, he said, but
sporting goods stores don't make the grade yet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Corliss, sporting goods stores have been such a
male-oriented business for so long that they haven't been able to
give women a real voice.
</P>
<P>
   Now that more high schools and colleges are enforcing Title IX _
1972 legislation that guaranteed equal opportunity for federally
funded athletic programs _ demand for women's activewear and
athletic footwear will only increase. Corliss' daughter, who is now
a Division I field hockey player in college, made him more aware of
the need for stores that cater to women.
</P>
<P>
   Reed of Lucy.com noted how funny it is that retailers don't
single out the challenge of selling to men as they do with women.
Many sporting goods and athletic specialty e-tailers list various
sports and women's as separate categories online instead of
including women's products within the various sports, she said. For
example, the options might include ``tennis,'' ``golf,''
``running'' and ``women's.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that women tend to be more sophisticated shoppers than
men and are ``harder to please'' has challenged some stores, Reed
said. In addition, many sporting goods stores and athletic
specialty stores have limited floor space and real estate.
Nevertheless, Lucy.com is considering opening freestanding stores,
even though that is an ``incredibly huge undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we can reach women nationally so much faster than we
would if we were to open a chain of stores. Building a Web site is
certainly not cheap, but it's much more reasonable to do it in a
short period of time,'' Reed said. ``It's also accessible all the
time, and you can get it from any place. With the way life is now,
that's a huge bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Even MacySport stepped into the women's business somewhat
cautiously. When the sports-oriented concept shop bowed last summer
at Macy's flagship store at New York's Herald Square, women's
activewear was offered on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   Now the retailer is working to develop that component with
additional labels and special events aimed at women. An Adidas
fashion show, athlete appearances and panel discussions are some of
the strategies being used.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Sailor, buyer for branded women's and kids' apparel for
The Finish Line, said female customers require more attention than
their male counterparts. ``They want to talk to someone who has
used the product. Providing knowledge on the sales floor is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   As performance-oriented products continue to become more
popular, having well-informed sales help will only become more
important, she said. Given that, The Finish Line has been
distributing more printed material about high-tech merchandise to
its sales associates and via its divisional managers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kelleher, director of marketing for Blades, a specialty
store chain that caters to snowboarders, skateboarders and other
nontraditional athletes, said asking women what they want and
following through with the appropriate product are essential to
building sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our area, the clothing is so closely tied to the sports.
We've been catering to women's needs, not saying, `This T-shirt is
good enough _ it's got the same skateboard brand on it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reorganizing sales floors and trying new fixtures and new
displays sometimes on a weekly basis are some of the ways Blades
aims to attract more women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at it, we're in a constant state of
improvement,'' Kelleher said. ``We try to cater to the customer as
much as possible to the level they expect. Customer service is such
an important part of our business _ that's been one of our biggest
challenges.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ On the surface, it looks like a simple equation:
Women play sports, and they like to shop.
</P>
<P>
   But selling activewear to women and getting it right is
something that retailers _ especially sporting goods and athletic
specialty stores _ have wrestled with for years.
</P>
<P>
   There's no disputing women's activewear represents a growth
opportunity. But tackling the issue continues to plague focus
groups and executives alike. Some say the challenge stems from
increased competition from nonathletic brands and stores, the
popularity of sharp-priced private-label goods, lack of innovation
and old stereotypes in the male-dominated sporting goods industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic area is a very tough business on the women's side
because of the fashion component,'' said John Shanley, senior vice
president of First Security Van Kasper. ``A lot of women are buying
perfectly fine private-label exercise apparel at lower price
points. On the upper end, they're buying performance-oriented
apparel. But it's hard to tell if they're buying it for their
performance characteristics or fashion ones. If it's for fashion,
they're dealing with so many other options.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer snickering at the likes of The Gap, Old Navy and
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch for their inauthentic athletic looks, sporting
goods stores recognize them as serious competitors. Making matters
more complicated is the influx of e-tailers going after the women's
business. Lucy.com, womenoutdoors.com, venussports.com and
geargoddess.com are among the new players that aim to steal more
market share from traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a running joke with my friends who work in the
sporting goods industry. We couldn't understand why women's is
listed as a category. It's not a category _ it's half the
population,'' said Vicki Reed, marketing director of Lucy.com. ``If
you start off lumping too many things into one basket, you can't
reach all women. And you can't talk to them with the most relevant
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it's not surprising that retailers are not sold on
any particular strategy; they're trying them as they go.
</P>
<P>
   Having tried two different formats for women's stores, The
Athlete's Foot now plans to test a third prototype with next
month's opening of a 2,000-square-foot store in Nashville, Tenn.
Robert Corliss, president and chief executive officer of the
company, said the new one was developed because the other two
concepts are not doing that well. Being located in malls with a
traditional Athlete's Foot store has detracted from the business,
he said. The women's stores are called The Athlete's Foot for Her,
and the new prototype will also carry that banner.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
new store type. Designed to be more of a lifestyle store, there
will be added seating, nutritional products and sports-related
literature, a few new labels, more technical-oriented products and
head-to-toe displays. Fit Print, a proprietary foot-scanning
technique that measures a shopper's size and gait, will also be
offered in the new store.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlete's Foot is also rolling out a pilot program for
training supplied by Knowoyourstuff.com. With the use of the
Internet, employees will be able to measure their performance,
check their compensation and obtain product information.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss noted that women's sales, which account for 25 percent
of the company's volume, have increased slightly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking at the women's business. Women are about
51 percent of the population, they make 70 to 80 percent of the
buying decisions and they represent 30 percent of [sporting goods]
stores' sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss praised Lady Foot Locker ``for making a market out of
the women's business,'' and he also gave kudos to Nordstrom for its
merchandising and customer service. The Gap, The Limited and
Talbots have done a good job of serving women, he said, but
sporting goods stores don't make the grade yet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Corliss, sporting goods stores have been such a
male-oriented business for so long that they haven't been able to
give women a real voice.
</P>
<P>
   Now that more high schools and colleges are enforcing Title IX _
1972 legislation that guaranteed equal opportunity for federally
funded athletic programs _ demand for women's activewear and
athletic footwear will only increase. Corliss' daughter, who is now
a Division I field hockey player in college, made him more aware of
the need for stores that cater to women.
</P>
<P>
   Reed of Lucy.com noted how funny it is that retailers don't
single out the challenge of selling to men as they do with women.
Many sporting goods and athletic specialty e-tailers list various
sports and women's as separate categories online instead of
including women's products within the various sports, she said. For
example, the options might include ``tennis,'' ``golf,''
``running'' and ``women's.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that women tend to be more sophisticated shoppers than
men and are ``harder to please'' has challenged some stores, Reed
said. In addition, many sporting goods stores and athletic
specialty stores have limited floor space and real estate.
Nevertheless, Lucy.com is considering opening freestanding stores,
even though that is an ``incredibly huge undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we can reach women nationally so much faster than we
would if we were to open a chain of stores. Building a Web site is
certainly not cheap, but it's much more reasonable to do it in a
short period of time,'' Reed said. ``It's also accessible all the
time, and you can get it from any place. With the way life is now,
that's a huge bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Even MacySport stepped into the women's business somewhat
cautiously. When the sports-oriented concept shop bowed last summer
at Macy's flagship store at New York's Herald Square, women's
activewear was offered on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   Now the retailer is working to develop that component with
additional labels and special events aimed at women. An Adidas
fashion show, athlete appearances and panel discussions are some of
the strategies being used.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Sailor, buyer for branded women's and kids' apparel for
The Finish Line, said female customers require more attention than
their male counterparts. ``They want to talk to someone who has
used the product. Providing knowledge on the sales floor is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   As performance-oriented products continue to become more
popular, having well-informed sales help will only become more
important, she said. Given that, The Finish Line has been
distributing more printed material about high-tech merchandise to
its sales associates and via its divisional managers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kelleher, director of marketing for Blades, a specialty
store chain that caters to snowboarders, skateboarders and other
nontraditional athletes, said asking women what they want and
following through with the appropriate product are essential to
building sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our area, the clothing is so closely tied to the sports.
We've been catering to women's needs, not saying, `This T-shirt is
good enough _ it's got the same skateboard brand on it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reorganizing sales floors and trying new fixtures and new
displays sometimes on a weekly basis are some of the ways Blades
aims to attract more women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at it, we're in a constant state of
improvement,'' Kelleher said. ``We try to cater to the customer as
much as possible to the level they expect. Customer service is such
an important part of our business _ that's been one of our biggest
challenges.'' &QL;

&HT;     KENYAN RUNNER TAKES HIS TIME WINNING BAY RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Filed in ``l'' and ``s'' categories.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reuben Cheruiyot messed around for a couple of
miles, at least by his lofty standards.
</P>
<P>
   He was content to poke along with the pack in the early stages
of the 89th Examiner Bay to Breakers on Sunday, in a race that
seemed to be stuck in cement.
</P>
<P>
   The pace was so slow that unseeded runners and guys jumping into
the action from off the curbs along Sixth Street actually managed
to keep up with the top-rated men for more than a moment or two.
</P>
<P>
   Then the 26-year-old Cheruiyot, another in that seemingly
endless cookie-cutter line of Kenyans, decided to get serious.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the most challenging spot on the 7.46-mile city to the
sea course _ Hayes Street hill _ to make his move.
</P>
<P>
   And what a move it was.
</P>
<P>
   Cheruiyot roared up the hill, quickly distancing himself from
everyone in the field except countryman Dominic Kirui, then, going
down the hill, he quickly dispatched Kirui, too.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the way it was Cheruiyot, running all alone into
history as he became the 10th straight Kenyan male to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   His time wasn't impressive. His clocking of 34:54, in fact, was
the slowest since Arturo Barrios' 34:57 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But, considering that the runners were practically walking the
first two miles (4:57 and 4:43, respectively), and that Cheruiyot's
journey was strictly a solo act after Hayes Street hill, his time
was more than commendable.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it was way off Kenyan Ismail Kirui's Breakers record of
33:42 and the world 12K best of 33:31 set by Kenyan Joseph Kimani,
and was the second-slowest Breakers clocking since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Cheruiyot, who had won five straight road races coming into
Sunday's competition, was well aware of the record talk preceding
the Breakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strong, and I was trying to push it,'' Cheruiyot said,
``but it was too hot for a record pace. I'm very happy to have won
the race the way I did. I like to run alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheruiyot's agent, Australian Peter Stubbs _ himself a
world-class half miler _ said, ``To break records, Reuben would
have needed to have three or four guys pushing him seriously, right
from the start, and that didn't happen. Most of the way, he was
just coasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs said he was surprised Cheruiyot handled the field as
easily as he did, especially after the slow early fractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Hayes Street hill,'' Stubbs said, ``I think he just decided
it was time to go to work. He was feeling good at that point, so
why not just drop the hammer? Which is exactly what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Breakers, much is always made of the rigors of Hayes
Street hill, about how tough it will prove for first timers in the
race, like Cheruiyot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at it,'' Stubbs said, ``and Reuben said to me,
`What's the problem? It's just a hill.'''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say. Not so easy for his nonplussed rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Kirui, who was second in 35:25 _ a fat 31 seconds behind
Cheruiyot _ said, ``I tried to stay with Reuben, but I was feeling
tired today, and he is very strong right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-place finisher Armando Quintanilla (35:30) of Mexico said,
``It was very difficult. Cheruiyot was going down the hill (Hayes
Street) when I was still going up. I would need to train very hard
to run beside him because he is in great form right now. The heat
wasn't a problem, but Reuben was.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintanilla's countryman Joel Hernandez, a sub-seeded runner,
finished ahead of the other two elite runners in the race, Jon
Brown of the United Kingdom and Josphat Machuka of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In seventh spot, behind the veteran Machuka, was the top Bay
Area finisher, Kalid Abdalah, a 20-year-old Somalian now living in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was displeased with the pokey pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy about it,'' Brown said. ``It suited me just fine.
But I'm just not in shape at the moment. This was the first time
I've done anything more than an easy run in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed that when Cheruiyot made his move on the hill, he'd
had enough of hanging around with the rest of us. He just wanted to
get on with it, so he accelerated really hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found getting up the hill difficult. I didn't recover for
two miles.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By then, of course, Brown was merely a spectator. Along with all
the other supposedly elite men, if they could even see Cheruiyot,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Cheruiyot, who honed his skills by running 16
miles a day to and from school when he was a youngster, was as
elusive verbally as he had been on the course.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Cheruiyot is, he'll be a longshot to make the Kenyan
Olympic 10,000-meter team _ his next goal _ as will Kirui. Both of
them live and train in Colorado now. The Kenyan stars already are
in training back home, getting ready for their country's Olympic
trials in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of becoming a champion,'' Cheruiyot said. ``An Olympic
champion? Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, however, Cheruiyot will keep trying to become king
of the roads rather than king of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come up with such a great series of races this year,''
Stubbs said, ``but I don't think he's peaked. He's kind of gotten
the hunger for the roads here in America. He's starting to build
his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's finished building it, the rest of the road racers
might well be advised to take up another line of work.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    London is booming. It's a city where West End matinees, tea at
Brown's Hotel and noontime concerts at St. Martin-in-the-Fields are
still star attractions. But it's also Tony Blair's ``Cool
Britannia,'' with a lively restaurant scene, a controversial
first-ever mayor, Ken Livingston, and the much-debated Millennium
Dome.
 &HT;    What will visiting Americans find in the capital this summer?
 &HT;    The new British Airways London Eye (44-20870-800-0600;
www.ba-londoneye.com), a giant Ferris wheel with enclosed cars that
rises slowly above the Thames for a bird's-eye view of the city.
Not to mention the newly opened Tate Modern (25 Sumner St. London.
SE1; 44-20-7887-8008; www.tate.org.uk) in the old Bankside Power
Station.
 &HT;    Located on the Thames and looking across at St. Paul's
Cathedral, the building was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott,
who gave England its red phone box.
 &HT;    The vast 500-foot-long Turbine Hall and the river views very
nearly distract from the national collection of modern art, which
includes major works by Duchamp, Hockney and Warhol. More than 2
million visitors are expected to visit the free museum this year.
 &HT;    In fact, the only downside to London this summer is that it can
cost a small fortune to vacation there. But here are some tips to
do it without courting bankruptcy.
 &HT;    Flights to London in summertime can be sky high. These are
months when's it also tough to use frequent flier miles. To get the
best fares, try to avoid flying on Fridays and Sundays.
 &HT;    If flights to Heathrow seem expensive, look to Gatwick and even
Birmingham, for example, which is just 90 minutes by train from
London.
 &HT;    Consolidator fares to London often undercut the major carriers'
summer fares. One of the fastest ways to access them is through
Internet sites such as Expedia.com (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.com), LowestFare.com
(www.lowestfare.com) and the Travel Site.Com
(www.thetravelsite.com).
 &HT;    Another way around high fares is a classic airline package.
Round-trip airfare, accommodations and transfers are included for a
single price, along with other perks, such as a sightseeing tour.
 &HT;    British Airways (Holiday Desk, 75-20 Astoria Blvd., Jackson
Heights, N.Y. 11370; 877-428-2228;
www.britishairways.com/regional/USA), Virgin Atlantic (747 Belden
Ave., Norwalk, Conn. 06850; 888-YES-VIRGIN; www.virginatlantic.com)
and American Airlines (P.O. Box 619688, DFW Airport, Texas 75261;
800-882-8880; www.aa.com) all offer a range of packages to London.
 &HT;    For example, Virgin's ``London Experience'' is a six-night
package that includes round-trip airfare, transfers, hotel, daily
continental breakfast, a theater ticket, one afternoon tea, a
sightseeing tour and other perks starting at $819 per person, based
on double occupancy. Not bad, considering that airfares alone
between New York and London can run higher than that in summer.
 &HT;    Package prices are fixed throughout the season, and they're
usually available with as little as seven days' advance notice. The
two variables, of course, are hotel choice and availability. Since
there may be 20 or more hotels offered at different prices, it's
smart to check them out independently via the Internet or with a
London guidebook.
 &HT;    Yet for some Americans, going to London isn't the same without
staying at one of London's best hotels, places that have redefined
the luxury-hotel experience. But London sticker shock is most
apparent at these fabled hotels where chintz, afternoon tea and
discreet service reign.
 &HT;    For London's top properties, it's not uncommon to spend in
excess of $400 per night, with daily breakfast at such hotels
easily adding $40 or more to the bill.
 &HT;    But here's a little secret. Smack in the middle of summertime
high season, when there are more pairs of white sneakers than
pigeons in Trafalgar Square, there are deals to be found at some of
London's finest hotels. That's because the highflying European
business travelers who are normally in residence are on vacation.
 &HT;    For example, look at One Aldwych (One Aldwych, WC2;
800-223-6800; www.onealdwych.co.uk), a chic, minimalist palace just
a stone's throw from Covent Garden. Rooms boast down comforters,
fresh fruit and flowers as well as CD players, and the hotel has a
59-foot lap pool where Mozart is piped underwater.
 &HT;    The average nightly rate is 300 pounds (about $474). But from
July 29 to September 10, ``Summer Vacation Rates'' at the hotel
come in at 195 pounds per night ($308) for the first two nights and
97 pounds ($153) for the third night. What's more, a full English
breakfast is included.
 &HT;    For those who like the idea of bed &AMP; breakfast but don't want to
stay in the suburbs, consider Uptown Reservations (41 Paradise
Walk, Chelsea; 44 020 7351 3445; www.fenet.co.uk/uptown). These bed
&AMP; breakfast accommodations are in private houses in such tony
neighborhoods as Chelsea, Knightsbridge or Kensington. Rooms have
either an ensuite bathroom or a private bathroom. Rates run 85
pounds ($134) and, naturally, include breakfast.
 &HT;    For those intent upon saving money, the British Tourist
Authority (551 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10176; 800-462-2748;
www.visitbritain.com) is a good source for finding bed &AMP; breakfasts
and affordable hotel suggestions. They also offer a wealth of
information on cost-saving museum and transportation passes.
 &HT;    No one said that London is cheap. But with a little forethought,
it can be affordable.

 &HT;    For example, Virgin's ``London Experience'' is a six-night
package that includes round-trip airfare, transfers, hotel, daily
continental breakfast, a theater ticket, one afternoon tea, a
sightseeing tour and other perks starting at $819 per person, based
on double occupancy. Not bad, considering that airfares alone
between New York and London can run higher than that in summer.
 &HT;    Package prices are fixed throughout the season, and they're
usually available with as little as seven days' advance notice. The
two variables, of course, are hotel choice and availability. Since
there may be 20 or more hotels offered at different prices, it's
smart to check them out independently via the Internet or with a
London guidebook.
 &HT;    Yet for some Americans, going to London isn't the same without
staying at one of London's best hotels, places that have redefined
the luxury-hotel experience. But London sticker shock is most
apparent at these fabled hotels where chintz, afternoon tea and
discreet service reign.
 &HT;    For London's top properties, it's not uncommon to spend in
excess of $400 per night, with daily breakfast at such hotels
easily adding $40 or more to the bill.
 &HT;    But here's a little secret. Smack in the middle of summertime
high season, when there are more pairs of white sneakers than
pigeons in Trafalgar Square, there are deals to be found at some of
London's finest hotels. That's because the highflying European
business travelers who are normally in residence are on vacation.
 &HT;    For example, look at One Aldwych (One Aldwych, WC2;
800-223-6800; www.onealdwych.co.uk), a chic, minimalist palace just
a stone's throw from Covent Garden. Rooms boast down comforters,
fresh fruit and flowers as well as CD players, and the hotel has a
59-foot lap pool where Mozart is piped underwater.
 &HT;    The average nightly rate is 300 pounds (about $474). But from
July 29 to September 10, ``Summer Vacation Rates'' at the hotel
come in at 195 pounds per night ($308) for the first two nights and
97 pounds ($153) for the third night. What's more, a full English
breakfast is included.
 &HT;    For those who like the idea of bed &AMP; breakfast but don't want to
stay in the suburbs, consider Uptown Reservations (41 Paradise
Walk, Chelsea; 44 020 7351 3445; www.fenet.co.uk/uptown). These bed
&AMP; breakfast accommodations are in private houses in such tony
neighborhoods as Chelsea, Knightsbridge or Kensington. Rooms have
either an ensuite bathroom or a private bathroom. Rates run 85
pounds ($134) and, naturally, include breakfast.
 &HT;    For those intent upon saving money, the British Tourist
Authority (551 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10176; 800-462-2748;
www.visitbritain.com) is a good source for finding bed &AMP; breakfasts
and affordable hotel suggestions. They also offer a wealth of
information on cost-saving museum and transportation passes.
 &HT;    No one said that London is cheap. But with a little forethought,
it can be affordable.

 By ADELE MALOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Planning a tour of China may not be easy, but it is worth the
effort, says Romaine Wismer of Ellenton, Fla., and her daughter,
Shelley Wismer, of Salt Lake City. In preparing for their trip,
they poured over brochures for hours, read books like Fodor's
``Exploring China,'' checked National Geographic and AAA files and
then visited www.China.com.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to cover as much as possible,'' they said, ``but did
not want to spend four or five days on a ship in the Yangtze River,
which is part of many popular tours of China.''
 &HT;    The Wismers settled on BestTours of River Vale, N.J.,
(800-688-3288; www.bestour.com) because this company allowed them
to swap unwanted cruise days for stops in Shaoxing and Hangzhou _
two cities in the wine-, tea- and silk-producing areas. Their
18-day itinerary included visits to Shanghai, Shaoxing, Hangzhou,
Suzhou, Beijing, Xian, Guilan, Guangzhou (Canton) and Hong Kong.
The cost: $4,000, which covered transportation, lodging and most
meals.
 &HT;    Although the schedule was busy and sometimes tiring, Romaine
Wismer, an active 74-year-old traveler, didn't find it impossible.
``Getting there was the most grueling part of the journey since the
17-hour flight covered 7,000 miles from Salt Lake City,'' she said.
 &HT;    While the Wismers admit that they were fascinated by the Great
Wall, Terracotta Warriors and the beauty of Guili, they remember
with greatest enthusiasm their close encounters with the locals and
their unique culture.
 &HT;    On an early-morning walk their first day in Shanghai, they saw
many groups of people engaged in activities _ some were absorbed in
Tai Chi, others were involved in an exercise class, and still
others followed prescribed dance routines and waved long red fabric
ribbons to form patterns. The Wismers learned that these dances are
performed at public celebrations and that the red fabric symbolizes
Communism.
 &HT;    Most interesting to the Wismer duo were the 20 or 30 people who
were dancing to a popular tune. When the Wismers asked their
permission to take a snapshot, they were greeted by collective
smiles and nods.
 &HT;    Romaine Wismer said, ``One small, older man stopped, bowed and
motioned to us to join the group. `Tango?' he asked. We shook our
heads to indicate that we had not mastered that dance, but he held
his arms open and again said, `Tango,' while beckoning us to join.
We smiled, bowed and continued on our way.''
 &HT;    
 WHIRLING ME AROUND  
 &HT;    ``The next morning, The same man was in the same spot,'' Romaine
Wismer said. ``This time when he issued his invitation, I stepped
forward while Shelley held up her camera. The man took my hand and
whirled me around while he smiled for the picture. What a wonderful
way to begin our journey through his country!''
 &HT;    The Wismers left Shanghai on the train going to Shaoxing, a much
smaller town that is famous for producing rice wine and is
reputedly one of the oldest villages in the country.
 &HT;    When they arrived, the Wismers and two other tourists were the
only passengers to leave the train. After lunch, the
mother-and-daughter team were on their own until dinner, so they
decided to take a short walk to the downtown area. Road workers
stopped their digging to stare, making the Wismers reflect on how
it feels to be a minority. They saw no other Caucasians.
 &HT;    A small van took Romaine and Shelley Wismer to Hangzhou, the
heart of the tea-producing area that celebrates the Mid-Autumn
Festival or Festival of the Mooncake. During the celebration, it is
customary for families to gather in the many parks to picnic, dance
or play games.
 &HT;    
 A SMALL CONFECTION  
 &HT;    A mooncake is a small confection, usually 2.5 inches in diameter
and an inch tall. It looks like a pale version of our Christmas
fruitcake and, according to Romaine Wismer, tastes a lot like it.
Mooncakes are sold in bakeries, hotel lobbies and, sometimes, at
street corner booths.
 &HT;    The Wismers enjoyed the dancers, even though they couldn't
understand a word of what the master of ceremonies said. They
watched in awe as a giant mooncake on a table three feet wide was
wheeled onto the stage, causing audience members to file up to the
stage to cut sections of the cake to eat after dinner.
 &HT;    Romaine Wismer says, ``After a little urging from me, Shelley
went to get a share of the mooncake for our party. The Chinese
people smiled and nodded their approval.''
 &HT;    
 OUR BEST INSIGHT  
 &HT;    The Wismers said they got their greatest insight into life in
China when they toured Beijing. ``We were always aware that our
guides were government employees who would only show us those
things that the government allows foreign tourists to see,''
Romaine Wismer said. But, she added, ``In Hutong we were introduced
to a family consisting of an older woman, her daughter and
granddaughter.
 &HT;    ``Their living quarters would be considered very poor in our
country, but this family was proud of the large-screen TV,
refrigerator and running water. All 13 of us crowded into one small
room. The grandmother didn't speak any English, but she smiled as
our guide explained that while she no longer worked, her daughter
and son-in-law both had good jobs. The daughter worked in a
restaurant, but we were not told what the son did. The grandmother,
whose name was Anna, offered us candy with much smiling and
bowing.''
 &HT;    On the way to Tiananmen Square, the Wismers were startled to see
a portable barber's chair on the sidewalk. In it sat a man who was
in the process of getting his hair cut in the open air.
 &HT;    ``The local people showed no surprise,'' Romaine Wismer said.
``They just walked around the chair.''
 &HT;    As the Wismers approached Tiananmen Square, a guide gave a long
talk about the events that took place in this historic location.
His description: ``The accident was caused by misguided students
who were influenced by outside agitators in 1989.''
 &HT;    Since her return, Romaine Wismer remembers the monuments and
beautiful spots of this enormous land. But most of all, she
remembers the one-on-one encounters with the people of China.
 &HT;    In addition to Bestours, other travel packages to China are
offered by Saga Holidays, a company that specializes in trips for
those ages 50 and older. Their 19-night tour, which includes a
Yangtze River cruise, is priced at $3,899, double occupancy.
Departures dates are available through September. For more
information, call (800) 432-1432, or visit www.sagaholidays.com on
the Web.
 &HT;    Orient Flexi-Pax Tours, which operates out of New York, has an
18-day Yangtze River Splendors trip that costs $3,739 plus taxes
for a fall departure. For more information, call (800) 545-5540, or

Renaissance poetry who led the largest fundraising campaign in the
history of higher education, plans to step down next spring after a
decade as president of Harvard, the nation's oldest and most

abrupt three-month leave of absence due to exhaustion early in his
tenure, Rudenstine has won wide praise for uniting Harvard's
historically disparate deans, and has been a leading national
spokesman supporting multiculturalism and affirmative action. By

   BRAZIL-SATELLITES (Alcantara, Brazil) _ In the satellite
launching business, location is everything. Because Alcantara is
two degrees south of the equator, rockets launched here can achieve
orbit faster and carry heavier payloads than those launched
elsewhere. Built by the Brazilian military two decades ago, the
Alcantara Launch Center has become the focal point for what is
perhaps the most ambitious space program in any developing country.
A boom in telecommunications satellites _ most of them for American
companies _ is likely to assure Alcantara a prosperous future. By

<HEADLINE>
DR. LAURA DOESN'T NEED HELP FAILING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dr. Laura Schlessinger's new syndicated television program
bombs, and it will, it won't be her fault.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Laura's show tanks, it will be because a vast left-wing
conspiracy _ gays, feminists, tree huggers, free-lovers, prochoice
advocates, child haters, atheists, journalists, academics, assorted
libertines and moral bankrupts _ has been working day and night to
keep her message off television.
</P>
<P>
   When her show fails it will be all their fault.
</P>
<P>
   Because you can be sure that it won't be Dr. Laura's.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she is about as telegenic as a dried codfish.
</P>
<P>
   Even if her TV persona gives new meaning to the word stiff.
</P>
<P>
   So I have mixed feelings about the tactics of gay activists who
are urging WCVB-TV (Ch. 5) not to air Dr. Laura's show. I
sympathize, but if they succeed it will give her another excuse to
play the martyr, a role she relishes, and knows how to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd rather watch her fail.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Dr. Laura said her remarks about gays had been
distorted, taken out of ``clinical'' context. She says she doesn't
condemn homosexuals, she condemns homosexuality. She hates the sin
but loves the sinner.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure in which clinical context she referred to gays as
``deviants.'' The word doesn't sound clinical, i.e., objective,
analytical, devoid of emotion. It sounds loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she thinks of her radio show as a clinic, although there
doesn't seem to be much about it that's clinical in the medical
sense. It's not what you'd call therapeutic, unless you believe in
old-fashioned wall-to-wall therapy, and a lot of her callers do,
apparently. Hit me again, Dr. Laura! Harder! Thanks. I needed that.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, driving to work, I listen to Dr. Laura just to get my
dander up. It never fails. She has the same effect on my nervous
system as four or five cups of coffee. Between Dr. Laura and Boston
traffic, I arrive at work with my eyes bugging out of my head.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura's radio show reaches 20 million listeners. It's
probably safe to say that most of them don't tune in, as I do, to
get their blood roiled. Her success says a great deal about how
desperate people are for guidance, for someone to tell them what's
right and what's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Into the slough of moral relativism steps a woman wrapped in a
cloak of sanctimony.
</P>
<P>
   She natters on as if she were without sin, free to cast the
first stone.
</P>
<P>
   She acts as though she personally carried the tablets down from
Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't give advice, she issues orders.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura's act may play on radio, but it won't go over on
televison. The only way to make her program a hit is to turn it
into a quiz show. ``For 1 million dollars, list the following
groups in the order in which Dr. Laura insulted and abused them on
yesterday's show: 1) Gays 2) Single mothers 3) Atheists or 4)
Mothers who work outside the home.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post reported last week that rehearsals for her
television program have not been going well. The paper quoted an
anonymous observer who said Dr. Laura was having a dificult time
mastering the TV talk-show form. The spy added, ``The worst part
is, she won't listen to anybody's advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes you want to go take on the day, doesn't it?

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, May 23:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CANCER (New Orleans) _ Developments at the cancer
conference: Three new studies suggest that small doses of
antidepressants can help relieve hot flashes in cancer patients. By
Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MANDRILLS (Undated) _ Primatologists are discovering new and
exciting elements in the life of the mandrills of Gabon: they dwell
in vast colonies of females and offspring. A group of 800 mandrills
is a tightknit and stable society, traveling, foraging, breeding,
playing, nuzzling and bickering together year after year. And
except when females are in estrus, the males are solitary dwelling
creatures, who all but kill one another when the females are in
season. By Natalie Angier. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT3.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RUSSIA-MIR (Undated) _ By some plans, it should have been
long dead. With most of its structure disintegrated by a fiery
reentry through the Earth's atmosphere, the remains of the giant
spacecraft should be resting on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
Instead, the Russian Mir space station remains in orbit, staffed by
two astronauts busily repairing worn components and readying it for
future visits. Previously abandoned, battered and showing all the
effects of its sometimes troubled 14 years in space, the Mir just
keeps going on and on. By Warren E. Leary. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT4.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LYME-DEBATE (Undated) _ A furious debate rages among doctors
over the value of expensive antibiotics used to term Lyme disease.
So say nothing more can be done after the original treatments,
while others contend the rigid, expensive regimen may be needed for
months. Now members of Congress are determined to find out which
side is right and have ordered a Congressional investigation. By
Holcomb B. Noble. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT5,6.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLUORESCENT-MOLECULE (Undated) _ A glowing point at the tip
of an optical fiber could someday be the torch that lights the
world of DNA, proteins and other molecules. Writing in Nature,
researchers at the University of Konstanz in Germany report that
they had created a microscope that used a single fluorescent
molecule as its light source. Some scientists are calling it a
breakthrough in optical imaging. By Kenneth Chang. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE (Undated) _ In a culmination of concerted efforts
initiated by one determined family, three groups of researchers are
reporting that they have found the gene mutation that causes a rare
disorder known as pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Now that they have
identified the gene, they say, they can begin figuring out how it
contributes to disease, diagnose it prenatally, test for it in
people whose symptoms are ambiguous and look for ways to treat the
disease. By Gina Kolata. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DAEDALUS (Undated) _ An imaginative and irreverent English
scientist who writes under the pen name Daedalus has been tweaking
scientific orthodoxy in weekly columns for the last 36 years. A
self-described ``court jester in the Palace of Science,'' he is an
expert in chemical spectroscopy and other sober subjects, and since
1988 his column has been published weekly by the serious journal
Nature. But his research projects have sometimes flown wildly off
the track of mainstream science. One of his achievements was the
construction of a fraudulent perpetual motion machine. By Malcolm
Browne. (1525 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALBATROSS (Undated) _ Researchers in Massachusetts
unexpectedly discovered an albatross, whose internal compass had
gone haywire. But it was just one of several extraordinary bird
finds on Penikese. 1215 words w/photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on the
nonexistent love life of bdelloids, the rediscovered asteroid
Albert and the missing comet K2. By Henry Fountain. (685 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MADCOW-DISEASE (Undated) _ Now, six years after young people
in Britain started dying from a human strain of mad cow disease,
scientists are still struggling to understand how the disease
spreads to humans, how many more will die from it and if a similar
epidemic could start in the United States spread by infected deer
and elk. While there are no firm answers, clues are being
discovered on an almost weekly basis as scientists explore the
nature of a mysterious infectious agent called the prion. By Sandra
Blakeslee. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BOWELS (Undated) _ An obsession with the bowels was more
than a mad moment in the history of medicine. It went on for a
century or more, and it is not over yet, according to a book
published in March, ``Inner Hygiene.'' The book is exhaustive and
scholarly, but it is also a merry chronicle. Constipation may be
common and unpleasant, but the notion that it is the root of every
illness is nonsense. The idea, however, had been around for
centuries, and it was truly embraced by doctors and the public in
the United States and Europe in the 1800s. It kept its hold on
medicine until well into the 20th century. By Denise Grady. (890
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEDICAL-CONSUMERISM (Undated) _ In quitting the United
States Senate race last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani discovered
that choosing a therapy for prostate cancer was a far more daunting
effort than he had expected. Giuliani said he had to focus entirely
on the decision, letting his immediate political future fall by the
wayside. Giuliani's difficulties spring largely from a radical
change in the relationship between patients and their doctors.
Americans have traded in paternalism for medical consumerism after
fighting for a greater voice in making critical decisions about
their care, and that has not come without cost. By Lawrence K.
Altman. (1125 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: High-fiber
diets may not prevent cancer, as recent studies suggest. But they
have tons of other benefits. By Jane E. Brody. (790 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-WAGER (Undated) _ How many human genes are there?
Recent estimates have ranged from 60,000 to 140,000 and might be
expected to narrow sharply as the human genome nears completion. In
fact the range has widened, suggesting that gene-counting remains
at least as much art as science. Faced with estimates that are all
over the lot, genome scientists have contrived a simpler way of
settling the question, at least for the present. At a meeting this
month at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory they opened a sweepstake
for bets on the number of human genes. The winner will be chosen
based on the most likely number decreed at the same annual meeting
in 2003. By Nicholas Wade. (585 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ For children who need medical attention at a hospital, the
danger may not end when they are placed in an ambulance. A recent
study found by researches at Johns Hopkins Children's Center found
that it was not uncommon for patients and medical equipment to be
unsecured as ambulances sped them to the hospital. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing medical costs has become a major goal in the age of
managed care, but a new study finds that can be trickier to
accomplish than it may seem. Money saved at the hospital often is
spent for other care, including later hospitalizations. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A researcher warns people with pacemakers not to sleep with
magnets, but apparently they can safely be worn as long as they're
kept at least six inches away from the devices. (306 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers say that deaths from sudden infant death syndrome
could be cut back even further if doctors would merely tell their
new mothers to put the babies to bed on their backs. (265 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Through genetic engineering, scientists have bred a mouse that
can drink much more alcohol that other mice, and that even recovers
from its hangovers fasters. They hope their findings will be
significant in treating alcoholics. (225 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Why does fish
start smelling awful in the garbage pail so much sooner than meat
does? By C. Claiborne Ray. (290 words)

WAVE OF VIOLENCE BY TEENS LEADS TO HAND-WRINGING IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A young woman is stalked and murdered. An elderly woman
is knifed to death by her neighbor. Another is killed during a bus
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   This might read like a New York police blotter, but all the
crimes were committed in Japan in the space of a few weeks. Most
startling, all were committed by Japanese teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is racked by a growing wave of teen violence, and that has
led to a lot of hand-wringing, as Japan wonders what is going wrong
with its youth.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's violent crime rate is the highest it has been in 23
years, but the fastest-growing category is crimes committed by
those under 18 years old. Specialists cite a combination of factors
to explain why so many of this generation are lashing out: economic
hard times, smaller families, an increased sense of isolation due
to technology, and school pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese youth, of course, aren't killing anybody, and the
crime rate remains much lower than in the United States, but
specialists said the assailants are merely extreme examples of a
surging number of dysfunctional Japanese youth known as
``hikikomori,'' or socially withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The average hikikomori might refuse to go to school, hole up in
a bedroom, sleep during the day, stay up at night, and act
violently toward family members.
</P>
<P>
   They are also characterized by a lack of self-esteem, and
according to adolescent psychiatrist Hidehiko Kuramoto, ``an
inability to separate the real world from the world of their
imagination.'' That's one reason why a hikikomori teenager can
become violent, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on juvenile crime in Japan are sketchy, but it has
been rising steadily since 1994, and today more than half of all
violent offenses are committed by teens. In 1998, the most recent
year for which statistics are available, incidents of school
violence rose 25 percent, and experts say it most certainly rose
again in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Japan last experienced a wave of teen violence in the early
1980s, but most of the crime was committed by gangs and it wasn't
quite so brutal. Today, most of the violence is done by
individuals, and it can be cruel and cold.
</P>
<P>
   In the case this month of a 17-year-old boy who stabbed his
64-year-old neighbor to death, the boy reportedly told police that
he wanted to have the experience of killing someone.
</P>
<P>
   Japan became aware of just how cruel a child can be in 1997,
when a 14-year-old in Kobe strangled and dismembered an
11-year-old, shocking the nation. Not only has youth violence
continued to grow, but the offenders are getting younger, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Youth violence in Japan is still nothing compared with the that
in the United States, which over the past year has had a rash of
school shootings, starting with the deaths at Columbine High School
in Colorado. But Yoshinao Hirano, an education professor at Shinshu
University, said Japanese youth are, in their hearts, as capable of
violence as their American peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that America has guns, and Japan does not,'' he
said. Japan has some of the strictest gun-control laws in the
world. To get a handgun _ all other guns are illegal _ one must
undergo a year of background checks.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the recent rash of teen violence, Japan's
parliament is working to change its juvenile crime statute, which
hasn't been altered since 1949. A draft bill would lower the age of
prosecution from 16 to 14, and would automatically place serious
crimes in the hands of prosecutors rather than family court.
</P>
<P>
   At age 14, Seiichi Ishii's daughter refused to go to school. She
became sullen and withdrawn, and wouldn't go out of the house. She
vented her rage at her mother. Ishii, a computer executive, is
trying to understand what happened. He said he thinks maybe the
problem is that his daughter is an only child, and didn't have a
sibling to interact with. He also said she was getting bullied at
school because she was a bit unusual, a sin at conformist Japanese
schools.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later his daughter is back in school, but
nothing has been solved. She's still violent at home, and directs
most of the behavior toward her mother. ``I'm afraid she might
snap, become a kireru,'' said Ishii, using a term that means to
commit a sudden violent act.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of social withdrawal is not exclusive to Japan,
but experts say one of the reasons it may be especially prevalent
is that Japan is a reserved society. It is the kind of behavior a
child can sink in to and no one might notice at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's peculiarly Japanese. These kids are being too passive.
It's a kind of passive aggression,'' said Hidehiko Sekizawa,
executive director of the Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living,
which monitors Japanese lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent surveys funded by the Ministry of Education point
much of the blame at parents. ``Japanese kids are lacking a moral
education,'' said Hirano, who was commissioned to conduct the
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hirano's studies, Japanese children have less
parental instruction and discipline than their counterparts in
Korea, Britain, Germany, and the United States. For example, 71
percent of Japanese youth have never been told by their fathers not
to lie _ three times more than youth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese youth are also less likely than teenagers in other
countries to do good deeds, like stopping a friend from doing
something wrong, or helping an elderly person, according to one
study, a sharp contrast to their parents' reputation for
politeness.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also attribute youth violence to video games and
television. But while critics in the United States object to video
games and movies with violence, the Japanese are worried about the
isolating nature of computers and television. A survey by the
Hakuhodo Institute found that children 10 to 14 ``thought of video
games as friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, schools must share in the blame, specialists say. Though
life in Japan is changing rapidly and becoming less traditional and
conformist, the schools are not. ``That gap can be difficult for
some students to handle,'' said Kuramoto. Bullying, for example, is
a consistent problem that schools do little to address. The
17-year-old boy who hijacked a bus and killed one passenger was the
victim of bullying in school.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his daughter undergoing massive trauma, Ishii found it
difficult to seek professional help. The family went to see a
psychiatrist only once, and his daughter made only occasional
visits to a counseling center. Ishii's wife ended up becoming
housebound, too. ``She was too ashamed to face anybody, so she
stayed inside all the time, just like our daughter,'' he said.

`AUNTIE' COMES UNDER FIRE   FOR SPURNING QUEEN MUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When the British Broadcasting Corp. announced last week
that it would not cover the July 19 pageant honoring the Queen
Mother on her 100th birthday, all hell broke loose.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives were apoplectic, saying the BBC's decision to snub
the Queen Mum, as the mother of Queen Elizabeth II is fondly known,
was proof that the network is a bastion of self-loathing Brits who
hate the monarchy and everything it stands for.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Tories said, it proved the BBC is run by a bunch of
left-wing, chablis-swigging, sushi-chomping liberals who are so
biased in favor of Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Labor Party
that the national broadcast service is undermining democracy.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the Tories, the BBC stands for Biased British
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   But before dismissing this as Tory hyperbole, one might note
that no less a thoughtful magazine than The Economist has compared
the BBC to a communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporation has a byzantine bureaucracy, an all-powerful
leader, and has long been in a state of permanent revolution,'' an
editorial opines. ``Most important, however, it has a creed _ that
public-service broadcasting must be funded by the taxpayer _ which
informs all its actions and which cannot publicly be questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tory assault on the BBC is part of a wider attack on
``Auntie,'' as the British refer to their nationally subsidized
network. Every household in Britain pays about $160 a year _ about
$4 billion overall _ for the privilege of watching costume dramas
and the Teletubbies. Part of the bargain includes some of the best
radio and television journalism in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the BBC is at a crossroads. Facing aggressive competition
from independent stations, which outbid ``the Beeb'' for popular US
imports like ``Friends'' and ``Frasier,'' and as digital and
satellite TV offer Britons unprecedented choice, the BBC has tried
to inject some energy and innovation into its sometimes stodgy
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Tories claim ``the Beeb'' is in Labor's pocket,
even some Labor stalwarts are turning up their noses at the BBC's
efforts to make itself less stuffy. Two weeks ago, Margaret
Beckett, a Labor member of Parliament, refused to go on the BBC's
premier public affairs show, ``Question Time,'' because Boy George
was a panelist.
</P>
<P>
   Boy George, the front man for 1980s pop group Culture Club,
accused Beckett of being a homophobic snob. Beckett replied that,
while tolerant of homosexuals, she was less so of the BBC going
down-market in search of ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the Queen Mum's parade, meanwhile, has led
many viewers to question just whose network this is, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the BBC provided live coverage of the opening of the
Tate Modern gallery, which houses modern art, deeming it one of the
most important cultural events in the nation's recent history.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many British people, Ron and Marge Dunbobbin say they
would rather watch a parade honoring the Queen Mum, whose
morale-boosting visits to victims of the Blitz made her a national
treasure 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the people who run the BBC think we'd rather watch a
bunch of rich celebrities talk about modern art, but I'll tell you,
most people want to see the Queen Mum,'' said Ron Dunbobbin, who,
with his wife, runs the Dryfesdale Hotel, a quaint hostelry in
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   With the BBC taking a pass on the Queen Mum's parade, ITV, the
rival independent commercial network, gladly scooped up the rights.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial stations have been running circles around the BBC of
late, outbidding it for the rights to broadcast soccer, which is
the closest thing to a national religion here. Des Lynam, the BBC's
longtime, unflappable chief sportscaster, went over to ITV.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the Tories, whose inability to mount serious opposition
to Blair is probably more of a threat to democracy than a bunch of
supposed limousine liberals at the Beeb. The Conservatives insist
that the BBC's choice of Andrew Marr as its political editor was
proof positive that the network is irredeemably biased.
</P>
<P>
   Marr, it seems, was once the editor of a liberal newspaper, The
Independent, and as a columnist has written opinion pieces that
have sometimes _ hold onto your hats _ endorsed Blair's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Right. Well. That proves it then, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   All right. Enough of that bother. Back to the great issues of
the day: When are the Teletubbies on again?
</P>

   DALLAS _ In a dimly lighted downtown hotel ballroom, pockets of
young men, lost in a sea of desktop computer workstations, are
blasting each other to virtual smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   The staccato click of computer keys lays low in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a player lets loose with a mock scream as his
on-screen character is being mowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Guys playing violent computer games? That's not news.
</P>
<P>
   The real story wears warm-ups and a company gimme hat, and is
moving quickly through the room, shaking hands and greeting the
players, many of whom know Angel Munoz personally.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz is haggard but happy. He was up until the wee hours doing
his own share of cyber-killing. It's noon now and, because this is
his party, he's making the rounds to ensure everything's going
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   History tells of breakthrough moments that set the world on its
ear, such as the day in 1928 when Sir Alexander Fleming discovered
that mold could be used as medicine, or in 1492, when Christopher
Columbus stumbled upon the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another one _ the day in June 1997 when Munoz, a Puerto
Rican immigrant and retired investment broker, figured out how to
make money off computer geeks doing what they do normally.
</P>
<P>
   And here's how he did it _ treat these computer jockeys, these
people of pallor, as athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz's creation was the Cyberathlete Professional League, a
prize-paying, official-rules-bearing competition. It's got
full-time players, such as Roy Sujoy, who plays under the name
Sujoy. He's a Cambridge-trained investment banker in his native
United Kingdom who now _ thanks to tournament winnings and
endorsements _ plays Quake III for a living.
</P>
<P>
   The league includes big-money events, such as the Razer/CPL
$100,000 championship, held here on a recent weekend at the Hyatt
Regency, where 512 gamers from around the world competed for the
top $40,000 prize, won after four days of on-screen fire fights by
Fatality, a.k.a. Johnathan Wendel, a 19-year-old from Kansas City
and another legend of computer gaming.
</P>
<P>
   When Fatality and Victor Cuadra, alias Makaveli, of Livermore,
Calif., blazed away at each other with lightning guns and other
implements of destruction in the tournament finals, it was a
legitimate event.
</P>
<P>
   Non-participating spectators, who paid $50 a head to get in,
mingled with eliminated players and watched the action from two
large, DiamondVision screens in another corner of the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators in the stands got the same view from the two screens
that each player saw. Those who didn't watch could shop at one of
the booths set up by event sponsors, who make everything from a
high-end gaming mouse to the heavily caffeinated drinks marathon
gamers favor.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz has a vision for this league, and it goes beyond
tournaments in hotels.

   ``Before CPL, all of the media attention went to game developers
and the games,'' Munoz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission ahead of the CPL is to have our events reviewed in
every sports section of every paper in the world,'' he says. ``We
want sports reporters and television crews to cover our events. We
want to be a mainstream sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These players are athletes, just as football or basketball
players are athletes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This flies in the face of the long held notion that computer
gamers are, for lack of a better word, geeks.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, the CPL could be considered the Ascension of the
Geek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been marginalized. We're been pariahs for a long time,''
says Edward Watson, CPL-Europe commissioner and owner of The
Playing Fields, a gaming center in London's West End. ``There are a
lot of people like us who want to come out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Although CPL players aren't necessarily quick of foot or
exceptionally strong, Munoz added, most of the best ones are
blessed with exceptional hand-eye coordination and quick reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sport is all about people competing in organized
competition,'' said Watson, who describes himself as a former
soccer fanatic, ``with defined rules and organized at a level like
this. That's when you have to start thinking about it as a sport.''
</P>
<P>
   That's evident here.
</P>
<P>
   At night, when the tourney is adjourned, contestants gather to
blast away at each other in impromptu matches. The wars rage all
night. By morning, the empty pizza boxes are stacked as high as a
mutant's eye.
</P>
<P>
   These are hardcore players. The speed of the action here could
induce motion sickness in nonplayers if they watched long enough.

   Take an early afternoon quarterfinal match between Sujoy and
GodfatherX, a.k.a. Justin Trubiana, an Austin, Texas, teen who, by
his own admission, was a long shot to get this far.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on a three-dimensional, multiroom and multilevel playing
field, the onscreen battle is waged in all directions, from all
angles and at eyeball-colliding speed for 15 full throttle minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sujoy, 24, the former British banker, polishes off Trubiana
18-12. They shake hands after its over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really satisfied with how that came out,'' Trubiana said,
in awe of the beating Sujoy handed him. ``I was walking around in a
fog most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Running high-stakes on-line shoot-em-ups wasn't how Munoz
envisioned his life.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, his parents moved him to their native
Puerto Rico when he was 8 years old to make sure he didn't lose
touch with his culture, the 40-year-old league owner says. He moved
back to the States in 1980 to study finance. His first jobs were in
Orlando and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz's career, which involved financing high-tech ventures,
took him to Dallas in 1987. He did so well with other people's
money that he retired at 35.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Doom.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad news, but rather the computer game, created by id
software of Mesquite, Texas. Considered the Big Kahuna of computer
gaming, it revolutionized the genre with its graphics and violence
and became a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Called a ``first person shooter'' in gaming industry jargon, the
object of the game is simple: Kill or be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz said he got hooked on playing Doom with Jeff Fox, a
onetime brokerage client and owner of Multimedia Learning, a Dallas
company that developed software package for Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz was restless.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in finance, you spend your time financing the
dreams of others,'' he said. ``I knew I wanted to create something.
I just didn't know what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   They came up with the Adrenaline Vault (adrenalinevault.com), a
site that rates, reviews and runs news about computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the news concerned LAN parties, named because computer
gamers would hook up makeshift local area networks, or LANs, to
play head-to-head games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the LAN parties,'' Munoz says. ``I saw the competition
that was going on. I felt there was something there.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to John Romero, a creator of Doom and Quake, it's heir
apparent on the gaming scene, and came up with an early idea for
the CPL.
</P>
<P>
   To compete with another league, the CPL hired star players, a
practice that it dropped pretty quickly. Instead, it focused on
large events, with the first held in Dallas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It drew 525 competitors, and the CPL was on its way.
</P>
<P>
   It now stages qualifying tournaments all over the world,
including some at The Playing Fields, a cafe/gaming center in
London's West End, owner Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   And to break the predominantly-male image the sport has, Munoz
is staging an all-women's tourney in Dallas in October.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz is aware of the link being drawn between games such as
Doom and Quake and school violence, and he won't have any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad society when we, as parents, are looking for
scapegoats,'' says Munoz, the father of two young children.
</P>
<P>
   Says Sujoy: ``Let's face it. This is a fantasy world. No one who
plays it thinks it's real. It's like kids playing cowboys and
Indians. No one takes this stuff seriously, right?''

   SCI-CANCER (New Orleans) _ Developments at the cancer
conference: Three new studies suggest that small doses of
antidepressants can help relieve hot flashes in cancer patients. By
Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MANDRILLS (Undated) _ Primatologists are discovering new and
exciting elements in the life of the mandrills of Gabon: they dwell
in vast colonies of females and offspring. A group of 800 mandrills
is a tightknit and stable society, traveling, foraging, breeding,
playing, nuzzling and bickering together year after year. And
except when females are in estrus, the males are solitary dwelling
creatures, who all but kill one another when the females are in
season. By Natalie Angier. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-RUSSIA-MIR (Undated) _ By some plans, it should have been
long dead. With most of its structure disintegrated by a fiery
reentry through the Earth's atmosphere, the remains of the giant
spacecraft should be resting on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
Instead, the Russian Mir space station remains in orbit, staffed by
two astronauts busily repairing worn components and readying it for
future visits. Previously abandoned, battered and showing all the
effects of its sometimes troubled 14 years in space, the Mir just
keeps going on and on. By Warren E. Leary. (1500 words)

   SCI-LYME-DEBATE (Undated) _ A furious debate rages among doctors
over the value of expensive antibiotics used to term Lyme disease.
So say nothing more can be done after the original treatments,
while others contend the rigid, expensive regimen may be needed for
months. Now members of Congress are determined to find out which
side is right and have ordered a Congressional investigation. By
Holcomb B. Noble. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT5,6.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLUORESCENT-MOLECULE (Undated) _ A glowing point at the tip
of an optical fiber could someday be the torch that lights the
world of DNA, proteins and other molecules. Writing in Nature,
researchers at the University of Konstanz in Germany report that
they had created a microscope that used a single fluorescent
molecule as its light source. Some scientists are calling it a
breakthrough in optical imaging. By Kenneth Chang. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE (Undated) _ In a culmination of concerted efforts
initiated by one determined family, three groups of researchers are
reporting that they have found the gene mutation that causes a rare
disorder known as pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Now that they have
identified the gene, they say, they can begin figuring out how it
contributes to disease, diagnose it prenatally, test for it in
people whose symptoms are ambiguous and look for ways to treat the
disease. By Gina Kolata. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DAEDALUS (Undated) _ An imaginative and irreverent English
scientist who writes under the pen name Daedalus has been tweaking
scientific orthodoxy in weekly columns for the last 36 years. A
self-described ``court jester in the Palace of Science,'' he is an
expert in chemical spectroscopy and other sober subjects, and since
1988 his column has been published weekly by the serious journal
Nature. But his research projects have sometimes flown wildly off
the track of mainstream science. One of his achievements was the
construction of a fraudulent perpetual motion machine. By Malcolm
Browne. (1525 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALBATROSS (Undated) _ Researchers in Massachusetts
unexpectedly discovered an albatross, whose internal compass had
gone haywire. But it was just one of several extraordinary bird
finds on Penikese. 1215 words w/photo.

nonexistent love life of bdelloids, the rediscovered asteroid
Albert and the missing comet K2. By Henry Fountain. (685 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MADCOW-DISEASE (Undated) _ Now, six years after young people
in Britain started dying from a human strain of mad cow disease,
scientists are still struggling to understand how the disease
spreads to humans, how many more will die from it and if a similar
epidemic could start in the United States spread by infected deer
and elk. While there are no firm answers, clues are being
discovered on an almost weekly basis as scientists explore the
nature of a mysterious infectious agent called the prion. By Sandra
Blakeslee. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BOWELS (Undated) _ An obsession with the bowels was more
than a mad moment in the history of medicine. It went on for a
century or more, and it is not over yet, according to a book
published in March, ``Inner Hygiene.'' The book is exhaustive and
scholarly, but it is also a merry chronicle. Constipation may be
common and unpleasant, but the notion that it is the root of every
illness is nonsense. The idea, however, had been around for
centuries, and it was truly embraced by doctors and the public in
the United States and Europe in the 1800s. It kept its hold on
medicine until well into the 20th century. By Denise Grady. (890
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEDICAL-CONSUMERISM (Undated) _ In quitting the United
States Senate race last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani discovered
that choosing a therapy for prostate cancer was a far more daunting
effort than he had expected. Giuliani said he had to focus entirely
on the decision, letting his immediate political future fall by the
wayside. Giuliani's difficulties spring largely from a radical
change in the relationship between patients and their doctors.
Americans have traded in paternalism for medical consumerism after
fighting for a greater voice in making critical decisions about
their care, and that has not come without cost. By Lawrence K.
Altman. (1125 words)

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: High-fiber
diets may not prevent cancer, as recent studies suggest. But they
have tons of other benefits. By Jane E. Brody. (790 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-WAGER (Undated) _ How many human genes are there?
Recent estimates have ranged from 60,000 to 140,000 and might be
expected to narrow sharply as the human genome nears completion. In
fact the range has widened, suggesting that gene-counting remains
at least as much art as science. Faced with estimates that are all
over the lot, genome scientists have contrived a simpler way of
settling the question, at least for the present. At a meeting this
month at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory they opened a sweepstake
for bets on the number of human genes. The winner will be chosen
based on the most likely number decreed at the same annual meeting
in 2003. By Nicholas Wade. (585 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ For children who need medical attention at a hospital, the
danger may not end when they are placed in an ambulance. A recent
study found by researches at Johns Hopkins Children's Center found
that it was not uncommon for patients and medical equipment to be
unsecured as ambulances sped them to the hospital. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing medical costs has become a major goal in the age of
managed care, but a new study finds that can be trickier to
accomplish than it may seem. Money saved at the hospital often is
spent for other care, including later hospitalizations. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A researcher warns people with pacemakers not to sleep with
magnets, but apparently they can safely be worn as long as they're
kept at least six inches away from the devices. (306 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers say that deaths from sudden infant death syndrome
could be cut back even further if doctors would merely tell their
new mothers to put the babies to bed on their backs. (265 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Through genetic engineering, scientists have bred a mouse that

UFO THEORISTS GAIN SUPPORT ABROAD, BUT REPRESSION AT HOME

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month's release of the first detailed satellite images of
Area 51, the top-secret US Air Force test site in Nevada, prompted
a Web site meltdown as people from across the nation logged on in
search of clues about unidentified flying objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest has been really phenomenal,'' said David
Mountain, marketing director for Aerial Images Inc., which posted
the high-resolution photographs of Area 51 on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But those hoping to see signs that captured UFOs are stored at
the site (as some aficionados have suggested) were destined to be
disappointed. Most of Area 51's operations occur underground,
making photos meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for fresh information on UFOs would have better
luck trying a new, but less publicized, source: a study by the
French military, just translated into an approved English edition.
</P>
<P>
   High-level officials _ including retired generals from the
French Institute of Higher Studies for National Defense, a
government-financed strategic planning agency _recently took a
giant step in openly challenging skepticism about UFOs.
</P>
<P>
   In a report based on a three-year study, they concluded that
``numerous manifestations observed by reliable witnesses could be
the work of craft of extraterrestrial origin'' and that, in fact,
the best explanation is ``the extraterrestrial hypothesis.''
Although not categorically proven, ``strong presumptions exist in
its favor and if it is correct, it is loaded with significant
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The French group reached that conclusion after examining nearly
500 international aeronautical sightings and radar/visual cases,
and previously undisclosed pilots' reports. They drew on data from
official sources, government authorities, and the air forces of
other countries. The findings are contained in a 90-page report
titled ``UFOs and Defense: What Should We Prepare For?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of sightings, which are completely unexplained
despite the abundance and quality of data from them, is growing
throughout the world,'' the team declared.
</P>
<P>
   The authors note that about 5 percent of sightings on which
there is solid documentation cannot be easily attributed to earthly
sources, such as secret military exercises. This 5 percent seem
``to be completely unknown flying machines with exceptional
performances that are guided by a natural or artificial
intelligence,'' they say. Science has developed plausible models
for travel from another solar system and for technology that could
be used to propel the vehicles, the report points out.
</P>
<P>
   It assures readers that UFOs have demonstrated no hostile acts,
``although intimidation maneuvers have been confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the widespread skepticism about UFOs, many will quickly
dismiss the generals' ``extraterrestrial hypothesis.'' But it is
less easy to do so once the authors' credentials are considered.
The study's originators are four-star General Bernard Norlain,
former commander of the French Tactical Air Force and military
counselor to the prime minister; General Denis Letty, an air force
fighter pilot; and Andre Lebeau, former head of the National Center
for Space Studies, the French equivalent of NASA.
</P>
<P>
   They formed a 12-member ``Committee for In-depth Studies,''
abbreviated as COMETA, which authored the report. Other
contributors included a three-star admiral, the national chief of
police, and the head of a government agency studying the subject,
as well as scientists and weapons engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the group stand by its findings, it is urging
international action. The writers recommend that France establish
``sectorial cooperation agreements with interested European and
foreign countries'' on the matter of UFOs. They suggest that the
European Union undertake diplomatic action with the United States
``exerting useful pressure to clarify this crucial issue which must
fall within the scope of political and strategic alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Why might the United States be interested _ albeit, privately _
in a subject often met with ridicule, or considered the domain of
the irrational?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, declassified US government documents show that
unexplained objects with extraordinary technical capabilities pose
challenges to military activity around the globe. For example, US
fighter jets have attempted to pursue UFOs, according to North
American Aerospace Defense Command logs and Air Force documents.
Iranian and Peruvian air force planes attempted to shoot down
unidentified craft in 1976 and 1980. Belgium F-16s armed with
missiles pursued a UFO in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the French report says that there have been ``visits
above secret installations and missile bases'' and ``military
aircraft shadowed'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Mitchell, the Apollo 14 astronaut who was the sixth man to
walk on the moon, is one of many supporters of international
cooperation on UFOs. Of the French report, he says, ``It's
significant that individuals of some standing in the government,
military, and intelligence community in France came forth with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who holds a doctorate from MIT in aeronautics and
astronautics, is convinced ``at a confidence level above 90
percent, that there is reality to all of this.'' He says, ``People
have been digging through the files and investigating for years
now. The files are quite convincing. The only thing that's lacking
is the official stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell joins five-star Admiral Lord Hill-Norton, the former
head of the British Ministry of Defense, in calling for
congressional fact-finding hearings into the UFO question.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress seems disinclined to pursue the matter, the
public's interest in UFOs is undiminished. A ballot initiative
underway in Missouri, certified by the secretary of state in March,
urges Congress to convene hearings. The initiative states that
``the Federal Government's handling of the UFO issue has
contributed to the public cynicism toward, and general mistrust of,
government.''
</P>
<P>
   US Naval Reserve Commander Willard H. Miller has long been
communicating this same concern to high level federal officials.
With over 30 years in Navy and joint interagency operations with
the Defense Department, Miller has participated in a series of
previously undisclosed briefings for Pentagon brass about military
policy regarding UFOs.
</P>
<P>
   Like many, Miller says he worries that the military's lack of
preparation for encounters with unexplained craft could provoke
dangerous confrontation when, and if, such an encounter occurs;
``precipitous military decisions,'' he warns, ``may lead to
unnecessary confusion, misapplication of forces, or possible
catastrophic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   And he says he is not alone in his concerns. ``There are those
in high places in the government who share a growing interest in
this subject,'' Miller reports.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the US military is concerned about UFOs, it is not saying so
publicly. Indeed, the French report chastises the United States for
what it calls an ``impressive repressive arsenal'' on the subject,
including a policy of disinformation and military regulations
prohibiting public disclosure of UFO sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Regulation 200-2, ``Unidentified Flying Objects
Reporting,'' for example, prohibits the release to the public and
the media of any data about ``those objects which are not
explainable.'' An even more restrictive procedure is outlined in
the Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication 146, which threatens to
prosecute anyone under its jurisdiction _ including pilots,
civilian agencies, merchant marine captains, and even some fishing
vessels _ for disclosing reports of sightings relevant to US
security.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers have been able to obtain some information
through the Freedom of Information Act, many UFO documents remain
classified.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier decades, issues that remain pertinent today were
openly discussed. In 1960, for example, US Representative Leonard
G. Wolf of Iowa entered an ``urgent warning'' from R. E.
Hillenkoetter, a former CIA director and Navy vice admiral, into
the Congressional Record that ``certain dangers are linked with
unidentified flying objects.'' Wolf cited General L. M. Chassin,
NATO coordinator of Allied Air Service, warning that ``If we
persist in refusing to recognize the existence of the UFOs, we will
end up, one fine day, by mistaking them for the guided missiles of
an enemy _ and the worst will be upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   These concerns were taken seriously enough to be incorporated
into the 1971 US-Soviet ``Agreement on Measures to Reduce the
Outbreak of Nuclear War.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The French report may open the door for nations to be more
forthcoming once again. Chile, for example, is openly addressing
its own concerns about air safety and UFOs. The now retired chief
of the Chilean Air Force has formed a committee with civil aviation
specialists to study recent near-collisions of UFOs and civilian
airliners.
</P>
<P>
   As the international conversation about UFOs unfolds, sightings
continue, as they have for decades. Perhaps the most notable recent
US sighting took place in March 1997. Hundreds of people across
Arizona reported seeing huge triangular objects, hovering silently
in the night sky _ a sighting that, as the state's US Senator John
McCain noted recently, has ``never been fully explained.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Jan. 5, four policemen at different locations in
St. Claire County, Illinois, witnessed a huge, brightly lighted,
triangular craft flying and hovering at 1,000 feet. One officer
reported witnessing extreme rapid motion by the craft that cannot
be explained in conventional terms. Nearby Scott Air Force base and
the Federal Aviation Administration purport to know nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department maintains it can find no information
acknowledging the existence of the triangular objects. In response
to a suit by curious Arizonans, it provided details of its search
to US District Court Judge Stephen M. McNamee of Phoenix. On March
30, McNamee concluded that ``a reasonable search was conducted''
even though no information was obtained, and he dismissed the case.

   There is one government agency in the country that has taken
steps to prepare for a UFO encounter. The Fire Officer's Guide to
Disaster Control, second edition _ used by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and taught at the seven universities offering
degrees in fire science _ warns of ``UFO hazards,'' such as
electrical fields that cause blackouts, force fields, and
physiological effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not stand under a UFO that is hovering at low altitudes,''
the book warns. ``Do not touch or attempt to touch a UFO that has
landed.''
</P>
<P>
   The text leaves little room for skepticism. John E. Mack,
professor of psychiatry at Harvard University and a Pulitzer
Prize-winning author, stopped being skeptical a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No culture from the beginning of time, no culture from
anywhere on the planet, has ever voided the idea of all other
intelligent life other than ourselves,'' he told a UFO conference
at the New York Hall of Science two weeks ago. ``That's
arrogance.''

ADDING UP THE BUDGET PLANS OF BUSH AND GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush wants a new missile-defense system,
prescription drug coverage, and the partial privatization of Social
Security. The price tag? Bush won't say, although it is clearly in
the hundreds of billions of dollars. And his campaign sees no
reason to come up with estimates until he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore wants to expand health coverage, eliminate the national
debt, while shoring up and expanding Social Security. How will he
pay for it? He makes a $130 billion assumption that the next
Congress would adopt his plan to increase cigarette taxes and cut
``corporate loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the beginning of the budget brinksmanship that has
become a backdrop of Campaign 2000. Over 10 years, there is much to
differentiate between budget proposals: at least $1 trillion _ yes,
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no more important difference between the
candidates. Their competing plans will directly affect everything
from drug coverage to retirement money to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, each candidate has blasted the other about the
budget, claiming the opponent's campaign promises would devour the
surplus and put the country back into deficit spending. But an
examination of promises being made by Bush and Gore seems to show
that both are relying on questionable assumptions. And both have
failed to put a price on major proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Like players in a monumental game of Monopoly, Bush and Gore
have passed ``Go'' as the all-but-certain nominees of their
parties, and they must decide how they would spend or allocate the
huge federal surplus that is projected over the next decade. There
is no precedent for such a generous starting point for a US
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months before the next president takes office, Bush and
Gore have plans to spend nearly all the surplus, and perhaps much
more. And it is far from clear whether the candidates are
allocating enough money to pay off the national debt and save
Social Security, as both say they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have been notably vague about cutting programs,
normally a top topic in a presidential campaign. Bush, for example,
has declined for months to release a list of programs he would
eliminate, although aides said the governor still intends to follow
through on his promise to end what Bush considers wasteful
spending.
</P>
<P>
   In a war of policy papers and press releases, the Gore campaign
says Bush would have to cut spending by 40 percent to pay for his
proposals. The Bush campaign responds that Gore has proposed more
than twice as much spending as he has acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   So who's right? That depends on whose budget assumptions are to
be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Two forecasters at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI said the budget plans
of both Bush and Gore should be viewed with skepticism. The
analysts, Cynthia Latta and Ezra Greenberg, said in a joint
interview that Gore's economic assumptions are too pessimistic, but
also said Bush's promise of huge tax cuts is too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both talking in excesses in order to make their
political points,'' Latta said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said: ``In the end, they will end up doing things that
are much more similar than they are now professing.'' Greenberg
said, for example, that Bush probably would get through Congress
only about half of the tax cuts he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say it is hard to know whom to believe. Few if any
analysts believed in the 1996 campaign that the US budget deficit
would vanish, and an enormous surplus would result, yet that is
what happened. So any economic prediction made during this campaign
may be justifiably suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the candidate with the rosier scenario in this campaign.
He predicts a $1.8 trillion surplus over the next 10 years, not
counting Social Security funds. He says that would leave enough
money for his tax cut and for his plan to allow younger workers to
put part of their Social Security payments into private investment
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, despite having been in office during a period of
extraordinary economic growth, has a less sanguine view of the
future. He says slower economic growth will result in a much
smaller surplus, $746 billion over 10 years. But he pads that
surplus with $130 billion in revenues from a new 25-cent-a-pack
cigarette tax and the elimination of mostly unspecified corporate
loopholes. This may be a questionable addition, given a lack of
congressional inclination for such measures.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gore does not count his own initiatives for education
and military pay. These measures would cost $250 billion. Gore
aides explained the omission by saying the money has been accounted
for in the last Clinton budget, in what is known as the ``budget
baseline.'' Bush aides, however, said Gore is using a gimmick to
make his budget proposals look smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns agree that Bush and Gore are at least $1 trillion
apart on how much extra money will be available to spend in the
coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign just invented $1 trillion because they
needed it,'' said a Gore adviser, Elaine Kamarck. She said Bush has
adopted a higher growth estimate to make his budget plan appear in
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides, however, said they are being cautious and cannot
understand why Gore thinks growth will be so slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore plan is essentially a status-quo, do-nothing kind of
plan: continue to sock away the surpluses and pay down the debt,
take no chances,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the
conservative National Center for Policy Analysis, which favors the
Bush program.
</P>
<P>
   Even some moderate Democrats say Gore is being too cautious.
Some leaders of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, such as
Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, have expressed dismay that Bush
has been quicker to endorse their ideas on Social Security and
Medicare than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates want tax cuts, but the similarity stops there.
Bush plans tax cuts totaling $1.3 trillion over 10 years, including
a reduction of the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33
percent, cuts in tax rates for middle- and lower- income taxpayers,
and elimination of the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says Bush's tax plan would in fact cost $2.3 trillion, thus
busting the budget; Bush says Gore's critique is based on
inaccurate forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's tax-cut plan would be much smaller, $250 billion over 10
years, with most of it benefiting lower- and middle-income people,
according to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from Bush's tax cut, the governor has remained vague
about the cost of some of his most expensive proposals, such as his
missile-defense system or his Social Security plan. Aides said Bush
made that decision after watching Gore unleash a torrent of
criticism against Bill Bradley's health-care proposal in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says Bush's Social Security plan would cost $1 trillion
more in transition costs than Bush has suggested. The Congressional
Budget Office says that the missile-defense system proposed by the
Pentagon would cost $60 billion, and that Bush's still-unspecified
version may cost much more.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, asked how Bush could
claim to be within the budget without including Social Security and
missile defense, responded: ``We have internal estimates for what
they are. We are comfortable with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey refused to make those estimates public.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hardly alone in refusing to say how much some of his
major proposals would cost. During the primary season, Gore
indicated that he wanted to provide universal health care coverage,
like Bradley, but that he didn't commit to any time frame. Instead,
Gore says, he wants to achieve his initial goal of providing all
children with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore goes much further than Bush in outlining other health care
programs and their costs. For example, Gore proposes spending $432
billion on Medicare, including $300 billion to extend the solvency
of the Medicare Trust Fund until at least 2027.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Gore wants to spend $98 billion to increase health
care coverage, mainly for children. Bush has not announced the
details of his health care proposal, making it impossible to
estimate costs.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore blasts Bush's Social Security proposal as a ``risky
scheme,'' his plan has received little scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   First, the vice president wants to spend an extra $100 billion
to expand Social Security benefits for certain women, especially
widows.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more significantly, Gore wants to use the budget
surplus to pay off the debt. But Gore does not mean using the
regular budget surplus, as some observers have assumed. Instead,
Gore wants to use 95 percent of the Social Security surplus to pay
off the $3.5 trillion national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complicated plan that essentially would be a massive
fund swap: Use the Social Security surplus to pay off the national
debt, and then, once the debt is paid off, use the money normally
set aside to pay off the debt to bolster Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not been critical of this maneuver, apparently because
he is considering a similar, though much smaller, plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not pledged to eliminate the national debt, and an aide
said no one in the campaign could say how much of the debt would be
reduced.

CORNING TO BUY REST OF INTELLISENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, prices in final 3 grafs do not reflect market close)  
 By JUSTIN DINI   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fiber optics giant Corning (GLW:NYSE) said it will acquire the
67 percent of closely held IntelliSense it doesn't already own for
some $500 million in Corning stock, one of three deals in the
high-tech space unveiled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, semiconductor maker LSI Logic (LSI:NYSE) said it
would buy privately held DataPath Systems, a Los Gatos,
Calif.-based maker of chips for communications applications, in an
all-stock deal valued at $420 million. And Sunnyvale, Calif.-based
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD:NYSE) said it would sell 90 percent of
its communications products unit to Silicon Valley-based tech
buyout firm Francisco Partners for about $375 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, the Corning, N.Y.-based company which acquired its
initial stake in Wilmington, Mass.-based IntelliSense in June, said
IntelliSense will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary when the
deal closes, which is expected some time in the second quarter. A
big chunk of the purchase price will be recorded as goodwill and
intangible assets that are expected to be amortized over periods of
five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Milpitas, Calif.-based LSI, meanwhile, said its acquisition of
DataPath ``will immediately bolsters LSI Logic's portfolio of
communications standard products as well as its library of
communications-specific building blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD, the second-biggest chip maker after Intel (INTC:Nasdaq),
will retain a 10 percent stake in the unit, with a warrant to
acquire approximately an additional 10 percent. The companies
anticipate completing the transaction in the third quarter. After
it closes, AMD will provide wafer fabrication, manufacturing and
related services to the new company under multi-year service
agreements. Financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   AMD shares fell 5 5/8, or 7 percent, to 78 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Corning shares declined 6 3/16, or 3 percent, to 176 1/4 in
midday trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   LSI shares fell 2 3/4, or 6 percent, to 43 1/2 in midday
trading.

THE CHILD-FREE   EXERT THEIR RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years they've glowered as colleagues have come to work late,
left early, or begged off on weekend or holiday assignments because
of their children.
</P>
<P>
   They've gritted their teeth as companies have offered
increasingly generous benefits for co-workers with children but
done little for them.
</P>
<P>
   They've grimaced as oblivious parents have let unruly little
terrors run wild through restaurants and museums, or lugged fussing
newborns into the quiet sanctity of the movies.
</P>
<P>
   And they've groaned as politicians and companies have engaged in
a schmaltzy pedo-pander to pitch policies or products.
</P>
<P>
   Now, aided by the Internet and a cogent new book that seems
destined to become their bible, they are starting to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   It's the revolt of the ``child-free,'' coming soon to a
workplace or neighborhood _ Boston now has its own No Kidding!
chapter _ near you.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between parents and nonparents has become palpable
enough that in March, ABC-TV's ``20/20'' devoted a segment to the
growing sense of grievance nursed by those without children. And
recent episodes of ``The Drew Carey Show'' and ``Ally McBeal'' have
sounded the same theme.
</P>
<P>
   Still more backlash than genuine movement, the child-free, as
those who have chosen not to have children call themselves, have as
their manifesto ``The Baby Boon: How Family-Friendly America Cheats
the Childless.'' Elinor Burkett's new book contends that both
government and corporate policies heap benefits on those with
children while slighting those without.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett sees a demographic double standard at play, for though
there is a baby boomlet underway in America, a significant part of
the population _ as much as 20 percent of female baby boomers, she
says _ are childless by choice.
</P>
<P>
   But while politicians pander to parents, they ignore those who
have opted off the procreation path, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, the United States has thrown itself into a
family frenzy, offering tax credits, workplace entitlements, and
other benefits to parents,'' Burkett says. For an old liberal like
herself, she says, the inequity is doubly bothersome because so
much of the benefit of Clinton-era ``family-friendly'' policy goes
not to the needy but to well-to-do middle-class families.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she offers the example of a suburban Boston couple
with a six-digit income who can nevertheless claim a $1,000 yearly
tax credit ($500 for each child), a $960 tax credit for child care,
and a $1,500 tax credit because one daughter is in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me and other childless people feel as though we are
being asked to subsidize the child-rearing of already comfortable
people,'' Burkett said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the workplace, companies that offer subsidized child care,
pregnancy and parenting leave, or other aid or special treatment
for those with children are conferring benefits on parents in a way
that offends the child-free, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have companies that provide benefits packages to
parents that are worth five, ten, even $15,000 more than those
designed for nonparents, making a mockery of the concept of equal
compensation,'' she avers.
</P>
<P>
   One example she cites is Marriott Corp., which offers more
generous subsidies for family health care plans than for single
plans and subsidizes child care to the tune of $5,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if Joe Smith and I do the same job, but he has two kids in
day care and a medical plan that covers his whole family, his
compensation is probably worth about $13,000 more than mine,'' says
Burkett, who calls for tax and workplace policies that are more
nearly child-neutral.
</P>
<P>
   That means targeting government tax subsidies or benefits to
those who truly need them and ensuring that workplace benefits for
parents are matched by benefits for the child-free. Burkett
suggests a fixed sum that employees can allocate among benefits
they choose, from childcare to health insurance to 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   One corporate role model, Burkett says, should be Eastman Kodak,
which, for example, has transformed maternity or paternity leave
into ``personal unique opportunity leave'' for which any employee
can apply.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's call for child neutrality in the workplace is
forcefully seconded by Scott Wenzel, a federal employee and
activist in the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we see over and over is that parents either formally
or informally have leeway to take time off from the workplace to
attend to the needs of their children, whereas people without
children who have pressing personal issues they need to address may
not have the same latitude,'' Wenzel says.
</P>
<P>
   He would prefer to see parenthood removed altogether as a
consideration from the workplace. Whether someone has a child, he
says, should have no more weight with a boss than if he or she owns
a boat. But absent that, Wenzel says, ``If a subsidy is made for
one subset of the workplace, something else should be done for the
people who cannot take advantage of that benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk is distressing indeed to parenting groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Ann Hewlett, chairman of the National Parenting
Association, says the childless should realize they too have an
interest in the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are 100 percent of the future and we are all
stakeholders in their future because they are the folks who will be
paying our Social Security,'' Hewlett says. She goes even further:
``If you are a childless adult you are kind of a free rider on the
effort of raising children.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, in turn, is just the kind of rhetoric that makes the
child-free fairly bristle with indignation. ``There is a dramatic
sanctimoniousness about having children,'' says Ilene Bilenky, a
Boston psychiatric nurse and freelance copy editor. ``I don't think
anybody really says, `We had better have children because the
Social Security system is tottering.' ''
</P>
<P>
   To Bilenky and others without children, a change in societal
attitude is long overdue. She's especially exasperated with
suggestions that people who choose not to have children have
somehow made a selfish decision. To her, it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I hear from people who want kids are selfish: `I
want somebody to carry on the name,' `I want someone to call me
Mommy,' or the classic, `I want someone to take care of me when I'm
old,' '' Bilenky says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just an underlying assumption that for women, if you
don't get married and have children, it is because you weren't able
to,'' says Jan VanDenBerg, a Somerville real estate developer. ``Or
that you are this shrew who doesn't want to give to other people.
It is so ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others would just like a child-saturated culture to grow
up a bit. Finding a social milieu where conversation extends beyond
babies, tots, and toddlers is the reason Jerry Steinberg started No
Kidding! in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1984. He had no idea
how many shared his views until 1995, when No Kidding! went online.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first 11 or 12 years, it was Vancouver standing
alone,'' Steinberg says. ``Then we got a Web site, and people
discovered us and it has just been phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   His organization now claims 45 chapters in Canada and the United
States. Most, like the one in Boston, host regular social events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so we can get together with people . . . where you don't
have to listen to diaper stories and breast-feeding stories and my
school has this problem, my minivan has that problem,'' says Lori
Copeland, a Boston paralegal.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the Internet that has helped the child-free find one
another, cyberspace has also given them a place to express their
frustrations. At Brats, a Web site that bills itself as ``a place
for you to vent,'' and on Alt.Support.Childfree Moderated pages,
the child-free regularly do just that. The postings there range
from mild peeves to vitriolic rants.
</P>
<P>
   The need to acquire, or preserve, a little child-free societal
space is one constant of the complaints from those without kids. If
restaurants can have smoking and nonsmoking, why not children and
nonchildren sections? After all, is there anyone who wouldn't
rather sit next to the US Olympic Chain-Smoking Team than to a
leather-lunged little reprobate who screams at a glass-shattering
pitch throughout dinner?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Burkett says nothing in her book has aroused as much ire as
the notion of child-free sections of restaurants and child-free
hours at supermarkets or health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get furious at the suggestion,'' she says. ``It just
seems to be such an easy and noncontroversial compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to Hewlett, who believes it is the nonparents, not the
parents, who should strive to be more understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went through the effort of imagination to put yourself
in the place of those parents who go out to eat once in a blue moon
. . . I think maybe you would try a little harder to be
accommodating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   If the child-free were not, they would quickly realize this
country is nowhere near as family friendly as they think, Hewlett
maintains. And it is true that other cultures are more
accommodating, either in offering more generous social policies or
in acquiescing to an even greater level of public brattiness.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, most countries make much more generous provisions for
child care, offer universal health care, and maintain free or
nearly free universities, says Edward Wolff, a professor of
economics at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``So compared to Europe, we are light-years behind in terms of
our support services,'' Wolff says.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel and Burkett remain unmoved, noting that those countries
also pay taxes far in excess of what is politically palatable here.
Instead of pointing to Europe, Wenzel says, parents would do better
to look to US traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to remember,'' he says, ``that costs of raising
children are the obligations of the people who chose to bear the
children: the parents.''

TWO BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS DEALS ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, prices in final 2 grafs do not reflect the market close)  
 By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business communications software makers, among the most highly
publicized and eagerly sought stock offerings of the past year,
came together in two billion-dollar deals Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vignette (VIGN:Nasdaq), of Austin, Texas, offered stock it
valued at $1.7 billion for San Ramon, Calif.-based OnDisplay
(ONDS:Nasdaq). And Fairfax, Va. -based webMethods (WEBM:Nasdaq)
said it would buy Active Software (ASWX:) of Santa, Clara, Calif.,
for stock valued at $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   All four companies market software to the business-to-business
sector. None has turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past year or more, a flood of new companies have
emerged to help meet the challenge of e-commerce deployment,'' said
Drew Brousseau, analyst for S.G. Cowen Securities. ``You're seeing
the early stages of what will inevitably be a convergence in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   S.G. Cowen rates Vignette strong buy and OnDisplay, for which it
co-managed an initial public offering, buy. The firm does not cover
webMethods or Active Software.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted negatively to the proposed acquisitions, as
the stocks of Vignette and webMethods, the two acquirers, fell very
sharply, reducing the values of the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of its deal, Vignette will issue 1.58 shares for
each OnDisplay share. The former says it makes ``e-business
application software products and services;'' the latter
``e-business infrastructure software applications for powering
e-business portals and e-marketplaces.'' The combined companies
will employ 2,000.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It has been nearly a year since Susan Darke's husband
died while participating in a gene transfer experiment at St.
Elizabeth's Medical Center. Tears fill her eyes as she wonders how
a 59-year-old man, robust despite serious heart trouble, could
expire just hours after the surgery they had hoped would allow him
a fuller life.
</P>
<P>
   Why, she asks, didn't Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner, the doctor
overseeing the clinical trial, tell patients that both he and the
hospital had a financial stake in the outcome of the experiment?
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't they tell her that a less invasive means of gene
transfer into the heart was about to be tested?
</P>
<P>
   And why was it only after she explicitly asked that they told
her that another participant had died in a similar trial at the
hospital?
</P>
<P>
   Her questions zero in on troubling issues in human
experimentation as growing numbers of doctors double as
entrepreneurs, valued by medical institutions as much for their
talent in attracting research money and private investors as their
ability to heal patients.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a national review of gene therapy experiments in the wake
of a young patient's death and other problems, Isner's experiments
were halted in February. The Food and Drug Administration and a
branch of the National Institutes of Health are investigating.
Isner, who the president of St. Elizabeth's calls ``the Pedro
Martinez of our research staff,'' acknowledged some lapses in an
interview last week with the Globe and in a written response to the
FDA. But Isner, along with hospital officials and executives of the
company they formed to eventually market gene therapy, say the
health and safety of patients have always been their primary
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, an examination unveils other issues: --In addition to Roger
J. Darke, five other patients have died in gene transfer studies in
other cities that are sponsored by Isner's company, Vascular
Genetics Inc., according to company officials. They say these
deaths were properly reported to federal agencies and were
unrelated to gene therapy. But they have not previously been
reported publicly. The five were in studies testing whether a gene
could stimulate growth of new blood vessels in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   --While Isner contends the gene therapy was not the cause,
records obtained by the Globe show that both heart patients who
died in Isner's experiments at St. Elizabeth's suffered cardiac
arrest within days of the chest surgery and gene injection. Darke,
of Peabody, died within a day of the surgery. Mary E. Lucier of
Milford lingered _ often in a coma-like state _ for nearly four
months. The two deaths came among 45 chronically ill patients
treated in similar protocols at St. Elizabeth's.
</P>
<P>
   A National Institutes of Health committee that reviewed the
protocol in 1998 asked whether the risk of surgery for Isner's
patients outweighed the potential benefit _ a question the families
are left to ponder. Isner had begun the trial in which Lucier died
before that committee could review it, a move that was allowed but
has since led to stricter rules. The NIH panel has recommended
restricting enrollment to extremely sick patients, and Isner said
he has.
</P>
<P>
   --A major investor in Vascular Genetics, the contract research
group Cato Holding, was overseeing the safety of trials involving
103 patients at 11 sites across the country. In an attempt to win
FDA permission to restart the trials, Vascular Genetics last month
hired an independent company to audit them.
</P>
<P>
   --Vascular Genetics is in a race with at least two other
biotechnology companies to develop the first gene therapy product
for heart disease. The reward is ``a billion-dollar-plus market,''
according to company president John Cumming.
</P>
<P>
   --Isner and St. Elizabeth's refuse to disclose their stakes in
Vascular Genetics, a privately held company, but together they
apparently own nearly 25 percent, according to information obtained
by the Globe. The hospital says this does not bias the research,
but others are worried about the potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could he be unbiased when he stands to profit?'' asked
Deborah Grayson, one of Roger Darke's four daughters, who, along
with her mother, spoke publicly for the first time since her
father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knows me and knows the institution knows that we've
always been about patients and research,'' Isner, a 52-year-old
cardiologist, responded last week. ``We certainly are not about to
allow anything to happen that is going to tarnish that
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Isner, chief of the 40-person cardiovascular research staff at
St. Elizabeth's, took the early lead nationally in testing gene
therapy for the heart. The experiments so far have been testing the
safety of injecting the gene that makes vascular endothelial growth
factor into patients' hearts in an attempt to grow new blood
vessels to bypass those blocked by heart disease. He has also been
testing the gene in patients with severe circulatory problems in
their legs. To be accepted into Isner's trials, the patients had to
have severe problems that could no longer be managed well with
medicine or normal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Isner's group trumpeted its preliminary results:
Several patients felt their chest pain had eased, and tests
suggested that more blood was reaching the heart muscle. Other
scientists note, however, that tests against a placebo are needed
before any firm conclusions can be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The two deaths in the St. Elizabeth's trials came after
injection of the gene into the beating heart through a 3-inch
incision in the chest. Isner has since begun using another method
that avoids chest surgery _ injection via a catheter inserted into
the heart through a vein in the groin.
</P>
<P>
   Isner says deaths in such trials are not unexpected because of
the patients' illness, and he maintains that none was related to
the gene therapy itself. However, ``the stress of surgery and
anethesiology might have contributed to their deaths,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 people nationally have participated in 372 gene
transfer protocols since 1989, according to the NIH. Only one death
_ in Pennsylvania _ has definitively been attributed to gene
therapy. However, more than 1,500 severe problems have been
reported to the NIH from January 1999 through February of this
year, including at least dozens of deaths. And researchers
acknowledge that 9 percent of the problems are ``unexpected and
possibly related'' to gene therapy. Despite Globe requests, neither
St. Elizabeth's nor Vascular Genetics would disclose the total
number of complications that have occurred in their trials.
</P>
<P>
   In Vascular Genetics' leg artery experiments, two participants
died last fall _ one who got gene therapy at the Cleveland Clinic
and one who was treated at University Hospital in Bern,
Switzerland. Two more deaths were reported at the Durham (Va.)
Medical Center and one at the Scripps Clinic in San Diego. Company
officials said none was due to the genes.
</P>
<P>
   The total is ``significantly lower than what the mortality is
for that patient population as a whole,'' said Cumming, of Vascular
Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   For the families of the two dead Massachusetts subjects, who
were identified by the Globe through death records, the news about
Isner's financial interest and other deaths around the country have
given them pause. While both patients gave their permission for the
procedure knowing it carried risk, their families say they believed
it was a treatment rather than an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Mary E. Lucier, who died at age 71 in October 1998, had her
first heart attack at age 48, followed by three bypass operations
and angioplasty. ``This was her last hope,'' said her daughter, Jan
Stallone of Milford. Stallone said Isner gave Lucier excellent care
during her lingering decline at the hospital. Nonetheless, she is
unsettled that Isner did not report the death properly to the
hospital's human subjects committee and autopsied her mother's
heart himself instead of allowing an objective review.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are desperate for something to give you back a
quality of life, you are so vulnerable,'' said Susan Darke, whose
husband of 35 years had worked daily as an electrical engineer
despite quadruple bypass surgery in 1993. ``I thought he was a
patient, but he was a research subject. We weren't informed (of the
risks) to the degree we should have been and with a third party
present with nothing to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Isner defended the hospital's informed consent procedure, adding
that he told patients not to consider the experiment as therapy.
But in the future, the hospital plans to disclose in writing to all
participants any illnesses or deaths in previous trials at the
hospital as well as the hospital's and doctor's financial interest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the hospital said it has imposed tougher reporting
rules, after Isner and the company failed to report some of the
deaths promptly to two watchdog agencies. They did report them
quickly to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's president, Michael F. Collins, took
responsibility last week for the lapses in reporting and procedure
and stood behind Isner, emphasizing the importance of both the
doctor and gene therapy to the institution. ``Jeff Isner has
brought together an outstanding team,'' he said. Like Red Sox
pitcher Pedro Martinez, to whom Collins compared his superstar,
Isner exudes confidence and enjoys publicity. But some suggest
managing superstars can create problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some hospitals are reluctant to erect what may be perceived as
bureaucratic hurdles in the path of people who are bringing
significant research dollars and visibility to the institution,''
said Joan Rachlin, executive director of Public Responsibility in
Medicine and Research.
</P>
<P>
   Isner has helped give national stature to St. Elizabeth's, a
400-bed hospital affiliated with Tufts University School of
Medicine. Since his arrival in 1988 from New England Medical
Center, where he was associate director of the cardiac
catheterization lab, he has helped catapult the hospital to a rank
of 31st nationally in NIH grants.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital rewarded Isner with a $200,000 salary in 1998, the
last year for which such data are public. (He and his wife own a
12-room home on 1.8 acres in Weston, plus two homes in Mashpee.)
The hospital invested more than $10 million in Isner's gene work
beginning in 1994, and owns several patents resulting from his
work.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to interest any existing pharmaceutical companies in
sponsoring Isner's work, in November 1997, the hospital joined with
Isner, Human Genome Sciences, and Cato Holding Co. to form Vascular
Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Cumming said it cost ``millions of dollars'' to launch the
company, but would not detail the shares. Hospital officials said
St. Elizabeth's now owns less than 10 percent. Isner's share, 20
percent at the outset, has been reduced somewhat, hospital
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Cumming said he does not believe that Isner's financial interest
influenced the trial or harmed patients. ``We think our program is
safe,'' he said. ``He's going to honestly and ethically follow
protocols.'' But he acknowledged that the stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 60 million Americans suffer from cardiovascular
disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Therapy
that has the potential to delay the need for angioplasty or bypass
surgery would be very lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   GenVec Inc., a Maryland company, and Collateral Therapeutics of
San Diego are competing with Vascular Genetics to develop gene
therapy for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive pressure is generating concern among some
doctors and ethicists that an investigator's financial interest
could lead him to bias the outcome of a study _ even
unintentionally _ by withholding poor results or enrolling
inappropriate patients.
</P>
<P>
   The potential conflicts are not peculiar to St. Elizabeth's.
``Not only is financial interest common, it is the modus operandi
in this industry,'' said Charles Henderson, editor-in-chief of Gene
Therapy Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Haavi Morreim, a professor at University of Tennessee Medical
School in Memphis who studies financial aspects of research, said,
``I don't think there are villains greedily promoting their own
profits. Mostly it's very good people who have or think they have a
wonderful idea to help people and do not appreciate the level of
conflict in which they're doing their work. (They have) such
enthusiasm for the project that it obscures some of the price that
the patient might pay.''

FOUNDER OF HERBALIFE DEAD AT 44 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, stock price does not reflect market close)  
 By JENNIFER FRIEDLIN   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbalife International (HERBA:NASDAQ) said Monday that its
chairman and chief executive, Mark Reynolds Hughes, died on Sunday
in his sleep at his home in Malibu, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said the
case had been turned over to the Los Angeles Coroner's office,
adding that Hughes' death appeared to be the result of natural
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who was 44, founded Herbalife, a maker of nutritional
and weight-loss products, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based company said that it would continue to
operate according to ``the spirit and vitality'' of Hughes' vision.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Herbalife announced that Hughes had shelved a plan to
buy out the company. He had offered to buy Herbalife in September
through a company he set up, MH Millennium Acquisition Corp., for
$510 million, or $17 a share, but then canceled the deal after
failing to arrange financing.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said at the time that he was making the offer because he
was unhappy about the company's sagging stock price. When the bid
was made, Herbalife's stock jumped 26 percent, to about 15. It
tumbled after the canceled bid and was trading down 1 1/4, or 13
percent, at 8 5/8 around midday Monday after hitting a 52-week low
of 8 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A company representative would not comment on Herbalife's
current plans, saying only that company executives were ``moving
forward with their current strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Internet homepage said Hughes decided to found
Herbalife after his mother's death from an accidental overdose of
prescription diet pills when he was 18.

MOTHERKIND 
By Jayne Anne Phillips. Knopf. 292 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world of heat and shadows depicted in Jayne Anne Phillips's
fiction is a high-risk place of close-focus intensity _ a universe
rendered, then made bearable, by the brick and mortar of language.
Her early works offered breathtaking heights of alienation: The
chameleonic, hipster voices of the stories in ``Black Tickets''
contained a trance-like ferocity Raymond Carver might have envied,
while ``Machine Dreams,'' her first novel, delivered the fractured
cruelties of the Vietnam age through its intimate, first-person
narrators, all of them on shifting sands. Hers is a language-laden
domain of both precision and nuance; ``Shelter,'' her most recent
novel, managed to convey a murderous story through the prismatic
lens of girlhood memories. In ``MotherKind,'' she has turned this
interior vision onto a year of birth and death _ both primordial
states that promise to strip away everything but the fire within.
</P>
<P>
   It's a crash course in the essential mysteries, in other words,
and one that seems in keeping with Phillips's affinity for the
white-hot center. But ``MotherKind'' is altogether different from
her previous fiction: softer, slower, less reliant upon either
external travails or mutable perspectives. In focusing on the story
of a new mother named Kate; her physician husband, Matt, and his
two sons; and the impending death of her mother from lung cancer,
Phillips has constructed a world of thick description _ of layered
emotion, cottony insularity, odyssean walks to the corner and back.
And while this subject matter has its obvious precedents, from
Proustian sweets to Mrs. Dalloway's perfect flowers, it requires a
particularity of depth and higher meaning that few writers can
accomplish. Phillips does so only erratically: There are moments of
great emotion in ``MotherKind,'' beautiful passages that convey the
woozy, secret center of early motherhood or the final symphonic
chords of loss. But far too much in between is simply concerned
with the detritus of waiting, without benefit of the exalted
language or symbolism that could contain it.
</P>
<P>
   We know from the outset what the stakes are here: ``one ending,
with variations,'' as Kate thinks, closing in on her mother's
death. When the novel opens, Kate, a 31-year-old editor and poet,
is pregnant; she is flying to her mother's small Appalachian town,
where Katherine Tatemen, at only 59, has been given a year to live.
Through several brief, retrospective narratives, we see the months
and events leading up to Kate's taking her mother to live with her
in Boston: Katherine's diagnosis, Kate's return from a solo
pilgrimage in Katmandu, the mother's happy acceptance of her
daughter's pregnancy, which precedes Kate's marriage to Matt by
several months. By the time Katherine has moved into Matt and
Kate's house, hoping that chemotherapy will give her the extra
months to get to know her grandson, we have a deepening sense of
the profound bond between the two women: universal in its
mother-daughter themes, particular in its kindness and empathic
reach.
</P>
<P>
   But if death is a main character from the beginning of
``MotherKind,'' that inexorable silhouette still leaves room for
the exuberance of the infant Alexander: his first minnow flutter in
Kate's womb; his ubiquitous demands, suggesting a perfect blend of
tyranny and innocence. Struggling to stay alive, Katherine caresses
her grandson, clings to her ancient poodle who is also staving off
death, watches Kate marry Matt amid magician's doves and a backyard
garden of eternal hope. And Kate moves ceaselessly from one
interior space to another, cradle to sickroom, in the middle of the
night _ exchanging a nursing child or a breast pump for the spoon
that measures her mother's morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Those crashing sounds you hear in the hallways, disrupting this
eternal arc, belong to Sam and Jonah, Matt's boys from a
just-finished marriage _ two unstoppable, typical dervishes of 8
and 6 who provide the only truly unpredictable action of
``MotherKind.'' One of the best scenes in the novel involves
Jonah's floating out to sea in an inflatable rowboat _ and yet even
this passage, frighteningly evoked, is stopped short, then
delivered by characters' recall and dialogue a few weeks later.
That circumspection suggests some of the problem with the novel.
There is a tentativeness to Phillips's writing here that is
unfamiliar; seeking to navigate the murky shoals of Kate's year of
firsts-and-lasts, her prose is too often cautious instead of
careful, lethargic or numbingly detailed rather than deliberate.
It's one thing to capture with elegant concision the contents of a
dying woman's medicine table; it's another entirely to belabor the
design shortcomings of a baby's windup swing.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ``MotherKind'' contains occasional cloudbursts of
emotion that are masterful as well as moving, from Kate's discovery
of a new mother's loss of self to her terrifying glimpse at ``the
free fall of time'' that she must now witness at such an
accelerated pace. Katherine, of course, has an intrepid presence in
this story that will begin and end in twilight; it is here, in the
power shift between mother and daughter, that death exacts, where
the novel achieves a finely rendered luminescence of grief.
</P>
<P>
   Its arrow aimed toward the nameless territory we call home,
``MotherKind'' charts its passage by the changing of seasons: the
stifling timelessness of an urban summer, the treacherous allure of
New England in its winter cave. Testifying in all its transient
sadness to the tenuousness of things _ to the death of loved ones,
the relentless losses and paybacks of the past _ it stands instead,
in its best moments, as a tribute to endurance. And Kate, whose
sojourns to the East primed her for the willy-nilly surrender both
of motherhood and of grief, would surely comprehend that enigmatic
center: a world of riderless horses and one-way streets, where a
pilgrimage can dead-end in the dark enclosure of a shrine.

NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be time to upgrade China's trade status with the United
States when the Chinese government stops torturing middle-aged
widows to death.
</P>
<P>
   No member of Congress should vote on the bill to establish
permanent normal trade relations with China without first reading
Ian Johnson's harrowing April 20 account in The Wall Street Journal
of what Beijing did to Chen Zixiu, a retired auto worker from
Weifang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before Chen Zixiu died,'' the story by reporter Ian
Johnson begins, ``her captors again demanded that she renounce her
faith in Falun Dafa. Barely conscious after repeated jolts from a
cattle prod, the 58-year-old stubbornly shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enraged, the local officials ordered Ms. Chen to run barefoot
in the snow. Two days of torture had left her legs bruised and her
short black hair matted with pus and blood, said cellmates and
other prisoners who witnessed the incident. She crawled outside,
vomited, and collapsed. She never regained consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Dafa is not a crime ring or a conspiracy to overthrow the
Chinese Communist Party. It is a system of breathing exercises
(called Falun Gong), combined with spiritual readings and
meditation. Chen was attracted to it because she found, like
several million other Chinese, that doing the exercises made her
feel better. But the Beijing dictatorship, intolerant of any
movement it doesn't control, banned Falun Gong last summer. Chen
was arrested. And when this humble woman _ who, Johnson writes, was
``barely literate and never before interested in politics'' _
refused to abandon her innocent exercises, the government decided
to teach her a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Chen's ordeal began that night,'' the Journal reports. In
a nearby cell, other prisoners heard her screams. ``Officials from
the Chengguan Street Committee used plastic truncheons on her
calves, feet, and lower back, as well as a cattle prod on her head
and neck, according to witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end, not much was left of Ms. Chen. Her son and daughter
were grudgingly permitted to see her corpse. ``Their mother, they
recalled, was laid out on a table . . . . Her calves were black.
Six-inch welts streaked along her back. Her teeth were broken. Her
ear was swollen and blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of normalizing trade relations with China _
permanently granting it what used to be called most-favored-nation
status _ say the decision should not be tied to human rights. The
current system of annually debating China's trade status, they
point out, hasn't induced Beijing to stop abusing the Chinese
people. But expanding trade will help spread private enterprise and
individual ownership of property in China, paving the way for wider
freedom and democracy. So the normalizers reason.
</P>
<P>
   And yet _ if China's rulers are prepared to behave with such
grotesque brutality now, when the trade changes it wants so badly
are at the top of Washington's agenda, how are they going to behave
when the bill is approved and normalization is a done deal?
</P>
<P>
   In strictly financial terms, there is no doubt that more trade
with China would mean gains for American industry. That has always
been the argument for conducting business as usual with
totalitarians. Free trade is a marvelous engine of prosperity; its
economic benefits cannot be disputed. But profits are not the sum
and substance of America's interests in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent normal relations with China? Yes, when China is a
normal country. Normal countries do not break harmless citizens who
gather for exercise and meditation. Normal countries do not operate
a vast network of slave labor camps in which millions of men and
women are beaten and starved into producing goods for export.
Normal countries do not imprison Catholic bishops for their loyalty
to Rome, or torture Tibetan monks for revering the Dalai Lama.
Normal countries do not forbid families from having more than one
child, or force abortions on women who get pregnant without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, China deployed more than 100 new ballistic
missiles opposite Taiwan. Beijing warned that it may resort to
``all drastic measures . . . including the use of force'' to compel
Taiwan's reunification with China. It threatened to respond with a
nuclear attack if the United States came to the island's defense.
``The United States,'' a Chinese military newspaper predicted,
``will not sacrifice 200 million Americans for 20 million
Taiwanese.''
</P>
<P>
   To repeat: If this is how China's communist dictators act now,
when they are eager to see the trade bill pass, what are they going
to be like once the bill becomes law and Washington's leverage is
gone?
</P>
<P>
   Denying China permanent normal trade relations does not mean
denying it trade. It means that trade continues under current
arrangements: business goes on as before, and Congress decides each
year whether to extend China's privileges for another 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   When will the time be ripe for normal dealings with China? When
the Chinese Communist Party tells the truth about Chen Zixiu. The
poor woman died, the government insists, of natural causes.

ASSAULT IS NOT INNOCENT PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can we agree that four 9-year-olds pinning a classmate to the
playground while a fifth boy mounts her and makes ``humping''
motions is, for lack of a better word, wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, is the debate in West Bath, Maine, fixating on how to
describe the assault on the little girl rather than focusing on the
assault itself?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since news surfaced last week that five third-grade boys
had been suspended from the West Bath School for repeatedly
physically and verbally abusing some of their female classmates,
the public debate has centered on whether the boys' actions
constitute sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   How could it be sexual harassment? scoff the critics. The boys
aren't even old enough to understand the concept.
</P>
<P>
   How could it not be? responds the other side. The boys were
simulating an act of gang rape.
</P>
<P>
   Call it sexual harassment or don't, if the phrase offends you,
but don't pretend that what happened in that schoolyard was simple
schoolboy horseplay. It was not, as the father of one of the
suspended boys insisted, equivalent to the innocent games of jailer
that he played as a boy. It was not, as others have suggested,
similar to the incident in 1996 when a first-grader in North
Carolina was disciplined for kissing a girl on the cheek because he
liked her.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of that much-ridiculed kissing scandal, the US
Department of Education issued guidelines calling on school
officials to use their ``judgment and common sense'' in these
cases. To constitute sexual harassment, it said, an act ``must be
sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it adversely
affect a student's education or creates a hostile or abusive
educational environment. For a one-time incident to rise to the
level of harassment it must be severe.''
</P>
<P>
   This incident would seem to qualify, but it didn't happen just
once. The little girl in West Bath was pinned to the ground on at
least two occasions. Complaints about the boys' behavior toward
several girls at school were lodged over several weeks before any
action was taken. The first time the little girl was thrown to the
ground during recess, she did as she had been told: She reported
the incident to the playground supervisor. The supervisor did
nothing, effectively giving the boys the green light to assault the
girls again and sending the girls the clear message that adults
cannot be trusted to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder they did not tell their parents about the harassment.
The boys had warned them of physical retaliation if they did, and
the refusal of the playground monitor to intervene on their behalf
must have made them feel even more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Today's schoolyard is not the place we remember; the teasing can
be meaner and more sexual than anything we experienced as children.
``Hostile Hallways,'' a study by the American Association of
University Women almost a decade ago, reported that 70 percent of
girls experience verbal sexual abuse and 50 percent suffer unwanted
sexual contact in school.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural influences don't help. Parents may tell their children
that sex is a scared act between beloved partners, but music lyrics
and videos, television shows, and movies sell them sex as a crude,
casual, often brutal exchange between two people of unequal power.
Boys rule; girls drool. ``Bitch'' is among the milder epithets used
to describe women in the songs 9-year-olds hear blasting from their
big brothers' CD players every night.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, teachers, and school administrators need to talk to
children about gender stereotyping without fear of being labeled
``politically correct'' by those who would have us believe that
this incident was no more than boyhood antics. We teach children
how to behave respectfully at the dinner table; surely we can teach
them how to conduct themselves appropriately with classmates of the
opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   No little girl should experience the terror that child did, and
no little boys should be ignored who have so clearly internalized a
dangerous cultural message about male power and its use to
intimidate. Whatever else those boys in West Bath thought they were
doing, they were not starry-eyed innocents sharing a tender moment
of affection with a female classmate because they liked her.

AFTER 39 YEARS, SHE'S THE GRANDE DAME OF TV NEWS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ All in all, the morning taping of ``The View'' had
been rather . . . eclectic.
</P>
<P>
   First, a retired plumber sprang from the audience during the
preshow warm-up and proceeded to shake his booty with alarming
gusto. Then TV trashman Jerry Springer made an innuendo-laden
appearance, cheered on by a studio audience hooting ``Jerry!
Jerry!'' Finally, a guest chef cooked up a batch of bugs, insisted
on sampling his delicacies, and offered one to Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Walters wore an expression America knows well,
her eloquent face fixed somewhere between bemusement and
incredulity. It was the look she wore when Monica Lewinsky blithely
discussed having sex with the president of the United States.
Discussed it in front of nearly 50 million viewers. (``Everybody
said `I'm not interested, I don't care,' and then the whole country
watched,'' Walters remarked dryly in an interview after the
``View'' taping). While watching Walters watch others, the thought
occurs: By now, what has this woman not seen and, especially,
heard? She
</P>
<P>
   WALTERS, Page C6 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   is, after all, the virtuoso of the revelatory interview, able to
coax confessions (and tears) out of just about anybody, making it
an Event whenever she sits down with a newsmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she is still capable of surprise, or at least of feigning
surprise. It puts the audience on her side, as do deft displays of
empathy. Before taping began on a second episode of ABC's ``The
View,'' Walters commiserated with spectators about hunger pangs.
``Now that the network has `Millionaire,' you'd think they'd give
you a cup of soup or something,'' Walters crooned sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   The audience loved it and, seemingly, her. In the front row sat
70-year-old Mollie Goldstein of Queens. ``We just came from `Regis
and Kathie Lee,' but I like this better,'' Goldstein confided.
``We're crazy about Barbara. I remember her from way back, so I
watch everything she's in.''
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said, so far, of Walters's birthplace,
Boston, when it comes to ``The View.'' The talk show, which
features freewheeling, topical chat, and celebrity interviews by
five women of different age groups, has been slow to build an
audience in the two months since WCVB-TV (Channel 5) began airing
it at 11 a.m. In recent weeks, viewership has started to climb, but
it still lags far behind ``The Price Is Right'' on WBZ-TV (Channel
4).
</P>
<P>
   A vivid presence on TV, Walters is surprisingly diminutive and
soft-spoken in person. Spectators inside the ``View'' studio on
Manhattan's West Side, even those seated 15 feet from her,
sometimes had to strain to hear her words. Yet since she's the
show's resident legend _ and co-producer _ there's no question as
to who's in charge. She firmly deflected a query about her personal
life from the youngest ``View'' panelist, Lisa Ling; later, when
the discussion began to wander aimlessly, Walters firmly
interjected ``To put a button on this. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Walters had 20 minutes between shows, which she spent in her
dressing room picking at Chinese food, making and taking phone
calls, and going over the guest list for the second ``View'' to be
taped that day. Affixed to one wall was a cartoon portrait of
Walters seated on the moon interviewing the title character of her
favorite book, ``The Little Prince,'' by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mania as usual &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was another hectic day for the 68-year-old Walters: After
wrapping up the second show, she was scheduled to tape two segments
of her newsmagazine, ``20/20,'' while making preparations to fly to
Texas to interview Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There were nearly a dozen others in the room: ``View'' costars
Ling, Star Jones, and Joy Behar (the other panelist, Meredith
Vieira, was away closing on a new house), plus a covey of
20-something assistants who weren't even born when Walters became a
household name on the ``Today'' show. They were all sitting down,
slumped into chairs and couches _ all except Walters. She remained
standing throughout the lunch break. If you sit, you stop, and
Barbara Walters doesn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   There are times, however, when she feels like cutting back, and
this day in late April seems to be one of those days. After noting
that her contract with ABC will be up in August, Walters picked up
a fortune cookie and asked: ``Is this going to tell me whether I
should renew my contract?'' She opened it and intoned dramatically:
``You should not renew!''
</P>
<P>
   Later, more seriously, Walters opened up about the demands of
her schedule. In addition to co-producing and appearing on ``The
View'' a couple of days a week, she anchors the weekly newsmagazine
``20/20,'' does four editions of ``The Barbara Walters Special''
per year, plus her annual ``Ten Most Fascinating People'' program.
And of course, there is the pressure of landing the big ``get,''
the interview everyone else covets. Just as people expect Mark
McGwire to hit a homer each time he comes up to the plate, so too
do they expect Walters to land the big gets, even though the
competition has never been stiffer (Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric,
Oprah Winfrey, Ted Koppel, Mike Wallace, Connie Chung,
``Entertainment Tonight,'' ``Access Hollywood.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder and harder to do because there is so much
competition,'' said Walters. ``It is very hard now, and I really
don't know how much longer I'm going to do specials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When my contract was signed, I didn't have `The View,' '' she
added. ``So I have to really start thinking about just what it is
that I can give up, that I want to give up. And I don't want to
climb another mountain. I'm not a workaholic. I have a very strong
social life, and many friends. My work is not my entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Words spoken defiantly, as if to convince herself. Indeed, the
high point of Walters's day seems to be the phone call she gets
from her daughter, Jackie, during which the two laugh at a risque
cartoon Jackie had mailed to her mother. Walters lit up again when
she was told that CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, who
recently had a baby, was on the phone. ``Hello, mama,'' Walters
trilled into the phone. ``I'll give you 30 seconds to tell me he's
the most wonderful baby in the whole world.'' She promised to offer
Amanpour some pointers on juggling a demanding TV career and
motherhood. Was Walters just making friendly conversation with a
celebrity, or was she reeling in an interview subject? With her,
one suspects, the two often merge. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Longing to pause &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains the distinct longing for some downtime. As
Walters zipped from subject to subject with her assistants _ her
upcoming interview with Bush, her desire to return to Brookline
(where she grew up) to film a segment for ``The View,'' a dozen
other details _ Walters suddenly sighed: ``Wouldn't it be fun to go
shopping? I haven't been shopping in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Duty called, though. That second show loomed, with actress
Heather Graham on tap. ``What's Heather Graham talking about?''
Walters asked. An aide suggested that conversational fodder might
be found in Graham's attempt with boyfriend Ed Burns to buy the
apartment of the late John F. Kennedy Jr. Walters shook her head:
``Let's stay away from that. It's such a downer.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of being Barbara Walters at this stage of her
39-year career is that she is far more famous than either Graham or
Burns, and many others she interviews. She waved away the
observation. ``Listen, you sell chickens on television now and
you're famous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but she's no chicken vendor. She's a walking piece of TV
history, with a resume studded with firsts: first female cohost of
the ``Today'' show, first woman to coanchor a network newscast,
first woman in television news to earn a salary of $1 million (it's
now reportedly closer to $10 million). She did not invent the
celebrity interview on TV, but she made it into an art form, and
turned ``the Barbara Walters interview'' into a genre with its own
distinct hallmarks. She was one of the pioneers of the TV
newsmagazine, and she, more than anyone else, built a bridge
between news and entertainment _ a bridge that is well-traveled in
television today.
</P>
<P>
   And consider this: Who else has remained well-known and au
courant enough that she's been the subject of impersonations on
both the ``Saturday Night Live'' of the 1970s (Gilda Radner as
``Baba Wawa'') and on the ``SNL'' of the year 2000 (Cheri Oteri)?
No one does Gerry Ford impersonations anymore, but Barbara Walters
still generates a cultural buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may be the most influential person in the history of TV,''
says Steven D. Stark, an NPR commentator who wrote ``Glued to the
Set: The 60 Television Shows and Events That Made Us Who We Are
Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People often think of Edward R. Murrow as the patron saint of
TV news,'' adds Stark. ``No, Barbara Walters is the patron saint of
TV news. For better or worse, she created what we now think of as
television news. She's a genius of a sort. If Mike Wallace were to
leave `60 Minutes,' `60 Minutes' would go on the same way. But `The
Barbara Walters Specials' are Barbara Walters; there's nobody else.
She's irreplaceable in a way that no one else is.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Stark's assessment of her influence, Walters's eyes
widened. Was this real surprise, or merely the mock? ``I don't feel
that way,'' she said, then assumed an attitude of
mock-imperiousness as she nodded toward her staff. ``I should ask
them to treat me with more respect. A little more respect,
please!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A diligent reporter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within the TV industry, Walters is known for doggedly pursuing
interview subjects herself rather than leaving it to producers, yet
she frets about the public perception that ``I just sit around and
everybody comes to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder and harder to get the big interview, and I hate
it,'' she said. ``Also, every murderer has an agent and a lawyer.
They want to know your ratings, they want to know how much time
you're going to give them. If you put them on, how much promotion?
I mean, it's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if you're Barbara Walters, what interview coups are
left?
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say to me: `Who would you like to get?' '' said
Walters. ``But the people who are left do not do interviews. The
queen of England does not do interviews. The pope does not do
interviews. So far Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles and the
young princes do not do interviews. The time that heads of state
mattered has passed. I think with the exception of Saddam Hussein,
there's no head of state that people would say: `I really want to
see him.' Maybe Fidel Castro now, but certainly not a year ago. And
people are not interested in foreign policy. They're not even that
interested in politics. You have to make George W. interesting to a
prime-time audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in search of another challenge, Walters teamed up with
Bill Geddies, her longtime producer for ``The Barbara Walters
Specials,'' to found ``The View'' three years ago. Walters said she
envisioned it as a cross between ``Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee'' and the
last part of ABC's ``This Week,'' where journalists indulge in some
give-and-take with each other.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir John Gielgud, one of the great actors of the English stage
who enthralled audiences for more than 60 years with his eloquent
voice and consummate artistry, died Sunday at his home in
Aylesbury, west of London. He was 96 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last survivor of that triumvirate of legendary
theatrical knights _ Lord Laurence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson
and Gielgud _ who dominated acting in England and vitalized
Shakespeare in what became a golden age of classical theater. He
was especially celebrated for his performances as Romeo, Hamlet,
Benedick, Angelo in ``Measure for Measure,'' Prospero and various
kings of the realm. With equal ease, he demonstrated his finesse in
plays by Wilde and Chekhov and by his contemporaries, who ranged
from Shaw to Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   A quintessential man of the theater, he was also known as a
director, a producer and an author. He loved acting and was devoted
to the stage, but he always understood the contradictions of his
profession. ``Acting is half shame, half glory,'' he once said.
``Shame at exhibiting yourself, glory when you can forget
yourself.'' And on another occasion he said: ``Acting has rid me of
my frustrations and satisfied many of my ambitions. It is more than
an occupation or a profession; for me it has been a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Olivier was known for his physical daring and Richardson
had a gift for eccentric characterization, it was Gielgud who
elevated language. In his bearing as well as his speech, he was the
most lyrical of the three, a fact that could lead people to
underrate his versatility. The beauty with which the actor
transmitted Shakespeare in his one-man show, ``Ages of Man,''
caused Kenneth Tynan to offer the backhanded compliment that he was
``the finest actor on earth from the neck up,'' leaving other
anatomical claims to Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   What the Tynan judgment overlooked was Gielgud the risk-taker,
especially in the last half of his distinguished career, in which
he revealed himself as a masterly character actor in plays by
Pinter and David Storey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke is that people think of me as an intellectual
actor,'' Gielgud said. ``Yet I have always trusted almost entirely
to observation, emotion and instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   He was ``the greatest classical actor of all time,'' Sheridan
Morley, Gielgud's authorized biographer, said Monday. Morley's
book, ``John G,'' is scheduled to be published early next year.
</P>
<P>
   An indefatigable worker, Gielgud acted until the very end of his
life. In his late 80s he appeared principally in films and on
television. His final performance on stage was in 1988 in Hugh
Whitemore's ``Best of Friends,'' in which he played Sir Sydney
Cockerell, the curator of the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge
University.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of tributes published on Gielgud's 80th
birthday, Sir Alec Guinness said, ``John Gielgud did more to
liberate the English theater from the fustian attitudes of the '20s
and early '30s than any other man and paved the way for what is
best in London today.'' Guinness later wrote that Gielgud headed
the list of ``lasting influences on my professional life.'' In that
birthday book, Dame Peggy Ashcroft wrote about Gielgud that ``his
charm and his charisma have never flagged, and who knows what he
may have up his sleeve for us yet?'' He was one of the most
surprising of actors, and someone who could not resist a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his career, he achieved an even wider popularity for his
roles in films and won an Academy Award in 1981 as best supporting
actor for playing the butler in the Dudley Moore comedy ``Arthur.''
He was amused that people were surprised by his success in a comic
role. As he said, ``I always thought you must try to find the
comedy even in parts like Lear and Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   The vulgar dialogue he spoke in ``Arthur'' seemed to contradict
his courtliness. Tall, elegant and dignified, with an imperious
profile, he could quite easily strike a stance of snobbishness.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, his last major movie role was as Prospero in
``Prospero's Books,'' Peter Greenaway's 1991 version of ``The
Tempest,'' fulfilling a dream of his to perform that Shakespearean
role on film. That was the fifth time he played Prospero;
repeatedly he reinterpreted a character, returning again and again
to Romeo, Hamlet and other roles. His fifth King Lear was in a 1994
radio production, directed by Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In one magnificent season early in his career he alternated with
Olivier in the roles of Romeo and Mercutio; he received more
admiring reviews for his Romeo, Olivier for his Mercutio. In the
course of his long life in the theater he played almost all the
great Shakespearean characters, in a number of cases affixing an
enduring imprint.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For someone who was known for his brilliant articulation of
Shakespearean verse and for his graceful stage presence, as a young
actor he was dismissed for his artificiality and his physical
awkwardness. His first drama teacher, Constance Benson, burst out
laughing in the middle of a rehearsal and said he walked ``like a
cat with rickets.'' For the young Gielgud, acting became a project
of self-education and self-improvement. He was his own most
demanding critic. Within a few years of his debut, he had worked
his way to the very top of his profession, and remained there
throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in London on April 14, 1904, the son of Frank
Gielgud, a stockbroker, and the former Kate Terry-Lewis. The name
Gielgud is Lithuanian, he said, ``not Scottish, as many people
imagine.'' He was christened Arthur John, but was always known as
John, or to friends, Johnnie. One of four children, he came from a
privileged background.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud had the lineage to be a great actor. His grandmother was
the actress Kate Terry, Ellen Terry was his great aunt, Edward
Gordon Craig was a cousin, and there were other actors and
theatrical managers in his family. His brother Val Gielgud was a
playwright, a novelist and a director. Besides their talent for the
theater, he said, the Gielguds and the Terrys shared ``the same
weakness: weak lachrymal glands.'' They were easy criers, something
that he was to use later to his advantage in performance.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in emulation of Gordon Craig, he set his earliest sights
on being a set designer. As a child, he said, he ``developed a
passion for painting for back cloths and designs in pastels for my
toy theater.'' He later wrote, ``I was stage-struck, mad about the
theater.'' Although he never lost his interest in design, he was
soon caught up by the idea of being an actor.

THE MAYOR MADE THE RIGHT CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the urging of his supporters to stay in the race for the
US Senate, New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made the right
decision Friday to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls continued to show a virtual dead heat between him
and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the mayor's recently announced personal
problems were sure eventually to work against him.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's April 27 announcement that he has prostate cancer may
have temporarily enhanced his political image by softening the hard
edge he conveyed to many voters, and thus drawing a few undecideds
to his cause.
</P>
<P>
   But, after the initial wave of sincere sympathy subsided, a
sense of reality would have set in, giving rise to questions about
whether Giuliani would be physically able to serve in the Senate.
He himself had to ponder that question during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   He had also to consider the political fallout from his
disclosure that he and his wife, Donna Hanover, are separating _
and Hanover's angry assertion to the media that her husband had had
an affair with a member of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani had decided that he could continue his campaign
while receiving treatment for his prostate cancer _ and accepted
the state Republican Party's nomination at its May 30 convention _
he would have been making a big decision not only for himself, but
for the New York GOP.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani had appeared to weaken physically as the campaign
went on, voters would have noticed. Some undecided voters
previously leaning toward him might have opted to stay home on
election day rather than vote for someone they feared could not
vigorously represent their state in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's physical and emotional endurance might have been
severely tested with ongoing stories and questions about his
marital problems, which in turn may have raised even tougher
questions about his character and values.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest New Yorkers in general were not
particularly judgmental of Giuliani's extramarital involvements,
but there also may be an undercurrent of concern that those matters
could have made him less effective as a senator.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt other senators with marital problems have managed to
survive, and sometimes even thrive, in Washington. But still others
have lost reelection bids for having similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   His personal problems aside, Giuliani would have faced daunting
challenges if he had made it to the Senate. While he is generally
credited with driving down crime in the city, he has also been
sharply criticized for his handling of two highly publicized cases
involving the city's police force and officers brutalizing two
unarmed men.
</P>
<P>
   In the Abner Louima case, a white officer was convicted of
sodomizing a Haitian immigrant with a broom handle in the police
station's bathroom, and three other white officers were convicted
of trying to cover up the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Amadou Diallo, four white officers fired 41
bullets at an unarmed West African immigrant as he stood at the
entrance of his Bronx apartment. All four were acquitted in
Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's show of support for the police in these incidents,
and his apparent lack of genuine remorse for the victims and their
families, brought heavy criticism from the city's black community,
from liberals, and from some moderates. He said at a recent town
hall meeting that, in retrospect, he would have handled the matters
differently, including being more sensitive to the victims'
families. But those comments did not change the views of his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Giuliani's problems would probably have worn down
his candidacy. It had become apparent that while his closest
supporters still hoped he would run, other key Republicans had
already begun to look for a replacement candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, US Representative Rick Lazio, the Long Island
moderate who had originally been forced to the sidelines to make
way for Giuliani's candidacy, was back in the race. He became the
instant front-runner for the GOP nomination. Governor George
Pataki, another popular Republican in the state, has indicated he
supports a Lazio bid.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street billionaire financier Theodore Forstmann has also
been mentioned as a possible candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As the GOP mulls its options, Clinton is moving along in a
campaign that resembles her husband's _ events just seem to go
their way.
</P>
<P>
   When less than two years ago, few New Yorkers gave her a chance,
today another Clinton has become the one to beat.

 UNDATED: an actor.

   His theatrical beginnings were inauspicious. At Hillside, his
preparatory school, he played the Mock Turtle in a production of
``Alice in Wonderland'' and sang, he said, ``with increasing volume
and shrillness in every verse.'' After attending Westminster
School, he rebelled against the idea of a university education and
decided to enter the theater, vowing that ``If I did not succeed
before I was 25, I would follow my parents' wishes, and work to
become an architect.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When he was 17, he made his professional debut, of sorts, as a
walk-on in an Old Vic production of ``Henry V.'' He played the
herald and had one line: ``Here is the number of the slaughter'd
French.'' As he later said, he made such a bad impression that when
he subsequently had walk-ons in ``King Lear'' and ``Peer Gynt'' he
was given no lines to speak. After three years at Lady Benson's
School, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, he played his first Romeo (opposite Gwen
Ffrangcon-Davies), and it was, he later wrote, a ``baptism by
fire.'' One critic, perhaps in anticipation of Tynan's remark, said
that ``Mr. Gielgud from the waist downward means absolutely
nothing.'' But within a year he was understudying Noel Coward in
the leading role in Coward's play ``The Vortex,'' and when the
author left the cast he replaced him. Later he was to credit Coward
with teaching him the art of timing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was playing Chekhov: Konstantin in ``The Seagull'' and
Baron Tusenbach in ``The Three Sisters.'' In 1926, he replaced
Coward again, this time in ``The Constant Nymph.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time his name was in lights was in 1928 in a farce
with Hermione Baddeley. It was, he said, ``an appalling concoction,
backed by the lady who had written it, called `Holding Out the
Apple.''' It was followed by two more disasters. For several years,
he said in his autobiography, ``Early Stages,'' he was on ``the
fringe of real success'' while in danger of being typecast as
``neurotic, rather hysterical young men.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   He joined the Old Vic, where he played, in succession, Romeo,
Richard II, Oberon, Macbeth and Hamlet. It was in ``Richard II''
that he ``began to feel at last that I was finding my feet in
Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet,'' which he played at the age of 25, was the first of
the plays to transfer to the West End, where it joined two other
``Hamlets'' on the boards. The English critic James Agate said the
Gielgud performance of Hamlet was ``the high water mark of English
Shakespearean acting in our time.'' In other words, he had
fulfilled his vow to his parents. It was Agate who called him ``Our
First Player.''

   In these plays, as John Mortimer recalled, the actor's ``voice
ensnared and enslaved'' the audience. ``No one had ever spoken
Shakespeare with such intelligence and understanding.'' He added,
``No one ever mentioned a cat with rickets again.''
</P>
<P>
   The following season, Gielgud returned to the Old Vic, where he
was joined by another young actor, Ralph Richardson. In their first
play together, he was Hotspur to the Richardson Prince Hal. On
opening night, he was surprised to hear Richardson whisper to him
on stage during the dueling scene: ``Now you hit me, cocky. Now I
hit you.''
</P>
<P>
   As Richardson recalled: ``I found his clothes extravagant, his
conversation flippant. I didn't like him. But when I played Caliban
to his Prospero, John said, `Would you care to run over your scene
with me.' I thought to myself, `Not much.' But we ran it through
and he gave me about 200 ideas as he usually does and I thought, by
God he knows something about this here play.''
</P>
<P>
   They quickly became fast friends and mutual admirers. ``I was
always rather amazed at him,'' Richardson said. ``A kind of
brilliant butterfly, while I was a very gloomy sort of boy.'''

   At the Old Vic, the young Gielgud played Sergius in ``Arms and
the Man,'' Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night'' and, at the age of 26,
``King Lear.'' But it was as ``Richard of Bordeaux,'' in his own
production in 1933, that he became a West End star. As he said,
``Queues coiled like serpents round'' the theater, as he was
``photographed, painted, caricatured, interviewed'' and lionized.
These were heady Shakespearean days, as he, often in tandem with
Olivier and Richardson, tackled the weightiest of classics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 he brought his ``Hamlet'' to Broadway, with Jessica
Tandy as his Ophelia. Again, there was another Hamlet in town:
Leslie Howard, and the two dueled for domination. The Gielgud
version ran for 132 performances, a record for ``Hamlet'' on
Broadway, until broken by Richard Burton in 1964, in a production
directed by Gielgud.
</P>
<P>
   In his first film, the silent ``Who Is the Man?'' in 1925, he
played a dope fiend, a role originally performed onstage by Sarah
Bernhardt. That was, he said, ``the most ridiculous part I played
on screen.'' Then Alfred Hitchcock persuaded him to be in ``The
Secret Agent,'' by telling him it was ``another Hamlet part.'' To
his dismay, ``Peter Lorre pinched all the best lines.'' ``The
Secret Agent'' opened the year of his Broadway ``Hamlet,'' and it
did not augur a promising film career. For many years, his
cinematic work was sporadic; the high points were Shakespearean, as
Clarence in Olivier's ``Richard III,'' as Cassius in Joseph
Mankiewicz's 1952 version of ``Julius Caesar'' and as King Henry IV
in Orson Welles' ``Chimes at Midnight.'' But his stage career
continued unabated during and after World War II and covered a wide
range of classics, as he proved to be equally at home in Wilde and
Chekhov, Sheridan and Congreve.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States in 1947 with ``The Lady's Not
for Burning,'' directing a cast that included himself and Burton.
``The Ages of Man,'' his one-man collage of excerpts from
Shakespeare, was a tour de force that he played in London, on
Broadway and on tour. In 1950 in ``a fresh start in a glorious
season at Stratford,'' he played Angelo, Cassius, Benedick and
Lear. Five years later he returned to Lear and astonished audiences
in George Devine's production designed by Isamu Noguchi. He was
knighted in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Through the next decades, he continued to direct as well as act,
with the emphasis on classics, although in 1965 he acted in Edward
Albee's ``Tiny Alice'' opposite Irene Worth, and several seasons
later he staged Albee's ``All Over'' on Broadway. In 1968 he played
the title role in the Peter Brook production of Seneca's
``Oedipus.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brook said: ``John is always in the present; he is modern in
his restless quest for truth and new meaning. He is also
traditional, for his passionate sense of quality comes from his
understanding of the past. He links two ages. He is unique.''

   In the 1970s Gielgud took a sudden and exhilarating step into
modern theater, first with David Storey's ``Home'' (1970) and then
with Harold Pinter's ``No Man's Land'' (1975). In both plays, he
shared the stage with his old friend Richardson. The director Peter
Hall had expected him to choose the ``posh part of Hirst'' in ``No
Man's Land'' because it was similar to other roles he had played.
Surprisingly he chose Spooner, the seedy poet in sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both felt we were paddling dangerously in uncharted seas,''
Gielgud said, ``but our shared success (in ``Home'' and ``No Man's
Land'') was a lively encouragement as well as a refreshing
challenge after the more conventional ups and downs of our past
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 Gielgud moved into experimental films, starring as a
tormented, aged novelist in Alain Resnais' ``Providence.'' With
that movie, he said, ``I felt I was in the avant-garde with a
vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   The following decade, while acting on stage in ``Julius
Caesar,'' Julian Mitchell's ``Half-Life'' and other plays, he
expanded his opportunities in films and television. In addition to
his role in ``Arthur,'' he was featured in the films ``Chariots of
Fire,'' ``Gandhi,'' ``Shining Through'' and ``Power of One,'' and
on television in ``Brideshead Revisited,'' ``War and Remembrance''
and ``Summer's Lease.'' For the last show, he won an Emmy as best
actor in a mini-series. Together with Olivier and Richardson, he
appeared in the television mini-series ``Wagner.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Gielgud was known for his faux pas, for
``dropping bricks'' in public. While having lunch with the
playwright Edward Knoblock, he said to his companion: ``Do you see
that man coming in? He's the biggest bore in London _ second only
to Edward Knoblock.'' Then realizing who was sitting next to him,
he retracted his statement: ``Not you, of course. I mean the other
Edward Knoblock.'' When he was directing Burton in ``Hamlet,'' he
went backstage after the performance and said, ``We'll go to dinner
when you're better,'' instead of ``when you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   His response to questions was candid. When the actor Michael
Hordern asked him for advice on how to play King Lear, Gielgud
famously replied, ``All I can tell you is to get a small Ophelia.''
Years later, he commented about Robert Stephens' Lear at
Stratford-on-Avon: ``He had somebody else carry her on!''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 24 years, Gielgud lived in a 17th-century house in
Buckinghamshire. With its beautiful garden and ornate furnishings,
the baronial estate was Gielgud's own Brideshead. The garden was
tended by his companion of many years, Martin Hensler, who died
last year. Gielgud has no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with the New York Times in 1993, the actor
was slender and stately, unbowed by his years. Anticipating his
90th birthday the following April, he had actively discouraged any
celebration. ``If I can manage to to go on working, it's much more
interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1976, he had sold his home in London and moved to the country
_ and seldom returned to the city. ``Every street in London is full
of memory,'' he said. ``I've lost so many dear friends: Peggy,
Ralph, Olivier, Redgrave and, in America, Helen Hayes, Judith,
Lillian.'' Choking back his emotion, he added, ``Thank goodness
Alec Guinness is going strong.'' The poignancy was especially
resonant for someone like Gielgud, for whom the theater had been a
family.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth decade as an actor, he was still stagestruck, and
carried with him the history of the English theater in the century.
``I used to love being in the theater and having great actors come
to visit me.'' Although he did not often see plays anymore, he
resolutely read reviews and kept up with what was happening on
stage in London.
</P>
<P>
   When he was not working, he passed ``the time rather agreeably,
as long as one doesn't brood too much about death and the unhappy
things of one's life.'' He said: ``I get moments of great
depression. Fortunately, I've had very good friends who have been
critical of me. They haven't flattered me too much so that I
acquired a sense of my own importance. That's a danger for an
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a great reader, often finishing four books a week, and he
also watched television. For many years, his favorite shows were
``Cheers'' and ``Dynasty.'' Through the 1990s he never stopped
working, appearing on television and in 1998 in the film
``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his interest in experimental theater, for years he had
avoided doing works by Samuel Beckett, and said that he had talked
Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness out of doing the original London
production of ``Waiting for Godot.'' In retrospect, he regretted
not doing ``Endgame,'' and this spring he acted for the last time,
in a film of Beckett's play ``Catastrophe,'' as ``the victim''
opposite Harold Pinter, under the direction of David Mamet. The
film is part of a series of movies made of all Beckett's stage
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's own writing was as elegant as his acting. His books
include the autobiographies ``Early Stages'' and ``An Actor and His
Time,'' and two collections of essays, ``Stage Directions'' and
``Distinguished Company.'' In ``Stage Directions'' he wrote, ``For
me the theater has always been an escape, a make-believe world,
full of color and excitement, fun, emotion, poetry and movement, a
world of striking characters and extraordinary personalities.'' One
of the most extraordinary was Gielgud himself.

A CRITICAL, BUT NARROW, LOOK AT MODERN JAPAN

   THE YAMATO DYNASTY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Secret History of Japan's Imperial Family &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Sterling Seagrave and Peggy Seagrave &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Broadway, 394 pp., illustrated, $27.50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A real history of Japan's imperial dynasty, which lays claim to
the oldest unbroken royal bloodline on the planet, would be a joy
and an adventure. What eccentricities must have been tolerated,
what sleights of hand perpetrated, to keep this legend alive for
two millennia? Centuries of deep isolationism and manipulation of
emperors by military lords have made the lack of information
surrounding this important component of Japan's distinctive
cultural tradition profound.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``The Yamato Dynasty'' makes no contribution to
filling the void. It does not even come close.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, authors Sterling and Peggy Seagrave dismiss the first
1,850 or so years of the Japanese imperial line with a few feeble
phrases, then proceed to use a hash of other people's work as a
medium in which to propagate their own prejudices and conspiracy
theories about the four most recent emperors, and about modern
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The result may look like history on the nonfiction shelves of
bookstores, it may sound like history to the completely uninitiated
_ but no one in possession of even a passing familiarity with
modern East Asian history will be fooled by this work, or pleased
with it. The book is like the college paper in which voluminous
source notes fail to disguise the absence of support for ridiculous
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Vague misgivings enter the reader's mind almost from the
beginning, with the repeated, ominous references to invisible men
behind the throne. And we are on full alert by the time the
narrative has passed through President Theodore Roosevelt's
mediation of an end to the Russo-Japanese War, the conflict that
marked the emergence of Japan as a world power. The Seagraves write
that Roosevelt assented to help negotiate an end to the conflict in
return for a secret agreement that ``Japan could have Korea if the
US could have the Philippines.'' No sources are given for this
assertion, which is, on its face, preposterous. The negotiations
occurred in 1905; the Philippines became an American colony
following the Spanish-American War, which ended years earlier. And
even if the dates were consistent, the Japan of that day, while
able to best the teetering Russian empire, was no threat whatever
to the emerging American colossus.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than historical error are prejudice and condescension,
which are present in abundance. ``Treachery, so common throughout
(Japan's) history, made loyalty admired precisely because it is so
rare and beautiful,'' the authors write. ``Consensus is idealized
because everyone cheats or colludes behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   The text also is shot through with contradictions. For example,
the Seagraves first assert that US Ambassador Joseph Grew was
grossly ignorant of conditions in Japan because of his narrow
circle of elite, Western-leaning contacts. Then they maintain that,
nearly a year in advance of the outbreak of hostilities, Grew
reported to Washington that there was talk in Tokyo that if
relations with the US broke down, the Japanese ``are planning to go
all out in a surprise mass attack on Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rather the Seagraves who seem to have a narrow circle of
informants. While they throw every mainstream reference on the
shelf into their bibliography, from John King Fairbank to Ezra
Vogel, their work shows little influence from that direction.
Rather, ``The Yamato Dynasty'' has the sharply critical tone of
Karel van Wolferen and Chalmers Johnson without the taut analysis
and careful reporting those authors display at their best.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be so surprising that the Seagraves have produced
this travesty. Sterling Seagrave is out to fashion his own
sub-genre: His previous books were ``The Soong Dynasty'' ( China)
and ``The Marcos Dynasty'' (Philippines). The book on the Soongs,
one of the most important and least chronicled families of
20th-century Chinese history, was welcome and highly informative.
Still, it was a stretch to call the Soongs a dynasty; even more so
the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves you wondering how many other points have been
stretched to make the subject matter conform to Seagrave's ever
more clearly stated view that Asian society is at its core more
corrupt and amoral than that of the West.

SUMMER OFFERINGS SHOWCASE ART OF ANIMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Used to be that Disney was the, er, mouse of the walk when it
came to animation. Studios would cringe at the thought of competing
head to head with ``The Lion King,'' ``Tarzan,'' or the ``Toy
Story'' series.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent that's still true. Disney's latest
big-screen offering, ``Dinosaur,'' out this past Friday, gets a
four-week head start before DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox, and
others studios unload their cinematic goods. But get a load of the
competition. By the time summer slows to a steamy crawl, a record
seven animated films will pop up in movie theaters, bringing fans a
screenful of aliens, pocket monsters, and chickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animation is really competing like live action does,'' says
John Canemaker, director of the animation program at New York
University's Tisch School of the Arts. ``It's actually a very
healthy thing that's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   What's unique about this summer's roundup, say people in the
industry, is the variety of animation styles being showcased. In
the past, filmmakers would replicate Disney's winning combination
of music and comedy to fashion a hit. (See, for example, 1997's
``Anastasia'' from Fox.)
</P>
<P>
   Now even Disney is playing with that formula. Its ``Dinosaur''
features a seamless mixture of computer-generated monsters paired
with live shots of the Australian coast, Florida swamps, and
Venezuelan plains. ``Titan A.E. (After Earth)'' will attempt to
entice the teenage masses with a pop soundtrac k arranged by No
Doubt's producer Glen Ballard and vocal characterizations by hip
young actors Drew Barrymore, Janeane Garofalo, and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' tugs the nostalgia
chord by pairing the hand-drawn moose and squirrel with actors
Robert DeNiro and Renee Russo. And ``Chicken Run'' not only boasts
clay-animated fowl by the makers of ``Wallace and Gromit,'' it's
got Mel Gibson voicing one of the lead characters.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden diversity of styles? Studios are finding, says
Canemaker, that animated work is ``competitive if they don't try to
do what Disney does. That's where the danger comes in. Disney has
perfected that turf. If you use interesting characters or a
different technique or a different kind of content to the films, .
. . I think you have a better chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Animation seems to be everywhere these days. A renaissance is
occuring on television, where choices range from ``The Rugrats'' to
``The Simpsons`` to ``South Park.'' Fans can even tune into the
Cartoon Network, where it's all animation, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, that interest began filtering down into
the movie business. Warner Bros., Fox, and DreamWorks all began
adding animation to their pipelines in an effort to garner ``Lion
King''-size grosses for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these company's initial efforts followed the Disney
formula a little too closely. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A disney movie'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, it seemed like anytime anyone's tried to take on
Disney, so to speak, it's been in a form of mimicry'' says Eric
Leighton, codirector of ``Dinosaur,'' who earned an Academy Award
nomiation for his visual effects work in 1993's ``The Nightmare
Before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Take (again) Fox's ``Anastasia,'' which was made by longtime
creative partners Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, veterans of Disney's
animation studio, who, as independent producers, were responsible
for such 1980s works as ``An American Tail'' and ``The Secret of
NIMH.'' Even Goldman, who codirected ``Titan A.E.'' with Bluth,
says that because of the style of ``Anastasia,'' people who saw it
were likely to say, ```Oh, look, a Disney movie.' They wouldn't
know the difference betwen the way we draw and the way Disney
draws.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem has to do with the hegemony Disney has in
people's hearts, says Goldman: ``If it's a family movie in
animation, if it doesn't have the word `Disney' on it, then parents
are saying, `Well, it can't be that good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This may partially explain why people avoided last year's
critically lauded ``The Iron Giant.'' But as the box-office tallies
of ``The Rugrats Movie,'' ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,''
and ``Beavis and Butt-head Do America'' show, films that shun the
Disney style can do quite well, particularly when they're spun off
from well-known franchises. As a result more and more studios are
willing to rip up the old Disney blueprint _ within reason, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still there to a certain extent,'' says Leighton, ``but
we're starting to see a litle bit more escape from it, a little bit
more playing around with different media and methods of
storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's own ``Dinosaur'' certainly falls into the new way of
thinking. It's part of the studio's goal to add more live
action/animation hybrids to its traditional animated fare, says
Thomas Schumacher, president of Walt Disney Feature Animation.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Disney admits to being threatened by the increasing
amount of animated product being sent to theaters. ``It doesn't
really effect me,'' says Schumacher, nonchalantly reeling off a
list of animation hits by other studios. ``They're not movies I
want to make.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Displaced dinos &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur,'' which Disney began developing in 1994, focuses on
a family of Lemurs (Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, and others) and
their herbivore friend, a hulking Iguanodon called Aladar (D. B.
Sweeney). After a meteor pummels the earth, leaving fire and desert
in its wake, the group joins a motley band of dinosaurs, including
Joan Plowright breathing life into a slow-moving Brachiosaur and
Della Reese playing a sassy, lumbering Styrachosaur.
</P>
<P>
   As the group searches for lush feeding grounds, its members are
terrorized by raptors and carnotaurs, a species discovered only
five years before ``Dinosaur'' started shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The film ``was not geared (to) younger children,'' says Ralph
Zondag, who codirected ``Dinosaur'' with Leighton. ``We wanted to
make this a little more edgier.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Disney executives ever ask the pair to make their
cold-blooded cast break out in song?
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been the point where we would have screamed
and ran,'' says Leighton.
</P>
<P>
   Zondag adds, ``We made sure that that was not going to happen.
It was a tough pill to swallow just trying to get these animals to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, giving the dinosaurs verbal abilities meant they had
to have expressions to reflect the words comming out of their
mouths. For the Iguanodons, the directors used a horse-like
musculature underneath the lizards' skin to power the emotions on
their long faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can imagine that a horse is happy or sad,'' says Zondag.
``it was a little more of a natural transition to use that as a
basis for the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Leighton and Zondag also had to make sure the film didn't end up
looking like a bad special-effects job where you could see where
the computer work ended and the live action began. They focused on
adding dust puffs and ground cracks under the dinosaur's feet. When
the meteor hits the earth, in the first few minutes of the film,
Aladar's shadow shifts from side to side, following the changing
pattern of the light source.
</P>
<P>
   We're ``making sure these characters really feel like they're
part of this work,'' explains Zondag. ``That way it feels a little
more seamless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' challenges animation in another way: by making a
science-fiction film that appeals to young adults. The film pits
humans against an alien race called the Drej. As in ``Dinosaur,''
the earth takes a beating, getting blown up by the Drej soon after
the film starts. For the rest of the movie, Damon and friends use
their spaceship, the Titan, to elude their enemy and search for a
safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   The goal with ``Titan A.E.,'' says Goldman, was to ``make it an
animated Indiana Jones, with that kind of pacing, that kind of
jeopardy to your characters, that kind of sophistication and subtle
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen focus inspired the filmmakers to use more modern
musical elements than are found in the typical animated flick.
You'll find no Broadway-style show tunes here. Instead, viewers
will hear Luscious Jackson and Lit, a fact that gives Goldman some
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument has always been you want to make a classical movie
that lives forever,'' says Goldman, 55. ``If you're going to put
rock music into it, you definitely don't want your characters to
sing it because it's going to have a five-year life and you'll
never play it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping,'' he adds, that ``this music does not date the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   But those are the chances animators will have to take as they
push this art form into the 21st century.

DON HENLEY IS BACK IN THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven years between albums is a pop-culture eternity, but not
for Don Henley. First he toured behind his last solo album, ``The
End of the Innocence,'' then he founded the Walden Woods Project
and published a book about the environment, then fought with Geffen
Records and sued them for his release, then reunited and toured
with the Eagles, then fathered three children in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the fast lane, to quote an Eagles song.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Inside Job,'' a new solo album, due out Tuesday.
It's worth the wait, as Henley combines graceful acoustic ballads
with simmering funk and drum-looped rock tracks, all girded with
articulate, rapier-wit lyrics about social issues and his new
family-man status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that I'd rather make a few good albums than a
whole lot of mediocre ones,'' says Henley, now 52. ``The
experiences that I had during those 11 years made it possible for
me to write these songs. So I don't worry about how much time has
gone by.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley also has no illusions about the target audience for the
new album, which will be backed by his appearance at the
FleetBoston Pavilion June 5. (It's a Walden Woods benefit, with
tickets $44 to $89.50)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 78 million baby boomers who don't really have a
whole lot to listen to, and I'm hoping that I can at least
partially fill that void,'' he says. ``I think that this album
speaks to concerns that members of my generation deal with on a
daily basis, including the environment, parenthood, and the
inhumanity and coldness pervasive in a corporatized world.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pollution to parenthood &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henley deals with environmental pollution in the piano ballad
``Goodbye to a River'' (with the line ``the captains of industry
are killing everything''), with parenthood in the tranquil ``Taking
You Home'' (about bringing home a newborn daughter, with the verse,
``In this love I found strength I never knew I had''), and abusive
corporations in ``Inside Job.'' In the latter, he sings, ``While
you were sleeping they came and took it all away/ It was an inside
job, it always is/ Chalk it up to business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynical? Yes _ and that's always been part of Henley's world
view. But that is countered more than ever by the sensitive songs
(including the acoustic ``For My Wedding'') that address the love
of family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the album is an example of yin and yang. It deals with
light and darkness,'' says Henley. ``I try to achieve a balance
because I think there's more of a balance in my life now. People
have used words like cynical and negative to describe me, which I
don't necessarily agree with. I've always been skeptical about
certain things and outspoken. . . . But I'm now finding a great
deal of solace in my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to say in some of these songs is that in an
illogical world, in a world where reason does not necessarily
prevail, solace can be found in the family, in nature, and in the
spiritual life which encompasses those two things. Nature has
always been my refuge, but now my family is my refuge as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley is not as sympathetic, of course, to the corporate world,
which he attacks with even more venom than usual on the album. In
``Workin' It,'' he offers a Dylanesque rap and this tart assessment
of some corporate executives: ``We're running out of everything,
but we can't afford to quit/ Before this binge is over, we've got
to squeeze out one more hit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporate climate, and not just in the record industry, is
frightening,'' says Henley. ``They're gobbling up everything. And
it's just not good for art, it's not good for culture, it's not
good for diversity, it's not good for the truth, it's not good for
fairness. And the government seems to have refined the art of
looking the other way. It's a completely laissez-faire climate now
in Washington. You can get as big and as voracious as you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Microsoft, Henley is reminded. A federal judge
recently ruled that the software giant violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Media monopolies &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the one token sacrificial lamb,'' he says. ``But there
are anticompetitive practices going on all over the place. And it's
all in the name of commerce. Every logical argument now that can be
made on behalf of sustaining this planet has to take a back seat to
commerce. I know about this first-hand because I'm from Texas, the
most polluted state in the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also disturbed by the formation of monopolies of various
kinds within the media industry. They tend to use nice euphemisms
like globalization, multinationalism, merger, and conglomerate _
but these are all euphemisms for monopoly. Back in Teddy
Roosevelt's time, none of this would have been allowed. He would
have been trustbusting up a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley also takes some shots at the Internet in ``Workin' It,''
with the biting line, ``We've got the software, hardware, CD-ROM,
we've got the exploitation.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a double-edged sword,'' he says. ``It's a bit
like television. It can be a wonderful tool for good, for
education, and communication. Or it can be a repository for all our
cultural garbage. There's a lot of litter alongside the information
highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go on the Internet. If the Internet has some
information that I need, I ask someone else to do it for me. And I
don't use e-mail, largely as a matter of privacy. There are serious
privacy issues with regard to the Internet. Large corporations are
gathering information on each and every one of us, which I deal
with on the song `Inside Job.' Big Brother is here. And he's
workin' it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley is clearly back in harness and ready to go. He even has a
new band, save for holdover guitarist Frank Simes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted people who were a little bit younger and more
enthusiastic,'' he says of the changes. ``I was looking for a
little hunger, so to speak. Not that some of my previous band
members weren't great musicians, but I think some of them had
gotten tired of going on the road and wanted to stay put. I don't
blame them for that and we all remain friends. But I just thought
it was time for a change. New faces, fresh start.''

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE

<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``Dinosaur'' Dinosaurs are natural movie stars, and
Disney's computer-generated tribe of them, set against real
landscapes, is a virtual triumph, moving movies (and Disney
animation) another step forward. This fable about a young orphan
dino struggling to survive with his surrogate family echoes
``Bambi,'' ``Tarzan,'' and ``The Lion King'' thematically, but has
a fresh look all its own. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !!! ``Hamlet'' This contemporary ```Hamlet,'' starring Ethan
Hawke, has a raw, fresh street energy that moves with vitality
through a Manhattan world of corporate takeovers, youthful angst,
and media overload. Even when its conceits only seem conceits,
Michael Almereyda's reworking persuasively plugs Shakespeare's
existentialism into today's ephemera. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``Road Trip'' Labored gross-out stuff, set in motion when a
guy at college in Ithaca, cheating on his girlfriend at college in
Austin, hits the road to head off a compromising video before she
gets it in the mail. Its masturbatory fantasies go after the
``American Pie'' set with jokes about anal probes, sperm banks, a
wacko roommate who has a white-mouse moment, and a French-toast gag
that will put you off breakfast for days. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Small Time Crooks'' Woody Allen is in a comfortable comic
groove as an ex-con dishwasher who strikes it rich when his wife's
cookie shop, fronting his latest larcenous scheme, becomes a wild
success in its own right. Allen has all he can do to avoid being
eclipsed by Tracey Ullman, as the stripper turned manicurist turned
cookie mogul, and by Elaine May, who's no less hilarious as her
dim-bulb cousin. (PG)

COLLEGE GRADUATES NEED ADVICE ON HANDLING MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It doesn't take long for reality to edge out revelry in
the minds of new college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Before the mortarboard and gown are packed away, decisions have
to be made about where to live and work, what to drive, and how to
pay for it on a graduate's piddling starting salary. Within a few
months, coupon clipping replaces bar hopping.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how it used to work.
</P>
<P>
   Things look different for the class of 2000. Many of this year's
grads have another problem entirely: what to do with all their
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an insignificant question,'' said Mark Podolsky,
president of the Financial Planning Association of Massachusetts.
``In today's world, grads need to understand that decisions they
make right off the bat can have quite an impact later in life.''
</P>
<P>
   What everyone understands is that the hot economy and lack of
available workers make the landscape for this generation of
graduates different from any before it.
</P>
<P>
   Average starting salaries reported by this year's graduating
class are as much as 12 percent higher than those of a year ago,
according to an April survey by the National Association of
Colleges and Employers. Inflation has risen 3 percent over the same
period, and workers' wages overall have gained 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those gains put new work-force entrants at pay scales their
parents didn't see for decades, if ever. Many graduates, especially
in high-tech fields, will garner a starting salary of $50,000 or
more this year _ on top of a $5,000 to $10,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The good times extend beyond Web design and computer science _
and beyond elite schools such as Harvard and MIT. Even liberal arts
majors from small colleges are seeing their worth rise, thanks to
the labor shortage in many fields.
</P>
<P>
   There have been similar wage hikes every year since 1993. Over
the past seven hiring seasons, starting salaries have jumped almost
60 percent for computer science majors and almost 40 percent for
those in electrical engineering, according to the association of
colleges and employers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices, meanwhile, are 19 percent higher than they were
in spring 1993, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And
incomes for all workers are roughly 30 percent higher, the American
Compensation Association estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago, students had to chase after recruiters for
interviews,'' said Dom DeLeo, director of the career center at
Boston College. ``These days, as often as not, it's the recruiters
working to make themselves attractive to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Camille Luckenbaugh, director of the National Association
of Colleges and Employers salary survey, ``Everyone is benefiting,
even majors you wouldn't associate with the new economy. The past
three years have marked the . . . best time to come out of college
that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Myatt, who graduated Friday from Babson College in
Wellesley, knows about the recruiting frenzy firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old from Salem, N.H., who acknowledges he got his
degree in management and management information systems ``without
the highest GPA in school,'' said he was bowled over when virtually
every company he chatted up at fall job fairs wanted to interview
him. Another called Myatt after a chance encounter with one of the
firm's executives on the MBTA.
</P>
<P>
   He narrowed his choices to a trio of high-tech companies. By
early January, he had offers from all three that included starting
salaries approaching $50,000, stock options, tuition reimbursement,
and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely wasn't trying to play one company against
another, but the recruiters kept calling and asking if there was
anything they could do'' to influence my decision, Myatt said.
``They were really good offers, and I'm still amazed they were all
coming after me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he accepted a job as a consultant at Boston-based
Zefer Corp., the company whose executive he had met on the train.
</P>
<P>
   Myatt won't be rich overnight, but he is making more money and
earning more stock options than he thought possible even a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all pretty unexpected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all graduates are surprised by the process, though.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis University senior Daniel Lieberman, who graduated
Saturday, said he expected to find a job without too much trouble.
But he was still thrilled when his two top picks came through with
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many places do the kind of work I'm interested in,'' said
Lieberman, a 21-year-old New Yorker who majored in economics with a
focus on environmental studies. ``I was worried about finding a job
that I really wanted to do, that I liked.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't turn out to be a problem. Two months after he sent
out his first resume, Lieberman landed a $35,000 job ``with really,
really great benefits'' as an environmental researcher at ICF
Consulting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman acknowledges that the new economy doesn't treat
all majors equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who had studied economics, like me, did pretty well,''
he said. ``A lot of other people I know in the social sciences or
humanities are still looking.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly news to Sara Ramsey, who graduated from Simmons
College with a degree in communications. Ramsey knows she would
have fared better with a business or high-tech focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend who double-majored in communications and
computer science, and she landed a great job paying $49,500 plus a
signing bonus,'' she said. ``The rest of us are wondering whether
we should have done the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ramsey is not too concerned about finding a job. And she
knows that when she does, it'll probably pay more than the liberal
arts grads of yesteryear first earned.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring there were plenty of positions to be had, she focused
on academics rather than an intense job search during the school
year. This summer, she will earn $10 to $15 an hour doing marketing
work at Pangaea Multimedia in Cambridge, Mass., where she interned
during the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the market is right now, jobs are popping up here and
there,'' said the 22-year-old Maine native. ``I'll find something
by the end of the summer and, if I don't like it, I always have the
option to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding how to handle good fortune is an enviable problem, said
Beth Kobliner, author of ``Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance
in Your Twenties and Thirties.'' But it's still a problem, she
said, especially in a world that forces an increasing amount of
financial self-responsibility on young workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a cliche at this point, but you're entirely on
your own when it comes to saving for retirement and taking care of
your long-term financial security,'' Kobliner said. ``And the scary
part is that you can't make up for this time if you miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduates seem to be getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Iowa State University survey found that half of college
students start worrying about their finances before they graduate.
Among people ages 20 to 39, the survey found 87 percent fretting
over money.
</P>
<P>
   Podolsky, of the Financial Planning Association, and president
of Financial Solutions Associates in Dedham, said the key for new
graduates is assessing their financial priorities and how to
address them. They can't just use their parents or grandparents as
models, either.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates ``have different issues and different time frames at
that age,'' Podolsky said. ``It really is a unique time,
financially speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to address, Podolsky, Kobliner, and others
agree, is how to use an employer's benefits package. Some benefits
are limited or unavailable if you don't sign up for them at the
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock options are great, but realize that they won't
necessarily pan out,'' Kobliner said. ``Just in case they don't
make you filthy rich, make sure you cover the basics through other
benefits,'' including disability insurance and a 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   But you also need to do some things on your own, said Debra
Neiman, a certified financial planner with the Neiman-Maloy
Financial Group in Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not `politically correct' for grads who feel flush to
talk about budgeting, but it's critical that they learn to live
within their means,'' Neiman said. ``Call it a spending plan, if
you have to, but do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommends financial software, such as Quicken or Microsoft
Money. Such products combine the discipline of a budget with the
flexibility and high-tech appeal of a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come out with a relatively high starting salary,
you'll probably think the sky's the limit,'' Neiman said. ``At
least putting numbers into the software or on paper forces you to
see the limitations and tradeoffs associated with your decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, financial professionals agree, is to do all
things in moderation. No matter how moneyed you feel as a new
graduate with a healthy salary, avoid the temptation to rush out
and buy the flashiest car or rent the ritziest apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As crazy as it sounds right now, buy a Toyota instead of a
Lexus and live in Allston instead of Beacon Hill,'' Podolsky said.
``Invest the rest, so you can take advantage of this super
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't, you'll regret it when you're older.''

`SLEEPY HOLLOW' A NODDER; `CARNIVAL OF SOULS' SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Sleepy Hollow'' _ Director Tim Burton and star
Johnny Depp worked together in ``Ed Wood'' to create a contemporary
masterpiece. But masterpieces don't happen often _ especially in
the movies _ and Burton and Depp's adaptation of Washington
Irving's legendary story falls short. Despite marvelous special
effects and a solid performance from Depp, the film lacks dramatic
construction. If Burton spent as much time creating character depth
as he did weaving the effects, ``Sleepy Hollow'' might have
achieved more than a few frights in the night.
</P>
<P>
   DVD PICK OF THE WEEK: ``Carnival of Souls'' _ Herk Harvey, an
industrial filmmaker, had the idea of making a movie about a church
organist who's haunted by things after a nasty car wreck. And
that's all he had. He did not have good actors. He had no money to
speak of. And he had to shoot the whole movie on less than a
shoestring. So why is this black-and-white, low-budget B movie so
creepy? Through a marvelous restoration and excellent supplementary
material _ including very smart and informative liner notes _ this
two-disc set is a prime example of how limitations can be
transformed into assets. The odd camera angles, out-of-synch sound,
and various other ``mistakes'' only lend a terrifying credibility
to the proceedings. It was Harvey's only feature. At $39.95, it's a
bit pricey to own, but well worth renting.

MILLIONAIRES, ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you want to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can surf to Internet sites that say they can help you
become one, live like one, or even date one.
</P>
<P>
   And _ no surprise _ they all can be found at Web addresses with
the word ``millionaire'' in them.
</P>
<P>
   One site in particular is good at giving personal finance advice
that, even if it doesn't get you to a million bucks, can help you
reduce debt and get on the road to saving and investing.
</P>
<P>
   Another site is little more than an advertising vehicle for a
magazine for millionaires and millionaire wannabes, as well as
companies looking to market to this high-end niche.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Web site for the TV show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' Here, you can relive some of the ``celebrity
millionaire'' moments, play an online version of the game, and look
up long-lost relatives and friends who might have been
million-dollar winners on the show. (The one contestant with my
last name _ no relation, as far as I know _ won nothing but his 15
minutes of fame.)
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the sites reviewed were rather marginal _ one was
even pornographic _ so don't think every Web address with the word
``millionaire'' in it holds the secret to riches. And don't think
an address with the word ``billionaire'' or ``zillionaire'' does,
either.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything on the Internet, check your source and view
all information with a critical eye.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a Web site that proclaims ``Date a Millionaire,''
actually posts a message from a plumber who says he and his fellow
plumbers aren't millionaires, but ``we make a good $150,000 a year
and thats (sic) pretty good. It is so hard to find a good woman who
isn't completely nuts about money and biased against blue collar
(sic) guys.'' This site, www.talktoamillionaire.com, also says it
lets you speak to a celebrity, beginning at $250 for a 15-minute
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Another site that probably should be viewed critically is
www.internetmillionaire.com. Touting itself as the ``on-line stock
traders (sic) guide to profits, success and riches in the 21st
century,'' this site says it averaged 113 percent return in 1999,
and provides a free report of ``10 Internet stocks that will change
the world.'' However, nowhere on the site is there an update of
what the returns are this year, with tech stocks now severely
beaten down. But the site projects a ``500 percent growth on our
Internet 2000 Portfolio between 2000 and 2003,'' and says you can
subscribe to its ``Circle of Wealth Newsletter'' for $125 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary of some of the millionaire Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   --www.armchairmillionaire.com: As of January, this became part
of the Investorama network of financial Web sites. Here, you can
learn what the site calls the ``five steps to financial freedom,''
read the stories of real people in the ``Armchair Millionaire's
Gallery,'' and use an interactive ``Million Dollar Portfolio Tool''
to figure out how you can get to that magical figure. Information
about the five steps _ lower your taxes, pay yourself first, invest
automatically, build a smart portfolio, and start today _ is
readily available to anyone who visits the site.
</P>
<P>
   But to use the portfolio tool, you must sign up for a free
Investorama membership. The tool asks for your age, how much you've
saved already, your take-home pay, and your savings rate. Then it
calculates how many years it will take you to reach a million, if
you follow the site's recommended action plan.
</P>
<P>
   The site recommends building a simple long-term portfolio made
up of three mutual funds, one that mimics the S&AMP;P 500 index of
large-capitalization stocks, another the Russell 2000 index of
small-cap stocks, and the third the Morgan Stanley EAFE index of
stocks in Europe, Australia, and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   --www.millionaire.com: With the motto ``The Very Best the World
has to Offer,'' this Web site for Millionaire magazine features a
chance to subscribe at $100 a year (pocket change for a
millionaire). It also offers the ability to patronize advertisers
selling everything from luxury loans of up to $30 million, to puppy
and kitten pendants and pins hand-sculpted out of 18-carat solid
gold with diamonds, to ``pre-owned'' Lear jets (for the
budget-conscious millionaire). The site also allows you to apply
online for a no-annual-fee, 3.9-percent-introductory-rate,
Millionaire Platinum Plus Master Card; learn about a Utah and
Bahamas-based international law firm that specializes in offshore
tax-minimization and asset protection; or buy a luxury waterfront
estate from a Boston-based affiliate of Christie's Great Estates.
But, like everyone else, millionaires must also read the fine
print: At the bottom of a Web page of ``featured'' penny-stock
companies on the site's InsiderStreet.com link, visitors are told
``some of the companies featured on this site have compensated
InsiderStreet.com to be profiled on this website.''
</P>
<P>
   --www.abc.go.com/primetime/millionaire/mill_home.html: And if
you need your Regis Philbin and ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
fix, you can come here to see video clips of your favorite
episodes. You can also play an online version of the game, enter a
sweepstakes to ``be a millionaire for a week,'' or buy the CD-ROM
version of the game. You can also find out how to become a
contestant on the show if you'd like to try your luck and know-how
at winning a million dollars. And, if you'd rather mooch off of
someone else's million bucks, you can find out if you know any of
the previous big winners.

$90,000 INHERITANCE CAN MAKE RETIREMENT COMFORTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. We will be inheriting $90,000 and are interested in Roth
IRAs and mutual funds. We feel we can add $12,000 a year to our
retirement savings over the next 20 to 25 years. What is our
retirement outlook?
</P>
<P>
   K.B., Arlington, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A. If you devote the entire inheritance to your retirement
accounts, you would be in marginal shape to retire after 20 years,
and in solid shape in 25 years. If you don't devote the inheritance
to retirement savings, you certainly would have to wait 25 years
before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   If you add the $90,000 to retirement savings and add $1,000 a
month for 25 years, you would have an accumulation of $1,671,630
after 20 years, presuming 10 percent average annual investment
returns. The pool would grow to $2,827,324 after 25 years. But if
you fall prey to the many other attractions that $90,000 can buy,
your retirement accounts (including the taxable holding in Janus
Worldwide) would amount to only $1,012,107 after 20 years, and
$1,8742,379 after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   So what's so shabby about $1 million plus? Consider the
ever-present bugbear of retirees: inflation. In 20 years, you will
need $159,183 to buy what $80,000 buys today if inflation averages
3.5 percent annually; the figure would be $189,059 after 25 years.
Even if you presume that you can live in retirement on 65 percent
of your current income, you would still need $103,469 after 20
years and $122,888 after 25 years to support a standard of living
equivalent to what $52,000 a year buys today.
</P>
<P>
   So, suddenly that $1 million doesn't loom so large.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is to put the inheritance in a stock mutual fund,
then withdraw $4,000 a year to fully fund Roth IRAs for both
yourself and your wife. After 25 years, you could expect to have
$683,774 in your taxable accounts, $441,719 in the tax-free Roth
IRAs, and $1,701,995 in the tax-deferred 403(b), a nice balance
that would allow you to manage your tax liabilities well.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, I'd suggest putting $50,000 of the
inheritance in a fund such as Vanguard Index 500 or USAA S&AMP;P 500,
and $10,000 each in funds such as Vanguard Mid-Cap Index, Vanguard
Small-Cap Index, Vanguard Health Care, and USAA Science and
Technology. When you move money from the taxable fund accounts to
the Roth IRAs, you can simply move to the same funds but with a
different tax status.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will leave the Navy in June and start working toward a
graduate degree in journalism. The two-year program will cost
$41,000 after a small fellowship; I might be able to earn an
additional $2,600 a year as a teaching assistant. I am not eligible
for need-based financial aid but can take student loans. I am
considering putting the savings account money in a CD or money
market fund and taking student loans to avoid dipping into stock
funds.
</P>
<P>
   D.D., San Diego, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. So you've heard journalism isn't a racket with fancy
salaries, and you figure you had better hang onto that $66,926 you
saved? A pretty good idea _ especially if the student loans are the
type that accrue interest only after you complete your studies.
Taking the loans gives you the option of paying them off two years
hence, just at the point that you would have to begin paying
interest.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, with any luck, your portfolio should have achieved
some gains. You should also be in a position to figure out your
likely budget once you begin working, and to decide whether you
will be able to bear the cost of the loans from your earnings, and
thus allow your stock funds to remain in your portfolio. Either
way, you'd have had a two-year interest-free loan.
</P>
<P>
   If you adopt that strategy, though, I'd suggest you move to a
less aggressive fund than PBHG Emerging Growth fund, which holds a
pretty risky portfolio. If you encounter a couple of tough years
with this fund while you are in graduate school, you could find
your options might not be as attractive upon graduation. Even with
the American Century Ultra fund, you would have the risk that your
returns over those two years would be negative, but I would view
that as a smaller risk.
</P>
<P>
   You could, of course, decide to park the money in the stock
funds in CDs or money markets during those two years, but you would
also doubtless pay an unpleasant tax bill if you did that. I'd be
comfortable if you decided to move from PBHG Emerging Growth to one
of the many Standard and Poor's Index 500 funds, which would at
least somewhat reduce the chance that a sizable part of your stock
savings might evaporate while you are cracking the books.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Ours is a single-income family, and I woke up about a year
ago and realized I was not putting nearly enough aside for
retirement and was not being aggressive enough with my 401(k)
investments. At the time, I had 80 percent of my money in a stable
value fund, and 10 percent each in Vanguard Institutional Index 500
and Vanguard Primecap. I contribute $450 a month to the 401(k) and
my employer matches with $160. Would you say the moves I have made
are too aggressive or not aggressive enough, and what more do I
need to do to be able to retire at 59 1/2?
</P>
<P>
   D.H., Beaumont, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Unless you make some pretty dramatic changes, retirement at
59 1/2 seems pretty problematical. If you save at the current rate
for 13 1/2 years and achieve average annual investment returns of
10 percent, you would accumulate $489,435, which will be nowhere
close to enough to support you in retirement, even at a somewhat
reduced standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, you are saving a little more than 8.5 percent of your
earnings, a respectable rate for a person who starts saving early
and invests well. I think you were right to change your 401(k)
allocations, but because you've probably been saving for only about
10 years and have had low investment returns for most of that
period, you need to catch up. I don't know enough about your costs
to suggest how much you might be able to add to your savings, but I
do suggest you try to save more.
</P>
<P>
   Also, move the credit union IRA to a more aggressive investment.
I'd move the entire account to the Vanguard Health Care fund, and
try to supplement the account with ongoing contributions. (But if
you have not reached the maximum for your potential employer match
to contributions to your 401(k), you should favor investments there
until you get to the maximum match.)
</P>
<P>
   You are not being too aggressive or too tame in your investment
choicess. You have a good mix. What you need is not better
investments, but to save more or retire later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
______ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute prediction: Next weekend at the latest, Vanguard's
Index 500 fund will probably take over from Fidelity Magellan as
the world's largest mutual fund. Although Index 500 had been
creeping up on Magellan in terms of assets under management in
recent years, its ascendancy just became a matter of time when
Magellan closed to new investors. Entering last week, Index 500 was
just $193 million behind Magellan, whose assets stood at $104,799
million.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's not about money. It's about time. One seems to be
devouring the other. The times are good, sure, but time? Forget it.
We are temporal paupers in this economy that is roaring like a
hungry lion and swallowing the clock whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a vacation,'' we groan in the deepening Sunday twilight
of another pathetically short and overprogrammed weekend. How can
it be Monday morning again? Didn't we just do that? Nobody leaves
the house until we find Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The ``downsize now'' gurus pontificate about simplicity from the
radio, TV, and bookstore windows. Yet another beatific author is
being interviewed about the joys of blowing the whistle on stress
and making cookies with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. But who's got time to look for the whistle in this
mess? Pass the Oreos, kid, and pour your own milk.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Glaser understands.
</P>
<P>
   She's an imperfect guru, in town to speak at a recent Simmons
College executive women's conference. She lets her hair flop at the
end of a long humid day. When she reaches into her purse for press
information and discovers she brought the wrong bag down from her
hotel room, she shrugs and laughs. She doesn't have all the
answers, but she does have two teenage sons and so juggles her
lecture and consulting schedule to spend no more than one or two
nights in a row away from her home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   She's the coauthor of ``When Money Isn't Enough: How Women Are
Finding the Soul of Success,'' written with Barbara Smalley _ a
book that could easily be about men, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increments,'' she says to the interviewer, who is frazzled
from a slow ride in Boston's Friday traffic and pressing the guru
for the secret formula that will defuse the time bomb. ``It starts
with recognizing stress.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem. But then what? And how long does it take to reach
nirvana in rush hour?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you ever get there,'' she says. ``It's a
process. You can't stay sedentary in life. It's about choices,
always about redefining success and making choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Her book is full of people who walked out of the executive suite
to a home business, or who decided to ``plateau'' on a comfortable
career ladder rung and not climb anymore, or who went back to the
old job when the impressive promotion fried the brain and soul.
</P>
<P>
   Inspirations all, but a reader wants to hear more about that
first step _ the second step, really, after recognizing stress. How
does a person break through the inertia of success and start fixing
what, by most standards, is working beautifully?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to figure out what you want,'' Glaser says. Never as
easy as it sounds, and a career coach or counselor can help. ``You
start with baby steps. Maybe you work at home a couple mornings a
week. Then you might look at job sharing, flex time, a part-time
position, or a leave of absence.''
</P>
<P>
   The boss won't laugh either, she says. The economy that's
creating those high-powered jobs and the attendant stress is also
creating a shortage of workers. So companies are scrambling to hang
on to good people.
</P>
<P>
   She knows a partner of a top accounting firm who is working part
time. Companies offer concierge services, laundry and dry cleaning
shops, minisupermarkets in the cafeteria, day care, some on-site
schooling, and a lactation room for nursing mothers. ``Unheard of a
few years ago,'' she says. ``Time is the currency of the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Her book is the outgrowth of two earlier volumes on women in the
workplace, also written with Smalley _ one on communication called
``More Power to You,'' and one on surviving in the macho corporate
culture, titled ``Swim With The Dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women tell me they're more successful than they ever thought
they'd be, but that something is missing,'' notes Glaser. ``They
say, `This is why I made all those sacrifices _ Hello?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The book focuses on women because they still often have primary
responsibility for children and home, and ``the issue of balance is
more in their face.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says the quest for time ``is much more than a woman's
midlife crisis. There's a shift in perception about what work is.
Our parents' generation were willing to work for the paycheck. Now
people want more.''
</P>
<P>
   Or less.

THE ECHOING MOMENTS OF A FADING TIBET

THE SEARCH FOR THE PANCHEN LAMA 
By Isabel Hilton. Norton. 336 pp. Illustrated. $25.95. 
 
VIRTUAL TIBET 
Searching for Shangri-La from the Himalayas to Hollywood 
By Orville Schell. Metropolitan. 340 pp. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traveling in Tibet two years ago, I chanced upon the summer
palace built by the Chinese for the 10th Panchen Lama in Shigatse
in the 1950s. It was a cavernous place, shuttered and rarely
visited. But one upstairs room was comfortably furnished, and on a
shelf were a half-dozen children's toys _ an airplane, a car, a few
stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   I motioned to the elderly monk who was leading us around. ``They
are here for him when he comes,'' he said, smiling _ meaning the
little boy the Chinese government had then recognized as the
reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Several years before that, while in Dharamsala to interview the
Dalai Lama for the BBC, journalist Isabel Hilton ``became gripped''
by the hints she picked up about the reincarnation search that was
then underway, five years after the death of the 10th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following year, as one child was recognized as the 11th
Panchen Lama by the Dalai Lama, then supplanted by a second boy
chosen by the Chinese government _ the little boy of the toys _
Hilton's unusual access to the Dalai Lama involved her to the point
where she became an accomplice in his efforts to have his chosen
boy recognized by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It is to Hilton's credit that she has not let her role
overshadow the drama and significance of the story of the search
itself. And she has surrounded that account with a rich, even
entertaining, account of Tibetan history and religion focused on
the traditional role of the Panchen Lama as the spiritual
counterpart to the Dalai Lama as political leader.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed in the West by the extraordinary appeal of the
present (14th) Dalai Lama, the 10th Panchen Lama emerges in
Hilton's account as a tragic and sympathetic figure who supported
needed social and political reforms but fell victim to the turmoil
of Maoist China.
</P>
<P>
   In the present situation, the Buddhist belief in reincarnation
has great political significance because after the death of either
the Dalai Lama or the Panchen Lama, the other must recognize his
reincarnation. The implications of the search for a reincarnated
Panchen Lama, writes Hilton, were thus ``clear to a regime in
Beijing which had spent decades seeking the key to the pacification
of Tibet.'' For if the newly reincarnated Panchen Lama was under
Beijing's control, then acting through him, Beijing could control
the selection of a 15th Dalai Lama when that time should come.
</P>
<P>
   (The value of this strategy, of course, seems diminished after
the flight earlier this year to India of the Karmapa, the
14-year-old lama who was the leading religious figure still in
Tibet and was widely believed to be loyal to Beijing.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the search, Hilton's account is as close to being an
``authorized version'' as there is likely to be, and is supported
by details that could only be known to an insider. One that neatly
captures the shifting line between the sacred and the profane in
contemporary Tibet concerns the visit by senior lamas to the sacred
Lhamo Latso lake in October 1994, as the search was in its final
stages.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing ceremonial cloaks and reciting mantras, they sat on a
high ridge above the lake, looking for some sign in the water to
help them identify the reincarnated Panchen Lama, Hilton writes.
``They held bells and dorjes of tantric ritual, and from time to
time picked up a pair of binoculars to scan the surface. Behind
them, serving monks made tea and prepared food, while one filmed
the ceremony on a video camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's role in all this was to enable the Dalai Lama to
identify _ on camera _ his chosen child and convey the name to the
leader of the search inside Tibet, who would then conclude the
search so as to win Beijing's unwitting approval of the Dalai
Lama's choice. This ``innocent subterfuge'' fell apart when the
Dalai Lama announced the choice prematurely. The Chinese reacted by
scooping up the chosen boy _ his present whereabouts are unknown _
and anointing their own choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibet of which Hilton writes _ binoculars and video camera
aside _ is a Tibet closer to medieval Europe, with its ``close
association'' of the spiritual and the temporal, than ``a kind of
religious Disneyland.'' That land of Western imagination is the
``Virtual Tibet'' chronicled by China scholar Orville Schell, whose
insider's view of the filming of ``Seven Years in Tibet'' is a
mirror image of Hilton's view of the search for the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lively and vastly entertaining account in which Tibetan
monks transplanted to a mock-up Lhasa in the mountains of Argentina
mingle with a Hollywood film crew with everything focused on a
single mythic figure _ except that it's actor Brad Pitt, not the
Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   But as Schell notes, the Tibet of tradition is likely to survive
only as a ``virtual Tibet'' because ``so many vestiges of
`mysterious' (or, in Chinese parlance, `feudal') Tibet have been
expunged from the face of that occupied land.''
</P>
<P>
   This same sense of what is disappearing comes through when
Hilton adds to a discussion of a future search for the
reincarnation of the present Dalai Lama the caveat, ``if, indeed,
there will be a 15th Dalai Lama.'' It may well be that Hilton has
seen _ and participated in _ one of the final moments of a lost
Tibet.

RED MAFIYA 
How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America 
By Robert I. Friedman. Little, Brown. 296 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Friedman, you are a bad man, a liar!''
</P>
<P>
   That's the reception freelance journalist Robert I. Friedman
received when he arrived unannounced two years ago at the home of a
Russian mobster living outside Denver. The crime boss, posing as a
businessman, wanted nothing to do with Friedman's request to talk
about the Red Mafiya's explosive growth in the United States. He
slammed the door in the writer's face.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade that Friedman has been tracking the Russian mob,
he has faced far worse. There was the death threat he received from
one of the most powerful Russian mobsters in this country,
Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov. The Valentine's Day card that
Ivankov mailed Friedman was certainly heartfelt: It contained a
passionate promise to torture and kill the writer, as Friedman
recounts it.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman has had to go into hiding at times, and he came to
possess a bulletproof vest in the course of his reporting on the
new, big thing in the nation's underworld, the Russian mob. He's
out there, occupying a no man's land of sorts _ ahead of most of
the nation's mainstream press in covering the Russians and even
ahead of much of law enforcement, particularly the FBI. The new
mobsters came of age in a lawless Russia and now do business here
with little regard for the customs that have long defined the
playing field for the cops, the mobsters, and the journalists who
cover both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Italians will kill you,'' Friedman writes, quoting from a
government wiretap of a conversation between a John Gotti associate
and another Italian underworld figure. ``But the Russians are crazy
_ they'll kill your whole family.'' Friedman says a retired New
York City policeman warned him the Russian mobsters will ``shoot
you just to see if their gun works.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's new book, ``Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has
Invaded America,'' is the culmination of his groundbreaking work to
date, parts of which have appeared in articles in the magazines New
York, Vanity Fair, and Details, and in The Village Voice. Mixing in
his own experiences trying to uncover the story, Friedman provides
a lucid and important overview of the Red Mafiya's US expansion
from its original beachhead in the Brooklyn neighborhood of
Brighton Beach. ``In North America alone,'' he writes, ``there are
now thirty Russian crime syndicates operating in at least seventeen
US cities, most notably New York, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles
and Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Mafiya, Friedman has found, does it all, and does it
well. Extortion, drugs, murder, money laundering that has ensnared
some of the largest US banks, and even international arms deals
involving submarines, helicopters, and other weapons plundered from
the former Soviet Union's military arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey fans also need to take note. Friedman describes Russian
mobsters shaking down some of the Russian-born hockey stars now
playing in the National Hockey League. ``Alexander Mogilny of the
Vancouver Canucks, Alexei Zhitnik of the Buffalo Sabres, and
Vladimir Malakhov of the Montreal Canadiens have all been targets
of extortion. Even Detroit Red Wings superstar Sergei Federov was
rumored to have had to pay gangsters to be left alone when he first
came to America.''
</P>
<P>
   The book documents how a number of players maintain close ties
to several of the Russian crime bosses operating here and, most
troubling, how the NHL brass has largely turned a blind eye to the
risk this poses to the game's integrity. ``The real question is why
the NHL tolerates its presence,'' says Friedman. For anyone who
cares about the game, the disclosures are shocking and deeply
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an important theme of Friedman's work is the slow
reaction to the growing menace displayed not only by the NHL but by
just about every sector of society _ the politicians, the press,
the public and, perhaps most important, law enforcement. The FBI,
addicted to the Italian La Cosa Nostra, has been slow to respond to
the Russian mob. ``If not for its (the FBI's) own sluggishness in
addressing the problem, the Russian mob in the United States would
never had become as powerful as it is today,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the FBI's stubborn fixation with La Cosa Nostra,
Friedman cites a second critical reason for law enforcement's delay
_ Jewish politics. ``Because the Russian mob was mostly Jewish, it
was a political hot potato, especially in the New York area, where
the vast majority of refugees were being resettled by Jewish
welfare agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   By far, the strength of this book is its reporting. Friedman
explains the influx of Russian mobsters, which accelerated after
the breakup of the Soviet Union, actually began in the early 1970s,
``when Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev had agreed to allow the
limited emigration of Soviet Jews, (and) thousands of hard-core
criminals, many of them released from the Soviet Gulags by the KGB,
took advantage of their nominal Jewish status to swarm into the
United States.'' He first got onto the story a decade ago while
reporting on the Italian Mafia and, ``I was introduced by a
Genovese organized crime family source in New York to several of
his Russian criminal colleagues, a meeting that opened a door to me
into this little-known, nearly impenetrable ethnic underworld.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is organized as a kind of rogues' gallery _ set
pieces on key Russians, such as Ivankov, the boss who Friedman says
threatened to kill him, or the gangster ``Tarzan'' (Ludwig
Fainberg) who operated mainly out of a Miami strip joint, Porky's.
Each piece tends to unfold similarly: The figure is introduced in
his US locale, then his Russian roots are explored and, finally,
the narrative returns to present criminal activity. I would have
preferred a bit more variation; as strange as it may sound given
their frightening lawlessness, the gangsters began to run together.
(Too often, for example, a new mob figure is introduced as ``one of
the most feared.'') It is clear that in the past decade there have
been several successful prosecutions of Russian mobsters, and
perhaps the book's flow would have benefited by switching to the
point of view of one of the investigators and going deep inside the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   I also wish Friedman had included notes on each chapter. To his
credit, he has won the confidence of many investigators and
underworld figures and obtained reams of classified documents. But
I often found myself wanting to know more about a particular
investigation, information as basic as a case's docket number. It's
the staple of back-of-the-book notes; unfortunately, there are none
here.
</P>
<P>
   But these are nit-picks. This is gumshoe reporting at its best.
Friedman has succeeded reportorially in ways writers about
organized crime usually don't: namely, obtaining many face-to-face
interviews with the actual crime figures. And he's done it all
while flying virtually solo, without the powerful institutional
backing journalists working for the top newspapers can expect.
Ivankov has threatened him, another gangster sued him for libel,
and another tried to bribe him. Fending off the bids to silence him
are apparently part of the turf that comes with exposing the Red
Mafiya, ``a brutal, innovative, multi-billion-dollar-a-year
criminal enterprise.''

ONCE AGAIN THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL LEADS TO THE BOOKSTORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Campaign 2000 books began arriving even before many
candidates had officially started running. Some 12 months ago we
got our first spate of so-called ``definitive'' biographies of the
candidates, including one wild, soon-discredited George W. Bush
tome by an ex-con. John McCain got the jump on would-be chroniclers
by putting out a well-received memoir; Bush put out a
not-so-well-received autobiography himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the second wave. This time around we get
quasi-objective commentary in the form of biography (''Inventing Al
Gore,'' by Bill Turque), essays (''The Case Against Hillary
Clinton,'' by former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan), and
sharp-edged fiction (''The Running Mate,'' by Joe Klein). Each
approach is clearly intended to sway reader-voters, though Turque
and Klein would probably argue they're trying to play everything
down the middle. Noonan is openly trying to convince Americans in
general, and New Yorkers in particular, that it's time to bid
Hillary and Bill farewell.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Inventing Al Gore,'' Turque, a longtime Washington
correspondent for Newsweek, revisits old scandals and suggests some
new ones. Far from being the well-rounded son of caring parents,
Vice President Gore was, Turque suggests, molded for a successful
political future by an ambitious mother and father (himself a U.S.
senator). When Albert Gore Sr. lost his last Senate election in
Tennessee because voters there perceived him as too liberal, mostly
on Vietnam, son Al took the lesson to heart and determined he would
avoid controversial positions when possible.
</P>
<P>
   (This was certainly not true regarding environmental issues. In
his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore wrote, ``The voice of
caution whispers persuasively in the ear of every politician, often
with good reason. ... The integrity of the environment is not just
another issue to be used in political games ... and the time has
come to take more political risks _ and endure much more political
criticism _ by proposing tougher, more effective solutions and
fighting hard for their enactment.'')
</P>
<P>
   Turque makes a strong case that powerful Albert Gore Sr. eased
his only son's upwardly mobile path _ first by gaining him cushy
duty during the Vietnam conflict (Al Jr. was unaware of this,
Turque notes) and, later, giving him a necessary financial base for
a political career by cutting the then-twentysomething in on
lucrative land deals.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the son made his own cautious way, heading off drug
accusations by admitting he inhaled, though not often (Turque
thinks Gore puffed a lot more than he publicly lets on) and molding
himself into the sort of conservative Democratic candidate
Tennessee voters eventually sent to the House of Representatives,
then the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Turque devastates Gore by contrasting many of his public
comments with his private actions _ any Republicans who believe
Molly Ivins was too tough on George W. Bush in ``Shrub'' ought to
read ``Inventing Al Gore.'' Without resorting to hyperbole, simply
by quoting Gore and then examining records, Turque skewers the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Gore's 1996 public lambasting of the tobacco industry
_ and his tearful invoking of the 1984 death of his sister, Nancy,
from lung cancer _ Turque notes that ``seven years after Nancy's
death, (Gore) continued to take contributions from cigarette
manufacturers and grew tobacco on his farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   In all, Turque concludes, Al Gore is ``a man who at critical
moments has proclaimed independence and then retreated from it,
stood on principle and then deferred it to political ambition.''
Far from inventing the Internet, the Al Gore presented to readers
by Bill Turque has continually re-invented himself to suit
prevailing political winds. Especially because Turque has presented
his themes so objectively, based on facts rather than innuendo,
it's a chilling picture, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Equally scary is Peggy Noonan's ``The Case Against Hillary
Clinton,'' but for a much different reason. No one would expect
arch-conservative Noonan to write a book praising the first lady
and senator-wanna-be, and she hasn't. We assume that Noonan, the
writer who crafted many of Ronald Reagan's speeches, will be quite
persuasive presenting an anti-Hillary case, and she is:
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton ``does not seem as big as the emotions she
engenders ... to me she seems more like an odd thing that happened
to us, a person of average insights, above-average intelligence,
and below-average character who somehow has come to fasten our
gaze.''
</P>
<P>
   On page after page, Noonan effectively eviscerates her subject.
Hannibal Lecter never carved a victim more completely than Noonan
slices and dices Hillary Clinton. Every reported scandal is
reiterated, and every Clinton response delineated:
</P>
<P>
   ``With a consistency that would be called heroic if it were
applied to a high purpose, she will keep her smile on, hug
children, speak in airy phrases no one could disagree with (`Our
children are our future'), stick to the script, and try very hard
not to answer questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Noonan blows it _ monumentally.
</P>
<P>
   Around the middle of her 181-page book, Noonan describes
``something you probably do not know about, something (Hillary) did
that astonished me because it really did take nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the Columbine school shootings, Noonan
reports, Hillary Clinton met secretly with all the top TV and film
industry moguls ``at the beautiful hillside home of Michael Eisner,
the famous CEO of Disney.'' There, Noonan relates, Clinton
castigated the bigwigs for producing material that not only
depicted but somehow encouraged violence, and warned them frankly
that unless they mended their ways she would openly oppose them,
even though she and husband Bill had always counted on their deep
pockets for campaign support.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing changes I'll try to make your lives difficult,''
Clinton declares. ``I'll lead the charge; I'll lead a boycott, and
this one you'll feel. Because if I turn on you, it's like Nixon to
China: People will notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Noonan admits the reason we wouldn't know about this
meeting is because there was no such meeting: ``It never happened,
and, really, it never will, because Hillary Clinton doesn't feel
she can put her country's needs before her need for campaign
money.''
</P>
<P>
   How unfortunate. Noonan had plenty of ammunition without having
to make more up. Even Edmund Morris' fictional additions to his
Reagan biography, ``Dutch,'' weren't this awful, since Morris was
trying to gild the Gipper legend, not destroy it. If Noonan wanted
to publish anti-Clinton fiction, she should have written a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is what Joe Klein did in 1996 with ``Primary
Colors,'' a thinly-disguised depiction of Bill Clinton's rocky,
colorful presidential campaign of 1992. The book got most of its
attention because the author was listed as ``Anonymous.'' Media
types took plenty of guesses regarding his/her real identity _
surely it had to be a journalist covering the campaign, or perhaps
someone from the Clinton camp. Mandy Grunwald and George
Stephanopoulos were early favorites. Klein only 'fessed up when
writing experts pegged him as the prohibitive favorite. ``Primary
Colors'' became a bestseller, then a movie starring John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad so many people paid attention to who wrote the
book, rather than how he wrote it. ``Primary Colors'' really worked
because Klein _ currently a Washington correspondent for The New
Yorker _ was so masterful at providing small, telling details about
daily political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Running Mate'' proves ``Primary Colors'' was no fluke.
Once again, Klein reveals the bone marrow of politics through
fiction _ though readers can, of course, spend happy moments
deciding who is based on whom.
</P>
<P>
   Protagonist Charlie Martin, a maimed Vietnam
veteran-turned-senator from an unnamed Midwestern state is, no
doubt, a mix of Nebraska's Bob Kerrey and Arizona's John McCain,
among others. Charlie, coming off a failed presidential try _
beaten in the Democratic primaries by Jack Stanton, the Clinton
doppelganger introduced by Klein in ``Primary Colors'' _ wants to
reorganize his staff, get an old pal a prominent position in the
Stanton administration, grow close to a just-discovered
illegitimate son, marry a New York businesswoman after too many
years as an eligible bachelor and, just maybe, have Stanton pick
him as running mate.
</P>
<P>
   This lengthy to-do list comes together as Charlie fights a
fraudulent claim of sexual assault (the alleged victim's father
decks the one-handed Charlie in front of the media), faces a Senate
challenge from a colorful conservative opponent and, in general,
has to decide whether he is first a human being or a politician,
since it is apparent, despite Charlie's best efforts, that it's
impossible to be both at the same time. (Of special note is Klein's
hilarious rendering of Charlie's inability to convince Stanton he
is vice-presidential material: ``... though Stanton was making a
visible effort not to pay attention, he was reading every tea leaf,
aware that Charlie was attempting the limited, qualified suck-up
route, and thinking less of him for that. Sucking up is an art; it
has to be effortless, seamless _ anything less than totally
convincing is a disaster.'')
</P>
<P>
   Charlie is, if anything, too dedicated to his job. His
character, and Klein's convoluted story, really pick up reader
interest as the author inserts priceless insights into the
necessary trivia of political life. Charlie shuffles the paintings
and sculpture in his Senate office every month to represent artwork
from different voter groups back home; he drives a Chrysler minivan
on campaign trips because the Chrysler plant in his state has 850
more workers than the Ford plant. These are the lines that
resonate, far more than Charlie's predictable attempt to run one
final, clean Senate race, and his equally predictable failure to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   A prophecy, here: Where, a generation ago, Teddy White's
magnificent nonfiction ``The Making of the President'' series
taught readers how American politics really worked, Klein's
``Primary Colors'' and ``The Running Mate'' will serve the same
purpose for current voters. As Jessamyn West observed, ``Fiction
reveals truths that reality obscures'' _ and ``The Running Mate''
is certainly among the best fiction published so far this year,
about politics or anything else.

NEW BEACON INTO MOLECULAR WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Germany)   (The Science Times)  
 By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A glowing point at the tip of an optical fiber could someday be
the torch that lights the world of DNA, proteins and other
molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the current issue of the journal Nature, researchers
at the University of Konstanz in Germany report that they have
created a microscope that uses a single fluorescent molecule as its
light source.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of this idea,'' said Dr. Vahid Sandoghdar, a
physicist at the University of Konstanz and the paper's senior
author, ``is if you can bring our molecule to an arbitrarily close
distance, then we should get molecular resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   As microscopes using this light source are refined, they may
allow scientists to observe the receptors and channels at the
surface of a cell or how particles of light interact with
molecules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' said Dr. Shimon Weiss, a staff scientist at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. ``I definitely
think this is a breakthrough in optical imaging.''
</P>
<P>
   The new microscope is a variation of an earlier device known as
a near-field scanning optical microscope, where laser light passed
through a tiny metal pinhole at the end of an optical fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, optical microscopes cannot make out details smaller
than half the wavelength of light, or about one-100,000th of an
inch, a constraint known as the diffraction limit. One way to get
around the diffraction limit is to stick a tiny light source very
close to the sample. In that case the light beam does not have a
chance to spread, or diffract, and the resolution is limited by the
width of the light source instead of the wavelength of the light.
</P>
<P>
   This allows near-field scanning optical microscopes to make out
details as small as one-millionth of inch in width, but light
leakages through the edges of the pinhole prevented finer
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Sandoghdar and his collaborators have replaced the pinhole with
a crystal embedded with fluorescent molecules known as terrylene.
By adjusting the frequency of the laser beam shining down the
optical fiber, they can light up a single terrylene molecule. ``We
demonstrate it is possible to manipulate a single molecule and use
it as a light source,'' Sandoghdar said.
</P>
<P>
   The objects examined so far with the microscope are relative
behemoths _ triangular aluminum pyramids one-50,000th of an inch on
a side _ and the images are fuzzy compared with those taken by an
atomic force microscope, which measures the topology of a surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done is a first demonstration,'' Sandoghdar said.
``We still have a lot of work to do to do this molecule
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandoghdar's group still needs to figure out how to place the
fluorescent terrylene exactly at the tip of the crystal so that
they can place it right next to the object they are looking at.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the microscope also operates at minus 457 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 2.6 degrees above absolute zero. Most fluorescent
molecules stop working within a few minutes at room temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   These constraints will for now limit potential applications and
the number of scientists who will be able to use it. ``It's a tour
de force to get this,'' said Dr. Calvin F. Quate, a research
professor in electrical engineering at Stanford University, ``and I
don't think it will be as widespread as other probes are.''
</P>
<P>
   For this microscope to be of use to biologists, more stable
fluorescent molecules need to be found. ``If you don't have that,
you don't have your microscopy,'' Weiss said. ``You want this
flashlight to be on. The question is how far it can be pushed. Can
this or something like this be pushed to room temperature?''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the ultracold temperatures, the new microscope could be
used to see how photons scatter off molecules or shuffle between
two fluorescent molecules. ``You would be doing
nano-photochemistry,'' Sandoghdar said, ``how one molecule reacts
with another.''

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON ARE JUST THE TIP OF ICEBERG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER DREIER AND FRANCES FOX PIVEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The demonstrations in Seattle last December against the World
Trade Organization, and in Washington, D.C., last month against the
International Monetary Fund are only the visible tip of a new
social ferment that is spreading across the United States, in
workplaces, campuses, and on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Agitation is growing over rising inequality, neighborhood
decline, and continuing environmental degradation. And while the
specific issues often differ, the common rallying cry is that
democratic rights should take precedence over growing corporate
power.
</P>
<P>
   Why now, when the economy is on a roar and unemployment is at a
historic low? The fact is that the dizzying increases in wealth and
profits celebrated in the gilded ghettos of Beverly Hills and
Scarsdale aren't making life better for many Americans, who find
themselves working harder for wages that lag behind historic
trends. Meanwhile, the millions of working poor and the destitute
are simply not part of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The big, spectacular demonstrations make the press, but the
evidence of insurgency is much more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is on the move, with strikes among janitors, truck
drivers, and airline pilots reflecting unions' growing
assertiveness. John Sweeney's election as AFL-CIO president four
years ago brought a new cohort of activists to the leadership of
many of the national and local unions. They are working to revive
social movement unionism, reaching out to form alliances with
community and campus groups, and reviving the old union emphasis on
organizing the unorganized, which means focusing on low-wage
service and manufacturing workers who are mainly immigrants, women,
and people of color.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, the Service Employees International
Union in Los Angeles won a union election for 75,000 home-care
workers, the largest single union victory since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups are also in motion. Living-wage campaigns in
more than 100 cities have brought together community organizations,
unions, and local church leaders, and in 34 cities they have
already won laws that require companies contracting with city or
county governments to pay better wages.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, demonstrations against police brutality have become
commonplace. In Atlanta, Coca-Cola is the target of demonstrators
demanding minority hiring. ACORN, a network of community
organizations, has launched a national campaign challenging banks
and insurance companies for their red-lining and predatory lending
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Community organizations affiliated with the Industrial Areas
Foundation are waging campaigns for better affordable housing, job
training, and local schools in dozens of cities. And organizations
of poor women and advocates are beginning to wage state and local
campaigns to modify the draconian new national welfare laws so
that, for example, poor mothers are not yanked out of school for a
workfare assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Bus Riders Union in Los Angeles, using lawsuits and
protests, has forced the regional transportation agency to add more
buses and reduce fares. A national coalition of environmentalists,
small farmers and consumer groups is challenging the ``gene
giants'' _ global companies like Monsanto and Novatis _ for their
promotion of the ``corporatization'' of agriculture and their
production of genetically-engineered food. Successful ``clean
money'' campaigns in Maine, Arizona, Vermont, and Massachusetts
have resulted in tough state public campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   And campuses have come alive. College students, and sometimes
high school students, are protesting sweatshop conditions, in the
developing world and in American cities. On more than 200 campuses,
student activists have succeeded in getting administrators to adopt
codes to guarantee that clothing with college insignias is not made
under sweatshop conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, students at Johns Hopkins, Tulane, Yale,
Purdue, Macalaster, Wesleyan, State University of New York at
Albany, and the Universities of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan,
Toronto, Kentucky, Oregon, Arizona, and Iowa have staged hunger
strikes or acts of civil disobedience to demand living wages, both
for the workers who produce their clothing, and for the college
employees who clean their dorms and serve their food.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators will inevitably judge the protests
unnecessary. But they are wrong. As in earlier gilded ages _ the
1890s, the 1920s _ corporate greed and corporate political
influence have grown together. Business money floods our elections
and K Street lobbyists write our legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, mass protest has sometimes worked to make political
leaders accountable to their democratic base, and brought us the
changes that have tempered the excesses of unbridled markets. In
the progressive era, radicals and reformers led the way for
legislation that today is the framework of corporate antitrust and
health and safety regulation. In the 1930s, movements of workers,
farmers, the aged, and the unemployed dramatized the effects of
pervasive economic insecurity and poverty and forced the creation
of our basic social welfare legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Protest movements can force American politicians to listen to
ordinary people who are usually ignored. They make democracy come
alive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With high-carbohydrate foods getting such a bad rap, it is
refreshing to hear about new findings that clearly demonstrate the
health value of a carbohydrate-rich diet, as long as it contains
the right carbohydrates, replete with soluble and insoluble fiber,
the way nature made them. Fiber has also been knocked around a bit
lately, after three disappointing studies failed to find that a
high-fiber diet helped to prevent colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If that were the only discouraging fact about fiber, I would say
you could safely abandon bran muffins, whole-grain cereals, beans
and peas and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables and return to a
pristine diet of pasty white bread. But dietary fiber, as the new
study so graphically showed, has myriad health benefits. The study
also shows that people need not resort to a very low-fat diet to
reap those benefits, as long as the fat in their diets is also the
right kind.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published this month in The New England Journal of
Medicine, involved 13 patients with Type 2 diabetes, which
typically starts in midlife and accounts for 90 percent of diabetes
cases in this country. Each patient diligently followed one of two
diets, each for six weeks, eating foods supplied by the Center for
Human Nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center in Dallas and keeping careful dietary records. Both diets
would on their face be considered healthful, meeting the guidelines
established for Americans. But with one not-so-drastic change, the
experimental diet was clearly superior.
</P>
<P>
   The standard diet supplied 24 grams of fiber daily (8 grams of
soluble fiber and 16 grams of insoluble fiber), as recommended by
the American Diabetes Association. The experimental diet supplied
double the fiber _ 25 grams of soluble and 25 grams of insoluble
fiber daily _ without supplements or foods artificially stoked with
extra fiber.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the participants consumed normal, unfortified,
tasty foods found in any supermarket, foods like oranges and
cantaloupe; oatmeal, granola and whole wheat bread; green peas,
tomatoes and zucchini with foods like chicken breast, ham, eggs and
pasta. Participants had no difficulty downing the high-fiber diet;
it contained nothing weird or unpalatable. It was food as food, not
as medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effect of the experimental diet mimicked improvements
commonly associated with medications. There were fewer spikes in
blood sugar and insulin levels, meaning the diabetes was better
controlled and less likely to damage blood vessels and nerves.
Blood lipid levels _ or fat _ dropped too. In addition to lower
total cholesterol, blood levels of heart-damaging triglycerides and
very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced on the
experimental diet by as much as typically results from
lipid-lowering drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Since diabetes greatly increases a person's risk of developing
heart disease and other disorders caused by fat-clogged arteries,
the results of this study are highly significant to the 14 million
Americans with Type 2 diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In this study, participants did not lose weight, since their
diets were designed to prevent weight loss from masking the
benefits of fiber. But other studies have shown that a fiber-rich
diet greatly helps someone trying to lose weight. Fiber enhances
satiety. It fills people up before it fills them out. It slows the
absorption of foods, as if someone was eating many mini-meals, and
thus delays the time when the person feels hungry again.
</P>
<P>
   Although the American Diabetes Association and other health
groups recommend a diet containing no more than 30 percent fat,
surveys have shown that most people with diabetes derive 34 percent
to 40 percent of their calories from fat. And far too much of the
fat is artery-damaging saturated fat from animal products instead
of the more protective monounsaturates found in olive oil, canola
oil, nut oils and avocados. In the Dallas study, the added fat used
in both diets was olive oil, which not only benefits the heart and
blood vessels but may also protect against some cancers.
</P>
<P>
   A second study of people with diabetes showed that reducing
dietary fat by replacing five typical high-fat foods with versions
made with less fat significantly lowered the participants'
consumption of cholesterol and saturated fat. Again, the substitute
foods were readily available.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from Florida International University in Miami,
reported that eating the fat-modified foods ``did not cause people
with diabetes to overconsume those foods or other foods.'' It also
resulted in a decrease in caloric intake. Their study was published
in The Journal of the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use of low-fat or fat-free foods may allow people with
diabetes to continue to eat their favorite foods, while
considerably decreasing their intake of saturated fats, cholesterol
and energy,'' the Florida team wrote. This approach would enable
people with diabetes to consume more protective monounsaturates
without increasing their caloric intake.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general and the American Diabetes Association
recommend that, at a minimum, people pursue 30 minutes of moderate
physical activity almost daily. Among the many benefits to someone
with diabetes are reductions in risk factors for heart and blood
vessel diseases, including lowering blood lipid levels and blood
pressure, a lessened tendency to form artery-blocking clots and a
reduction in weight.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking demonstration of the benefits of exercise,
published last month in The Annals of Internal Medicine,
researchers at the Cooper Institute and Clinic in Dallas assessed
fitness and activity levels and monitored death rates for 12 years
among 1,263 men with Type 2 diabetes. After taking into account
factors that could distort their findings, the researchers found
that participants in the low-fitness group had double the death
rate of men who were fit. Those who reported being physically
inactive had a death rate 70 percent higher than those who said
they were physically active.
</P>
<P>
   This and another study in Sweden ``suggest that the amount of
exercise needed to achieve a cardioprotective benefit is modest,''
said Dr. Charles M. Clark Jr. of the Richard Roudebush Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data supporting the health benefits of physical activity
are overwhelming,'' he said in an accompanying editorial.

   PREVENTION: For Children, a Safer Race to the Hospital
</P>
<P>
   For children who need medical attention at hospitals, the danger
may not end when they are placed in ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Children's Center
found that it was not uncommon for patients and medical equipment
to be unsecured as ambulances sped to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, part of an effort to improve ambulance safety,
were presented this month in Boston at a meeting of the Pediatric
Academic Societies and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nadine Levick, an emergency medical specialist at Johns
Hopkins, emphasized that the findings were not an indictment of
ambulance safety. The goal of the study, she said, was to assess
conditions in the typical ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   With that information in hand, a team of doctors and engineers,
supported by the federal government, intend to design tests,
complete with crash-test dummies, similar to those used to assess
the safety of passenger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is, anything we can do to make this a safer
environment is a plus,'' Levick said.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances have a high crash rate per mile traveled, but the
crashes tend to be minor, Levick said.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers observed 200 ambulance arrivals at an
unidentified urban hospital involving 206 patients and 636 other
occupants. The observers found that in 11 percent of the cases,
patients on gurneys were not strapped in at all. Ten percent
traveled on a parent's lap. And many types of emergency medical
service equipment were found to be either poorly secured or not
tied down at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rx MONEY: Save at One End, Spend at the Other
</P>
<P>
   Reducing medical costs has become a major goal in the age of
managed care, but a new study finds that can be trickier to
accomplish than it may seem.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main ways to reduce costs is by shortening as much as
possible the amount of time people are hospitalized. They are now
told to come in as close to surgery as possible, for example, and
discharged far earlier than was the practice in the past.
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons at the Boston University School of Medicine took a
look at the savings associated with the early discharge of patients
who had had heart bypass surgery, they found that in many cases the
medical costs were simply shifted elsewhere, including to nursing
services in the home or extended-care facilities. And in some
cases, when problems arose, the patients had to be quickly
readmitted to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were presented earlier this month by Dr. Harold
Lazar, a cardiothoracic surgeon, at a meeting of the American
Association for Thoracic Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   According to the university, researchers compared bypass
patients from 1990 with those from 1998, when patients spent an
average of 3.8 fewer days in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   HAZARDS: When Magnets Make a Heart Go Bonkers
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas A. Mattioni treats patients for heart disease, so he
takes no position on whether the alternative-medical practice of
sleeping on magnets has any effect on arthritis or other joint
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattioni does have a warning for those using the magnets who
also have implantable pacemakers or similar devices called
cardioverter defibrillator: be careful. The magnets, usually placed
in mattress pads, can change the settings on the pacemakers and
turn off the defibrillators _ with potentially fatal results.
</P>
<P>
   Mattioni, director of electrophysiology at the Arizona Heart
Institute in Phoenix, presented his findings at a conference this
month of the North American Society of Pacing and
Electrophysiology.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said he had known nothing about the use of
the magnets until several patients asked him about them. Mattioni
and colleagues then began ordering the products on the Internet and
trying to gauge their effect.
</P>
<P>
   The magnets are placed not just in mattress pads but worn around
the arms, legs and waist. The researchers found that as long as the
magnets were kept six or more inches from the heart devices _
usually implanted in the upper arm _ there was no problem. So for
people who use wearable forms of the magnets, there is generally no
problem.
</P>
<P>
   But people who sleep on mattress pads with magnets have a much
higher risk of being affected, the researchers found. If someone
using a defibrillator gets too close to a magnet in the pad, for
example, the device may fail to deliver the needed jolt of
electricity if the heart fails.
</P>
<P>
   Mattioni said he had no way of knowing how many people used the
magnets. About two million people in the United States use
pacemakers, and 250,000 have the defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: Words of Warning to Help Stop SIDS
</P>
<P>
   Putting infants on their backs when they go to sleep is a widely
accepted technique for reducing the risk of sudden infant death
syndrome, but doctors need to do a lot more to get the word out, a
new study finds.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one percent of parents and baby sitters surveyed reported
that their babies' doctors had not told them how to put the
children down to sleep, say researchers for the National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in The Journal of the American Medical
Association, also found progress in the fight against SIDS. Deaths
have gone down almost 40 percent since a campaign emphasizing
having children sleep on their backs or sides began in 1994. About
3,000 babies a year die from the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said a significant disparity remained
between whites and blacks. From 1994 to 1998, they said, stomach
placement decreased to 17 percent from 44 percent among white
infants; for blacks during the same period, the rate was 32
percent, down from 53 percent. (Black infants are 2.2 times as
likely to dies of SIDS as are white ones.) The researchers urged a
greater effort to educate black parents.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors did make recommendations, the study found, parents
and others were more likely to place babies on their backs. ``I
think that if they're not doing it, then they should be,'' said
Marian Willinger, a SIDS specialist at the health institute,
referring to doctors. The key, she said, is consistency, so that
babies get used to the position.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE LAB: A Mouse Made for Heavy Drinking
</P>
<P>
   First it was mice that could eat to their hearts' content
without getting fat. Now it's mice that can hold their alcohol
better and recover from it faster.
</P>
<P>
   First, scientists at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of
New Jersey reported that they had created a genetically modified
mouse that could eat with abandon. The long-term objective is
better understanding of human obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists at the University of Washington report creating
a mouse that drinks much more alcohol than it would ordinarily. The
goal here is more insight into alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say they have bred mice missing a gene that
bears instructions for making an important brain protein. The mice,
they say, drink twice as much alcohol as do mice with the protein.
</P>
<P>
   And, given injections of alcohol raising blood-alcohol level to
almost three times the driving limit, the mice recovered in about
65 minutes. (Ordinary mice needed about 90.) The findings were
reported in a recent issue of The Journal of Neuroscience.

CULT OF THE COLON: FROM LITTLE LIVER PILLS TO BIG OBSESSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (The Science Times)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a grand leap of logic about 100 years ago, doctors pinpointed
the cause of violent crime, suicide, nervous exhaustion, insomnia,
fatigue, headaches, confusion, sexual dysfunction, bad skin,
baldness, tuberculosis, gum disease, cancer and spinsterhood. The
culprit was intestinal stasis, leading to that horror of horrors,
autointoxication. It was, please pardon the term, constipation.
</P>
<P>
   It was universal. Astute doctors could spot victims everywhere,
even on city streets, by their telltale greasy skins and septic
open mouths. Autointoxication meant that toxins from backed-up,
rotting wastes were seeping into their bloodstreams, poisoning
their bodies and minds. They needed help. They needed cleaning out.
They needed laxatives, roughage, special exercises, trusses,
gut-pounding massages, abdominal vibrating machines and a menacing
array of equipment to administer ``internal baths'' and restore
muscle tone to their flaccid innards. Sometimes, they needed
drastic surgery to rearrange their insides.
</P>
<P>
   This obsession with the bowels was more than a mad moment in the
history of medicine. It went on for a century or more, and it is
not over yet, according to a book published in March, ``Inner
Hygiene'' (Oxford University Press), by Dr. James C. Whorton of the
University of Washington in Seattle. The book is exhaustive and
scholarly, but, thank goodness, it is also a wry chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who grew up puzzling over delicately worded radio ads
for peculiar products like Serutan (``nature's spelled
backwards''), Sal Hepatica and Carter's Little Liver Pills, or
wondering how Grandma could have become addicted to Feen-a-Mint
laxative chewing gum, Whorton's book will explain it all.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that constipation causes a great deal of
suffering and can be serious, especially in elderly or chronically
ill people. But the notion that it is the root of every illness is
nonsense. The idea, however, had been around for centuries, and it
was truly embraced by doctors and the public in the United States
and Europe in the 1800s. It kept its hold on medicine until well
into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   By Whorton's account, a giant in the fight against constipation
was the London surgeon Dr. William Arbuthnot Lane, who had his
heyday during the first decade or so of the 20th century. He
convinced people that virtually everyone was chronically
constipated, and he made up a theory to explain it: The human
digestive system had evolved in four-footed ancestors, and when
people stood up on two legs, gravity was too much for their
intestines, which drooped, kinked and got clogged.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was a great believer in mineral oil, and he gulped it down
several times a day himself and also dosed everyone around him with
it, including his family, his servants and his parrot, Whorton
reports.
</P>
<P>
   But advanced cases were too far gone for mineral oil, and Lane,
who was said to be a brilliant surgeon, devised ever bolder and
more useless operations, taking out more and more of people's
intestines to relieve them of kinks and blockages. Most of his
patients were women, some of whom married after the surgery, for
which Lane took credit, claiming that no one would have married
them before he straightened out their knotted guts, improving both
their looks and their dispositions.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s Lane's theories and operations had been discredited
and even ridiculed by his colleagues, one of whom pointed out that
by his gravitational theory, penguins, gorillas and especially
bats, since they hang upside down, should suffer terribly from
constipation.
</P>
<P>
   But the cult of the colon still ruled, and gave rise during the
1920s to a laxative industry and volumes like ``Intestinal
Management for Longer, Happier Life.'' No matter that doctors said
anything from three times a day to once every three days was
normal, there was money to be made by convincing people of the
great peril of ``irregularity.''
</P>
<P>
   An American ad during that era warned that poisonous gases would
spread through the body unless ``bowel bloat'' was cleaned out
gently but thoroughly with Cascarets Candy Cathartic. Other ads
claimed that laxatives were a great way to lose weight, and Ex-Lax
called itself ``the secret of natural beauty.'' Food crazes for
bran, yeast, yogurt and sour milk to prevent constipation also
sprang up during the 1920s, and Battle Creek, Mich., home of
Kellogg's All Bran and Post Grape Nuts, became the cereal capital
of the world, marketing products to promote regularity.
</P>
<P>
   All of this might seem like a quaint and amusing chapter in the
history of weird medical beliefs. But is it history?
</P>
<P>
   Given Americans' current preoccupation with high-fiber diets,
and their endless parental fussing over the contents of children's
diapers, one could easily argue that old fears of autointoxication
must still be with us. As late as 1986, the National Institutes of
Health was still writing pamphlets to reassure the public that the
human body did not absorb poisons from retained feces.
</P>
<P>
   Today, herbal and alternative medicine magazines carry ads for
``cleansing programs'' that promise to rid the body of toxins that
linger in the intestines in a slimy layer of something called
``mucoid plaque.'' Americans still spend $600 million a year on
laxatives.

   A. Fish contains quite a bit of a substance that gives rise to
two chemicals that make the rotten-fish smell, while red meat has
hardly any, said Dr. Joseph Hotchkiss, a professor of food science
at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   The two chemicals are trimethylamine and dimethylamine, both
derived from trimethylamine oxide, which is particularly common in
the flesh of fin fish, especially cold-water, surface-dwelling
ocean fish like the cod. Ocean fish start to smell faster than,
say, catfish, Hotchkiss said.
</P>
<P>
   When the fish is killed and exposed to the action of air, its
own enzymes and bacteria, Hotchkiss explained, that causes the
trimethylamine oxide to undergo a chemical process called
carboxylation. The products are amines, which are volatile and
quite odoriferous.
</P>
<P>
   Fish dealers test for the amount of amines to determine how
fresh fish is, ``and the consumer's nose knows, too,'' Hotchkiss
said. ``But those who do not eat fish find it more objectionable
than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pass around a vial with the chemicals that cause fish
to stink in a beginning food science class, the reactions differ,''
Hotchkiss said. ``Students from inland northern countries find it
obnoxious; those from southern marine areas, with different
cultural backgrounds and food habits, find it much less
offensive.''

DR. LAURA BERATES, LECTURES AND INSULTS AUDIENCE IN HER BEST
BEDSIDE MANNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Dr. Laura Schlessinger is cutting someone else off in
midsentence, berating her caller, and it makes you think _ people
actually listen to this?
</P>
<P>
   Every day?
</P>
<P>
   Without a gun to their head?
</P>
<P>
   In less than an hour on one recent afternoon, the acid-tongued
and holier-than-thou California-based radio personality/pseudo
shrink:
</P>
<P>
   _ Suggests that a woman pretend she is adopted as a way to deal
with a family problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tells a woman not to marry a boyfriend because her son doesn't
like the guy _ without asking how long the two have been dating or
if they're already engaged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Browbeats a woman for ``whining and complaining'' about her
father's role in her life as her wedding approaches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turns an innocuous question about explaining sex to a child
into a shrill, rambling diatribe against the feminist movement,
abortion and bad parents, which she says are legion. The feminist
movement, to paraphrase Dr. Laura, has made women unpaid
prostitutes and men bums.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interrupts everyone who calls in. Often.
</P>
<P>
   And this is mild compared to what Schlessinger says about
homosexuals: She has called them ``deviants'' and ``biological
errors,'' thus incurring the wrath of gay-rights groups around the
country _ as well as a group of Canadian broadcasters who want her
banned from the airwaves. Schlessinger later issued an apology for
her comments, but her critics are unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura makes Rush Limbaugh sound good natured and open
minded. And this will likely get worse before it gets better. With
two new books in publication and a talk show debuting next fall on
CBS, she's going to be grating on our ears more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things you should know right off about Dr. Laura:
She did not earn a Ph.D in psychology or psychiatry; she got her
doctorate in physiology, which is the study of the functions of the
body. She does have a license as a counselor from the University of
Southern California in 1980. She also was an adjunct professor at
Pepperdine University. But, overall, she has fewer credentials than
television's Dr. Frasier Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger, 53, is in fact, a talk-show shock jock, in love
with the sound of her own opinions, delivered in a self-righteous
screeching tone that makes a New York City subway train sound
soothing. But don't say any of that to her face _ she has a black
belt in karate.
</P>
<P>
   OK, on occasion she makes some good points (see the list below).
But she spews them in an abrupt, unpleasant manner, with an air of
unbridled disgust and dislike for the world around her _ the real
world, where people get divorced, where both spouses in many
families have to work to make ends meet, and where stuff happens.
</P>
<P>
   Her tone is summed up by the tag line repeated before her
commercials: ``I'm Dr. Laura Schlessinger _ now go do the right
thing!'' delivered in an authoritative clean-your-room-this-instant
tone. Compassion is not one of her strong suits.
</P>
<P>
   She is somewhat hypocritical as well. She rails against the
feminist movement, which sowed the seeds that enabled women like
her to become successful. She cautions against two-income families
raising children while being part of one herself. She is married
and has a son, Deryk. Her husband, Lewis Bishop, is a former
biology teacher who manages her career.
</P>
<P>
   And there is her bedside manner _ or lack of one. Chiding and
intimidating callers hardly sounds like the best way of helping
people with their problems, which she says is her objective.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the louder and more objectionable she gets, the more
successful she becomes. So it's time we take a closer look at this
one-woman wrecking crew.
</P>
<P>
   DR. LAURA DOES DALLAS: In Big D, they still talk about
Schlessinger's behavior at a 1997 Jewish Federation of Dallas
fund-raiser. According to several sources, Schlessinger behaved
horribly from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   First, she refused three suites at the Grand Kempinski (she
finally deigned to stay at The Mansion on Turtle Creek), and then
refused to ride in a car with the three women who arrived to take
her to the event because they wore perfume.
</P>
<P>
   At the event, Schlessinger (despite being paid $30,000) mingled
with guests for only five minutes. She then, according to columnist
Maryln Schwartz of The Dallas Morning News, ``berated everyone and
said that anyone who was not as Orthodox as she is wasn't a Jew.''
Guests were astounded, and several hundred walked out. ``She was
just very nasty and insulting. She also got up and walked out
without taking several gifts given to her,'' Schwartz says.
</P>
<P>
   DR. LAURA DOES TV: ``Dr. Laura,'' her one-hour TV talk show,
debuts Sept. 11 on CBS on 175 stations (95 percent of the country),
despite numerous protests by gay rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth-Dallas, the show will be on KTVT/Channel 11,
despite protests from about 100 people on April 15 at the station's
Dallas studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're contractually obligated to carry the show, as are CBS
stations around the country,'' says station vice president and
general manager Brian Jones. Jones says ``Dr. Laura'' is
tentatively scheduled to air from 4 to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a studio audience and live guests and phone-in
elements,'' he says. ``The show will feature a balanced perspective
of a variety of issues and that's what we know. It doesn't exist
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Jones says he met with the leaders of several organizations at
the protest. ``It's the beginning of an ongoing dialogue,'' he
says. ``We all now have open channels. I anticipate more feedback
and conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Count on it, says Steve Atkinson, activism chair of the Dallas
Gay and Lesbian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect there will be more protests if the show airs,''
Atkinson says. ``We want the show not to air and that's what we're
going to keep working toward. I don't think anybody could tell us
with a straight face that if she put forth negative stereotypes
about any other group of people _ Jews or blacks or Hispanics _ she
would be given a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's feeding into fear and hatred, and I firmly believe we
have to hold people accountable when they contribute to a climate
of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't hate ``everything'' Dr. Laura says _ heck no. Here are
10 points she's made that most people would agree with:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's good to donate stuff you don't want anymore to the less
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children should not demand presents and throw fits in stores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Narcissism can kick your behind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men and women do dumb things that mess up their lives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think before you have children. And then think again.
</P>
<P>
   _ You can't have everything you want.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's good for families to spend time together.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's better to take control of your life than whine about
being a victim.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children are not commodities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Having a conscience and using it are important.
</P>
<P>
   SCHLESSINGER ON THE SHELVES: Dr. Laura has published six books;
the two most recent ones are:
</P>
<P>
   ``Parenthood by Proxy'' (Cliff Street Books; $24 hardcover) and
``But I Waaannt It!'' (Cliff Street Books; $15.95 hardcover).
</P>
<P>
   The first is a pro-family/pro-stay-at-home-mom tome in which
Schlessinger lashes out against mothers working outside the home,
calls day care ``a symptom of feminist paranoia,'' takes women to
task for ``prioritizing'' career over kids, and warns all parents
about wanting to be their kids' friends instead of disciplining
them and setting boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parenthood'' also rails against the ``movement'' for same-sex
marriages, saying said the movement is ``to satisfy adult desires,
and to hell with the children, if there are any.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I Waaannt It!'' is Dr. Laura's second children's book _
one that takes children to task for whining and not appreciating
what they have. Sammy and his mom go to the toy store to buy
presents for cousin Rachel. But Sammy demands toys, throwing an
in-store kicking-and-screaming fit until he gets his way. He can't
sleep, though, and soon realizes that it's his beat-up old toy, Mr.
Cat, that makes him happy. The new toys he no longer wants are
donated to a children's home.

each have the obligation and the responsibility to live our lives
in a way that helps perfect the world. I take that very
seriously.''

   ISRAEL-LEBANON (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
long-planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon seemed to be suddenly
accelerating out of control Monday, with Hezbollah guerrillas
driving Israeli-allied militias out of border command posts and
northern Israeli residents fleeing south in fear of Hezbollah
rocket attacks. Israeli warplanes repeatedly bombed Hezbollah
followers moving into the border zone, killing five civilians and
wounding another 25, according to reports from Lebanon. Fearing
Hezbollah reprisals, the Israeli army ordered frontier residents
into bomb shelters, but hundreds chose instead to leave and drive
far out of Katyusha rocket range. By William A. Orme Jr.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ NATO has been slow to
provide information on last year's airstrikes on Kosovo and has
delayed the marking and clearing of unexploded bombs, in particular
the dangerous cluster bombs, the head of the U.N. mine operation in
Kosovo said Monday. His comments came as American peacekeepers
reported a 10-year-old boy was killed, and two other children were
seriously wounded on Sunday by a cluster bomb in an unmarked site
in southern Kosovo. Over 100 people have died, and hundreds more
have been injured, in mine and bomb accidents since refugees

an unusual lineup of justices that reflected differing views both
on the extent of the problem the 1996 law was passed to address _
the unwanted ``bleed'' of signals from cable channels that a

   Mystery Reproduction
</P>
<P>
   How's your love life? Hopefully it's better than that of a class
of small organisms called bdelloids, who haven't had so much as a
date in at least 40 million years.
</P>
<P>
   Bdelloids (like their sex drive, their ``b'' is silent) are
rotifers, tiny invertebrates that live in fresh water and other
moist habitats. With some 360 described species, bdelloids are the
largest class of multicelled animal that reproduces asexually.
There are no male bdelloids, and no hermaphrodites either.
</P>
<P>
   Asexual reproduction is usually thought of as a sure route to
extinction. Thus the flourishing of bdelloids for all this time
(the oldest specimens have been found in 40-million-year-old amber)
has been a puzzle. Some scientists thought the animals might have
been having sex behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Harvard, reporting in the journal Science, have
now provided strong evidence that there has been no hanky-panky.
The researchers analyzed chromosome pairs in several bdelloid
species, and compared them to pairs from other rotifers that
reproduce sexually.
</P>
<P>
   The bdelloid pairs were found to be fundamentally different from
the nonbdelloid pairs, with far more variation in DNA sequences
among the pairs. This is a sign that the chromosomal pairs evolved
through asexual reproduction over a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say that further studies should provide more
insight into the reasons bdelloids are exceptions to the general
rule that asexual reproduction is an evolutionary dead end.
</P>
<P>
   An Asteroid Rediscovered
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid 719 Albert was discovered in 1911 by an astronomer
at the Imperial Observatory in Vienna, Austria, back in the days of
the Austro-Hungarian empire. It was seen on two successive nights
in October of that year.
</P>
<P>
   But then, it seems, Albert went out and never came back. The
asteroid disappeared, too faint to be seen even when one of the
best telescopes in the world was used to look for it in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 89 years after it was lost, Albert has been found again.
Astronomers from the University of Arizona discovered an asteroid
this month using a telescope at Kitt Peak, and analysis by the
Minor Planet Center of the International Astronomical Union
determined that it was Albert. With the rediscovery, the location
of all the numbered asteroids, of which there are 14,788, is known.
</P>
<P>
   The rediscovery has enabled astronomers to calculate its orbit
more precisely. It is not surprising that it has been hard to find
_ its orbit takes it about 300 million miles from the sun. Its
initial discovery in 1911 coincided with a time once every 30 years
when it comes closest to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A Comet Is Discovered
</P>
<P>
   Albert may have been lost for the better part of a century, but
comet K2 was never even found.
</P>
<P>
   The comet was missed when it passed through the solar system in
1997, although it was bright enough to be seen by professional or
amateur astronomers. It has only been discovered now, using what is
hardly a comet-watcher _ the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory,
otherwise known as the Soho spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Soho has an instrument on board that maps the solar wind by
measuring emissions from hydrogen atoms at ultraviolet wavelengths.
Comets emit large amounts of this same kind of radiation, as water
molecules are broken apart by sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Using archived data from 1995 to 1998 from the instrument,
researchers in Finland and France identified 18 comets, including
such well-known ones as Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake. But among five
detected from mid-1997 data, the one now called C/1997 K2 was
previously unknown.
</P>
<P>
   While K2 wasn't the brightest light in the firmament, it was
brighter than some other comets discovered by amateur astronomers
that year. And it stayed at a constant brightness for several
months. The researchers, who described the discovery in Nature, say
that it points out the need for full-sky comet surveys.

<P>
   In a culmination of concerted efforts initiated by one
determined family, three groups of researchers are reporting that
they have found the gene mutation that causes a rare disorder known
as pseudoxanthoma elasticum.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery is being published Tuesday in The Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences and on June 1 in two papers in
Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators say the gene, known as ABCC6, directs cells to
make a protein that is similar to others, known as ABC
transporters, that shuttle small molecules in and out of cells. Now
that they have identified the gene, they say, they can begin
figuring out how it contributes to disease, diagnose it prenatally,
test for it in people whose symptoms are ambiguous and look for
ways to treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the gene had its origins in 1994, when a puzzled
mother took her 6-year-old daughter to a dermatologist to ask about
a persistent rash on the little girl's neck.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Sharon Terry of Sharon, Mass., had noticed the rash
a year earlier but assumed it was of no consequence and would go
away. Finally, she asked a dermatologist what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he looked at it, he said, `pseudoxanthoma
elasticum,''' Terry recalled. ``Then he glanced at my son, who was
4 at the time, and said, `Gee, he has it too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Terry, who has a master's degree in religious studies, and her
husband, Patrick, who manages a construction company, had never
heard of the rare genetic disorder, which causes mineralization of
tissue. They spent the weekend at the library of the University of
Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester reading everything they
could find about it. They quickly realized that not much was known.
It was rare _ affecting an estimated one person in 25,000 to
50,000. It had an array of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can develop bumps on their skin, their skin can sag and
wrinkle, blood vessels in their gastrointestinal tracts and those
in the legs can be blocked, causing pain, and so can vessels in the
heart, causing heart attacks. But the disease's most likely serious
consequence is a calcification and cracking of the membrane behind
the retina. Blood leaks into the eye, causing progressive and
severe loss of vision, with many becoming nearly blind by the age
of 40.
</P>
<P>
   But the 400 papers that the Terrys found on the disease were
just case studies. ``We knew right away that we did not want to
wait in the deli line for our number to be called and whine `when
will you do our disease?''' Terry said. They wanted to make it
irresistible for scientists to find the gene that causes it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they set up a foundation, PXE International, found
2,000 patients, established a repository of patients' tissue,
raised money and enlisted with scientists. The foundation's efforts
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers who published their findings in Nature Genetics
were led by Dr. Charles D. Boyd of the University of Hawaii and Dr.
Arthur A.B. Bergen of the Netherlands Ophthalmic Research Institute
in Amsterdam. The scientist who published in The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences is Jouni Uitto of Thomas Jefferson
University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Uitto, who is a professor and chairman of the department of
dermatology and cutaneous biology at Jefferson, proposes that when
mutations disable the ABCC6 gene, toxic compounds accumulate in the
body and attach themselves to elastic tissue in the skin, in blood
vessels and in a membrane behind the retina. Terry said her next
goal was to analyze the different mutations that could disable the
ABCC6 gene to learn the reasons for the various manifestations in
different people. ``We want to find a way to slow the disease
down,'' she said. ``Our goal is to cure the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it has been an intense four years running PXE
International, Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I volunteer for the organization about 90 hours a week,'' she
said. Her husband, she adds, spends all of his free time working
for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do much else,'' Terry said. ``As my husband says, we
don't do the laundry much.''

&HT;     STATE POSTPONED ANTI-SMOKING ADS TARGETING POLITICAL DONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's top health official last year tried
to head off an anti-smoking media blitz targeting a drugstore chain
that had donated $130,000 to Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents and interviews, state health Director
Diana Bonta took unusual steps to block the California Medical
Association Foundation from using a state health grant to fund a
1999 advertising campaign criticizing the Rite Aid pharmacy chain
for selling cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The medical foundation said it targeted Rite Aid because the
company is California's biggest drugstore chain, and because its
executives had refused to limit cigarette sales in stores that are
otherwise devoted to selling medicine and health products.
</P>
<P>
   But Rite Aid also is a player in California politics, having
donated $235,000 to candidates in the 1998 state elections,
including $80,000 to Davis, who at the time was running for
governor. On July 30, 1999, shortly after the CMA Foundation says
it told Rite Aid of its planned advertising campaign, Rite Aid gave
the Democrat another $50,000, state records show.
</P>
<P>
   And after that, even though the Department of Health Services
had already signed off on the Rite Aid ads, Bonta's aides began
scrutinizing the foundation's grant contract, said Carol A. Lee,
the CMA Foundation director. No irregularities were found.
</P>
<P>
   Bonta later appealed to the foundation to shelve its ads so she
could personally mediate with Rite Aid, according to an Oct. 29
letter from the foundation responding to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's Pharmacy Partnership went ahead with its
campaign, and on Nov. 10 hit Rite Aid with a tough full-page ad in
the New York Times (``No company should profit from healing us and
harming us at the same time,'' it said) and a televised news
conference featuring a throat cancer victim.
</P>
<P>
   The medical foundation declined the health director's plea to
put off the campaign because at prior meetings Rite Aid executives
``absolutely refused'' to consider removing cigarettes from their
stores, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Bonta said she had questioned
the Rite Aid campaign because it seemed ethically inconsistent to
single out one pharmacy for selling tobacco when others do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   She also wanted to make sure that the company's management had
been given a chance to respond to the criticism before the ads were
launched. Finally, she said she had only recently been appointed to
her post, and wanted to make sure proper procedures had been
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign donations had nothing to do with it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no conversation with the governor,'' she said. ``I don't
know about the donation. That was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a brand-new person coming into the job, saying, `Hey,
what is this? How does it fit into the grand scheme . . . in terms
of targeting this company?''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, anti-smoking activists said it was unusual, and
troubling, for the health director herself to become involved in an
effort to scotch anti-tobacco ads, which are funded from the state
cigarette tax.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanton Glantz, a professor at the University of California
at San Francisco, called Bonta's action ``unprecedented'' and
``intrusive'' and said it made him question the Davis
administration's professed commitment to combating smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is shocking that the health director in the administration
of a governor who campaigned against tobacco to get elected would
stand in the way of an effort to get cigarettes out of pharmacies,
no matter how big the campaign donation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstores ``should not be out selling a product that is killing
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid public relations director Sarah Datz said the Camp
Hill, Pa.-based company sells cigarettes because customers want to
buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a retail business, and our job is giving our
customers a choice,'' she said. While Rite Aid complies with all
California laws regarding tobacco sales, she said, the company also
believes that ``it's important for customers to make their own
lifestyle and product choices.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to comment on the company's political donations.
</P>
<P>
   California's anti-smoking campaign is funded by a tax of 25
cents per pack on cigarettes imposed by the Proposition 99
initiative in 1988. The taxes, more than $40 million last year, are
earmarked to fund a wide range of anti-smoking measures, including
anti-smoking education efforts administered by the state Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort, the state has funded a series of print,
billboard and TV ads that portray the hazards of smoking in the
harshest terms.

CLUES TO MAD COW DISEASE EMERGE IN STUDY OF MUTANT PROTEINS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, six years after young people in Britain started dying from
a human strain of mad cow disease, scientists are still struggling
to understand how the disease spreads to humans, how many more will
die from it and if a similar epidemic could start in the United
States spread by infected deer and elk.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no firm answers, clues are being discovered on
an almost weekly basis as scientists explore the nature of a
mysterious infectious agent called the prion. Unlike
disease-causing viruses or bacteria, prions are normal proteins
found throughout the body tissues of humans and other animals. But
for reasons that are not at all understood, normal prions sometimes
transform themselves into tiny particles that cannot be killed with
boiling water, chemical disinfectants or strong radiation.
</P>
<P>
   These prions, almost impossible to destroy, accumulate in the
brains of infected animals and people, destroying cells and leaving
spongy holes in the tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The most common human form of this malady, called sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or CJD, seems to arise spontaneously in
the brains of about one per 1 million people. An estimated 300
Americans, mostly over age 50, die from it each year.
</P>
<P>
   But a new variant of CJD now is killing young Britons who
acquired the disease from eating cattle infected with abnormal
prions of their own. The cattle malady, called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy or mad cow disease, has infected hundreds of
thousands of animals since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago many of the world's leading prion researchers went
to Miami to meet with the families of American victims of sporadic
CJD and to tell them everything that was known about prion
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a unique medical conference,'' said Cecile Sardo,
secretary of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Foundation in Miami,
which organized the meeting, held May 7 and 8. ``When scientists
get together they talk technically,'' she said. ``They rarely talk
in person to families.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 125 people attending, half were family members and half
were medical professionals. Dr. Stephen DeArmond, a pathologist at
the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco,
explained that the normal prion protein was folded in a loopy
pattern resembling corkscrews. But when it misfolds and acquires
ribbon-like sheets, the prion becomes deadly. When a misfolded
prion comes into contact with a healthy prion, he said, it can
sometimes force the normal prion to change shape. The process
continues, like a nuclear chain reaction, until the brain is
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   It was recently proved beyond doubt that new variant CJD was a
human form of mad cow disease, said Dr. Robert Will, a neurologist
and director of Britain's National CJD. Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh. This new disease could eventually kill tens of thousands
of people in Britain or, given the many uncertainties about prion
diseases and long incubation periods, it may eventually die out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far 56 people in Britain, two in France and one from
Ireland have died of new variant CJD. British health officials
recently found a method that might assess the scope of the
epidemic, Will said. Unlike the misfolded prions in sporadic CJD,
which are found exclusively in brain tissue, new variant prions are
found in the brain, tonsils, appendix, spleen and lymph nodes.
Pathologists are examining 18,000 specimens from tonsil removed in
the last two decades; 3,000 tonsils have been tested but the
results have not been made public, Will said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest mysteries is why the new variant form of the
disease attacks young people, Will said. The British victims were
13 to 43 years old, whereas sporadic CJD affects much older people.
Will said that one possible explanation was the widespread use of
``mechanically extracted meat.'' After meat is removed from the
carcass, he said, it is compressed with a machine not unlike an
automobile crusher used in wrecking yards. Bone comes out one end
and a meatlike goo at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   This ``meat'' was once widely used in baby food and
institutional school meals, Will said. It was fed to children all
over the country, but the link between eating the food and getting
the disease has not been proved.
</P>
<P>
   No cases of new variant CJD have been found in the United
States, said Lawrence Schonberger of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. There have been a few instances of deaths
of younger Americans from CJD, but tests of their brain tissue
showed that they had sporadic forms of the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Dr. Michael Hansen, a researcher at Consumers
Union in Yonkers, N.Y., deer and elk in several western states are
experiencing a growing epidemic of a prion disease called chronic
wasting disease.
</P>
<P>
   In Larimer County, Colo., 15 percent of deer are infected,
Hansen said. Some experts fear that many hunters and their families
have almost certainly been exposed to the misfolded proteins from
eating infected deer and elk meat, Hansen said. But it is not known
if the deer version of the disease has been transmitted to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Such transmission is possible, said Dr. Byron Caughey, a senior
investigator at the Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases of the
Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont. Results of
experiments, to be published soon, show that the misfolded deer
prion can, in a test tube, convert normal human, sheep and cattle
prions into deadly prions. The rates are very low, he said, but
conversions can occur.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting, family members told researchers
horror stories about how their loved ones had been told, wrongly,
that they had Alzheimer's disease or got no satisfactory diagnoses
at all. Many said that local pathologists, fearing prions, would
not carry out brain biopsies and that some morticians had refused
to embalm the bodies of CJD victims.
</P>
<P>
   Families are confused and angry, said Mel Steiger, an engineer
from Salt Lake City, whose wife died of sporadic CJD. They want to
know if there is an environmental factor, and, he said, they worry
that officials in the United States are not doing enough to monitor
the situation.

   The best wine of the Los Angeles County Fair's Wines of the
Americas Competition, which was named Friday, might be difficult to
find.
</P>
<P>
   Announced as Best Wine of the Competition, a 1996 cabernet
sauvignon from California's Beaulieu Vineyard, Rutherford, titled
Clone 6 and priced at around $110 a bottle edged out a $12 Amador
County, California, syrah from Montevina Winery and a 1997 Pezzi
King Californian reserve zinfandel from Dry Creek that sells for
around $30.
</P>
<P>
   But the best deal of the most honored wines picked by the 60
judges from around the globe, who sipped and spat for three days at
the Millard Sheets Gallery at Fairplex in Pomona, may be the Best
in Class chardonnay, a 1998 Gallo of Sonoma bargain priced at $10 a
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   There were 2,662 entries from 500 wineries at this year's
competition, regarded by many as the most important of the nation's
elite county fair wine competitions and often the largest.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Fair wine competition began in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   This year there were two added competitions, one for extra
virgin olive oils which drew 28 entries and a wine package design
competition. Separate judging panels examined the olive oils and
wine bottle labels.
</P>
<P>
   The public will be able to taste many of the entries (wines and
olive oils) and many of the the winning wines at a fund-raising
event today at the Millard Sheets Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous years, the wines will also be available for
tasting at the County Fair, Sept. 14-Oct. 1.

   It was a moment when the sublime met the ridiculous, Jane
Goodall by way of the Marx Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Abernethy and her fellow primatologists were driving
through the Lope Reserve of Gabon, in Central Africa, a gorgeous
checkerboard mosaic of open savanna grassland and dense, galleried
tropical rainforest. Suddenly they spied a group of mandrills
crossing the road just a few yards in front of them, the
distinctively colorful primates loping along in snappy single file.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash, the scientists realized that the great monkey god
had smiled on them, and that the military procession gave them a
chance to get an accurate count of a mandrill group, something
that, although the baboonlike creatures have been known about and
admired for centuries, nobody had ever managed to do. Yanking out a
hand-held videocamera, the researchers started shooting, literally,
from the hip. As the large, raucous battalion passed in front of
her, Abernethy, of the International Center for Medical Research in
Gabon, tried to quickly describe on the videotape the sex of each
individual, and whether it was adult or juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female, female, female,'' she muttered, keeping her voice low
so as not to frighten the monkeys. ``Juvenile, female, female, big
male, big male, female.''
</P>
<P>
   The mandrills kept crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female, female, female, big male, female, female . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the classic scene in ``Night at the Opera,'' when
people keep piling into Groucho's room, and just when you think
it's stuffed beyond capacity, another guest pushes through the
door?
</P>
<P>
   ``Female, female, female, juvenile, big male, female . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Abernethy's immortal utterance (as heard on the video,
which can be seen at the new Congo exhibit at the Bronx Zoo): ``Oh,
forget it!'' Still the mandrills kept on coming . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most exciting experiences I'd ever had with
primates in the wild,'' said Elizabeth Rogers of the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland, who has worked at the Lope reserve
periodically since 1984. ``The size of that group was really over
the top, and there we were, filming it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists' excitement only mounted when they replayed the
tape and got the census they had sought: 604 mandrills, the largest
aggregation of nonhuman primates ever observed. Nor was that
particular mandrill group the most populous the scientists would
encounter. In five years of rigorous study at Lope, the scientists
have tallied hordes of 700, 800, up to 1,350.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, the primatologists have determined that the
mandrill groups are extremely cohesive. Baboons are known to
congregate while feeding in groups of maybe 150 individuals, but
such crowds are fleeting, and will fission into their core social
subunits of 30 or 40 animals once an area has been picked clean. By
contrast, a group of 800 mandrills is a tightknit and stable
society, traveling, foraging, breeding, playing, nuzzling and
bickering together year after year. (The average mandrill lives for
15 years in the wild.)
</P>
<P>
   It's like a movable version of Winesburg, Ohio _ with one big
difference. In Sherwood Anderson's fictional community, as in
nearly all primate societies, males are outstanding, if not always
upstanding, members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   But as Abernethy and her co-authors E. Jean Wickings and Lee
J.T. White of the Wildlife Conservation Society describe in a new
report that was presented last month at an ecology meeting in
Orlando, and that will be published this year, the enduring
mandrill social group consists almost entirely of females and their
dependent offspring.
</P>
<P>
   As astonished as the researchers were by the magnitude of a
mandrill society, they have been equally surprised to discover that
adult male mandrills interact with the group only when the females
are in estrus, from June through early November. Once the breeding
season is through, the males disappear, and spend the rest of the
year in distinctly unsimian solitude. They don't even bother to
form itinerant bachelor bands, as many male primates do. And should
a male happen to spy a passing flock of females in the off-season,
Curious George he ain't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll simply ignore them,'' Abernethy said in a telephone
interview from Gabon, adding, ``Male mandrills don't invest in
political relationships, as chimpanzees will. They don't establish
long-term bonds with females. When they move into a group, at the
beginning of a breeding season, they have to establish everything
from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 235 known species of primates, only the
orangutan matches the male mandrill in its taste for the monkish
life. The new findings overturn almost everything that has been
said about the behavior and social life Mandrillus sphinx to date,
and also call into question existing models of why primates form
social groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew that mandrills were amazing animals, the type
that gets featured by Disney,'' said Dr. John Oates, a zoologist
and conservationist at Hunter College, referring to the mandrills'
appearance in the animated blockbuster, ``The Lion King.'' But now
mandrills turn out to be ``so amazing,'' he said, ``that all we can
do is throw up our hands and speculate wildly about how they got to
be the way they are.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more somber note, the discoveries raise questions about the
species' long-term prospects as a free-ranging creature.
Conservationists are alarmed by how the recent rise in the
so-called bush meat trade _ the hunting of wild animals in general
and primates in particular _ might affect mandrill populations.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new studies show that mandrills travel over
unusually long distances in spectacularly large numbers,
conservationists are concerned that the monkeys will be especially
vulnerable to hunters using the ever-expanding network of logging
roads to penetrate into forests that were once inaccessible to
hunting. Some conservation organizations now rank the bush meat
trade as the single greatest threat to primates and other wildlife,
outstripping in severity even the familiar eco-villain, habitat
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case of species like mandrills, we have a real problem from
hunting,'' said Dr. John G. Robinson, a vice president of Wildlife
Conservation Society in the Bronx, which finances the mandrill
project in Gabon. ``People like to eat them, they're very tasty,
and they come in the right size. You can smoke them and transport
them very easily. And because mandrills move in very large groups,
they're pretty easy to find and to intercept, and to hunt in
batches of 50, 100 or even more.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, mandrills are classified as ``near-threatened,''
rather than ``endangered,'' but Robinson and his colleagues are
taking steps while the numbers still offer hope for a creature that
loves a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the scientists are negotiating to expand the
list of criteria that a logging company must meet if its wood is to
be sanctioned as ``sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   By current practice, wood is certified as sustainable if a
logging company cuts down only so many trees a year, avoids clear
cutting and replants a certain percentage of what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   The market for such environmentally correct wood is growing
faster than you can say ``chain saw.'' Home Depot, the chain of
home-improvement stores, has announced that it will buy sustainable
wood whenever possible. Conservationists would like to append
``sensitivity to wildlife'' to the certification process, a
stipulation that would impel logging companies to keep commercial
hunters off their roads and away from the primate throngs.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   That mandrills take group size to extremes is in keeping with
the flamboyant creatures, which boast Guinness-type records in an
array of categories. As Charles Darwin observed in 1871, the
mandrill is the most vividly colored specimen in mammaldom, its
lozenge-shaped muzzle of red and blue more like what you would
expect on a bird than on the furred. The male gets gaudier still at
sexual maturity, when his blue and red markings turn neon-bright
and are further highlighted by the growth of dazzling white cheek
ridges and a thick golden beard; and, just to be sure he is seen
coming and going, his blue buttocks brighten as well.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 feet in height and 90 pounds in weight, and with canine
teeth the size of human thumbs, the adult male is the largest and
most formidable of any monkey. Moreover, the sexual dimorphism, or
size difference, between the male and the 25-pound female is among
the most extreme in the primate order. Yet, though mandrills have
been known about for centuries, prized as curiosities by potentates
and long a favorite attraction in zoos, they have been little
studied in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're extremely difficult to track when they're in the
forest,'' Rogers explained.
</P>
<P>
   Because mandrills look like Crayola versions of baboons, they
were thought until recently to be close cousins of the Papio
family, even members of it. Thus, mandrill society was usually
described as baboonish in structure, composed of an alpha male and
his dogged coterie of females. Some researchers suggested that the
male mandrill's bright colors made it easier for him to lead
``his'' females through the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, a DNA study published in The Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences revealed that mandrills are
neither baboons nor their next of kin. Instead, mandrills turn out
to be most closely related to mangebays, short-legged tree-dwelling
monkeys. Now the research at Lope is showing that, behaviorally,
mandrills are a class unto themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using videocameras to record troops as they
traverse openings in the forest, the researchers have also managed
to put radio collars on a number of adult mandrills, an approach
that revealed the loneliness of the off-season male.
</P>
<P>
   By collecting thousands of scat samples, the scientists have
learned much about mandrill diet. Mandrills are finicky omnivores.
They eat a little bit of a lot of things _ nuts, leaves, insects,
fruit, grass, fungi, small vertebrates. They pick and choose and
throw a lot away in disgust. A species of nut that pleases them in
one spot may repel them in the next. They travel constantly as they
forage, covering three or five miles a day, far more than most
primates travel. Their home range is accordingly huge, 115 square
miles or so, the largest such range known for any primate.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have also learned how violent a male's life can
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the six males that we collared, only one had all its
canines intact,'' Abernethy said. ``All the rest had broken teeth,
scars on the face, ripped nostrils up to the eye. One had such
severe fresh puncture wounds that we could see the cartilage. We
couldn't collar him, and I don't know if he survived after we let
him go.'' The males get these wounds in violent battles with one
another during mating season.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the males do not have much time to make their
reproductive mark. They do not have harems, after all, and they
cannot very well monopolize a female society numbering 800 strong.
</P>
<P>
   Once females start coming into estrus, males from all around
descend on the group. The males start grunting, panting, heaving
noisily from the chest hour upon hour. They are big, colorful, loud
and impossible to ignore. They fight, yes, and they suffer from the
lacerating canines of their competitors, but the primatologists
propose that the males would suffer even greater damage if not for
their dramatic appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having seen the risks they take during actual fights,''
Abernethy said, ``I'd suspect that the incredible investment they
make in color and auditory signaling is an attempt to minimize that
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a male in his fully pigmented and baritone glory
is trying to get the attention of at least some females as quickly
as possible, before a rival suitor decides to go for his throat.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers do not yet understand why mandrill societies
have evolved as they have. They do not know why so many females
stick together, and they are just starting to do the studies to see
whether all the females in a given troop are related.
</P>
<P>
   Does large group size protect the female, and if so, from whom?
Perhaps from predators, or perhaps from mandrill males. Whereas
female baboons often display the wounds of the alpha males that
seek to control them, female mandrills do not seem to be the
recipients of mate abuse, despite the male's vastly superior size.
</P>
<P>
   Can mandrills find safety in numbers should human hunters come
to call? Don't bet a buffalo nickel on it.

SHADES OF GRAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The hottest breakthrough artist of 1999 sounded hot, tired and
ready to make a breakthough into a long afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   Macy Gray was in the midst of her second day of filming a new
video somewhere in the Valley and the steaming weather and rigid
schedule had turned her normally raspy voice even more smoky than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hectic, yeah,'' she whispered. ``We've been doing this
shoot nonstop and I feel like I could crawl into a cave right about
now. I haven't had a minute to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's life has been nonstop nearly from the moment her enticing
debut album, ``On How Life Is'' (Clean Slate/Epic), surfaced last
summer. The disc's savvy mix of hip-hop, old-school soul and rock
caught the ear of r&AMP;b fans and radio programmers who made ``Do
Something'' a hit, turning Gray into one of the year's most
celebrated new acts. The album ended up on a host of best-of lists
and Gray was nominated for a best new artist Grammy Award in a
field dominated by teen sensations. ``Do Something,'' meanwhile,
was nominated in the best female r&AMP;b vocal category.
</P>
<P>
   It brought Gray even more exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to win, especially for new artist,'' Gray, 30,
said. ``It was a kick going to the awards and everything, anyway.
But you kind of knew who would probably win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the winners in Gray's categories were Christina
Aguilera and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, though, is one of those rare performers with a distinctive
sound. Her tone has been compared to Miles Davis' otherworldly
speaking voice while others hear smoky shades of Nina Simone,
Eartha Kitt and Tina Turner.
</P>
<P>
   And Gray's fans range from Neil Young to 'N Sync's Chris
Kirkpatrick to dance-pop maven Fatboy Slim, with whom she recently
cut two tracks for his forthcoming album.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else like Macy Gray and that's the appeal of
her as an artist,'' said Chris Patyk, music director at local hot
adult contemporary station KYSR-FM (98.7) _ Star 98. ``There's no
one else like her at a time with so much prepackaged, homogenized
stuff. The vibe here at the station started in the hallways. When
we were talking about playing her before Christmas we put the
record on and it just lit up the phones. Her album got huge quickly
and started outselling things we were playing pretty heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who appears Wednesday at the Greek Theatre and then heads
out with Carlos Santana at the end of July, almost didn't become a
singer at all.
</P>
<P>
   Born Natalie McIntyre in Canton, Ohio, to a steelworker dad and
a mom who taught eighth-grade math, she was regularly teased by
neighborhood kids who made such fun of her unusual voice that she
stopped talking at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singing was the last thing I ever imagined I could do,'' said
Gray, whose stage name was borrowed from a beloved neighbor in
Canton. ``I loved music but I never ever saw myself as a
performer.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Gray soaked up her parents' record collection, which
was full of old-school soul by Aretha Franklin, Donny Hathaway, Sly
Stone, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. At the same time, Gray was
studying classical piano, remaining so self-conscious about her
voice that she never attempted to sing a note.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed in 1992 when she moved to Los Angeles to
study screenwriting at the University of Southern California.
Hooking up with some musician friends, Gray penned lyrics and cut
guide vocals for another vocalist. When it was time to record, the
singer didn't show and Gray filled in.
</P>
<P>
   The tape began to circulate and Gray's voice was noticed by the
leader of a hotel jazz band who asked her to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was crazy because it was a good money gig,'' she
recalled. ``I was singing standards and Sinatra tunes for a hundred
bucks an hour. Easy money.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gray _ a divorced mother of three who lives in Encino _
and some pals opened an after-hours Hollywood coffee shop called
the We Ours, where the Roots, Tricky, and the Black Eyed Peas
stopped by to hang out and sometimes jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a word-of-mouth thing but the place was so small you
knew everybody,'' Gray said. ``It was a good scene to get a sound
together, to see what was working and what wasn't. It wasn't like a
big Hollywood hang-out. It was a ghetto superstar thing. We'd play
there every week but because the place could fit only 100 people,
we stripped down our 12-piece band to a four-piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's sizzling, all-night open-mike jams and Gray's
reputation as a singer made Andrew Slater, manager of Fiona Apple
and the Wallflowers, notice. Slater hooked her up with hot
producer-musician Jon Brion, who added unusual instrumental touches
such as vibes and the strange-sounding proto-synthesizer, the
chamberlin.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting album, ``On How Life Is,'' which has since sold
more than 2 million copies, came at the perfect time. Lauryn Hill's
album, ``The Education of Lauryn Hill'' had opened the door for a
more musical brand of rap and hip-hop while old-school soul and
funk were making a periodic comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The album's initial radio hit, ``Do Something,'' led listeners
to sample such standout material as the funk-inflected ``Why Didn't
You Call Me,'' the frank ``Sex-o-Matic Venus Freak,'' the affecting
breakup song ``I Try,'' and the poignant disc-closer, ``The
Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians on the record include Gray's longtime writing
partners, programmer Darryl Swann and keyboardist Jeremy Ruzumna,
plus Arik Marshall, who played guitar with the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, and such seasoned veterans as Funkadelic guitarist
Blackbird McKnight, Tower of Power percussionist Lenny Castro and
Apple drummer Matt Chamberlain. The string arrangements were
courtesy of Beck's dad, David Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who won two statuettes at the recent Brit Awards,
Britain's answer to the Grammys, performs ``I Try'' on Fox-TV's
(Channel 11) Essence Awards at 8 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even with her high media profile, Gray says her sometimes gritty
lyrics are deeply personal tales from her life. And she's surprised
they have such apparently universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're snippets of things that have happened to me, that
inspired me to write,'' she says. ``It's just my life. It's all
pretty personal. It's not like I'm speaking for the whole world. I
really don't have some big message. It's just what I've gone
through and I hope people can relate.'' &QL;

<P>
   PENIKESE ISLAND, Mass. _ The weather was hot and sunny with a
stiff southwest wind blowing at about 30 knots on Tuesday, May 9,
when a large seabird, an albatross, came flying in off Buzzard's
Bay at 11:45 a.m. and buzzed researchers hunkered down in a blind
here.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, Gina Reppucci of North Chelmsford, Mass., and
Carolyn Mostello of West Kingston, R.I., were on the island to
study terns and gulls for the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries
and Wildlife. The last thing they expected to see was an albatross.
</P>
<P>
   But both had prior experience with albatrosses in the Pacific
Ocean and had spent time observing these birds on Midway Island, a
major breeding area for laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis) and
black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes) albatrosses, two widespread
Pacific Ocean species.
</P>
<P>
   Mostello has even seen the rarest species of albatross in the
world, the short-tailed albatross (Phoebastria albatrus), at
Midway.
</P>
<P>
   So they were well aware that these large, soaring birds, whose
wingspans reach six or seven feet, were virtual strangers _
accidentals, in the language of ornithology _ in the North Atlantic
Ocean. One can scarcely hope to see a member of this family in a
lifetime of venturing offshore in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   As Reppucci recalled, they were ``hysterical, our eyes popping
out of our heads,'' when this adult yellow-nosed albatross
(Thalassarche chlororhyncos) came soaring in off the bay and zoomed
by their blind, passing about 15 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   They were so awestruck when they realized what it was that they
did not even grab their binoculars on the bird's first pass. They
did not need them as it came in at eye level, then flared up and
over the blind. The black bill with yellow upper ridge, underwing
pattern, the exquisite eye shadow and overall pattern and
coloration of this fabulous bird were etched into instant memory.
``It was the most exciting thing we had ever seen,'' Mostello said.
</P>
<P>
   While observing endangered terns is worthwhile and satisfying,
there is nothing like a big-time rarity, a bona fide off-the-wall
vagrant seabird.
</P>
<P>
   Penikese Island is a small grass-covered island in the sparsely
inhabited Elizabeth Island chain that juts westward into Buzzard's
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are camping here from April through August,
monitoring a federally endangered species, the roseate tern (Sterna
dougallii). There are large numbers of nesting herring gulls (Larus
argentatus) and great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) on the
island and a small rookery of black-crowned night-herons
(Nycticorax nycticorax) and a few snowy egrets (Egretta thula).
</P>
<P>
   For a small island, Penikese has its share of ornithological
items of note. The first breeding record of the manx shearwater
(Puffinus puffinus) in North America was discovered when a nest
containing a chick was found here in 1973, the first time this
species had been found nesting on the western side of the North
Atlantic. It has not been found breeding in Massachusetts since.
</P>
<P>
   Penikese is also the southernmost known nesting location for a
small seabird called the Leach's storm-petrel (Oceanodroma
leucorhoa) in the Atlantic Ocean. These nocturnal birds arrive in
the middle of the night to return to nesting burrows in old stone
walls on the island. There are only a handful of pairs on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   But the albatross was an even rarer bird. The ``gooney'' bird
made several passes over the grassy island hillsides at relatively
slow speed, treating the researchers to great views at close range.
</P>
<P>
   The nesting great black-backed gulls took offense at its
presence and three or four adults gave chase. The beleaguered
albatross headed back to the north into Buzzard's Bay with several
``angry'' great black-backs in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Albatrosses come to land for only one reason: to find a mate,
lay an egg and raise another albatross. Were Penikese Island
located in the southern Atlantic Ocean, it would be ideal albatross
nesting habitat. It fills the bill nicely with strong winds and
wide open grassy hillsides to serve as runways for these heavy
birds to take off on. Most important, it is free of mammalian
predators. The bird was in all probability prospecting for a nest
site.
</P>
<P>
   But it was 180 degrees out of sync from the Southern Hemisphere.
While it is spring here, it is fall where the rest of its species
lives. It seems the bird's compass and internal clocks have all
been reset for the Northern Hemisphere. If it could only find a
mate, there could be a staggering range expansion into a whole new
hemisphere. This kind of thing could happen _ the Penikese
albatross is not the first to turn up in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer an adult yellow-nosed albatross visited Matinicus
Rock in Maine on July 6. The bird remained for about two hours, was
photographed and then it flew off never to be seen again, unless
the bird that visited Penikese was the same individual. The
sighting in Maine last summer was the third for this species in
Maine ornithological history.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the North Atlantic, there have been some
remarkable albatross sightings. A black-browed albatross
(Thalassarche melanophris) returned to the same huge Northern
Gannet (Morus bassanus) rookery on Hermaness Island in the Outer
Hebrides from 1967 until 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The albatross courted these large, seagoing gannets to no avail.
It built a nest each year from 1972 until 1987 but never attracted
a mate as the rest of its species were well south of the equator.
This bird exhibited extreme site fidelity, but it was the only one
of its kind, so its efforts were genetically in vain.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other records for this species in Massachusetts.
Amazingly, the first record was of a bird on almost the exact same
date, on May 7, 1971, seen over Bird Island, off of Marion, Mass.,
also in Buzzard's Bay. This bird was spotted by Dr. Ian Nisbet, an
authority on roseate terns who has been active in research and
conservation efforts on their behalf for more than 40 years. Bird
Island is really no distance at all as the albatross flies from
Penikese across Buzzard's Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow-nosed albatrosses have also been spotted from the Gulf of
St. Lawrence in Quebec, the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick, twice in
New York state, once in Freeport on Long Island and one was seen
flying up the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more birders go afield armed with excellent optics
and first-rate field guides, the species is being detected more
frequently. But the birds are still very rare.
</P>
<P>
   Albatrosses are extraordinarily long-lived. This is known from
recoveries of birds wearing bands or rings that were attached at a
known time and place. The longevity record is of a giant royal
albatross (Diomedea epomohora) banded in New Zealand and recovered
as a breeding adult 58 years later. Theoretically they could live
to be more than 80 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the recently sighted bird has not reappeared at
Penikese Island or been seen anywhere else for that matter. &QL;

   Rudolph Giuliani has pulled out of the New York Senate race,
leaving his successor months behind in fund-raising, planning and
glad-handing. How do you beat Hillary Clinton from a standing
start? Here are a few words from some experts.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Nachman, a former editor of The New York Post, is
executive producer of ``Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher'':
</P>
<P>
   So you're some no-name Republican suddenly thrust into
prominence and about to launch a campaign against someone with name
recognition equal to Evita Peron's. As my mother would say, what
could be bad? With no Rudy Giuliani baggage to carry, your
``unfavorable'' ratings are already hugely better than the ones for
the woman who calls herself ``HILLARY!''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's not your police department you have to defend.
You never kicked any little old ladies off the welfare rolls, or
ticketed a jaywalker, or banished a hot-dog peddler or arrested
some hapless cabbie. Or dumped your wife on live TV. There's your
slogan: It Wasn't Me!
</P>
<P>
   That means your only opponent is Hillary, not yourself. And
since she won't have Rudy to kick around anymore, she'll be
required to defend herself. And thanks to your being nobody, she'll
have nothing to attack. Until Friday, the race was going to be won
by the candidate the voters disliked least. Now that's you. This is
good, yes? Why didn't we think of this before?
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz has been Rudolph Giuliani's pollster since 1993:
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: this election was never really about Rudy
Giuliani. It has always been about Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Most pollsters will tell you that attitudes toward Hillary were
more important in determining voter preferences than their feelings
toward Rudy. That being said, the reason why Rudy Guiliani was able
to weather the past few weeks without any drop in public opinion
was his incredible record of success in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton just doesn't have that record _ and that may
prove to be the key weapon in Rick Lazio's political arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The one question that Rick Lazio needs to present to the people
of New York is, ``Can you name one thing Hillary Clinton has done
for the people of New York?'' It's short, sweet, to the point and
in my focus groups throughout the state, no one could answer it.
Even her own advisers have trouble answering.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Wilentz is director of the American studies program at
Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their candidate, Republicans will try to paint
Hillary Clinton as an outsider, the carpetbagger without a record.
But I'm not so sure this will work. Clinton represents a distinct
New York tradition, one that actually predates the ethnic pol _ the
ambitious and talented arriviste.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the other great eastern states _ Massachusetts
with its Brahmins and River Gods, Pennsylvania with its inbred
Quaker elite _ New York has always been remarkably open to upstarts
_ socially as well as politically.
</P>
<P>
   The first outstanding New Yorker in the new nation's politics,
Alexander Hamilton, was the West Indies-born son of an unremarkable
Scottish peddler. After Hamilton came George Clinton, the
Jeffersonian Democrat, and his nephew, DeWitt. Descendants of
moderately prosperous immigrant farmers from Ulster County, they
both served auspicious terms as New York's governor. Then came
Martin Van Buren, the cunning, self-made son of a tavernkeeper from
Kinderhook. After two Senate terms, he became the first New Yorker
to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have welcomed out-of-staters, particularly, it
seems, when it comes to choosing their Senate candidates. Not only
the oft-mentioned Robert Kennedy of Massachusetts and James Buckley
of Connecticut, but also Ramsey Clark of Texas, the Democratic
senatorial nominee in 1972. Indeed, New York's very first senator,
Rufus King, began his political career as a delegate to the
Continental Congress _ from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   So while Republicans may try to make the carpetbagger charge
stick, I'm not so sure it will work.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bond is a former Republican National Committee chairman:
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton lost a formidable opponent in Rudy Giuliani. He
had a proven record of attracting crossover Democrats, and a
Republican Senate candidate has to have that appeal. While the
dynamics of the race have changed, however, Clinton's uphill battle
to win this Senate seat hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is no such thing as a standing start for any
Republican running against her, even in New York. Polls showed her
support at a steady 44 percent, and despite Giuliani's troubles
over the past two weeks, her support has barely moved.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a recent decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals tossed out Federal Election Commission restrictions on
party contributions to congressional candidates. Although this
court has jurisdiction only over six Western states, both parties
have indicated that they will apply it nationally. Thus,
fund-raising will not be an issue for the New York Senate
candidate. The party could legally write out a multimillion-dollar
check tomorrow to provide financial parity.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell L. Moss is director of the Taub Urban Research Center
at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Without Rudy Giuliani in the race, Clinton will have to work
much harder to mobilize minority groups in New York City.
African-American voters are enthusiastic supporters of Bill
Clinton, but it's not clear that the president's popularity is
automatically transferred to his wife. Clinton was counting on
anti-Giuliani sentiment to bring out her voters in minority areas.
More important, Republicans can now nominate a candidate with
suburban roots who will carry the Conservative Party imprimatur, a
clone of genial George Pataki. Furthermore, Hillary Clinton cannot
rely on upstate voters to instinctively oppose a politician from
New York City. Without the mayor, Republicans will do better
upstate and in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg is the editor of Rothenberg Political Report:
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio could actually turn out to be a stronger opponent
than Rudy Giuliani. He is a moderate who voted for family and
medical leave; he backs gun control and has been supported by
environmental groups. Even more important, the four-term
congressman from Suffolk County doesn't carry the mayor's personal
or political baggage. He's more personable and unthreatening than
Giuliani, and he doesn't have to worry that a shooting, racial
incident or City Hall scandal will derail his Senate bid. Lazio
could re-create the same coalition of upstate and suburban voters
that helped George Pataki oust another political celebrity, Mario
Cuomo, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump, the real estate developer, is author, with Dave
Shiflett, of ``The America We Deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has proved over a long period of time that she is very
tough, tenacious and smart. Whoever runs against her will have to
have those qualities in even greater abundance because her name
recognition and celebrity are so very high.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to the issues and work very hard _ and the anti-Hillary
vote may just be a big surprise in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush recently proposed supplementing traditional
Social Security with personal retirement accounts. Individuals
would invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a proposal naturally raises a question: In such a mixed
system, are future retirees at risk of receiving significantly
lower benefits? The answer is no. Adding individual retirement
accounts will only make future retirement incomes more secure.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the current pay-as-you-go system is itself risky.
Without changes, benefits will exceed tax revenue by 2015, and the
trust fund will be empty by 2037. Moreover, maintaining currently
projected benefits would require raising the payroll tax from the
current 12.4 percent to more than 19 percent. If taxes aren't
raised, benefits will have to be cut by one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has not developed a detailed blueprint, a study I
conducted two years ago with Elena Ranguelova of Harvard and Andrew
Samwick of Dartmouth shows how adding individual accounts can
succeed with no increase in tax rates and little or no risk to
future retirees.
</P>
<P>
   We analyzed the risks that retirees would face if the Social
Security tax were not increased and government deposited amounts
equal to 2 percent of each individual's earnings into new personal
retirement accounts. The deposits could be financed from the
projected budget surpluses without any increase in tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   In our analysis, individuals invest the money in a balanced
portfolio of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent corporate bonds. Such
a portfolio had an average return over the last 50 years of more
than 6 percent, after inflation. When individuals reach retirement
age, the money in these accounts supplements their Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has another bonus: the increased national savings means
more corporate investment and profits and therefore more corporate
tax payments. That extra revenue can be used to supplement the
Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   These calculations are easily adapted to a plan like the one
Bush suggests: allowing individuals to use a small percentage of
their Social Security taxes to finance their personal retirement
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Assume that 2 percent of the 12.4 percent Social Security tax is
deposited in personal retirement accounts. The rate of return on
these accounts would exceed the return in the Social Security trust
fund. Traditional tax-financed benefits combined with payouts from
personal retirement accounts can therefore maintain retirement
incomes at the level now projected. And with corporations making
greater profits, as a result of increased national saving, and
therefore paying more taxes, the trust fund remains permanently
solvent.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, Social Security benefits would be financed
almost solely through the traditional method. So, for those who are
now retired, there would be no risk, since the new system would not
apply to them. Over time, the importance of the investment-based
benefits would increase. But eventually, the 12.4 percent payroll
tax would finance at least two-thirds of the projected benefit
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Although investing does have some risk, it is very small, and
retirees stand a good chance of receiving substantially more than
what is projected for them now.
</P>
<P>
   Take a 21-year-old, who will have average earnings each year
until he retires and invests his personal retirement account
deposits of 2 percent of earnings in the balanced stock-bond
portfolio. Based on the market's volatility in the last 50 years,
he has a 50 percent chance that his combined benefits will exceed
his currently projected Social Security benefits by at least
one-third. There is a better than 10 percent chance that his
combined benefits will more than double his projected Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is not very risky. There is less than 10 percent
chance that his combined benefits will be less than 90 percent of
his projected Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Even these relatively small risks for future retirees could be
eliminated by a government guarantee that anyone who invests in the
standard stock-bond portfolio would be compensated if his annuity
falls below the benefits projected in current law. (Individuals
would be free to invest in other approved portfolios, but the
guarantee would reflect only the performance of the standard
stock-bond portfolio.)
</P>
<P>
   Our study implies that in most years, guarantee payments would
not be needed. And there is a less than 1 percent chance that the
total taxpayer cost _ including the payroll tax as well as the
guarantee payment _ would be as large as the 19 percent tax rate
that would be required to finance the same level of benefits if
there is no reform.
</P>
<P>
   The real risk to future retirees is not that individual accounts
would be too risky. The real risk would be in not reforming Social
Security now, before the demographic problem becomes overwhelming.
</P>

adviser to Gov. George W. Bush.)

THE U.N.'S FAILURES ARE EVERYONE'S FAULT

<P>
   ATLANTA _ After U.N. peacekeepers proved incapable of handling
the chaos in Sierra Leone, Richard Holbrooke, the American
ambassador to the United Nations, was one of many to call for
changes in the way the organization conducts peacekeeping. But such
demands assume that the institution is capable of reform.
Unfortunately that may not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations does go through the motions. In April 1995,
after its failures in Somalia and Angola, a ``Lessons Learned
Unit'' was established to determine why peacekeeping efforts
failed. This office of eight people is currently collecting and
analyzing information on a peacekeeping operation in Yugoslavia,
which ended in 1995, and one in Angola, which ended in 1997.
Apparently, the lessons of failure come slowly.
</P>
<P>
   More important than the glacial pace of self-assessment is the
nature of the organization. The United Nations serves its 188
member states, which, when determining the organization's policies,
largely pursue their national interests.
</P>
<P>
   If no country or group of countries is willing to do a job, it
will be handed to the United Nations. That way, if the effort
fails, the United Nations, and not an individual country, can
assume the responsibility. Since every country wants that option,
each respects the other's right to saddle the organization with
impossible missions.
</P>
<P>
   A country can also use the United Nations to hide its own
foreign policy failures. What is happening in Congo is a case in
point. Six nearby African countries sent their armies to fight in
Congo's civil war. But in a huge nation with multiple factions and
militias, victory is not easy. Rather than admit that this war is
their Vietnam, these countries have persuaded the United Nations to
commit a small peacekeeping force, hoping that it will grow in the
future. This would provide a semblance of order, while the regional
countries withdraw, were it not for the fact that the Congolese
can't even agree on a place to discuss the country's peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping missions are handled by the U.N. bureaucracy, which
has 188 bosses yet no effective oversight. The bureaucracy knows
that it can ill afford to anger any of the 188 members. So, it
discourages initiative, and avoids measuring its results or
honestly evaluating its failures.
</P>
<P>
   Waste and mismanagement are not reported since the bureaucracy
is not directly accountable to any congressman, journalist or
taxpayer. The organization's internal auditor has only existed for
six years, and Madeleine Albright once referred to the office as a
``junkyard puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is always short of the personnel it needs for
peacekeeping operations. First world countries with first-rate
armies are usually unwilling to put their troops at risk. Thus,
these operations are often left to third world countries, and the
United Nations sends some of the worst soldiers in the world off to
situations where it can only hope they are not called on to
actually do anything.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the U.N.'s police monitors, who are supposed
to improve respect for human rights. Given an order to assemble a
large number of policemen, the United Nations scrambles to round up
the bodies. As a result, volunteers have come from China, Nigeria
and other countries that have no known association with good police
work. In the peacekeeping operation in Mozambique in 1992 to 1994,
for instance, the inactivity of the police monitors actually
encouraged human rights violations. Some local cops took their lack
of comment as a tacit endorsement of abusive tactics.
</P>
<P>
   When peacekeepers perform badly, it is too politically
embarrassing to remove them. This is particularly true of senior
officials since they were often given their jobs not because of
their abilities, but because of the countries they represent. For
instance, as the situation in Sierra Leone began to melt down, U.N.
officials in New York, who usually micromanage things, began to
blame the officials in Africa for the failure. Even if that were
true, the political head of the mission is Nigerian, and his
country will be crucial if there is to be any solution to Sierra
Leone's misery. The military head of the operation is from India _
one of the largest contributors of troops.
</P>
<P>
   Do these inherent institutional problems mean the United Nations
will never succeed at peacekeeping? Of the 53 operations conducted
since 1948, many were successful. Unlike the border disputes of the
past, however, today's conflicts are almost always civil wars. It
is much easier to divide territory between two states than to
divide political power in one state. So for more successful
peacekeeping, either the way the United Nations is used by its
members or the performance of its bureaucracy has to improve.
Neither is likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   (Dennis C. Jett, an adviser at the Carter Center, is the author
of ``Why Peacekeeping Fails.'' He was American ambassador to Peru
(1996-1999) and Mozambique (1993 to 1996).)

&HT;     CHURCH SETTLES CASE OF ALLEGED ABUSE

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Averting a potentially embarrassing civil trial,
the Archdiocese of San Francisco has reached a settlement in the
case of a teen-age rectory worker who accused his Burlingame pastor
of physical and mental abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed, but the lawyer for the young
man, whose lawsuit claimed damages of more than $50,000, said the
amount was ``very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly indicates the archdiocese recognizes the validity
of the allegations,'' said Justine Durrell, the San Francisco
lawyer representing the plaintiff, identified in court documents as
John Doe. ``They probably had concerns about going to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial was to start Monday in San Francisco Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Church spokesman Maurice Healy said the archdiocese's insurance
company paid the settlement, describing it as ``a standard release
of all claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest's attorney did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that stunned parishioners at St. Catherine of Siena
Church, the Rev. James Aylward was spotted in November 1997,
wrestling in a darkened rectory room with a 16-year-old former
altar boy. Another priest, the Rev. John Conley, happened upon the
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   After crawling out the room, leaving the teen to face Conley
alone, Aylward later insisted the nocturnal encounter was a
one-time incident of ``horseplay and wrestling,'' and publicly
apologized for his ``foolishness and imprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   The police and the San Mateo County district attorney's office
investigated, finding insufficient evidence to file criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese conducted an internal review, concluding that
Aylward's conduct was inappropriate but not sexual. The archdiocese
said it strongly disapproved of priests wrestling with youths, but
termed Aylward's conduct a lapse in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Aylward, ordained in 1964, remained as pastor for about seven
months, then resigned to later serve as parochial vicar at Our Lady
of Mount Carmel Church in Mill Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the former altar boy sued, alleging he had been
``physically and mentally abused'' by Aylward for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aylward would force Doe to wrestle with him, forcing him to
the ground and getting on top of him,'' the lawsuit contended.
``Aylward would secure Doe in positions from which (he) could not
escape and not release him until Doe would groan from pain. Aylward
while engaged in these acts would grunt and groan and saliva would
drip from his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accused the archdiocese of sanctioning the
misconduct by failing to discipline or remove the priest from the
parish.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese denied the allegations. ``Nothing happened,''
said Paul Gaspari, the lawyer representing the church.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, Aylward admitted to a history of inappropriate
touching of boys for his own sexual gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Under oath, the 61-year-old priest confessed to multiple
incidents of inappropriate physical contact with minors, over at
least 12 years at several parishes.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Aylward described the physical interaction he
had with boys as ``wrestling'' and admitted that some of the
encounters were for his own sexual pleasure, according to Ronald
Schwartz, co-counsel in the lawsuit against Aylward.
</P>
<P>
   During his deposition, Aylward also said archdiocesan officials,
during their internal investigation, never asked whether he had
engaged in such conduct with other minors. He testified that had
his religious superiors probed further, he would have told them the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Archdiocesan officials said they ``specifically asked (Aylward)
whether he had any sexual contact of any kind with any minors at
any time, and he denied having done so. . . . (H)e never wavered
from that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Aylward was immediately placed on administrative leave and
remains in that status today.
</P>
<P>
   His revelations startled even his staunchest supporters. In
mid-March, more than 100 St. Catherine parishioners gathered in the
parish auditorium to discuss the case. Much anger was voiced, not
only at their former pastor but also toward the archdiocese.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddest twists in the case involved Conley, the parish
priest who stumbled upon the nighttime ``wrestling'' and reported
it to both law enforcement and his religious superiors. Before his
ordination in 1993, Conley had worked as a federal prosecutor,
serving for a time as chief of the criminal division in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after exposing the wrestling incident, Conley was placed
on administrative leave, where he remains to this day.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual move, he filed a lawsuit against his
religious superiors, maintaining that he was defamed and penalized
for reporting suspected child abuse. The suit for infliction of
emotional distress and defamation was dismissed in San Francisco
and is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this case will encourage the church to reinstate
Father Conley,'' Durrell said. ``It would make a real statement in
terms of their willingness to encourage whistle-blowers instead of
the cloak and dagger approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese has insisted Conley was put on leave not because
he reported the incident but for unrelated actions and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Church spokesman Maurice Healy was cryptic about the priest's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably certain actions the archdiocese would want
done before we get out of the administrative leave mode,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conley declined to be interviewed because of his appeal.

SCIENTISTS CAST BETS ON HUMAN GENES; A WINNER WILL BE PICKED IN
2003 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Germany, Wash.)   (The Science Times)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many human genes are there? Recent estimates have ranged
from 60,000 to 140,000 and might be expected to narrow sharply as
the human genome nears completion. In fact, the range has widened,
suggesting that gene-counting remains at least as much art as
science.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with estimates that are all over the lot, genome
scientists have contrived a simpler way of settling the question,
at least for the present. At a meeting this month at the Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island they opened a sweepstakes
for bets on the number of human genes. The winner will be chosen
based on the most likely number decreed at the same annual meeting
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The mean of the 228 bets so far cast is 62,598 genes, with a
high of 200,000 and a low of 27,462. (Further details are on the
Web at www.ensembl.org/genesweep.html.) By comparison, 19,099 genes
are apparently required to run the C. elegans roundworm and 13,601
genes for the Drosophila fruit fly, the only two animals whose full
genomes have so far been decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Given the range of estimates, the real number will have
considerable bearing on how long it takes to understand the human
genetic repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Bets aside, three new estimates published last week in the
journal Nature Genetics ranged from a high of 120,000 to a new low
of 28,000 genes.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the number of gene transcripts produced by living
cells, researchers at the University of Washington calculated that
the human genome contains a total of only 35,000 genes.
</P>
<P>
   An even lower estimate _ 28,000 to 34,000 genes _ comes from Dr.
Jean Weissenbach of Genoscope in France. He and his colleagues
tallied human genes by matching them to their counterparts in the
puffer fish, where genes are easier to count.
</P>
<P>
   A third estimate, from Dr. John Quackenbush and colleagues at
the Institute for Genomic Research, also based on gene transcripts,
puts the number of genes at about 120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the low estimate has been one of 60,000 to 70,000
human genes, a figure arrived at in 1994 by Dr. J. Craig Venter,
now president of Celera. The high estimate of 140,000 was issued
last September by Dr. Randy Scott, president of Incyte, a
commercial rival of Celera. Though Scott had a scientific basis for
his claim, it did not seem entirely coincidental that his number
was exactly twice Venter's highest estimate, as if to suggest twice
the value in Incyte's gene set.
</P>
<P>
   Though Venter's number had long been the low end of the range,
it suddenly seemed middle of the road earlier this month when a
group of German and Japanese researchers calculated that there were
only 40,000 human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's estimates from the University of Washington and the
French group support the idea that the number of human genes is far
less than has long been supposed.
</P>
<P>
   These lower estimates, if true, could be considered serious
threats to human pride and perceptions of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   Can it really require only a third more genes to design and
operate a person than a microscopic worm? By what sardonic sense of
humor would evolution give humans the imagination to see themselves
as the summit of creation yet make them with only twice the number
of genes as required by a midget fly that feeds on rotten fruit?
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have only twice as many genes as the worm but get a
much greater increase in complexity from more complex interaction
between the components,'' said Dr. Phil Green of the University of
Washington, an author of one of the low-ball estimates. ``That
saves a little bit of our pride.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Green's bet on the number of human genes is
35,000. Quackenbush's is 118,259.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT RAISES FRESH ANTITRUST CHALLENGE
 &HT;    Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a long-awaited date before a federal judge
only days away, Microsoft Corp. argued yet again Monday that the
company should be kept intact even if it broke the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the three previous sets of briefs on what remedies would
best cure the company's antitrust faults, the latest Microsoft
offering was unsolicited by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jackson is to preside at a hearing here at which
both the government and the company will air their remedy views and
contrasting legal timetables.
</P>
<P>
   After Jackson last month ruled that Microsoft had illegally
sought to retain its monopoly power over operating systems for
personal computers, the government called on the judge to break the
company into two parts.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft contended Monday that in an earlier Justice
Department action, ``the government has already admitted that the
breakup of Microsoft would be 'dangerous to the economy's welfare'
and 'against the public interest.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The government had it right in 1995: the (antitrust) law does
not countenance the dismemberment of Microsoft, a remedy that would
clearly 'act against the public interest.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 case ended in a settlement and consent decree _ one
which the government later accused Microsoft of having broken. The
dispute led directly to the current suit, brought on behalf of the
Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the government contends Microsoft's new arguments
don't wash because they are based on the situation that prevailed
before Jackson issued his wide-ranging decision.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also noted that in the earlier case both Jackson and
the Justice Department admitted there was no way of knowing whether
competing technologies, such as the Netscape Navigator Web browser
or Sun Microsystems' Java platform, could eventually have replaced
its dominant Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without such a finding, the government's request for
structural relief must fail,'' Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Microsoft contends that the U.S. Court of Appeals found
in 1998 that technological tying _ the inclusion of
once-independent software into an operating system _ was within
bounds, as long as it creates some demonstrable benefit to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's verdict failed to take into account that appeals'
court finding, Microsoft claims.

`EXPERIENCE': FOR WRITERS, FATHER AND SON, OUT OF CONFLICT GREW
LOVE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review. Boldface words in
10th graf should be set in italics.) 
 BY MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With novels like ``London Fields,'' ``Money'' and ``The
Information,'' Martin Amis has demonstrated that he is a writer
equipped with a daunting arsenal of literary gifts: a dazzling,
chameleonesque command of language, a willingness to tackle large
issues and larger social canvases and an unforgiving, heat-seeking
eye for the unwholesome ferment of contemporary life. The one thing
lacking in his work, readers might have argued, was an emotional
sincerity; too often his writing substituted sardonic detachment
for heartfelt feeling, chilly postmodern pyrotechnics for a concern
with what one of Amis' heroes, Saul Bellow, has called ``the
mysterious circumstances of being.''
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed with ``Experience,'' Amis' remarkable new
memoir. The entertainingly footnoted volume loops back and forth in
time to chronicle the author's coming of age with becoming
earnestness and humor and serves up some charmingly antic set
pieces including what must surely stand as the darkest and funniest
account of dental surgery ever written. The book will be best
remembered, however, for its wonderfully vivid portrait of the
author's late father, the comic novelist and poet Kingsley Amis. It
is a portrait of a father and son as deeply affecting as the one
Philip Roth created in his 1991 book, ``Patrimony,'' a portrait
animated by clear-eyed literary insight and enduring love and
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it could not have been easy being Kingsley Amis' son.
The elder Amis' acidic memoirs, published in 1991, not only settled
dozens of literary scores, but also drew a self-portrait of a
willful curmudgeon who was as prickly as he was unsparing. Kingsley
Amis gave interviews characterizing his son's books as unreadable,
his liberal politics as ``dangerous, howling nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My father never encouraged me to write, never invited me to go
for that longshot,'' Martin Amis writes in ``Experience,'' ``he
praised me less often than he publicly dispraised me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet beneath the apparent antipathy, father and son evinced a
clear literary kinship. Both got their start as angry young men
with a dyspeptic gift for satire and biting humor. Both wrote a
series of novels featuring feckless, self-deluded heroes. And both
have admirably lived up to Amis Senior's credo that ``any proper
writer ought to be able to write anything from an Easter Day sermon
to a sheep-dip handout.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Amis suggests in these pages that some of his father's
more provocative political statements were simply exercises in
``winding me up,'' and in ``Experience,'' he conveys the bantering,
comradely quality of the relationship between his own younger self
_ ``a drawling, velvet-suited, snakeskin-booted'' adolescent
cultivating a ridiculous ``plumed and crested manner'' _ and
Kingsley in his prime, a tireless womanizer, drinker and raconteur,
an inexhaustible ``engine of comedy,'' presiding over the
household's humor and high spirits.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult Martin took his two young sons to lunch at his
father's every Sunday, and also joined his father for a garrulous
midweek meal. When the younger Amis left his wife for another woman
in 1993, it was his father he turned to for solace and advice.
``Only to him,'' he writes, ``could I confess how terrible I felt,
how physically terrible, bemused, subnormalized, stupefied from
within, and always about to flinch or tremble from the effort of
making my face look honest, kind, sane. Only to him could I talk
about what I was doing to my children. Because he had done it to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of his marriage to Elizabeth Jane Howard (for
whom he had left Martin's mother, Hilary, in 1963), Kingsley Amis
began to enter a decline. Even in his youth he'd suffered from
nyctophobia (fear of the night) and monophobia (fear of being
alone), and in the wake of Howard's departure, Martin and his
brother began to take turns ``Dadsitting,'' promising him that he'd
never have to spend an evening alone. They eventually helped
arrange for their mother and her third husband to take up residence
with Kingsley in an unorthodox menage that would endure for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   To this day Martin Amis credits his mother's caretaking with
bringing his father ``back to life and love,'' and enabling him to
renounce the bitterness and misogyny so evident in books like
``Stanley and the Women,'' and to go on to write such comic
masterworks as ``The Old Devils.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the toll of years of drinking _ combined, perhaps,
with Alzheimer's disease _ would rob Kingsley of the two things
most intrinsic to his sense of self: his capacity for laughter and
his love of words. ``I now see that this was an alternate-world
Kingsley,'' Martin Amis writes of his father's final weeks, ``an
anti-Kingsley, confined from now on to a regime of tautologies and
commonplaces. What his brain was doing was the  &UR; opposite of
writing. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Experience'' Martin Amis writes not only of his father's
death in 1995, but of the other events that rocked his world in the
mid-90s: the dissolution of his first marriage, the discovery that
he had fathered a daughter named Delilah some 20 years earlier, his
much talked-about break with his good friend, the novelist Julian
Barnes, and the revelation that his beloved cousin, Lucy
Partington, who mysteriously disappeared two decades ago, had been
murdered and dismembered by one of Britain's most notorious serial
killers, Frederick West.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of Lucy in 1973, coupled with the grisly
circumstances of her death, Amis observes, seems to have planted
the seeds of ``infinite fear'' in his unconscious, and in
retrospect perhaps fueled the morbid strain in his fiction, his
inclination to focus, in his novels, on death and loss and
extremity, and to grapple with them with hyperbole and black humor.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Experience,'' however, Amis speaks ``for once, without
artifice'' of the ``ordinary miracles and ordinary disasters'' of
real life _ of what it means to be a son, and what it means to be a
father with children of his own. The result is Amis' most fully
realized book yet _ a book that fuses his humor, intellect and
daring with a new gravitas and warmth, a book that stands, at once,
as a loving tribute to his father and as a fulfillment of his own
abundant talents as a writer.

   TECH-SAVVY _ Question and answer column focusing on using

(Cleere/Rudd, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVEDNETKIDS _ When
children of the pre-Internet generation grew up, they were taught
to solve problems methodically, in a linear way, the first steps to
an A to B to C mindset. Today's kids learn to think in three
dimensions, using computers and the Internet to manipulate text,
images, sound and video, creating their own language unhindered by
geography or a lack of information resources. How is the Internet
and today's computer technology changing the way Austin children
develop? We'll find the brightest Austin kids see if learning to
have such skills create a generation that will be that much smarter
than their parents? (Gallaga, Austin American-Statesman). 45. WITH

   WESTPOINT _Shares of WestPoint Stevens were off more than 30
percent in the wake of an announcement that the textile maker was
dropping plans to go private. The bed and bath products company

<P>
   DOW _ It's beginning to sink in that the Federal Reserve's rate

   COXNET PTECH 0523 _ A high-tech vision of a flat panel future is
the gospel for thousands of physicists and engineers around the

the Internet and more advanced microprocessors give the flat panel

   ARTIST SCREEN _ Zvi Yaniv isn't the typical artist. He's not the
typical physicist either. He envisions a world with wall-sized

   TECHNOBUDDY _ When I was a young man, way too much of my time
was spent trying to get more speed and louder exhaust noises out of
a car that began life as a rather ordinary Chevrolet Chevelle.
Nowadays cars aren't that big of a deal to me. Instead, I spend
just as much childish zeal and grown-up money hopping up my home
PC. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1 column
color sig of columnist.

<P>
   NON-SPORT-GAMES _ At the Sega booth during the E3Expo in Los
Angeles recently, the line to play ``Jet Grind Radio'' was so long
company officials sometimes had to ask enthusiasts to stop so
others could play the new video game. The highly anticipated game
is for the Sega Dreamcast and will be released this fall. Here's 10
of the top non-sports games on all the consoles _ PlayStation 2,
PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast _ that will go on sale

   VIDEOGAME _ LOS ANGELES _ Millions of video game gearheads are
twiddling their thumbs until October waiting for Sony's PlayStation

summer. As part of a $10 million promotional blitz for the sleek
device _ which has an upgraded video processor, DVD drive and

   TECH-CENTERPIECE _ Remember that famous line from the old
``Saturday Night Live'' skit: It's a floor wax and a desert
topping. Only in this case it's a telephone and a Web browser all
rolled up in the same neat package. If you've got a wireless Web
cellular phone, you can order a book or check the sports scores, or
get the latest news from CNN. Oh, and if you want to make a phone
call, you can do that, too. The next and newest generation of
cellular phones have matchbook-sized screens and built-in Internet
browsers that let users access everything from CNN to Yahoo and

be Web-ready by the end of the year. (Katz, Atlanta

   LEWIS-SCENE _ BALTIMORE _ They don't think he's guilty, they're

(home of Free Ray Lewis t-shirts) to Severn (home of infamous limo)
to Owings Mill (home of Ray and Ravens), the message is clear: Ray
is innocent. A recent poll confirms. But the city - and the team -
prepare for life without Ray. A scene-setter for trial's first day.

   OLY-SWM-WALKER _ AUSTIN _ Mark Spitz. Matt Biondi. Neil Walker?
At first glance it seems odd to pair Walker's name with those of
some of the greatest swimmers in U.S. history. This March at the
short-course world championships in Athens, Greece, Walker joined
Spitz and Biondi as the only men ever to cop seven medals at a
major international competition. Five of the medals were gold and
the other two silver. In the process of collecting that haul,
Walker set not one, not two, but five world records. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman). 25. WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   OLY-DIV-WALKER _ AUSTIN _ Dumais has been called America's next
big hope indiving. His stunning success as a young diver earned him
quick comparisons to Greg Louganis, a double gold-medal winner in
the 1984 and1988 Olympics. The 2000 Olympics are fast approaching,
and Dumais is still be out there playing pickup basketball at the
University of Texas, trying to show people on the rec courts that
he's got some game. (Maher, Austin American-Statesman). 20.

   OLY-CYC-MCRAE _ AUSTIN _ A cyclist from Plano and Austin is back
in Europe and keeping an eye on Sydney, Australia, for the upcoming
Olympic Games. We're talking Chann McRae, not Lance Armstrong, the
reigning Tour de France champion. McRae, a boyhood friend of
Armstrong, is poised to make more of a name for himself this year.

   OLY-FORTNER _ AUSTIN _Lately, when it comes to the USA in the
Olympic Games, there is always pressure for gold and nothing else.
It's UT Nell Fortner's turn in the hot seat as she will be one of

<P>
   GLF-OPEN-QUALIFYING _ With visions of ``Tin Cup'' dancing in
their heads, more than 140 golfers gathered at Braelinn Golf Club
in Peachtree City on Monday to begin their quest for a berth in the
U.S. Open. They came in all shapes and sizes, from all walks of
life, with shared dreams -- shoot four good rounds of golf to
qualify for the opportunity to tee it up with the pros at Pebble
Beach in mid-June. That's the unique thing about the U.S. Open. If
your handicap is inside a 2, you plop down $150 and take your shot
at advancing from one of the hundreds of pre-qualifying sites. Four
survived at Braelinn. . . with regional qualifying tests to come.

   HANDICAP-PLAYER _ Salem high school senior Mandy Young suffers
from an immune-deficiency disorder so rare that she is the only
person who has been diagnosed with it. It cost her her left leg.
But neither the loss of the leg nor the possibility that a minor
injury like a cut could become life-threatening has kept her from
playing softball. She is one of the best hitters on her Atlanta
area recreation league team and maintains a radiant outlook on life
regardless of her circumstances. (Hildreth, Atlanta

   OLY-SWM-WALKER _ AUSTIN _ Mark Spitz. Matt Biondi. Neil Walker?
At first glance it seems odd to pair Walker's name with those of
some of the greatest swimmers in U.S. history. This March at the
short-course world championships in Athens, Greece, Walker joined
Spitz and Biondi as the only men ever to cop seven medals at a
major international competition. Five of the medals were gold and
the other two silver. In the process of collecting that haul,
Walker set not one, not two, but five world records. (Maher, Austin

Armstrong, is poised to make more of a name for himself this year.

   GLF-OPEN-QUALIFYING _ With visions of ``Tin Cup'' dancing in
their heads, more than 140 golfers gathered at Braelinn Golf Club
in Peachtree City on Monday to begin their quest for a berth in the
U.S. Open. They came in all shapes and sizes, from all walks of
life, with shared dreams -- shoot four good rounds of golf to
qualify for the opportunity to tee it up with the pros at Pebble
Beach in mid-June. That's the unique thing about the U.S. Open. If
your handicap is inside a 2, you plop down $150 and take your shot
at advancing from one of the hundreds of pre-qualifying sites. Four
survived at Braelinn. . . with regional qualifying tests to come.

NO EASY DECISIONS FOR A MAN OF DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In quitting the Senate race last week, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani discovered that choosing a therapy for prostate cancer was
a far more daunting effort than he had expected. Giuliani said he
had to focus entirely on the decision, letting his immediate
political future fall by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's difficulties spring largely from a radical change in
the relationship between patients and their doctors. Americans have
traded in paternalism for medical consumerism after fighting for a
greater voice in making critical decisions about their care. That
has not come without cost.
</P>
<P>
   Making crucial decisions in one's own care has become
increasingly complex. Tests now detect certain diseases like
prostate cancer earlier, increasing chances for cure. Treatment
choices are wider. Yet, for prostate cancer, doctors may not know
which treatment is best.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are forcing many people to assume a degree of
responsibility for their care unknown to their parents, and many
younger people are unprepared for the difficulties in making the
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's is a case in point. His father died in 1981 at 73 of
prostate cancer. The full facts in the elder Giuliani's case are
not known. But in that era, prostate cancer was usually not
detected until it had spread and was well beyond any hope of cure.
It also was an era when doctors decided the treatment, and few
patients questioned them.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, doctors rarely told patients that they had
cancer. In this new era of medical consumerism, most cancer
patients are told they have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A blood test known as PSA, for prostate specific antigen, led to
the detection of Giuliani's prostate cancer at an early stage. The
test did not exist in his father's lifetime. Thus, its use has
forced Giuliani to make decisions his father never had to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer patients like Joe Torre, the New York Yankees
manager, have told Giuliani about their experiences. With his
take-charge personality, Giuliani has sought medical advice from a
number of doctors throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani found that urologists and radiation oncologists tend to
champion their specialties and present medical information in
subtle ways intended to sway patients to their fields. Those
circumstances made the effort of becoming an informed patient
complex, frustrating and overwhelming, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients differ in how they make medical decisions. Many
prostate cancer patients who wish to start treatment immediately
settle on one within days of learning the diagnosis. Many others,
over their heads in the morass of medical nuance, need more time.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani learned he had prostate cancer he was caught up in
crucial political and personal decisions. He found himself
simultaneously tackling four jobs _ mayor, unofficial candidate for
the Senate, dealing with marital difficulties, and being a cancer
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Three or so weeks would be enough time to choose a treatment and
judge how it would affect his campaigning, Giuliani thought in his
initial timetable. But his other problems distracted him from
focusing on the medical decision, he said. In confronting his
mortality, he found making medical decisions much tougher than
making budgetary or legal decisions and the most difficult and
painful of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not prostate cancer was the sole reason for his
dropping out of the race, there is no question about the difficult
choices Giuliani confronted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand the impact of this,'' Giuliani said.
Unanswered Questions
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer ranks second to skin cancer as the most common
malignancy among men. It usually grows slowly and can take years
before proving fatal. The problem is that doctors do not know how
to tell which patient most needs early aggressive treatment and
which can wait. Thus, many more men are treated for prostate cancer
than would die from it had they not been treated at all. Under such
circumstances, doctors do not consider it risky for patients to
spend several weeks choosing a therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, choosing a therapy for prostate cancer is particularly
difficult because the crucial head-to-head studies that could
provide important answers have not been carried out. Instead,
patients have to rely on broad statistics that many feel may not
apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   Men with prostate cancer find themselves in a position similar
to the situation women with breast cancer faced a few years ago.
Decisions eased only when crucial studies were completed to show
that lumpectomy plus adjuvant drugs and radiation was an effective
alternative to radical mastectomy for early breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   2 POSSIBLE TREATMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is considering two main treatments: surgery to remove
the prostate or radiation therapy. Until last Friday, Giuliani had
to speculate about which therapy would get him back on the
senatorial campaign trail fastest and with fewest complications.
</P>
<P>
   Many men can do some routine desk work a few days after prostate
surgery. But it takes at least three weeks before they can travel,
and then many must deal with urinary incontinence and frequent
diaper changes. Adding to the complexity is that after surgeons
remove a prostate, pathologists look at it through a microscope for
malignant cells. If they find the cancer has spread, radiation
therapy may also be needed.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of radiation for prostate cancer, and
neither would seriously interfere with Giuliani's work as mayor.
Yet each would have posed problems for campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   In one form of radiation, doctors use needles for permanently
implanting radioactive ``seeds'' into the prostate. Radiation wears
off after several months. Because such patients emit tiny amounts
of radiation, they are warned to avoid continued close contact with
pregnant women and children. That is not a major problem for most
people. The amount of radiation in a fleeting exposure can be less
than the amount of radiation in the environment. Nevertheless, if
blown out of proportion, it could become a liability for a
hand-shaking, baby-kissing politician in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The second form is external radiation. For prostate cancer, it
is usually given five days a week for eight weeks. During that
time, a patient can work regular hours. But the patient is confined
to the geographic area in which he is being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Giuliani weighed such factors heavily as a
prospective senatorial candidate.

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not going too far to say that without Michael J. Fox,
``Spin City'' would likely have been canceled a long time ago. The
sitcom boasts a great idea _ cheerfully reveling in the wholesale
chicanery of big-city politics _ but for an ostensibly political
show, it's awfully toothless (``The West Wing'' has finally proven
a network series can deal with issue without viewers abandoning it
in droves). In reality, ``Spin's'' just another workplace comedy
with the usual requisite bunch of zany and inept characters.
</P>
<P>
   Put Fox in the mix, though, and his brand of lovable
unctuousness somehow redeems the whole thing. His gift was more in
evidence in ``Family Ties,'' the long-running series that made him
a star _ as Alex Keaton, Fox made his greed-is-good mantra seem
cuddly and adorably misguided. But he probably had a tougher job
with ``Spin City,'' since the writing for this show was more
schematic, so the fact that he's dragged it through four seasons is
perhaps a more impressive accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Also, here, Fox has just been one of a scheming, cynical bunch
of characters; the fact that he's the most competent helps him look
positively angelic amongst the duplicitous boobs he helps lead. Fox
announced earlier this year that he was leaving the show due to his
Parkinson's Disease _ a condition he had miraculously concealed
from the tabloids and mainstream press for nearly a decade - he
transformed tonight's season finale into an event. Few will tune in
to say goodbye to Michael Flaherty, Fox's character; instead,
they're bidding adieu to Fox himself (who really isn't going
anywhere _ he'll still serve as executive producer on the show and
direct some episodes next season).
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the writers can't rise to the occasion and make the
evening memorable. In tonight's episode, a reporter unearths the
fact that Mayor Winston (Barry Bostwick) _ and just about all of
his aides EXCEPT Mike Flaherty (Fox) _ have had an unwitting (and,
therefore, most unlikely), cushy relationship with a proverbial
reputed mobster. While the rest of the bunch searches for weasel
room, Mike nobly rescues the administration by grabbing the sword
and plunging himself upon it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone gets their requisite good-bye moment but, since these
aren't characters in whom we've invested a great deal of emotional
energy, the sentiment becomes more about Fox's condition than about
the flimsy plot. After all, there's no indication amidst the
chest-pounding that Flaherty's leaving town or walking out of their
lives forever (the show's producers didn't include the episode's
final, cliff-hanger scene on review copies).
</P>
<P>
   When Charlie Sheen joins the cast next year, that should do it
in _ not because Sheen doesn't have a facility for cynical comedy,
but because despite all the talk about ``Spin City'' being an
ensemble series, Fox truly was the heart of the show. And how many
folks do you know _ all right, outside of the entertainment
industry _ who can thrive without a heart? &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Spin City'' &QL; 
What: Season finale bidding farewell to star Michael J. Fox. &QL;

CHECHENS HOPE THEIR MUSES ARE LOUDER THAN BOMBS  

</HEADLINE>
   By SONIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Topa Elimbayev spent the last Chechen war in a basement
bomb shelter in Grozny. In 1995 Russian air raids and artillery
destroyed the dance theater he directed for 30 years, scattering
his troupe across the former Soviet Union. This time, with Grozny
flattened, he is in Moscow, teaching children to dance.
</P>
<P>
   Elimbayev, dancer-trim at 55, has not abandoned his homeland but
rather is fighting to save Chechen culture and break the stereotype
of his people as bandits and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to dance in exile, after Stalin deported the entire
Chechen population to Central Asia in 1944. His mission now, he
said, is to pass on centuries-old traditions to the children of
Moscow's large Chechen diaspora, threatened by assimilation and
ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When muses speak, cannons are silent,'' he said. ``This war
was started by idiots. We have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People should know about our culture,'' he continued. ``To be
proud of our nation, we have to have a very high culture.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one Chechen almost all Russians admired it was a
dancer, Makhmud Esambayev, known as the Wizard of Dance, who was
famous not only for Chechen dances but for those from Russia,
India, Brazil and dozens of other places as well. In the 1960s he
was one of the first in the post-Stalin era to perform a Jewish
dance publicly in the Soviet Union. His death in January at 75 was
widely reported in the Russian press.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechen culture dance is central to the courtship ritual:
Young men and women perform stirring, sensual dances but do not
touch, and dance is the heart of wedding festivities. But a special
occasion is not required.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Esambayev said, our little boys and girls start making
dance movements even before they walk,'' said Ruslan Nashkhoyev,
editor of a diaspora newspaper and author of a book about
Esambayev. ``It's part of our way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never lost this,'' he said. ``Not in deportation. Not even
here in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Nashkhoyev said that Chechen dance was similar to that of the
Basque region of Spain. Basques are thought by some to be
linguistically linked to the Caucasus region, home of the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekend Elimbayev's Vainakh Children's Arts and Culture
Center in Moscow attracts more than 200 children from age 4 to 14.
They gather in rented quarters at the sports hall of a clock
factory near downtown Moscow for lessons in dance, music and
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   The girls wear black leotards and white ballet skirts and
slippers, their hair pulled back so they look like little
ballerinas. Lined up in neat rows on a basketball court, they
practice graceful gliding movements and fluid hand gestures to a
drumbeat and accordion music. In a separate room boys in sweat
pants, T-shirts and knee pads take breathtaking slides and spins
across the floor. An even louder drumbeat accompanies their
high-stepping moves and sharp arm thrusts, all executed with a
determined gaze and heads held high. The children also learn the
basics of classical dance.
</P>
<P>
   Music lessons are taught by Ali Dimayev, a singer and composer
who has set Chechen folk music to rock beats and was inspired to
start writing a rock opera after hearing ``Jesus Christ
Superstar.'' His father was Chechnya's most famous accordionist,
whose playing, lauded by Stalin in 1939, was banned during the
deportation but heralded the Chechens' return home in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as music and dance are not taken from us, our nation
will live, we won't lose our identity, and we won't be defeated,''
Dimayev said during an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Parents come to the center to exchange the latest news from
home, for moral support and to give their children a respite from
their status as outsiders. Many Chechens do not look different from
Russians. They are often fair-skinned and light-haired; there are
blond and redheaded children at Vainakh, which means ``Our
People.'' But once their identities are known they become targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are treated as equals here,'' said Aishat
Arsanova, a refugee whose two sons, Abubakar, 10, and Ilyas, 11,
attend regularly. ``When Abubakar went to school, he asked me if he
could say he's from Grozny. Here everyone knows.''
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Bosnian Muslims opened a cultural center in Belgrade
as fighting raged in Sarajevo. Vainakh opened in November as
Russian fire was flattening what was left of Grozny and just two
months after explosions linked to Chechens ripped through two
apartment buildings in Moscow and two in southern Russia, killing
300. The apartment bombings set off a wave of anti-Chechen
sentiment, although a direct Chechen link has not been proven.
Elimbayev and others at the center said they were as angry at
Chechen extremists as they are at the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Vainakh is not a bastion of cultural exclusivity. The ballet
master is Armenian, and three of the six dance teachers are
Russian, as is the impresario who is promoting the center's
performances. All of them say they are in love with Chechen dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechens are a people of great artistry,'' said Mikhail
Plotnikov, the impresario. ``Through dance they strive to express
their anger, their pain, their love of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who cannot pay, lessons at the center are free. But in
a cruel blow, the center's main sponsor, a prominent Chechen
oilman, died in March in a mysterious plane crash in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Elimbayev's next best hope for financing may be
the Russian Culture Ministry. At a meeting at the ministry in March
he was promised a building for a children's arts school and money
to restore his original Vainakh dance troupe. Russian officials
apparently want to maintain Chechen culture in Moscow and transport
it home when conditions permit.
</P>
<P>
   But for now Elimbayev is focusing on his dream of a gala
performance by his children next year at the Tchaikovsky concert
hall, home of the Igor Moiseyev folk dance ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those children will explode such a bomb with their performance
at the Tchaikovsky hall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that the most cherished dream for Elimbayev,
the children and their parents is to return home to Chechnya.

as converging winds near a warm front cause moist air over the
region to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Thundershowers will move east from the eastern Ohio Valley and
Tennessee Valley early Tuesday. In the wake of the showers, partly
sunny and very warm conditions will develop. Tuesday afternoon, a
band of thunderstorms will erupt near a cold front moving east from
the central Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual heat will spread from the Southwest to the southern
Plains while cool air reaches the northern Rockies.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DESERT HEAT  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Searing heat has come early to the deserts of the Southwest
where desiccating warmth is the norm in the summer months. Daytime
temperatures in the 90s or higher are normal from May to September.
On Sunday, the mercury soared to 114 degrees in Thermal, Calif.,
eclipsing the previous record for the day by 8 degrees. The
Southwest lies in a belt of high pressure that girdles the globe
near 30 degrees north latitude. The sinking air in the high
pressure zone suppresses clouds, promoting desert climates from
Arizona to Africa to Asia. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A dance floor with a 50-foot window on Central Park
will be the new face of Jazz at Lincoln Center. At a news
conference Tuesday the organization is to unveil plans for its new
home, including what are billed as the world's first concert halls
built especially for jazz: a 100,000-square-foot complex at
Columbus Circle with two auditoriums, a club-size jazz cafe, two
rehearsal studios and a classroom, all wired for recording,
broadcast and Webcast.
</P>
<P>
   In its new spaces the organization intends to present jazz 365
days a year, with its larger rooms also available for opera, dance
and the Lincoln Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Wynton Marsalis, the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln
Center, said, ``Everything is going to be integrated: The
relationship between one space and another, the relationship
between the audience and the musicians will be one fluid motion
because that's how our music is.''
</P>
<P>
   The jazz complex includes a 1,100-seat concert theater that can
be configured with or without a proscenium stage. It also includes
a 600-seat performance atrium with a dance floor surrounded by
tiers of tables, like a latter-day Rainbow Room, where musicians
will perform in front of a window overlooking the park from six
stories up.
</P>
<P>
   The 140-seat jazz cafe will also have a park view. A marquee at
Broadway and 60th Street will list the day's performances on an
electronic sign. And on the way to performances visitors will pass
through a multimedia Jazz Hall of Fame. The complex is to be named
Frederick P. Rose Hall for the donor who gave $10 million to get
the project started.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz center is a $103 million project to be built within the
$1.6 billion, 2.5 million-square-foot corporate, condominium and
hotel complex called Columbus Center, on the former site of the New
York Coliseum. Rose Hall is to fit into Columbus Center between two
750-foot towers holding the headquarters of AOL-Time Warner,
broadcast studios, stores, condominiums, a garage and a Mandarin
Oriental Hotel. Construction is to begin in April 2001, and the new
center is to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The performance spaces are designed for the acoustics and
ambience of jazz performance, drawing on inspirations that range
from New Orleans street parades to Greek amphitheaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing was the quality of the sound,'' Marsalis said.
``We're going for the clearest sound, but with warm and golden
overtones: golden but not too dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional concert halls have been built for classical music,
and their long reverberation often makes jazz sound muddled, with
too much echo. With the new theater, Marsalis said, ``we're trying
to find a space in which the tail of the echo is long enough to be
slightly dry as a classical hall but perfect for us.'' The
acoustics will be adjustable.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz center has been designed by Rafael Vinoly, who is also
the architect for the new home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the
Philadelphia Regional Performing Arts Center, and for the Tokyo
Forum, a convention center and railroad station. For Jazz at
Lincoln Center, he said, the building ``is an attempt to create a
space that puts jazz where it should be, which is essentially at
the geographic and symbolic center of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's initial mandate for the Columbus Circle
space, which was owned by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, was that it include a new theater or opera house. Jazz
at Lincoln Center first sought to design a theater that could
accommodate both opera and jazz. But as it became clear that the
two forms had very different needs, Vinoly suggested creating both
the theater and the performance atrium, a jazz room with a view.
</P>
<P>
   The theater has a larger stage than the New York State Theater,
but is more intimate, with a seating area that is 30 feet shorter
than Alice Tully Hall. Its stage can be framed by a proscenium and
raised for dance or opera performances, or lowered for jazz
concerts, bringing the musicians closer to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't like to be above people when I'm playing,''
Marsalis said. There is fly space above the stage for scenery but
also a ceiling that can be closed so that sound does not escape
upward.
</P>
<P>
   With the proscenium removed for jazz performances, 200
additional seats can be placed behind the stage, bringing the
audience into the performance. ``A majority of the musicians you
talk to would rather have the feeling of people being part of their
ensemble, rather than being separate from them,'' Marsalis said.
``It engenders a feeling of community, which is why most musicians
got started in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz at Lincoln Center expects to use the theater space for its
own productions about three months a year and rent it for dance,
world music and classical programs, including part of the Great
Performers series. The theater is the same size as a multipurpose
hall that Lincoln Center had hoped to build in 1997 at Broadway and
64th Street, a plan rejected by Lincoln Center's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a place for the other constituents of Lincoln
Center to do their programs as well,'' said Rob Gibson, executive
director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. ``Now we can have the
Philharmonic down to our place.'' The Lincoln Center Festival has
agreed to use the theater, and Gibson said many dance companies had
already shown interest in booking the space. Because the new
building is not governed by Lincoln Center's current contracts,
Jazz at Lincoln Center will be negotiating new ones with stage and
technical workers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis and Gibson envision the atrium, with its bandstand by
the huge window, as a place where the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra
can settle in, they said. Programs that they might have presented
for three nights at Alice Tully Hall could be performed for two
weeks. Although the glass wall _ a huge, hard, reflective surface _
presents a challenge for the room's acoustic design, Jazz at
Lincoln Center and Vinoly are confident that the room can sound
good.
</P>
<P>
   The entire building's design, Vinoly said, is intended to lessen
the separation between audience and performers that is reinforced
in most concert halls. ``This is what distinguishes jazz as a
social statement,'' he said. ``There is a sense of integration, of
participation beyond just enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gibson described the new complex as a place for
interdisciplinary connections. The performance spaces share the
lobby, so dance or opera audiences might mingle with jazz fans. He
also envisions a subscription series that could combine, for
example, the Ballet Hispanico in the theater with Chico O'Farrill's
Afro-Cuban big band in the atrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz intersects with every performing art form,'' said Gordon
J. Davis, chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center, ``and the hallmark of
the program created by Rob and Wynton is to make that clear to
everybody. Of all the institutions at Lincoln Center we're probably
the ones who collaborate the most with other art forms, from City
Ballet to Juilliard to the Philharmonic and the Film Society.''
</P>
<P>
   The 600-seat performance atrium overlooking the park would be
used for jazz eight months a year, while there would be jazz in the
cafe every night. With daytime educational programs in the jazz
cafe, classroom and studios, Rose Hall would probably be open from
8 a.m. to 2 a.m., and Marsalis said he would like to see the cafe
become a place for jam sessions into the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who died in September, was a real estate executive who
also endowed the new planetarium at the American Museum of Natural
History and the Rose Building at Lincoln Center. Along with his
donation, Jazz at Lincoln Center has received $10 million from
Irene Diamond, $18 million from the city, $2 million from the Ford
Foundation and $1 million from the Manhattan Borough President's
office. Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records will underwrite the Jazz
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz at Lincoln Center still needs to raise more than $55
million; donors are being sought to name the performance atrium
(for $10 million) and the jazz cafe ($5 million). Large donors can
also buy season tickets for boxes in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is not the most important thing,'' Davis said.
``The most important thing is what will go in it: the spirit, the
program, the education. We believe deeply that the building will
make all of that more powerful. This is not simply a hall, this is
a much more complicated and, we hope, extraordinary mix of
possibilities.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN ELECTION GETS WILDER AS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE PLAN FLOPS
 &HT;    (450&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The most competitive presidential race in Mexico's
modern history turned wilder with the sudden cancellation of a
pivotal debate that was scheduled for Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was expected to feature the top three candidates, but
was called off late Saturday night after negotiators failed to
agree on a format.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday representatives of the candidates met again to see if
they could salvage the event, which would have been the second
televised debate held during this country's contentious race for
president.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting _ whose outcome was unknown as of Monday evening
_ was convened only after the candidates publicly labeled one
another as cowards who foiled the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the debate was another example of the tense,
unpredictable nature of this high-stakes campaign. This is the
first time in 71 years that Mexico's ruling Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI, is behind in some opinion polls and
could lose the presidential election, scheduled for July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Observers appear divided on who had the most to lose by backing
out of a debate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI and its candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa ``are the
ones that are chicken,'' said Federico Estevez, political analyst
with Mexico's nonpartisan Center for Research and Development.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida tried to pin blame on Vicente Fox Quesada, a
former Coca-Cola executive and candidate of Mexico's conservative
National Action Party, or PAN. Fox is ahead in some polls and poses
a very real threat to Labastida, and the PRI's seven-decade
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Fox insisted on having a U.S.-style debate with three
interviewers asking questions during the 90-minute encounter. He
also objected to a plan by Mexico's television networks to air the
debate on stations with the least number of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, who rejected the idea of a panel, accused Fox of
wanting close friends of his to be included as interviewers and
said a panel format wouldn't be a traditional debate.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate of Mexico's leftist
Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, also blamed Fox for being
inflexible. He too rejected the idea of a panel.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Trevino, a Labastida adviser, called Fox ``two-faced''
and ``ridiculous'' and suggested Fox wanted to sabotage the debate
so he wouldn't have to face attacks as the campaign heads toward
the final stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``His clear intention was not to have the debate,'' Trevino
said. ``He thinks he's running for president of his high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Estevez , however, said Fox's terms for the debate _ especially
a bigger audience _ made sense given his momentum as a leading
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the frontrunner now. Why should he expose himself? He
should at least get better channels or a better format,'' Estevez
said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference on Sunday, Fox accused Labastida of being
afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to confront questions from various
interviewers because they can't defend 70 years of corruption,
crime and poverty,'' he said. ``They don't want the freedom of
spontaneous questions for the candidates because they are afraid
they won't know any answers. They want questions to be sent to them
ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday night broadcast on Mexico's Television Azteca, the
country's second largest network, Fox jeered at Labastida while
both were being questioned about the debate's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, blaming Fox, said in a statement: ``I'm going to
fulfill my promise that the debate happens. The debate is not an
obligation for candidates, but it is a right that the people have.
I'm going to defend that right.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates held their first debate in April. Fox was widely
judged in Mexico City to be the winner of that encounter, which
included Labastida, Cardenas and three other minor candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that in a second three-way debate Labastida and
Cardenas would have both reserved most of their attacks for Fox.

 UNDATED: Gun Ri.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bowman; Joseph L. Galloway, the writer of the U.S. News article;
and Ed Offley, the Washington bureau chief of the stripes.com Web
site discovered personnel records flatly contradicting Daily's
assertions about his military service: that he was a prisoner of
war, that he had received certain decorations, and, most important,
that he served with H Company, the unit of the 7th Cavalry Regiment
directly involved in the No Gun Ri incident.
</P>
<P>
   How solid is the new evidence?
</P>
<P>
   It has raised serious doubts among some reporters who trusted
Daily. He has responded to very few questioners. When Galloway
reached him, Daily raised the possibility that his memory had been
affected by emotional trauma or his anti-depressant medication.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Hanley, one of the AP reporters, said he originally
found Daily's accounts of events convincing, and trusted his
documentary evidence: a driver's license placing him with the
company in March 1950, a letter home naming his company commander,
and an H Company ceremonial Christmas dinner menu from Dec. 25,
1949. Not until recently did Hanley get documentation of the
conflicting personnel records.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley said this past weekend: ``There is a discrepancy in the
sketchy military record of one of our more than 40 sources. We are
trying to get to the bottom of it. But this source provided no
essential information for our report on No Gun Ri.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question, however, that the newly discovered
personnel records cast doubt on Daily's claims, not only about No
Gun Ri but about his entire military career.
</P>
<P>
   How important is Daily? AP's executive editor, Jonathan Wolman,
said in a statement last week: ``Serious questions involve veteran
Ed Daily. We spoke to soldiers who put him at the scene and have
reviewed the documentation he offered for his role.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If it turns out that he and those records deceived
us, we will be extremely regretful, and saddened for him. But the
tale of No Gun Ri does not fall on the words of Daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley points out that Daily is not quoted until the 56th
paragraph of the original account. And he said that several other
veterans confirmed the basic fact of the killing before Daily did.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stephen G. Smith, the editor of U.S. News, describes
Daily as ``the linchpin'' of the wire service's original report.
``He's the one who ties it all together,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the AP account depends on what Smith calls ``a mosaic of
partial quotes,'' the fact that Daily's three quotes were vivid,
full sentences dealing with the event, the orders and the veterans'
feelings of guilt made him more crucial than the other veterans
interviewed, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Few of those skeptical of the overall report mention the South
Korean witnesses, who are also quoted at some length.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these South Koreans are seeking reparations, a fact
mentioned with some irritation by two veterans interviewed by The
New York Times last week. Few journalists have reinterviewed the
South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanley bristles at the idea that their quest for reparations
casts doubt on their memories. ``Frankly,'' he said, ``it is
analogous to questioning the right of Holocaust victims to seek
some token of reparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules
</P>
<P>
   Amid Fear, Were There Orders to Kill?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being the public face of No Gun Ri, Daily is also one
of three former soldiers who tell the AP _ either in the original
report or in a video on the wire service's Web site _ that their
commanders on the scene ordered them to fire. He told the AP: ``The
command looked at it as getting rid of the problem in the easier
way. That was to shoot them in a a group.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of orders is crucial to determining whether the
killings were simply lethal overreaction by young soldiers scared
that enemy troops were hidden among the civilians, or whether they
constituted a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   A second soldier from H Company, Eugene Hesselman, was quoted as
saying that the company commander, Capt. Melbourne C. Chandler, had
said: ``To hell with all those people. Let's get rid of all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News points out that H Company's morning report for July
27, the summary of a unit's activity the day before, listed
Hesselman as having been wounded on July 26. But its attempts to
reach Hesselman proved unsuccessful. Hesselman, in an interview
long before the name of No Gun Ri was widely known, had told the AP
that he had a small shrapnel wound and declined to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, however, said that the medical battalion's morning
reports indicated that Hesselman had been evacuated to the medical
unit on July 26, the day of the massacre. However, the morning
report of July 27 does not indicate when that transfer occurred _
before or after the shooting, before or after any order might have
been given.
</P>
<P>
   The third veteran to mention orders, George Preece, does so in a
videotaped interview with Hanley. In an interview with The
Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader days after the AP released its
original report on Sept. 29, Preece retracted the statement, and he
has since denied that any orders were given.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanley said on Friday that he now has interviews with 10
former GIs confirming that there were direct orders. As for the
retractions and rollbacks of some veterans on the details and even
the existence of the killings, Hanley said he believed that the
former GIs had come under pressure from fellow veterans, or were
worried about possible war-crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley also points out that no veteran came to AP volunteering
information for the original article.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``These guys were called cold,'' and remembered details
of the events that in many cases matched the details the South
Koreans had given.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley also says that arguments about on-the-scene orders
overlook two general orders from top commanders. The 1st Cavalry
Division headquarters on July 24 had issued an order saying: ``No
refugees to cross the front line. Fire everyone trying to cross
lines. Use discretion in case of women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News made no reference to these general orders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would frame his account differently if he had
to do it again, Galloway replied: ``If I had time to do the other
interviews and sit back and ponder, I might have written it
differently. But still, as it stands, not bad. I think we did a
good job in the time that we had. I stand behind it. I think in the
end, when the investigation is over and done, there will be a lot
more holes shot in the AP story.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he meant by ``in the time we had,'' Galloway said he
was trying to get his piece published before Offley and Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the crucial centerpiece of the AP report, the
American soldiers killed at least 100 Korean civilians _ possibly
under direct orders _ has been chipped but hardly shattered by the
latest revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Patterson, a rifleman in the 2nd Battalion, said in an
interview with The New York Times last week: ``Unfortunately, the
incident took place. Numbers are not known exactly.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Carol Goodman, a 71-year-old writer from Morristown, N.J.,
was hiking in the Swiss Alps four years ago when she became dizzy,
lost her sense of balance and began, as she put it, walking like a
drunk. She managed to get back to her friends' home in St. Moritz
and went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke the next morning with the room spinning,'' she
recalled. After she began vomiting, she was taken by ambulance to a
nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I got there, the doctors said my eyes were
jiggling out of my head,'' she said. ``I was on the fastest roller
coaster in the world and could not stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss doctors stabilized nerve spasms in and around her eyes
and she flew home to New Jersey the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman says her collapse was the culmination of health problems
she had steadily developed since 1992, when she was bitten by a
tick in her backyard and Lyme disease was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   After the bite, she began to feel tired and achy and was treated
with a 28-day course of antibiotics. Still feeling ill, she was
referred to a well-known specialist in Lyme disease, Dr. Allen C.
Steere of Boston, who told her she did not need more antibiotics
and would improve on her own, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said: ``I began to be in constant leg and back
pain. I had an irregular heartbeat, memory problems. My nerves
would jolt as if I were getting electric shocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's experience is at the center of a bitter medical debate
over Lyme disease that has been simmering for years, but that has
now erupted in anger and increasingly vocal and formal accusations.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is Goodman's former doctor, Steere, who first
identified Lyme disease in the United States 25 years ago in a
cluster of patients in Lyme, Conn. Steere, along with a majority of
mainstream doctors, say most cases of Lyme disease can be
successfully treated with 30 to 60 days of antibiotics, which they
say kills the Lyme infection.
</P>
<P>
   If symptoms continue, they are probably caused by something
else, these doctors say _ like a form of post-Lyme syndrome or some
poorly understood condition that may persist after the infection is
killed; or they are caused by an unrelated problem, like chronic
fatigue syndrome, psychiatric illness or diseases with similar
symptoms, like lupus or multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say, long regimens of expensive antibiotics are
unnecessary, and can be even dangerous, after the infection has
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are doctors like Dr. Joseph J. Burrascano, an
internist and family doctor in East Hampton, N.Y., a leader of
those who say patients with symptoms like Goodman's suffer from
long-term, or chronic, Lyme disease and need long-term antibiotic
treatment. The bacteria that cause the disease, known as
spirochete, they say, can bore so deeply into tissue that they
evade initial treatments and remain infectious.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, both Steere and Burrascano have been
ordered by their states' medical boards to answer formal complaints
about their practices. Earlier this month, members of Congress from
Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania asked for an inquiry into
accusations that federal health officials were showing scientific
bias and misallocating research money designated for Lyme research.
</P>
<P>
   They asked the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of Congress, to look into accusations by patients, doctors and
scientists who are challenging the mainstream position.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said that
given the seriousness of the complaints, ``we believe it is
incumbent upon us to request an unbiased investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, patients who say they have had experiences similar to
Goodman's have become more incensed. They say they often cannot get
treatment, leaving them bedridden and suffering a range of symptoms
from brain damage and cognitive difficulties to memory loss,
blindness or death.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients, many on crutches or in wheelchairs, have been
holding meetings and protest rallies in Pennsylvania. Others have
complained at meetings and hearings in the New York, Texas and
Connecticut Legislatures, and patient-support groups have sprung up
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Coughlan, coordinator of the Massachusetts Lyme Disease
Coalition, a patient group on Cape Cod, says his group gets an
average of 50 calls a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people are desperately ill and in pain and they
cannot get effective treatment or any treatment at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Steere has become the subject of seven formal
complaints and four letters of complaint filed with the
Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine by patients who
accuse him of misdiagnosing or mistreating their conditions and
causing their health to worsen. Copies of their complaints were
obtained by the New York Times. Nancy Achin Sullivan, executive
director of the board, said that she could not comment on the
pending case but that 11 such complaints would be considered a high
number.
</P>
<P>
   Steere, in an interview, would not comment on individual cases,
but said the complaints were ``completely without merit and I am
confident that they will be dismissed.'' He said he was a victim of
``organized harassment,'' adding that his treatment followed
accepted guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eugene D. Shapiro, a professor of pediatrics at the Yale
University School of Medicine and a supporter of Steere's position,
said many patients were not treated for Lyme disease because they
did not have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myth has become that whatever you have, it must be Lyme
disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burrascano, meanwhile, was notified in December that he must
face a hearing before the New York's medical licensing board, the
State Office of Professional Medical Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Burrascano said he was first notified that he was under
investigation seven years ago after he testified in Congress
against limiting antibiotics for Lyme patients. Shortly afterward,
state inspectors visited his office, he said, and took files of
Lyme patients. To his knowledge, he said, none of his patients have
complained to the state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   He said he heard nothing until December, when he was told of the
hearing . But, he said, he has been not told what the charges are,
who filed them and or when the hearing will be held. Kristine
Smith, a spokesman for the New York board, said she could not
discuss pending cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Burrascano said: ``Whatever the medical board is saying,
what most impresses me about all this is that the Lyme patients I
see are so incredibly sick. And other doctors are not helping them.
I just follow common sense. I listen to my patients and if there's
something I can't understand, I try to figure it out. I don't just
dismiss them.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Greening, 31, of Sayville, N.Y., a former gymnastics
teacher, said Lyme disease struck her when she was 22, forcing her
to use a wheelchair at times and then immobilizing her. Several
other doctors had failed to help, she said, when she saw
Burrascano.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved my life,'' said Greening, who is now able to walk
again. ``I feel safe now and for the first time hope I'm on the
road to recovery. But what would happen to me if he couldn't
practice?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth B. Liegner, a Lyme specialist and internist in
Armonk, N.Y., said the action taken against Burrascano last
December ``simply amounts to a war on doctors who are just trying
to find a way to help patients who are very sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for doctors to want to push their views,'' he
said, ``but what's going on here is an attempt to stand in the way
and prevent others from practicing theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   At this point, many scientists contend that too little long-term
research has been done to know who is right. Dr. Pierce Gardner, a
dean at the State University of New York at Stony Brook School of
Medicine, wrote in a recent editorial in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, that there was still no valid way to
assess and manage the disease over the long term, adding,
``Uncertainty breeds strong disparate opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the formal complaints against Steere, which came from
Goodman, said he had failed to give enough antibiotics and told her
that she was going to recover.
</P>
<P>
   When she continued to get worse, she said in an interview, she
could not get another appointment and was told by a research
assistant in the doctor's office that she should try an
antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New Jersey, she said, she was unable to find a doctor
who would treat her. She said doctors often cited Steere's
treatment guidelines, said they could not help and suggested
psychiatric help. Steere declined to discuss individual patients,
but said he gave patients the best and most appropriate care.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Goodman said, she was carried in her husband's arms
into the office of Dr. Bernard Davidoff of Morristown, who
diagnosed her condition as persistent Lyme disease based on her
symptoms. She then saw Liegner, who said he confirmed the diagnosis
from blood tests and her symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Liegner, who also spoke in an interview, said he had treated
more than 1,000 patients with experiences similar to Goodman's. He
said he had put her on long-term oral antibiotics. When he tried to
stop the treatments, she relapsed. Both Goodman and Liegner said
she was still taking antibiotics, and was now in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Other patients who filed complaints against Steere echoed her
experience, saying he contended that either they no longer had Lyme
disease if they had had the 30 days of antibiotics, or that they
had never had it.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kineavy, a registered nurse from Boston, who also filed a
formal complaint, said in an accompanying letter that she had had a
positive blood test and debilitating symptoms when she was referred
to Steere and had another positive test two weeks after he
dismissed her. Kineavy said she was flabbergasted when Steere told
her, ``You've never had Lyme disease in your entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Steere fired one of the first shots in the Lyme wars in
a study, ``The Overdose of Lyme Disease,'' that was published in
The Journal of the American Medical Association. He said that of
788 patients referred to his rheumatology clinic by other doctors
who had diagnosed their conditions as Lyme disease, only a minority
actually had the disease, according to his blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   Among critics of the study, Dr. Craig P. Cleveland, a Cincinnati
clinician, said in a letter to the editor of the journal that it
was saying in effect, ``Your tests are wrong and mine are right.''
Because diagnostic blood tests for Lyme are often inaccurate, the
critics said, the study was not conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Steere agreed that tests in some other laboratories were
inaccurate but said his were not. n the subject of prolonged
antibiotic therapy, he said, ``I have been discouraged by what I
have seen.'' He said he had had better success with medications
aimed specifically at individual symptoms that persisted, like
pain, depression or chronic fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the other side of the debate, Dr. Brian A. Fallon, an
associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons, wrote of three
long-term case studies of psychiatric disorders in a 1998 article
in the journal Psychiatric Clinics of North America. It was titled
``The Underdiagnosis of Neuropsychiatric Lyme Disease in Children
and Adults.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the cases was that of a 7-year-old girl identified only
as Susan. According to Fallon, she received a diagnosis of
attention deficit disorder but she grew increasingly tired,
forgetful and had difficulty speaking, suffered joint pain and
sensitivity to light and sound.
</P>
<P>
   In the second grade she tested positive for Lyme disease. After
she was put on antibiotics, she improved physically and began to
get straight As. But when taken off the antibiotics, she would
quickly regress, a situation that persisted until she was 9, when
her condition stabilized. Then at 12, the pain, headaches and poor
concentration and poor grades returned. After she was put back on
antibiotics for several months, she improved again, and now at 15
she is off the medication and in good health, Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
   The case study is regarded as too small to prove the value of
long-term antibiotics, which Fallon readily concedes. But he said
it was one of the few observations of chronic Lyme patients carried
out over long periods of time. ``Basically, I intended it to help
clinicians avoid misdiagnoses,'' he said.

&HT;     COURT STRIKES DOWN TIME LIMIT ON CABLE SEX SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, siding with Playboy
Entertainment Group, on Monday struck down a federal law designed
to shield children from accidental exposure to erotic cable
programs that their parents have not chosen to receive.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the court agreed with Playboy that the law
was too broad and violated the First Amendment rights of cable
viewers to receive sexually explicit programs.
</P>
<P>
   The law required cable operators that don't fully scramble, or
block, sex-oriented networks for nonsubscribers to limit those
channels' ``indecent'' programs _ even to paying subscribers _ to
the hours between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. when children are probably not
watching television.``Basic speech principles are at stake in this
cases,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court. ``The
history of the law of free expression is one of vindication in
cases involving speech that many citizens may find shabby,
offensive, or even ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that the broadcasting of indecent material into
homes was an area the government could ``address'' but that it
needed to do so in ``a way consistent with the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, ending a dispute over regulating cable systems
</P>
<P>
   that fail to fully scramble signals for nonsubscribers, was
hailed as a victory over government censorship and attacked as an
</P>
<P>
   abandonment of impressionable youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Chairwoman Christie Hefner said, ``We have maintained
all along that (the law) was unconstitutional, unnecessary and
impractical. We felt it was an intrusion on individual choice by
the federal government.''Daniel Brenner of the National Cable
Television Association, added that the ruling ``takes into account
the needs of viewers who want this programming and those who do
not. Both can be
</P>
<P>
   accommodated, and cable is committed to making sure such
channels
</P>
<P>
   are blocked for viewers who don't want them,''
</P>
<P>
   But Janet LaRue, an attorney with the conservative Family
Research Council, called the ruling an ``outrage'' and added,
``It's a sad day when the protection of children takes a back
</P>
<P>
   seat to the profits of pornographers.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law, the Communications Decency Act, in 1996
to address the concerns of parents who complained that a technical
problem known as ``signal bleed''_ in which sound and distorted
images from sexually explicit channels are not completely blocked
electronically _ was allowing their children to view adult
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Playboy Entertainment Group, a cable TV spinoff
of the magazine, challenged the law. The company argued that it was
regulatory overkill and restricted adults' access to
constitutionally protected speech.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy also contended that the problem of signal bleed was
present only in some areas of the country and that the cable
operators had offered subscribers a free special box that fully
blocked adult programming. Therefore, the company said, a blanket,
across-the-board ban on those types of channels during daytime and
early evening hours was inappropriate and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 a special three-judge federal district court in
Wilmington, Del., agreed with Playboy, saying that less restrictive
alternatives _ the free blocking boxes _ were available to address
the issue. Therefore, the panel said, the law's requirement that
cable operators limit the viewing time of indecent shows was
``overly burdensome'' and therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The court said giving adequate notice of the blocking-box
alternative would be less restrictive than barring adult-oriented
programs in the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   In its direct appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court, the
Clinton administration argued that without the law, children whose
parents did not subscribe to such channels would often be able to
see and hear raunchy programs that haven't been properly scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   The government's brief included testimony from a Florida woman
who said she found her 7- and 8-year-old children and a playmate
one afternoon watching the Spice channel, with scenes of a couple
seemingly having sex.
</P>
<P>
   The problem occurs in as many as 39 million homes with 29
million children, a Justice Department lawyer told the court during
arguments last November.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable systems have the capacity to block unwanted channels on
a household-by-household basis,'' Kennedy said. ``Targeted blocking
is less restrictive than banning, and the government cannot ban
speech if blocking is a feasible and effective means of furthering
its compelling interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the dissenters, Justice Stephen Breyer said the
majority's decision ``threatens to leave Congress without power to
help the millions of parents who do not want to expose their
children to commercial pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia joined Breyer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bruce Fein, a constitutional law scholar here, said the close
5-4 decision showed that the court is struggling with how to deal
with new technologies, such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology makes it difficult protect children without
blocking out material constitutionally protected to the parents,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a federal
law making it a crime to send or display indecent material on the
Internet in a way available to minors. The unanimous decision
marked the court's first effort to extend the principles of the
First Amendment into cyberspace and to confront the nature of a
new, and an unfamiliar medium.

&HT;     SUDDEN GULF STORMS DON'T DISSUADE FISHING ENTHUSIASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GOODSPEED  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKPORT, Texas _ The best-laid plans of mice and fishermen
often go astray.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Scottish poet Robert Burns would have written if he
had ever anticipated an angling trip for months only to arrive at
the Gulf coast at the same time as a storm.
</P>
<P>
   But fishing guides can be as determined as the proverbial
postman: Neither rain, nor sleet, nor wind ... If the client wants
to go fishing badly enough, four Rockport guides agree they're
ready to brave rain and rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish are already wet anyway,'' said Phillip Durst of Just
One More Guide Service. ``This is a popular spot for people from
San Antonio, Austin and Houston, and they've been planning their
trip for months. If it's raining or bad weather is on the way, I'll
ask them at the dock if they want to go or wait for another day.
Most of them say, `Let's go get it' _ unless it's lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   It's usually tough to get guides to agree on some matters, but
they're united on lightning _ it's a bad thing. Sometimes, however,
it's difficult to convince clients to call it a day when they're
catching fish between crashes of thunder, said Rocky Rouquette of
Tecolote Charter Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that some people don't understand,'' Rouquette
said. ``But what's there to understand? You have a graphite rod in
your hand and your foot in saltwater. You can get over being wet,
but you're not going to get over being struck by lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   Storms can build quickly on the Gulf of Mexico and put a damper
on a trip _ or even force a run for safety. No guide wants to put
himself or clients into dangerous situations and all pay close
attention to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, even quiet clouds can offer warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Saucedo of Bahia Rica Adventures recalls taking a doctor,
his wife and two sons out last Father's Day after the rain stopped.
They started catching fish immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I looked over and saw the lines up off the water,''
Saucedo says, explaining that static electricity will build before
a thunderstorm. ``I looked at the father, and his hair was standing
straight up. I said, `We've got to get out of here. It's ready to
start bolting.' He didn't want to go, so I pulled my hat off and my
hair stood up. He said, `Is that bad?' And this guy's a surgeon. I
said, `What do you think?'''
</P>
<P>
   They raced back to the dock just as sky broke open with wind,
rain and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Graphite fishing rods also can let you know that something is in
the air, said Larry Ebest of Backwater Safari Guide Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's enough static electricity in the air, you can put a
graphite rod up to your ear and hear it creaking,'' Ebest said.
``The pole becomes a lightning rod. You know something is about to
happen, and it would be best to head on in.''
</P>
<P>
   Guides set their own policies for what to do if a trip is
canceled because of weather. Some will refund the deposit, but most
would rather reschedule the trip.
</P>
<P>
   They all agree that going ahead with a trip in foul weather is a
judgment call between the guide and client. If it's just raining
and the wind is not too high, they'll tough it out if the client
wants to. If a trip is cut short because of weather, then the guide
must decide whether to charge or reschedule, and most understand
that a client does not want to feel cheated.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather is like walking a tightrope, though, Saucedo said.
If the guide says no, some clients might feel that he doesn't want
to go. If he says yes, they could think he just wants to drive them
around, let them get so miserable they'll call it off and the guide
will still keep the money, knowing they were not really going to
fish in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   That brings up the biggest question _ do fish still bite in the
rain?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually not a good day when it's raining,'' Durst said.
But it's still possible to get a limit of reds or specks, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A hard rain will push the baitfish down so you'll have to fish
deeper. If there was a thunderstorm the night before, the fishing
might shut down until midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't think fish will bite if it's raining,''
Ebest said. ``But if you're not fishing, it's impossible to know if
they're biting.''
</P>
<P>
   Saucedo agreed, adding that wind and rough water will make it
harder to reach certain sweet spots, but they'll still be biting.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've canceled your best-laid plans and you're pacing
like a rat in a trap in your hotel room when your stomach starts
growling, just remember: You're not the only one who's hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish are going to eat every day, even in the rain,'' Saucedo
said.

NO EASY DECISIONS FOR A MAN OF DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeats to fix byline.)   (The Science Times)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In quitting the Senate race last week, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani discovered that choosing a therapy for prostate cancer was
a far more daunting effort than he had expected. Giuliani said he
had to focus entirely on the decision, letting his immediate
political future fall by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's difficulties spring largely from a radical change in
the relationship between patients and their doctors. Americans have
traded in paternalism for medical consumerism after fighting for a
greater voice in making critical decisions about their care. That
has not come without cost.
</P>
<P>
   Making crucial decisions in one's own care has become
increasingly complex. Tests now detect certain diseases like
prostate cancer earlier, increasing chances for cure. Treatment
choices are wider. Yet, for prostate cancer, doctors may not know
which treatment is best.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are forcing many people to assume a degree of
responsibility for their care unknown to their parents, and many
younger people are unprepared for the difficulties in making the
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's is a case in point. His father died in 1981 at 73 of
prostate cancer. The full facts in the elder Giuliani's case are
not known. But in that era, prostate cancer was usually not
detected until it had spread and was well beyond any hope of cure.
It also was an era when doctors decided the treatment, and few
patients questioned them.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, doctors rarely told patients that they had
cancer. In this new era of medical consumerism, most cancer
patients are told they have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A blood test known as PSA, for prostate specific antigen, led to
the detection of Giuliani's prostate cancer at an early stage. The
test did not exist in his father's lifetime. Thus, its use has
forced Giuliani to make decisions his father never had to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer patients like Joe Torre, the New York Yankees
manager, have told Giuliani about their experiences. With his
take-charge personality, Giuliani has sought medical advice from a
number of doctors throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani found that urologists and radiation oncologists tend to
champion their specialties and present medical information in
subtle ways intended to sway patients to their fields. Those
circumstances made the effort of becoming an informed patient
complex, frustrating and overwhelming, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients differ in how they make medical decisions. Many
prostate cancer patients who wish to start treatment immediately
settle on one within days of learning the diagnosis. Many others,
over their heads in the morass of medical nuance, need more time.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani learned he had prostate cancer he was caught up in
crucial political and personal decisions. He found himself
simultaneously tackling four jobs _ mayor, unofficial candidate for
the Senate, dealing with marital difficulties, and being a cancer
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Three or so weeks would be enough time to choose a treatment and
judge how it would affect his campaigning, Giuliani thought in his
initial timetable. But his other problems distracted him from
focusing on the medical decision, he said. In confronting his
mortality, he found making medical decisions much tougher than
making budgetary or legal decisions and the most difficult and
painful of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not prostate cancer was the sole reason for his
dropping out of the race, there is no question about the difficult
choices Giuliani confronted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand the impact of this,'' Giuliani said.
Unanswered Questions
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer ranks second to skin cancer as the most common
malignancy among men. It usually grows slowly and can take years
before proving fatal. The problem is that doctors do not know how
to tell which patient most needs early aggressive treatment and
which can wait. Thus, many more men are treated for prostate cancer
than would die from it had they not been treated at all. Under such
circumstances, doctors do not consider it risky for patients to
spend several weeks choosing a therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, choosing a therapy for prostate cancer is particularly
difficult because the crucial head-to-head studies that could
provide important answers have not been carried out. Instead,
patients have to rely on broad statistics that many feel may not
apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   Men with prostate cancer find themselves in a position similar
to the situation women with breast cancer faced a few years ago.
Decisions eased only when crucial studies were completed to show
that lumpectomy plus adjuvant drugs and radiation was an effective
alternative to radical mastectomy for early breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   2 POSSIBLE TREATMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is considering two main treatments: surgery to remove
the prostate or radiation therapy. Until last Friday, Giuliani had
to speculate about which therapy would get him back on the
senatorial campaign trail fastest and with fewest complications.
</P>
<P>
   Many men can do some routine desk work a few days after prostate
surgery. But it takes at least three weeks before they can travel,
and then many must deal with urinary incontinence and frequent
diaper changes. Adding to the complexity is that after surgeons
remove a prostate, pathologists look at it through a microscope for
malignant cells. If they find the cancer has spread, radiation
therapy may also be needed.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of radiation for prostate cancer, and
neither would seriously interfere with Giuliani's work as mayor.
Yet each would have posed problems for campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   In one form of radiation, doctors use needles for permanently
implanting radioactive ``seeds'' into the prostate. Radiation wears
off after several months. Because such patients emit tiny amounts
of radiation, they are warned to avoid continued close contact with
pregnant women and children. That is not a major problem for most
people. The amount of radiation in a fleeting exposure can be less
than the amount of radiation in the environment. Nevertheless, if
blown out of proportion, it could become a liability for a
hand-shaking, baby-kissing politician in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The second form is external radiation. For prostate cancer, it
is usually given five days a week for eight weeks. During that
time, a patient can work regular hours. But the patient is confined
to the geographic area in which he is being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Giuliani weighed such factors heavily as a
prospective senatorial candidate.

 &HT;    Outlook gives birth to new lists of stocks to own
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the bull market has turned decidedly bearish, business
and personal finance magazines are offering advice on which stocks
to buy in a down market.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (June), The Wall Street Journal's personal finance
magazine, recommends ``the magnificent seven,'' a group of ``small,
fast-growing companies that, thanks to this spring's market
meltdown, happen to be selling at big discounts.''
</P>
<P>
   They are Allaire (ticker symbol ALLR), Global Industries (GLBL),
Globix (GBIX), Inhale Therapeutic (INHL), Medicis Pharmaceutical
(MRX), Pinnacle Systems (PCLE) and Zoran (ZRAN).
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's Personal Finance (June) says the market's spring
gyrations proved once again the value of diversification. The
magazine lists 35 stocks in three portfolios designed to suit an
investor's personal style: aggressive (mostly small, fast-growing
tech companies); patient (established blue chip stocks); or
conservative (utilities and other high-yielding stocks).
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg Personal Finance (June) recommends that investors look
to ``business to business'' stocks, usually referred to simply as
B2B. These are companies with names like i2 Technologies (ITWO), a
company that designs software for inventory control. Others buy and
sell raw materials, parts, goods and services using the worldwide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   `Hot growth companies'
</P>
<P>
   Three metro Atlanta companies are on the latest Business Week
(May 29) list of 100 ``hot growth companies.''
</P>
<P>
   They are LHS Group, number 46, an Atlanta company that supplies
support software to phone companies, and which is being acquired;
Theragenics, number 73, a Buford company that makes radioactive
seeds used to treat prostate cancer; and Optio Software, number 78,
an Alpharetta company whose software customizes information for
delivery by fax, printer or e-mail. The No. 1 company is Direct
Focus, a Vancouver direct marketing retailer of sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Business Week said this year's diverse list of small businesses
proves ``you don't have to be a dot-com to be a dynamo.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Red Herring (June), which targets the technology
market, is out with its annual list of ``the 100 most important
companies in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service, the only Georgia company on this list,
was cited because of the company's huge investment in technology.
Unlike most other lists, Red Herring doesn't rank the companies but
lists them in alphabetical order based on criteria ``borrowed from
venture capitalists and investment bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (May 29) alerts business firms to the ``invasion of the
body snatchers,'' as headhunters and executive search firms are
called these days. If you're the boss, the body snatchers want your
best workers ``and they'll do anything to get what they're after.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Business Review (May/June) sees a disturbing trend in
corporate America: CEO churning. ``Top executives are rapidly
coming and going, keeping their jobs for shorter periods of time.
The reason? Most boards simply don't know what leadership means,
and thus they pick the wrong people to run companies,'' the
magazine says.

 &HT;    COURT, STRIKING SCHEDULE LIMITS, SAYS PARENTS CAN BLOCK SEXY TV
 &HT;    460&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's up to parents to block sexually explicit cable
TV programming from their homes, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had restricted the hours of such programming to
late-night hours in order to protect children from ``signal
bleed,'' in which non-subscribers can see and hear snippets from a
supposedly scrambled X-rated channel.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that the law was an
unconstitutional infringement of free speech. Parents can keep such
programming out of their homes simply by calling their cable
companies, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, targeted blocking is less restrictive than
banning, and the government cannot ban speech if targeted blocking
is a feasible and effective means of furthering its compelling
interests,'' Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, cable operators are required to comply to a
customer's request to completely block _ rather than just scramble
_ a signal. New televisions are also equipped with ``V-chips'' so
parents can eliminate channels or programs they find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the decision means that more parents will
rely on these other remedies, predicted Eliot Mincberg, a legal
analyst for People for the American Way, a civil liberties advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are doing it already,'' said Dave Beckwith, a
spokesman for the National Cable Television Association. ``This
trap blocks out the signal entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the cable company sends an installer to the
subscriber's house to put in the blocking device. Sometimes it can
be done through a phone call to the central office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the system,'' said Beckwith. In either case, the
service is free to the subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said there would be some financial impact on cable
companies if large numbers of subscribers requested channel
blocking, since it costs more to block a signal than scramble one.
</P>
<P>
   Janet LaRue, an attorney for the Family Research Council, said
she is urging families to quickly call their cable companies for a
blocking device.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply disappointed with this decision, which makes
protection of children take a back seat to the profits of cable
pornographers,'' she said. ``It's going to get worse. They let that
signal bleed for no other reason than to attract new customers.
It's free advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision upholds a lower court ruling, so
cable subscribers will see no difference in their service. The law
under question, part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, has
been largely thwarted by legal challenges since its enactment. It
was enforced only from May 1997 to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, said in a statement, ``In reviewing today's Supreme
Court decision, parents should remember that current law
specifically provides that cable customers can contact their local
cable companies and request that channels they find objectionable
be blocked from their homes at no cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The V-chip also gives ``parents the ability to block television
programming that is not fit for their kids to watch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the court implied that this is an action better left to
parents than to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no response that voluntary blocking requires a consumer
to take action, or may be inconvenient, or may not go perfectly
every time,'' wrote Kennedy. ``A court should not presume parents,
given full information, will fail to act.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in his dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer
said Congress was right to act because the availability of
voluntary blocking devices has failed to adequately protect
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``By finding 'adequate alternatives' where there are none, the
court reduces Congress' protective power to the vanishing point,''
Breyer wrote. ``This is not what the First Amendment demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was joined in the majority by Justices John Paul
Stevens, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor
and Antonin Scalia sided with Breyer in the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the court was so evenly split, and with moderates and
conservatives on both sides, there will few political
ramifications, Mincberg predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives can't say, 'look what those liberal justices
have done,' and liberals can't say, 'look what those conservative
justices have done, ' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is U.S. v. Playboy Entertainment Group.

   SCOTUS-CABLE-TV (Washington) _ Declaring for the first time that
programming on cable television is entitled to the highest level of
First Amendment protection, the Supreme Court on Monday struck down
a federal law that required many cable systems to limit sexually
explicit channels to the late-night hours. The vote was 5-4, with
an unusual lineup of justices that reflected differing views both
on the extent of the problem the 1996 law was passed to address _
the unwanted ``bleed'' of signals from cable channels that a
household had not ordered _ and on the degree of constitutional
``flexibility'' the government should receive in its effort to
shield children from exposure to graphic sexual images. By Linda
Greenhouse.

<P>
   ISRAEL-LEBANON (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
long-planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon seemed to be suddenly
accelerating out of control Monday, with Hezbollah guerrillas
driving Israeli-allied militias out of border command posts and
northern Israeli residents fleeing south in fear of Hezbollah
rocket attacks. Israeli warplanes repeatedly bombed Hezbollah
followers moving into the border zone, killing five civilians and
wounding another 25, according to reports from Lebanon. Fearing
Hezbollah reprisals, the Israeli army ordered frontier residents
into bomb shelters, but hundreds chose instead to leave and drive
far out of Katyusha rocket range. By William A. Orme Jr.

   CHINA-TRADE-ADS (Washington) _ With just two days to go before
Congress decides whether to upgrade economic ties with China, both

expensive political campaigns in years to recruit three dozen
undecided lawmakers who hold the key to victory or defeat. By
Joseph Kahn.

   CALIF-DAVIS-JUSTICE (Sacramento, Calif.) _ In the 1998 campaign,
Gov. Gray Davis said he would be tougher on crime than his
Republican opponent. No one took that remark literally. But these
days, Democratic lawmakers say it sometimes seems as though Davis
was only slightly exaggerating. Halfway into his second year in
office, the governor is establishing himself as more of a
tight-fisted conservative on criminal justice issues than his
Republican predecessors, or any other elected official in
California _ if not the nation. The governor has essentially
removed the incentive that makes inmates model prisoners by
refusing any recommendation the parole board has made to grant a
release. He has announced that any judge he appoints should reflect
his sentiments ``or resign.'' He has blocked efforts to reform the
state's notorious ``three strikes'' law, which can put someone in
prison for life for stealing a bicycle if it is their third felony
conviction. And he has vetoed a modest bill that would grant the
press greater access to inmates in the state's notoriously
closed-door prison system, which has been rocked in recent years by
corruption scandals. By Evelyn Nieves. (1800 words)

 &HT;    COURT, STRIKING SCHEDULE LIMITS, SAYS PARENTS CAN BLOCK SEXY TV
 &HT;    460&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's up to parents to block sexually explicit cable
TV programming from their homes, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had restricted the hours of such programming to
late-night hours in order to protect children from ``signal
bleed,'' in which non-subscribers can see and hear snippets from a
supposedly scrambled X-rated channel.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that the law was an
unconstitutional infringement of free speech. Parents can keep such
programming out of their homes simply by calling their cable
companies, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, targeted blocking is less restrictive than
banning, and the government cannot ban speech if targeted blocking
is a feasible and effective means of furthering its compelling
interests,'' Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, cable operators are required to comply to a
customer's request to completely block _ rather than just scramble
_ a signal. New televisions are also equipped with ``V-chips'' so
parents can eliminate channels or programs they find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the decision means that more parents will
rely on these other remedies, predicted Eliot Mincberg, a legal
analyst for People for the American Way, a civil liberties advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are doing it already,'' said Dave Beckwith, a
spokesman for the National Cable Television Association. ``This
trap blocks out the signal entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the cable company sends an installer to the
subscriber's house to put in the blocking device. Sometimes it can
be done through a phone call to the central office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the system,'' said Beckwith. In either case, the
service is free to the subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said there would be some financial impact on cable
companies if large numbers of subscribers requested channel
blocking, since it costs more to block a signal than scramble one.
</P>
<P>
   Janet LaRue, an attorney for the Family Research Council, said
she is urging families to quickly call their cable companies for a
blocking device.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply disappointed with this decision, which makes
protection of children take a back seat to the profits of cable
pornographers,'' she said. ``It's going to get worse. They let that
signal bleed for no other reason than to attract new customers.
It's free advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision upholds a lower court ruling, so
cable subscribers will see no difference in their service. The law
under question, part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, has
been largely thwarted by legal challenges since its enactment. It
was enforced only from May 1997 to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, said in a statement, ``In reviewing today's Supreme
Court decision, parents should remember that current law
specifically provides that cable customers can contact their local
cable companies and request that channels they find objectionable
be blocked from their homes at no cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The V-chip also gives ``parents the ability to block television
programming that is not fit for their kids to watch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the court implied that this is an action better left to
parents than to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no response that voluntary blocking requires a consumer
to take action, or may be inconvenient, or may not go perfectly
every time,'' wrote Kennedy. ``A court should not presume parents,
given full information, will fail to act.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in his dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer
said Congress was right to act because the availability of
voluntary blocking devices has failed to adequately protect
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``By finding 'adequate alternatives' where there are none, the
court reduces Congress' protective power to the vanishing point,''
Breyer wrote. ``This is not what the First Amendment demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was joined in the majority by Justices John Paul
Stevens, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor
and Antonin Scalia sided with Breyer in the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the court was so evenly split, and with moderates and
conservatives on both sides, there will few political
ramifications, Mincberg predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives can't say, 'look what those liberal justices
have done,' and liberals can't say, 'look what those conservative
justices have done, ' `` he said.
</P>

AN MTV PRANKSTER GETS (MOSTLY) SERIOUS ABOUT HIS CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of the review. Time, channel are

 By CARYN JAMES  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is so different from ``E.R.'' In fact, though ``The Tom
Green Cancer Special'' takes place largely in a hospital, following
its star as he is treated for testicular cancer, this
stomach-churning, affecting, original special is different from
anything that has ever been on television.
</P>
<P>
   The cult star of his MTV series, in which his camera captures
reactions to practical jokes that delight 15-year-olds, Green is
just beginning to emerge as a mainstream personality. Last week on
``The Tonight Show'' he put a squirming white mouse in his mouth,
re-enacting a scene from his current movie, ``Road Trip,'' and
horrifying Judge Judy, sitting next to him on the couch. With a
wide-eyed gaze and a goatee, he looks both innocent and devilish, a
style that perfectly expresses his personality.
</P>
<P>
   However adolescent his humor, though, it can be serious and
revealing as it shatters cultural assumptions. He turned a corner
with his recent special in which he took Monica Lewinsky to Canada,
where he grew up, ostensibly to buy fabric for her line of
handbags. He took her to dinner with his parents, the beleaguered
victims of so many of his pranks. The tone was poignant simply
because he was nice to her, neither fawning nor rude. (Think of how
different that attitude is.) Gradually, deeper resonances emerged:
Of course he was making fun of her, but they were both making more
fun of the people who came out to gawk at her; and it was a bit sad
to see how willing she was to go along.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Cancer Special'' is another breakthrough. It deserves its
viewer's warning; the show is excruciating to sit though because it
includes a long, unflinching look at the operation (no one except a
surgeon should ever get that close to human intestines) and a visit
to the pathology lab where we see the mashed-up testicle that had
been removed in a previous operation. Yet beyond its shock value,
the show is also a bizarre television landmark, willfully erasing
all boundaries between narcissism and art, black humor and
gross-out comedy, private and public lives, good taste and bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to live this secret life with one testicle,'' he
says here, explaining his reaction after the cancerous testicle was
removed. When he needed a second operation to remove and test lymph
nodes in his abdomen, he decided to take the cameras along. His
special is the video generation's equivalent of the confessional
memoir, a kind of public therapy in which self-revelation becomes a
survival strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Green is so known for pranks that the immediate reaction to the
news he had cancer was that he must be joking. The special is no
joke. A large part was filmed at the University of Southern
California, where he was treated. The chairman of the urology
department explains that while testicular cancer accounts for only
1 percent to 2 percent of male cancers, it is the most common form
among 15- to 35-year-old men. (Green is 28.)
</P>
<P>
   Such informative moments are not the point, though. The special
is shaped by nervous laughter. Green recruits those closest to him
and they gamely try to adopt his defensive, mocking attitude. He
goes to dinner with his parents, his girlfriend Drew Barrymore and
his two regular sidekicks from his show, Glenn Humplick and Phil
Giroux. He gives the waitress an elaborate, uncomfortable
explanation of his disease, and she replies, ``You want to see a
wine list?''
</P>
<P>
   This particular kind of cancer gives him plenty of opportunities
for jokes that would never make it on network television. Yet there
are also moments that seem unintentionally touching. Being fitted
for what he calls his burial suit (actually the suit he wore to the
Oscars), he asks for ``a last picture of me alive with my mother,
in a nice suit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom, you're going to live,'' his mother says, sweetly and as
cheerfully as she can, kissing him on the cheek. ``What did the
doctor tell you today? He said, `Tom, you're going to be fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   He looks close to tears, though he recovers by saying, ``You're
wrinkling my suit, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital he asks the doctor, ``Is it possible I'm going
to wake up screaming?''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the operation is the price viewers pay for the rest of
the special. Even Green says, with his deadpan delivery, ``I was
kind of hoping it would have been funnier inside my body.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, there are some genuinely funny moments, including a
singalong ditty about the value of self-examination, complete with
lyrics on screen and a bouncing testicle over the words. Appearing
to a cheering crowd at the University of Florida, he has turned his
terrifying experience into comedy, helped by the fact that the
doctors found no trace of cancer during the second operation.
Still, he ends the special by saying, ``Hopefully, my cancer won't
come back and I won't die.'' Performers are rarely so chilling,
blunt or honest.
</P>
<P>
   To flip back and forth between the taboo-shattering Tom Green
and the staid ``Frontline'' would be to invite an extreme case of
cultural whiplash. Despite its eye-glazing title, though, ``The
Battle Over School Choice'' turns out to be a smooth, humanizing
primer on an issue that is both central to the presidential
campaign and deadly dull in the abstract. The main subject is
vouchers, with which the government pays for students to attend
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on Cleveland, the evenhanded special presents voucher
students whose futures have been salvaged by the opportunity, as
well as others who attended a school whose founders absconded with
the government's money. There are interviews with Vice President Al
Gore, who opposes vouchers, and Gov. George W. Bush, who supports
them, but the documentary makes the point that there is less
difference between the candidates' views than their ads contend.
(And really, who is against higher standards and better education?)
</P>
<P>
   The failure of this otherwise lucid, engaging documentary is in
its modest ambition: It offers only glancing references to a
profound, underlying issue it is easier to ignore: how much the
battle over school choice is really about race and class.  &QL;

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the northeastern corner of Syria, near the Iraqi border and
within sight of southern Turkey's Taurus Mountains, archaeologists
have begun excavations of an ancient settlement that lay on a major
trade route from Nineveh to Aleppo. The ruins from more than 5,500
years ago are telling them that previous ideas about the spread of
early civilization were more than likely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The first trenches cut into the large 500-acre site, Tell
Hamoukar, have yielded strong evidence that centrally administered
complex societies in northern regions of the Middle East apparently
arose simultaneously but independently of the more celebrated
city-states of southern Mesopotamia, in what is now southern Iraq.
In the conventional view, civilization was thought to begin solely
in the south and then move north through trade and colonization.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement of the new finds, Dr. McGuire Gibson, an
archaeologist at the Oriental Institute of the University of
Chicago, said, ``We need to reconsider our ideas about the
beginnings of civilization, pushing the time further back.''
</P>
<P>
   Other archaeologists familiar with the research agreed in
interviews last week that the Tell Hamoukar excavations confirmed
and should elaborate on a consensus that has emerged among scholars
in the last decade about the role of northern settlements in Syria
and Iraq and in southeastern Turkey in the development of
civilization. These settlements exhibited many of the attributes of
civilization _ monumental architecture, division of labor, social
stratification _ apparently before they had any significant contact
with people in the lower valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important excavation,'' said Dr. Gil J. Stein, an
archaeologist at Northwestern University. ``It fits in really
nicely with a picture that's been emerging, based on several other
excavation sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Dr. Guillermo Algaze, an archaeologist at the University of
California at San Diego, who had argued for a south-to-north
transplantation of early civilization, said that he now generally
agreed with the new interpretation. ``I've been eating a lot of
crow lately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations at Tell Hamoukar were started last summer by a joint
expedition of the Oriental Institute and the Syrian Directorate
General of Antiquities. Work will resume next month and will
probably continue for many years. The site promises an abundance of
artifacts, archaeologists said, not only because of its large size
but also because most of the material seems to be close to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Digging into the oldest layer of ruins uncovered so far,
archaeologists found traces of people living in villages at the
site as early as 4000 B.C. Within 300 years, the settlement had
grown into a prosperous town of at least 32 acres with ample
evidence of a well-organized society of the kind associated with
the early stages of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Gibson said, the town appeared to be enclosed by
a defensive wall 10 feet high and 13 feet wide. Such walls came
with civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the walls the archaeologists dug up the remains of fine
pottery and several large ovens, shaped like igloos, evidence of
food preparation on an institutional scale. The same areas held
pieces of large cooking pots and animal bones and traces of wheat,
barley and oats for what must have been a bakery and also probably
a brewery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparing bread and food on such a scale is evidence of a
society in which somebody is organizing people and resources,''
Gibson said. ``You are building up a hierarchy, a social structure
that's a mark of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most telling evidence for an organized, stratified
society, archaeologists said, were the seals the people probably
used to mark containers of food and other goods. Some of the seals
are small, with only simple incisions or cross-hatching. Others are
larger, presumably for higher officials to stamp more valuable
goods. One of these stamping seals was in the form of a leopard
with 13 spots, and others were in the shape of deer, bears and
ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would propose that the larger, more elaborate seals with
figurative scenes were held only by the few people who had greater
authority, while the smaller, simply incised seals were used by
many more people with less authority,'' Gibson said. ``The
difference would be something like the signature of the regional
director of customs of Chicago compared to the rubber stamps that
say only `U.S. Customs.'''
</P>
<P>
   In southern Mesopotamia at this time, an expanding population
and increased food production from irrigation were changing the
social landscape even more drastically. Economies were being run by
increasingly centralized leadership. Agricultural villages grew
into urban centers, some of which were in time ruled by local
kings. This became known to scholars as the Uruk period, after one
of the more prominent of these southern city-states, more than 400
miles south of Tell Hamoukar, and it was the period that
established Mesopotamia as ``the cradle of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago archaeologists said they had found no pottery or
other evidence of Uruk influences on the Tell Hamoukar settlement
in the 3700-3500 B.C. period. Some Uruk-type pottery shows up
around 3200, by which time there was perhaps a substantial southern
Mesopotamian presence at the site.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other excavations at Tell Brak, also in northeast Syria, and
Hacinebi and Arslantepe, in southeast Turkey, have also revealed
that complex societies had developed before any significant contact
with the Uruk people, Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   So when southern Mesopotamians did expand into the north in the
middle to late fourth millennium, Stein concluded, they ``came into
contact with northern polities that were already quite advanced
chiefdoms, even though they were not as large in scale as the
urbanized states of the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he now agrees with this view, Algaze cautioned that it
would be a mistake to allow ``the pendulum of thinking to swing too
far in the other direction'' and conclude that the northern
societies were comparable in their scale of development with those
in the south. Since the first writing presumably developed to
handle record-keeping for a centralized economy, he said, the fact
that writing originated in Sumer, in southern Mesopotamia,
indicated a more advanced society there.
</P>
<P>
   In a publication of the Oriental Institute, Gibson noted that a
few scholars were even suggesting that perhaps civilization began
not in southern Mesopotamia, but in the north, and that it
gradually made its way south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we start revising our textbooks, however, we should
remember that there was an even earlier contact with people who had
come from southern Mesopotamia,'' he wrote, referring to a southern
culture in the Ubaid period, extending from 5500 to about 4000 BC
Some Ubaid pottery and other artifacts have been found scattered
throughout the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Zettler, a University of Pennsylvania archaeologist
with extensive experience in Syria, said: ``I'm convinced that our
real focus now should not be on the Uruk period, but the Ubaid.
It's not a terribly well-known period.''
</P>
<P>
   For one reason, he said, remains from the Ubaid period are hard
to find in southern Mesopotamia. They are presumably buried deep
beneath Uruk sites or covered by river silt. Archaeologists may
have more luck looking for an earlier transition to complex
societies at sites in the north, perhaps including Tell Hamoukar.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson would make no promises. ``It's a very big site and it's
going to take a lot of digging,'' he said.

3-D GAMING NOW RULE, NOT EXCEPTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, is
always a treat to attend. Each year, the vision of the future of
entertainment becomes just a bit clearer.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 gathering, held this month at the Los Angeles
Convention Center, two things became apparent. First, 3-D
technologies are now the rule in computer and video gaming, rather
than the exception. And the hard-core game audience is no longer
the prime market for developers, who are now going after the
mainstream, casual player.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in and the proliferation of 3-D graphics hardware have
made it possible for those who write game programs to craft
elaborate, realistic worlds even for the simplest of games. Nearly
every PC sold in the past two years has a graphics card powerful
enough to run most of the games seen at E3 this year; and many of
those sold in the past three years can also handle them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most of the games being released for personal
computers have some kind of multiplayer or Internet component.
These are usually free _ you don't have to be a member of a service
to find opponents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, remember Frogger, the classic 1980s 2-D video game
in which you guided a frog across busy highways and swift-running
rivers? Hasbro released an updated version a while back, and soon
will offer Frogger 2, which fans of the original will barely
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   In Frogger 2, your little green friend is rendered in three
dimensions and has graduated beyond merely crossing freeways. He
now traverses jungle temples and platforms in space, dodging odd
creatures and tiles that drop from beneath his webbed feet. The
game, due to be delivered later this year, also lets players
compete over a network.
</P>
<P>
   This is a game for a mass audience, but relies on fairly
advanced graphics technology. Hasbro wouldn't be able to design the
game this way if it were not for the pervasiveness of 3-D graphics
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: LucasArts' Monkey Island series of
tongue-in-cheek adventure games have traditionally been in 2-D. But
the next title, Escape from Monkey Island, moves to a 3-D style
that's in keeping with the cartoonish look of past games. This
game, due out in the fall, continues the adventures of
``swashbungling'' hero Guybrush Threepwood as he battles his
longtime nemesis, the villainous pirate, LeChuck.
</P>
<P>
   Games that have traditionally been created in 3-D _ such as
action, strategy and first-person shooters _ looked even better
this year. The realism in some cases was breathtaking, although
these were shown on state-of-the-art graphics cards that are just
now becoming available. They may or may not look as good on your
system when you bring the games home from the store.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive first-person games I saw use id Software's
Quake III engine. That engine, which is at the core of id's own
Quake III Arena death-match game, is being used in three
high-profile games _ Electronic Arts' The World is Not Enough,
based on the James Bond film of the same name; Activision's Star
Trek Voyager: Elite Force, the first shooter to bear the Star Trek
name; and Gray Matter's Return to Castle Wolfenstein, a remake of
the game considered the original first-person shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The capabilities of the Quake III engine make all three titles
incredibly realistic. The Borgs you must battle in the Star Trek
game are creepily rendered _ you can see their ruined faces and the
detailed cyber-components of their exoskeletons. The exotic
settings in the James Bond title are part of an environment that
can be affected by what you do. Shooting at the wrong place on a
balcony can send it crashing down upon you, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the most realistic of these three games is Return to Castle
Wolfenstein, which updates the original Wolfenstein 3D _ the
precursor to Doom and the original Quake _ in dramatic fashion.
Developers at Gray Matter photographed walls and floors in Europe
to create realistic textures for the Nazi stronghold dubbed Castle
Wolfenstein. The Quake III engine has been tweaked for even more
realism _ you can see the stubble on the chins of your opponents,
and cobwebs waft gently in midair. It is easily the most convincing
3-D environment I've seen yet in any game.
</P>
<P>
   Console games are also increasingly rendered in 3-D, and new
hardware is being developed with that in mind. Sony's Playstation
2, available now in Japan and coming to the United States in
October, is excellent at this. But it pales in comparison to what
will be offered by the latest player in this market: Microsoft's
X-Box.
</P>
<P>
   In closed-room demos for the press, Microsoft showed off the
X-box running at about one-tenth of its power capabilities. Even at
that low level, it was impressive. The detail shown on flowers in
an onscreen garden was rich _ I felt I could reach out and feel the
petals. The Microsoft representative running the demo claimed that
rendering one large flower in the garden used all the power that is
found in Playstation 2, indicating that the X-Box should run rings
around the Sony product.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the overheated atmosphere of E3, it's important to
take all such comments with large grains of salt. But visually, the
X-Box demo beat out anything I saw running on the many Playstation
2 systems at E3. If Microsoft can deliver this quality when it
ships the X-Box sometime next year, the 800-pound gorilla of the PC
world will have made a formidable mark in the console universe.

&HT;     SUPREME COURT ENTERS FRAY OVER SMOG RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wading into one of the biggest environmental cases
in years, the Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether the
federal government can drastically cut smog and soot levels over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will review a lower court's decision to block the
Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing regulations it
adopted in 1997 to cut air pollution by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Patton, the senior attorney at Environmental Defense, a
Washington-based lobbying group, said the court's decision _
expected sometime next year _ would end one of the most
controversial clean air cases in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lower court decision turned back EPA's clean air health
standards by disregarding more than 30 years of national clean air
policy,'' Patton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
one of several business groups that sued the EPA over the rules,
said only Congress has the right to impose such ``wide-reaching''
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and for all, the Supreme Court can put an end to EPA's
unconstitutional attempt to extend their regulatory power and
ignore the will of Congress,'' said Donohue, whose Washington-based
federation represents more than three million businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the clean air rules in 1997, EPA Administrator
Carol Browner said the stricter standards would ``provide new
health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million
children.''
</P>
<P>
   If put into effect, the EPA's rules would have an immediate
economic impact in places _ mostly in the Midwest _ where old power
plants still burn coal. At the same time, Eastern states _ such as
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut _ that have complained for
years about drifting pollution from the Midwest could see
improvement in air quality after several years.
</P>
<P>
   The revised air standards limited the allowable level of ozone,
a component of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of the 0.12
parts per million under the old requirement. And states for the
first time were required to regulate microscopic particulates, or
soot, from power plants, cars and other sources down to 2.5 microns
_ 28 times smaller than the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimated that as many as 15,000 lives would be saved
annually by the cleaner air and that hundreds of thousands of cases
of asthma and respiratory ailments would be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   But the anti-pollution rules were fiercely opposed by a broad
coalition of businesses, from auto and steel manufacturers to
truckers and power plant operators. These groups said it would cost
$46 billion a year to comply with the new standards, and they
questioned whether the improvement in air would have much effect on
health.
</P>
<P>
   After lobbying efforts with the Clinton administration failed,
the business groups turned to the courts to block the standards. In
1998, a coalition of industry groups and three states _ Michigan,
Ohio and West Virginia _ sued the EPA in the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a three-judge panel in that court ruled 2-1 that the
agency overstepped its authority. The appeals court panel said the
EPA had interpreted the 1990 Clean Air Act ``so loosely'' that it
unlawfully usurped Congress' legislative power. In October, the
full appeals court voted 6-5 against reviewing the decision,
leaving the ruling intact.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to issue air quality
standards to protect human health. The law says the agency may set
pollution limits that ``accurately reflect the latest scientific
knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all
identifiable effects on public health or welfare which may be
expected from the presence of a pollutant.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Clinton administration asked the Supreme Court
to take up the case. Solicitor General Seth Waxman called the lower
court ruling ``a radical departure from settled law'' and said that
loss of the clean air standards ``unnecessarily prolongs the
exposure of millions of Americans to unhealthy pollutant levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's last major environmental case was in 1997 when it
unanimously interpreted the Endangered Species Act to permit
lawsuits not only by people who think the government is doing too
little to protect threatened species, but also by those who think
that federal regulations have gone too far. The decision opened the
door to suits against regulators by businesses and property owners.

 &HT;    LAWS NEEDED TO PROTECT ONLINE PRIVACY, FTC SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So many Internet merchants are violating the
privacy of consumers that Congress must pass legislation to stop
the abuses, the Federal Trade Commission said Monday in a report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the federal agency has monitoring privacy and
hoping businesses would curb themselves, but ``progress in
self-regulation has been disappointing,'' FTC Chairman Robert
Pitofsky said in a statement submitted with the report.
</P>
<P>
   Without regulations, companies are ``unlikely to provide online
consumers with the level of protection they seek and deserve,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said that while nearly 90 percent of popular Web sites
offer some type of privacy disclosure, safeguards are weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we probe beneath the surface and assess compliance with
(recommended guidelines), a less-than-encouraging picture
emerges,'' he said. ``Only one in five of the busiest commercial
Web sites provides basic privacy protections.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's stinging report will be presented to the Senate
Commerce Committee on Thursday. But many Republican leaders believe
regulation would be premature in the young world of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quickest way to kill the Internet is to regulate it to
death,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. W.J. ``Billy''
Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee on trade
and consumer protection. In general, GOP leaders ``believe we need
to move cautiously'' on legislation, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of Democrats, led by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Monday announced
they would introduce comprehensive privacy legislation to keep
companies from profiting from the sale of personal data gleaned
from unwitting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ensuring privacy is good business, and establishing a federal
standard for these protections will allow us to address consumers'
concerns before they pass up the growing Internet marketplace
altogether,'' Hollings said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such legislation could get traction in Congress this
year appears doubtful. Lawmakers already have a full plate of
technology-related legislation awaiting action. Moreover, Congress
plans a long summer recess during the political party conventions.
Then, with the fall elections coming up, lawmakers hope to end this
Congress by Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying a consumer protection bill for another year would
please electronic commerce companies, which have been lobbying
against regulations since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, who previously had supported self-regulation, now
wants the power to penalize companies that violate privacy
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., a New
Jersey-based group that promotes privacy legislation, said
legislative action is ``long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a market failure,'' he said. ``The idea that the free
market will cure all privacy problems is no more plausible than the
idea that the market will cure all environmental problems.'' Only
the force of law can enforce privacy protections, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But industry trade groups reacted negatively to the FTC report.
``We believe the recommendations are overbroad, premature,
impractical and unnecessary,'' said the Online Privacy Alliance, a
trade group representing companies engage in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Hollings proposal, companies operating on the Internet
would have to provide consumers with:
</P>
<P>
   _ Notice. Companies must clearly indicate how they collect
personal information and how they intend to use it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consent. They must get the consumer's consent before
collecting or using consumers' personally identifiable information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Access. They must provide consumers with access to personal
information collected about them, and offer the opportunity to
correct, deny or supplement that information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Security. They must establish procedures to protect the
security and confidentiality of the information.

 &HT;    New treatment, new hope
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   XENIA, Ohio _ The worst moment in Doug Yaus' ordeal might have
been the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer two years ago. As he sat on
the doctor's examining table, the words made him light-headed. He
had done enough research by then. ``You're history,'' was what he
heard, although the doctor didn't say quite that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That and the exploratory surgery,'' the 44-year-old Xenia man
says now. ``Those were scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The exploratory surgery could have ended his chance for a
life-saving liver transplant. It turned out that cancer in the bile
duct, the kind he really had, didn't offer much better prospects
than cancer in the pancreas. But Yaus beat those long odds by
qualifying for a clinical trial that might cure it. The catch was,
if so much as one tiny tumor migrated from his liver, Yaus was out
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   So after getting zapped with radiation for about two weeks,
after nearly another week of radiation through a tube that snaked
down his throat all the way to his liver, after some low-dose
chemotherapy and 2 1/2 months of thinking he might actually be the
one in 100 to beat this disease, it would all come down to what the
surgeon found inside Yaus' abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought it was hard to wait for an exam grade or the bid
on the sale of your house? ``That was intense,'' Yaus says. ``You
know you might find out that not too far down the road, you're
going to meet your maker.''
</P>
<P>
   For 42 percent of the patients in the Mayo Clinic trial, the
hope ended there. The cancer went beyond their livers and they went
off the transplant list. But Yaus and 10 others in the experimental
protocol received transplants and they're all alive today. It has
been only a year for Yaus, but the average survival span is 44
months.
</P>
<P>
   Where most cancer treatments attack the tumor after surgery, Dr.
Gregory Gores decided to zap the bile-duct tumors before surgery.
It appears to work ``for a highly selected group of patients'' with
early-stage cancer, says Gores, who published his research in this
month's issue of the Liver Transplantation journal. ``Before this
point, no treatment options were available for this group of
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the misdiagnosis of pancreatic cancer was the
first step Yaus took toward medical history. He wasn't even in any
pain when he first went to his doctor. The whites of his eyes were
kind of yellow, his urine looked more like coffee and some
heartburn was wrecking his appetite, but he was still working
eight-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt well enough to where you can shrug it off,'' he says.
The one thing that did bother him was the result he kept getting on
his ``Family Doctor'' software, a computer program that matched
symptoms with suggested diagnoses. Yaus kept varying the symptoms a
little, ``just in case I was being a hypochondriac,'' but the
answer on his computer stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always came up, `See your doctor immediately,''' he says.
``You want to know the answers, but you're afraid of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   His family doctor took blood tests and sent him to a liver
specialist, who took a variety of scans and samples and saw his
pancreas was enlarged. That typically happens when a tumor clogging
the bile duct causes bile to back up like an overflowing sink, but
all Yaus knew at the time was a doctor with degrees on his wall was
calling it pancreatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Right away he called Dr. Ken Smithson, a Dallas
gastroenterologist who was married to Yaus' cousin. Smithson told
him how to hook up with Baylor University in Texas or the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn. By the end of the day, a Wednesday, he
had an appointment at Mayo for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bile duct is a small tube connecting the liver to the small
intestine, enabling bile produced in the liver to facilitate
digestion in the intestine. It's about the width of a disposable
pen, so it doesn't take a very big tumor to block the duct and back
the bile up into the bloodstream. But by the time that excess bile
starts causing jaundiced skin, it's almost always impossible to
remove the cancer without ruining the liver and requiring a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, even though you think you have removed all the
cancer, you can't get all the microscopic tumors,'' Gores says. The
cancer there is so aggressive that it can overrun the new liver or
other organs within weeks of a transplant. Because there aren't
enough donor livers for the people who could live a long time with
a new one, almost no one with bile-duct cancer is eligible for a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   So the average person with bile-duct cancer lives for 13 months
after diagnosis, Gores says. It's not a common cancer, but it kills
nearly all of the 2,000 to 5,000 Americans it strikes each year.
Usually it's the byproduct of another liver disease, as it was for
pro football Hall of Famer Walter Payton, one of Gores' patients,
who died last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make transplants feasible and extend that lifespan,
someone had to find a way to keep the cancer from returning.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer therapy usually takes place after surgery to remove the
cancer, says Gores, because, ``Most of the time, the surgeons can't
wait to do anything before surgery.'' That wasn't working for
bile-duct cancer because the cancer returned so quickly. By the
time a transplant patient recovered enough to withstand harsh
treatment, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we started thinking, `What's the most rational thing we can
do before surgery?''' Gores says. ``For this particular tumor, it's
radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaus was diagnosed in the first week of June 1998. Twice a day
for 15 days he had radiation beams fired at his tumor, and then
came the agony of having a wire-sized tube fished through his nose
and throat and stomach and intestine until it reached his bile
duct. For three days on each lobe of the bile duct, the tumor was
pelted with radioactive beads the size of a pencil lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still amazes me today that they can do that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weeks of radiation, accompanied by low doses of
chemotherapy, nobody mentioned the fateful exploratory surgery to
come. Yaus had beaten big odds just to get this far. From 1993
through 1998, only 19 of the 918 Mayo patients with bile-duct
cancer were enrolled in the clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was that August. Dr. Charles Rosen, the surgeon,
told Yaus, ``We could not see the tumor at all.'' It had been the
size of a golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't coherent enough to jump up and down and celebrate,''
Yaus says. ``But I knew what he was saying. I felt like I'd made
that final hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took nine months to cross the finish line, weakened by
his damaged liver until he reached the top of the transplant
waiting list. ``You realize how important your family is in times
like those when you can't even get around by yourself,'' Yaus says
of his wife, Evelyn, and parents, Jack and Bonnie. When he spent
the last three months waiting at Mayo, someone was there nearly
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anxiety when that phone rings at 6 in the
morning and they say, `We've got a liver for you,''' he says. The
time had come. ``I thought, `Let's get it on.'''
</P>
<P>
   He noticed a difference right away. He didn't feel sickly when
he woke up. He wasn't so worn out. ``I just felt normal.'' He was
back working part time at Clarklift of Ohio, the Dayton forklift
manufacturer, three months after the transplant on May 14, 1999.
He's been full time since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty vibrant, isn't he?'' Gores says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man,'' Yaus says. ``He's the one who invented this
treatment. He made it all possible.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To make the 2004 presidential election more
exciting and encourage broader voter participation, a Republican
panel boldly proposes to tinker with the present front-loaded
primary system, which nobody likes very much.
</P>
<P>
   The party nomination contests this year were over by the March 7
primary round, eliminating all viable candidates but Vice President
Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush before half the states had
held primaries or caucuses. The compressed timetable gave the two
men with the biggest names and the most money an unfair advantage
over lesser-known rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Disenfranchising a huge chunk of the country is not the
democratic way.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed alternative and other reforms that have been
periodically floated come with their own problems. For openers,
state legislatures that set the actual primary dates have their own
ideas about their importance in the electoral process and resist
being pushed around by national party do-gooders.
</P>
<P>
   A special Republican National Committee panel recently endorsed
a scheme to balance the primary calendar by letting the smallest
states hold their contests in March, confining middle-size states
to April and May and holding off the 12 largest states until June.
The GOP would try to enforce the new rules by slashing the size of
the convention delegation of any state that refused to cooperate.
This, however, would not be a good omen for party harmony in
affected states in the coming general election.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are also unhappy with the present primary system
but are skittish about the proposed reform. They will stay away
from the issue for a while until they see how much turmoil it
causes in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The big states won't like being pushed to the back of the pack,
where their influence could be minimized by the earlier returns.
That's why the big guys moved up this year's primary dates in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   But other solutions that might be fair to all the states are not
necessarily the answer either.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious alternative is a shift to a national primary,
in which every state would vote for party candidates on the same
day. But this would make it even more difficult for lesser-known
candidates to gain traction, money and media exposure against the
giants. It would give every individual running only one shot at a
victory, not several chances in several states.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of campaigning nationwide should be saved for the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   And we can predict that the parties would still have to deal
with the stubborn insistence of Iowa and New Hampshire to go first.
That would retain their inflated influence over the presidential
contests despite their relatively unrepresentative constituencies
and size. But this is not a bad thing. These states offer upstart
candidates an opportunity to prove their merit through one-on-one
campaigning, which would not be possible in a truly national
primary, where the media and money would matter most.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled regional primaries, spread out over four months in a
rotating sequence every four years, might be a logical compromise.
It would allow the campaign to progress at an orderly pace.
However, directly pitting the political and economic interests of
one region against another is likely to be more divisive than
unifying. The candidates may divvy up the regions, hoping to make a
big impact where they are strongest. This is a formula for trouble.
The competitive strains between South and North, East and West are
traditional and natural. Codifying them can only further polarize
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The major push to revise the current crammed-together electoral
process comes from concern about voter apathy, which afflicts both
parties. The theory is that giving more people a chance to take
part in meaningful primaries or caucuses will make politics more
representative and less dominated by big donors and special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it is not the primary system that is at fault.
Perhaps the candidates do not inspire enthusiastic support. Perhaps
the lack of an overriding emotional issue this year dampens public
interest. Perhaps campaigns in general go on too long. Perhaps the
excessive sums of money involved have turned us off. Perhaps in
this information age we are overloaded with charges and
countercharges that we cannot accurately assess.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps campaign finance reform is really the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, it is not necessary to change the primary
schedule. If that is so, it is necessary not to change it.

 &HT;    Under pressure, Heat squeezed
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They can't take this anymore, and the stress of it all _
three playoff-deciding games in three years on their own court and
three losses to the same opponent _ is now, finally and absolutely,
as clear as a Miami Heat meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, the Heat cracked not only at the end of the game
but beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   They cracked in going more than three minutes without scoring,
holding a six-point lead near the end of a game they needed to win
as desperately as they have ever needed anything on a basketball
floor.
</P>
<P>
   And then they cracked in the aftermath of an 83-82 loss to the
New York Knicks, who own Miami's mind and soul and heart, by
chasing and cursing officials Dick Bavetta, Dan Crawford and
Bennett Salvatore and blaming them for the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The officials weren't responsible for Jamal Mashburn (3-of-15)
and Tim Hardaway (6-of-20) shooting miserably.
</P>
<P>
   The officials weren't responsible for the Heat missing 10 free
throws _ including the first five they attempted in the fourth
quarter _ or being outrebounded.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the officials weren't responsible for the Heat
lying to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' said Miami center Alonzo Mourning, ``we are the
better team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's denial.
</P>
<P>
   That's ignoring reality at a time of high stress.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Heat ... that's all that's left of and for them.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Knicks have done to them.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful rivalry _ probably the best in professional sport
right now _ should come to end with this Miami surrender. No one
should require further proof of New York's supremacy. Four
consecutive playoff series have been stretched to the limit by the
two opponents, and the Knicks have won the past three in Miami's
home.
</P>
<P>
   They have won big (by 17 points) and small (twice by one).
</P>
<P>
   They have won when a ball bounced in for them (Allan Houston
last year) and away for the Heat (Clarence Weatherspoon this year).
But it's over.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat were fragile before losing the final two games of this
series. Now, they're broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in 13 world championships,'' said Miami head coach
Pat Riley, ``and I have never been in a Finals series that has as
much intensity and as much effort as this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Heat's ranting about officials so diminishes
the competition and so defines their own submission to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them dressed quickly and departed the funeral parlor of
a locker room. Others lingered to complain in vituperative diatribe
against the officials _ Hardaway in a no-questions statement about
``making them accountable'' or Mashburn, after leaving the court
spewing obscenities, in long and cathartic explanations about the
unfairness of having ``put in more work than any other NBA team
would ever think about'' and feeling somehow cheated.
</P>
<P>
   But the enduring picture will be of Mourning, around whom a new
Heat team almost certainly will soon begin to be constructed,
slumped in his cubicle or bent over holding his head in his hands.
He pushed Miami to a 25-16 lead by scoring almost as many points
(14) as the Knicks on baseline floater, a dunk, a rebound, another
dunk, a short jumper, a rebound and a long jumper.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, his 29 points and 13 rebounds and five
blocked shots weren't enough to save the Heat from a disaster that
will consume them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Mourning was forced to pass the ball to Mashburn
with the game in the balance and forced to watch Mashburn, who he
said was ``wide open'' on the catch, swing it to Weatherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he watched the rebound of Weatherspoon's miss go to
New York's Latrell Sprewell teetering almost out of bounds as the
Knicks screamed for a timeout that allowed them to then bite off
the last 2.1 seconds of Miami's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Mourning said, ``we put more into this than they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat did no such thing, of course.
</P>
<P>
   They did something else ... something they have done time and
time and time again against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   They cracked.

DASH IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 28)  
(Eds: The misspelling of ``indispensable'' at the beginning of the
second-last graf is deliberate.) 
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stately colon, the confiding parenthesis and the gently
pausing comma demand to know: What's behind today's big dash to the
dash? Why has this  &UR; lingua interruptus &LR;  _ expressing uncertainty,
jerking the reader around, setting up startling conclusions,
imitating patterns of speech _ come to dominate our prose?
</P>
<P>
   In the preceding paragraph, I used a pair of dashes to interrupt
a sentence and insert supplementary material that gave the question
meaning or _ to writers, at least _ urgency. I could as easily have
used a pair of parentheses, specifically designed for the purpose
of graceful interjection of useful explication.
</P>
<P>
   In the sentence beginning the previous paragraph, I could again
have used parentheses (``parens'' to friends) or even commas to
separate the mild interjection of ``to writers, at least,'' but I
didn't. Why not? Because I have fallen into the habit of trying too
often to make writing read like speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The spoken sentence is filled with uttered second thoughts,
changes of direction, lurches off on tangents and similar twists.
That's because we say what we think as we think it, and thoughts
have a way of tumbling over one another, and we stick them in our
flow of words as each notion comes to us.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of raw transcription, art strains to imitate life,
and artful writers feel the pressure to mirror the speech patterns
of yammering people by imitating their higgledy-piggledy outpouring
of unedited thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   That transcribed-speech technique is fine for writers of fiction
and is especially apt for playwrights and screenwriters who reveal
their characters' characters realistically through their speech.
Some characters blurt their thoughts, showing honesty; others
weasel their words, showing duplicity; yet others expostulate
grammatically but endlessly, showing off.
</P>
<P>
   Writers of drama must write speech, not writing, because real
people do not speak writing. Hence we have pauses, delays _ you get
my drift? _ half-stops, restarts, stammering and exclamatory grunts
(ugh!) and drifting off into pre-dot-com ellipses .... To put this
speech in written form _ that is, to transcribe it _ we have seen
the powerful punch _ pow! right in the kisser _ of illustrative
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Good dramatic writers are in favor of whatever turns the reader
on. In an 1863 poem, the poet Emily Dickinson, writing in the
halting voice of a woman dying, used the dash to signify gasping
for breath: ``I am alive _ I guess _/The Branches on my Hand/Are
full of Morning Glory _ And at my finger's end _/The Carmine _
tingles warm _/And if I hold a Glass/Across my Mouth _ it blurs it
_/Physician's _ proof of Breath _/I am alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In our time, the writing of Tom Wolfe has made stylish use of
the dash; he combines it with italics and the midsentence
exclamation point to indicate herky-jerkiness or panic in thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the current Harper's deriding the critics of
American ``triumphalism,'' the iconoclastic Wolfe steps into their
shoes to write, ``After the Soviet archives were opened up _ I
mean, damn! _ it looks like Hiss and the Rosenbergs actually  &UR; were &LR; 
Soviet agents _ and even the Witch Hunt, which was one of the
bedrocks of our beliefs _ damn again! _.'' That's the use of
fictional internal monologue in a nonfiction article, and the dash
does its job of chopping up the speech.
</P>
<P>
   But writers of narrative and exposition, as well as those who
present fiction in the third person, choose to use the language in
the voice of the writer and not of a character.
</P>
<P>
   The written sentence, which is not to be confused with the
spoken sentence that has been transcribed, gives its creator a
chance to rethink the ideas that have come off the top of the head,
to reassemble them in an orderly series, to snip off the
stupidities and shoot the strays, thereby to marshal a cogent
argument or paint a striking image.
</P>
<P>
   On Punctuation Highway, the writer-as-speaker is a dasher, only
half-braking at every stop sign; the writer-as-writer measures
every pause, uses a comma for the speed bump and a semicolon to
proceed with caution at the balancing of closely related complete
thoughts, as in this sentence. The colon, a strict setter-up of
things to follow, is like an arrow that says ``Now watch this'' to
the reader, but it is too often replaced by the do-anything dash.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Veit of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington
disagrees with me about the danger of the  &UR; em &LR; , which is the
typographer's term for the length of the dash: It's as long as the
letter  &UR; M &LR;  in the same font.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, no function of the  &UR; em &LR;  couldn't be handled by
other punctuation _ comma, colon, semicolon, period or
parentheses,'' he notes. ``The impact of the  &UR; em &LR;  is not syntactic
but visual. Its shape and length demand a pause and impart drama.
It sets up a punch line in a way a colon cannot. Arthur Wallace
Calhoun put a code of the Old South into words in 1918: `A woman's
name should appear in print but twice _ when she marries and when
she dies.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was then; now, just as women appear in print a lot, the
dash appears too often. I acknowledge that dashes can be useful _
say, to add an example _ and are surely more emphatic than
parentheses (without the sly sharing of confidence with the
reader).
</P>
<P>
   And the dash is indispensible for surrounding a list that
already contains commas _ weakly beginning a sentence with a
conjunction, misspelling  &UR; indispensable &LR; , and incorrectly using a
comma before the  &UR; and &LR;  preceding the final item in a series _ but
undiluted dashiness has become the mark of the slapdash writer who
fails to take the trouble to differentiate among the pauses of
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is different from speaking. Organize your written
thoughts so that you don't have to stud your sentences with asides,
sudden additions, curses or last-minute entries. Limit your use of
the dash to its indisp _ to those functions where it beats the
other punctuation pauses _ or else.

A VOTE FOR REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of the House of Representatives ought to vote this week
to grant China permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Beijing's record on human rights is
acceptable or that American workers and their unions are wrong to
worry about jobs in textiles and some other industries going
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But a vote against permanent normal trade relations for China
would not improve human rights in China and would not preserve
American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   House members are not voting on China's entry into the World
Trade Organization. China's accession to the WTO is practically
certain. They are deciding whether or not they will terminate the
annual farce of voting to bestow normal trade relations on Beijing
one year at a time. And since WTO rules require that each member
confer permanent status on other members, a House vote in the
negative would mean that the United States would be in violation of
WTO rules, isolating itself rather than China.
</P>
<P>
   The primary consequence of such a self-punishing exercise would
be to permit China to deny to American goods and services the
lowered tariffs and expunged quotas that competitors such as
Germany and Japan will enjoy. American exporters of soy beans, cell
phones, and Hollywood movies would then forfeit the considerable
concessions that US trade negotiators have wrung from the Chinese
over years of hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of a yes vote in the House often exagerate the
benefits enhanced free trade may have on human and civil rights in
China. As long as the Communist Party maintains its grip on the
world's most populous nation, the best that can be expected is a
continued expansion of choices in the private lives of Chinese
citizens and in the economic sphere.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Chinese markets to US imports may do little, in the near
term, to alleviate political repression within China or to end
China's colonization of Tibet. But free-market reformers in the
party would suffer a serious setback if the House voted to
perpetuate the pointless yearly vote on normal trade relations.
That is why the Dalai Lama has said that a yes vote will serve the
cause of reform in China.

MOSCOW'S VILLIANS AREN'T WHAT THEY USED TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARILYN STASIO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I went to Russia not too long ago and it wasn't there _ at
least, not the sinister, Soviet-era Russia that writers of Cold War
spy thrillers had prepared me to find behind the Iron Curtain. For
that matter, the Iron Curtain wasn't there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where was the cold air of menace that hung over Moscow in Martin
Cruz Smith's ``Gorky Park,'' smothering a politically sensitive
murder investigation in an oppressive landscape of ``white breath,
white trees, white snow, white sky''? What ever happened to Karla,
the implacable chief of Soviet espionage (``so self-possessed that
he could allow, if need be, 10 years for an operation to bear
fruit'') who relentlessly pursued the British agent George Smiley
in ``Quest for Karla,'' the trilogy of cerebral thrillers that John
Le Carre wrote in the 1970s? Where, oh where, among the spring buds
of a new political climate, were the bitter snows of yesteryear?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gone, gone, gone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody reads that stuff anymore, my Russian hosts gently
informed me, as they hustled me into the smart shops, fancy
restaurants and gleamingly refurbished landmarks of modern Moscow.
Actually, they don't even write that stuff anymore. The great spy
masters are either abandoning the old Russia and striking out for
new frontiers or repudiating the genre entirely. Martin Cruz
Smith's latest novel was set in Cuba, and Frederick Forsyth's last
book, a sequel to ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' was set in a Coney
Island fish factory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having had a glimpse of the new Russia, I can understand the
disenchantment of the genre masters. Compared with the subtle chess
players in Cold War thrillers, those black-booted Mafia gangsters
who gun their BMW motorbikes on the cobbled side streets of the
Tverskaya while making their shakedown rounds are drugstore
cowboys. The millionaire bankers, oil tycoons, media moguls and
industry barons who make up Russia's new oligarchy might prove to
be more cunning villains. But don't ask these greedy biznizmeni
(stout men who ostentatiously park their big Bentleys on public
sidewalks) to adapt their crass style to the classic spy thriller,
with its reflective foreign agents, its byzantine games of intrigue
and agonizing moral dilemmas.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The buy-or-die spirit of Russia's new market economy doesn't
adapt any better to the atmosphere of bleak despair in these
novels. Pleasant as it may be, shopping in the fashionable
boutiques of the Arbat and Manezh Square will never replace the old
thrill of being herded through the GUM department store by a glum
Intourist guide. Luckily, my reading matter on this trip took the
edge off the unnerving civility that dollar-bearing foreigners now
encounter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lenin was still rotting decorously in his tomb on the morning
that I went to Red Square, and the Tsarskaya _ the wooden tower
where Ivan the Terrible stood gloating over the protracted
executions of state criminals _ was still good for a heartfelt
shudder. But the sun was shining, tourists were gamboling, and the
little army of fuzz-faced soldiers who marched up to me only wanted
to have their pictures taken to send home to their mothers in
Gdansk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, it was with some relief that I buried my nose in ``The
Forbidden Zone,'' a political thriller by Michael Hetzer. Hetzer
was the founding editor of The Moscow Times, the English-language
newspaper in Moscow, and a survivor of the fusillade of gunfire
that ripped up the newspaper's offices (and killed four people) in
the chaotic street fighting of 1993. In the eyes of his heroine, an
American astronomer named Katherine Sears, Moscow in 1984 was still
a ``gloomy, oppressive and sinister'' place for a woman traveling
alone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although I encountered no hostility on my own trip (beyond the
supercilious sneer of a waiter at the ever-so-trendy Boyarsky
restaurant), poor Katherine fares otherwise when she tries to find
out the fate of a dissident astrophysicist. Pegged as a spy, she is
dragged from her room at the huge and hideous Ukraine Hotel (``the
city's largest foreigner ghetto'') by KGB agents and hounded into
hiding by a senior member of the Politburo. Happily, the chase
takes her to the very landmarks I was headed for that day: the
magnificent Cathedral of the Assumption (where she's torn away from
the splendid icons and pursued to the bell tower by a hooded monk);
the medieval enclosure of Novodevushi Convent (where a woman in a
red scarf slips her a cryptic message); the swank Moskva Restaurant
(where she catches the same awful floor show I did).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Katherine's jaunty Perils-of-Pauline adventures are fine
for sightseeing, Robert Harris' ``Archangel'' is a book best taken
out after dark. The hero is a British scholar named Fluke Kelso who
has come to Moscow to attend an international symposium marking the
reopening of the Soviet archives only to discover that the cult of
Stalinism is still very much alive in Russia. Caught up in the
``charge of history,'' he wanders the city like a traveler in a
time warp. ``That was what always drew him back,'' he says, ``the
way history hung in the air between the blackened buildings like
sulfur after a lightning strike.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When night falls on the city in ``Gorky Park'' _ ``the evening a
maternal black, windows small and bright, the faces on the street
bright as windows'' _ Martin Cruz Smith's police inspector, Arkady
Renko, experiences the same sensation of being adrift in time.
Standing alone in the winter twilight, ``he felt he could have been
in any Moscow of the past five centuries, and he wouldn't have been
surprised by the sound of hooves in mud.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the paranoid world of the espionage novel, the hovering past
is always alive with menace. In ``Archangel'' Robert Harris makes
the present seem as malevolent as the past. I never made it to
Robotnik, a fictional Mafia-run nightclub where Fluke Kelso
observes rich Russians at sexual play and learns the going rate for
a ``respectable'' prostitute ($300). But the stark night scenes of
a place where the ``serious money'' goes to sin, where ``teeth and
eyes and nails and banknotes flashed in the gloom like knives,''
elicits the kind of shiver that you just don't get from going to
the Bolshoi.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any Westerner in Moscow on business should find John Le Carre's
``Single &AMP; Single'' sobering reading, especially after staggering
back to the hotel from a jovial trade dinner. The idealistic hero,
Oliver Single, is the junior partner in a London investment house
that used to launder dirty money for members of the old Politburo.
Now the merchant bankers are back in town to cut some deals with a
new breed of crook. After meeting his clients _ a thuggish family
of Georgian drug dealers who want to use their illicit profits to
corner the international market in human blood _ Oliver is whisked
off to one of those glitzy hotel casinos that have sprung up around
Red Square (the sort of place where ``plainclothesmen guard the
swing doors, pink-stained fountains play,'' and the wheels are spun
by ``women croupiers in low-cut dresses.'') Then it's off to the
family digs, where Oliver and his new associates sit in chairs once
owned by Catherine the Great, puff on Cuban cigars, and toast their
business venture from silver-chased ram's horns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sipping tea in the lobby of the Metropol and eavesdropping on a
thin-lipped Danish businessman ``in phones'' struggling to
negotiate a contract with two beefy Muscovites in black leather
jackets, I could appreciate Oliver's culture shock.

ETHIOPIA'S MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ethiopia's unwarranted attack into Eritrea has greatly escalated
the war between these two impoverished nations. Despite its
military success, Ethiopia ought to withdraw and accept the peace
agreement that has been on the table for months.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea are fighting over an inconsequential piece
of real estate. But it is highly charged with symbolism as the two
nations sort out their relationship after a 20-year war that ended
with Eritrea breaking off from the larger nation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton before the war hailed President Isaias
Afewerki of Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia as
exemplars of new African leadership. The conflict suggests they are
run-of-the-mill strongmen who fight to advance their domestic
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Meles came to power because the Eritrean war of independence
weakened the dictator then in power. He is a member of the minority
Tigray group, and the latest offensive gives him an opportunity to
solidify his standing among the Amhara people, who dominate Addis
Ababa, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lake, Clinton's former national security adviser, and
other administration figures have gone back and forth between the
two countries to persuade them to accept a peace plan proposed by
the Organization of African Unity. This low-key diplomacy did
nothing to avert the latest offensive. The administration needs to
get tougher.
</P>
<P>
   It has supported a boycott of arms sales to both countries, but
this supposed evenhandedness benefits Ethiopia, given its recent
success and the huge population imbalance (58.4 million to 3.8
million).
</P>
<P>
   Isaias and the other Eritreans are intent on affirming their
independence from their recent masters. But they had no right to
seize the border land in 1998, an act that precipitated war.
Nonetheless, they have volunteered to withdraw pending an impartial
border demarcation, while Ethiopia has raised spurious objections
to the deal. The United States and other western nations must make
it clear to the Ethiopians that they are now in the wrong.

RUDENSTINE'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, college and university presidents shook the halls of
American thought. Today, their intellectual leadership is
overshadowed by two of higher education's watchwords: capital
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Rudenstine stepped into this river in 1991 when he became
president of Harvard University. Understated and known for working
behind the scenes, Rudenstine has struck a pragmatic balance
between fiscal and academic excellence, even if he may never have
his name on a Harvard building. His plan to step down as president,
announced Monday, means Harvard must hammer out a new future.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics praise Rudenstine's impressive fund-raising
ability. Harvard has exceeded its $2.1 billion campaign goal. A
scholar of Renaissance literature, Rudenstine champions the
sciences. He has pushed Washington to spend more on research and
has addressed pressing new issues facing Harvard's medical school
and teaching hospitals. Hires such as law professor Lani Guinier
and government professor William Julius Wilson have helped
diversify the faculty. Rudenstine's historic legacy may well be
starting an effort to get Harvard's fiercely independent schools to
work more closely together.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree calls Rudenstine
``an extraordinary president and an ordinary guy,'' pointing to his
involvement in details great and small, from academic appointments
to office-hour talks with undergraduates. In 1994, this retail
presidency looked all too human when Rudenstine took a medical
leave, saying he was exhausted. He seemed overwhelmed, but three
months later he was back.
</P>
<P>
   In a search that may take a year, Harvard would do well to find
a new president who combines Rudenstine's fund-raising and
managerial attributes with an ability to use the office as a bully
pulpit. Ever-faster developments in such fields as medicine,
communications, and biotechnology are raising ethical questions
that cry out for answers. The sweet reason once offered by college
presidents is in demand again. The next president must protect the
traditional core of academic excellence and its modern variations.

&HT;     HUNGRY BEARS GIVE YOSEMITE VISITORS A TASTE OF THE WILD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's spring training for bears, campers and
hikers at Yosemite National Park, and so far the bears are winning
the game.
</P>
<P>
   In one story, a happy visitor had reportedly just hiked the
beautiful Mirror Lake Trail, which runs adjacent to the base of
Half Dome, and returned to his car to find a bear sitting in the
back seat, having a picnic with all the goodies that had been left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   In another encounter, a momma bear with two cubs sauntered into
a campground, and while the campers were banging on pots in shock,
the bears poked their noses into coolers and ripped through bags of
food, taking what they wanted for 10 or 15 minutes. The campers
then took pictures, not sure if this was a disaster or the most
amazing thing they had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week in Yosemite Valley, eight more vehicles were
broken into by bears and there were another 12 damage reports from
campgrounds. So far this spring there have been 117 bear incidents
already at Yosemite, resulting in $32,871 in property damage, most
of it to cars.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no injuries. You see, the bears are not
interested in you. They just want your food. And too often, they
are getting it.
</P>
<P>
   As spring arrives in the alpine zone, Yosemite Valley becomes
the greatest showpiece in North America, as snowmelt turns
waterfalls into silver-tasseled ribbons against the eye-popping
granite canyon walls. Meanwhile, like something out of P.T. Barnum,
it's like the Yosemite bears are in a three-ring circus in the
parking lots and campgrounds.
</P>

   Wild bears are supposed to eat grass, budding leaves and
insects, and perhaps carrion if they come across it as they emerge
from their winter sleep. Except in Yosemite, bears have learned
that Tang, butter and candy taste a lot better. The worst-case is
when campers don't use bear-proof food lockers, or visitors leave a
bags full of goodies in their parked cars, allowing momma bear a
chance to teach her cubs the tricks of food-raiding. The cubs learn
fast, and as those cubs smarten up and become adults, another
generation of bears will prefer Hostess cupcakes to carpenter ants.
</P>
<P>
   To try to stop this cycle, campers are now required to use
bear-proof food lockers, and in the coming summer, those heading
into the Yosemite wilderness are required to use bear-proof food
canisters when above 9,600-foot elevation. Violators will be
ticketed and fined. In addition, visitors are advised to report any
situation where a bear is trying to reach human food: Phone the
Save-A-Bear Hotline at (209) 372-0200 (press 2, then 4).

<P>
   For many visitors, seeing a bear validates the vacation, and
there is often no better place to do that than Yosemite. Another
truth, though, is they are a side show, not the show itself.
</P>
<P>
   And the big show is just starting. After the surprise storm last
Tuesday dumped 18 inches of snow on the Sierra crest, ensuing warm
temperatures are defrosting the high-country deep freeze. In turn,
snowmelt is flooding crevices, flowing down canyons, into streams,
and straight to Yosemite Valley. Eventually it reaches the brink of
the canyon, creating some of the most dramatic waterfalls in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Driving into the valley, the first sight of Bridalveil Falls
(620 feet) on the South Wall can take your breath away. Yet it
seems that every fissure of rock has water running down it right
now, as if it is a giant waterfall park, and it will continue like
for at least the next six weeks during peak snowmelt.
</P>
<P>
   The road up to Glacier Point opened last week, and with spring
arriving to the alpine zone, this may be perhaps the most stellar
lookout in North America. It overlooks Half Dome, Tenaya Canyon,
the headwaters of the Merced River and the Yosemite Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't what pops your eyes out. It's the waterfalls, on
one side a view of Nevada Falls (594 feet) aside Liberty Dome and
Vernal Falls (317 feet) a bit below that, and the entire two-decked
free-fall of Yosemite Falls (2,425 feet, the highest waterfall in
America) to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gripe at Yosemite has always been too many cars, too
many people, and as the vacation season starts, the crowds are just
starting to show up in significant numbers, mainly day visitors.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a landmark attempt to reduce the number of cars in
the valley, the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation Service
started a voluntary bus service between Mariposa, Merced, and Mono
counties and the park. But until quotas and a reservation entry
service is established, this is a finger-in-the-dike solution,
especially on summer days when there are 24,000 people in five
square miles on the valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you were a bear, you wouldn't much mind, because
many of these people represent potential for an easy food raid:
``So much food, so little time.''

<P>
   By some plans, Russia's Mir space station should have been long
dead, with most of its structure incinerated by a fiery re-entry
through Earth's atmosphere and the remains of the giant spacecraft
resting on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mir remains in orbit. Even as astronauts from the space
shuttle Atlantis were preparing the nascent International Space
Station for future occupancy, a pair of astronauts aboard Mir were
busily repairing worn components and preparing it for future
visits. Previously abandoned, battered and showing all the effects
of its sometimes troubled 14 years in space, Mir just keeps going.
</P>
<P>
   Long the subject of premature obituaries, Mir, the pride of the
cash-starved Russian space program, is being given longer life due
to last-minute money from Western investors. With the help of more
than $20 million in private investment and spacecraft supplied by
Russian partners, it appears the life of the 130-ton space station
may extend past its 15th anniversary in orbit next February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not surprised that the Russians found a way to keep Mir
up,'' said Marcia Smith, a space analyst with the Library of
Congress' Congressional Research Service. ``It is a source of great
national pride and they are very resourceful.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mir's continued operation delights Russia and some space
enthusiasts worldwide, the United States and other partners in the
International Space Station see Mir's continuation as a potential
threat to the international project. How can Russia, they ask, with
its limited resources, both support Mir and keep its commitments as
a major partner in the new station?
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which is
leading the international project, notes that Russia is a sovereign
nation with the right to do what it wants with Mir and the rest of
its space program. But NASA officials express chagrin that the
international project is more than two years behind schedule,
mainly because of Russian delays in completing critical components
that have resulted from inadequate financing.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, told a congressional
subcommittee last month that he was highly frustrated that Russia
would agree to a venture to extend Mir operations after saying that
it would abandon the station and concentrate its resources on the
international project. ``They always seem to have a little extra
money around for Mir but not the International Space Station,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said earlier that Russia must keep its agreement to
concentrate its resources on the new project. ``The Russians have
got to focus, and the primary focus is meeting their commitment to
the International Space Station,'' he said, ``If Mir saps their
strength in meeting their commitments, then we have serious
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two modules of the $60 billion international station,
one American and one Russian, have been in orbit since the fall of
1998 awaiting the arrival of a crucial third component, a
Russian-made service module that is to provide initial living
quarters and laboratory space for the growing station. Program
officials say the Russian segment, which must be in place before
more parts are added to the station, is ready and set to be
launched in July.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the delayed Russian-made service module is the
current mission of the U.S. shuttle Atlantis, which docked with the
new station 210 miles above the Earth on Sunday to refurbish the
complex. Atlantis' seven-member crew was to swap out deteriorating
Russian electric batteries, transfer 1,000 thousand pounds of
supplies for future crews, and raise the station's decaying orbit
by 26 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russian astronauts Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr
Kalery continue their 60-day mission of putting Mir back into
working order and assessing the orbiting outpost for future
renovations and commercial applications. The crew arrived at Mir on
April 6 and concentrated on making the station habitable again
before starting a program of scientific research. The astronauts
found and patched what they reportedly believed was the source of a
persistent air leak, and used supplies brought up by an unmanned
Progress cargo craft to repair and restock the station.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, the Russian astronauts conducted a five-hour
spacewalk outside Mir to inspect its outer hull and retrieve
experimental packages left out by previous crews. They discovered
that a solar power panel that had stopped working in March
apparently suffered a short circuit that charred external wiring.
Also, they tested a new glue designed to seal cracks in aging
spacecraft. The glue, which its developers said could be used to
fill small cracks and leaks in any spacecraft, was applied to a
special test panel and left outside Mir to be retrieved later.
</P>
<P>
   All of this activity comes just nine months after Mir was
supposedly abandoned in preparation for nudging it out of orbit
with rockets and letting it burn up in the upper atmosphere. The
Russian government pledged to put no more money into the station
and let it die, unless private financing was found to keep it in
orbit. Several groups proposed schemes to save Mir, but none could
come up with the estimated $100 million to $200 million per year
needed to operate the station.
</P>
<P>
   This situation changed at the beginning of the year when a group
of Western investors formed a company called MirCorp and began
raising money. MirCorp, chartered in Bermuda and based in
Amsterdam, received initial financing of about $20 million from
Gold &AMP; Appel Transfer SA, a Caribbean-based venture capital holding
company. In February, MirCorp signed an agreement with RSC Energia,
the privatized Russian company that built and operates Mir, for
commercial use of the station for the remainder of its life.
Energia, which is 38 percent owned by the Russian government,
became the majority stockholder in MirCorp and retains ownership of
Mir.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp has announced plans for the station that include turning
it into a space hotel for wealthy tourists willing to pay $20
million for a unique vacation, leasing space to pharmaceutical and
other companies wanting to do proprietary research in space, and
establishing Internet and entertainment businesses there.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Manber, an American who is president of MirCorp, said in
an interview that the company had raised $40 million so far, and
intended to raise another $100 million before a possible public
stock offering next year. Manber said the company had almost raised
enough money for its next announced mission to Mir, sending up a
crew this fall with equipment to start Internet services from orbit
and beginning renovations of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not promised things that we have not delivered,''
Manber said. ``We have hit our technical milestones and have hit
the basics of our business model, and are very optimistic about our
chances. With each success we have, we think we can raise more
money on the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Manber said that, according to the accounting and investment
firms the company is consulting about a stock offering, MirCorp
could raise between $300 million and $500 million through a public
stock offering. If this happens, he said, the Russians could come
away with up to $200 million to revitalize their space industry and
the company would have more money to upgrade the station and
perhaps even build a new central module for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the core module of Mir is 14 years old,'' Manber said.
``If you build a new core and add the newer modules of the current
station, then you have a much younger station in space available
for commercial uses for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   James E. Oberg, a former NASA engineer and Houston-based expert
on the Russian space program, said MirCorp was not assured success,
``but I admire them for giving it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken a risky, innovative approach and the basis of
opportunity is taking chances,'' Oberg said, ``A lot of the things
they are proposing are off-the-wall ideas, but some have merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles P. Vick, a space analyst with the Federation of American
Scientists in Washington, said he did not believe there was enough
private interest and money available to finance expansive Mir
plans. ``I don't think the capital is there, unless it is put in by
governments. It just seems like a limited program that won't go
very far.''
</P>
<P>
   John E. Pike, another federation analyst, said the changing
political climate in Russia might be shifting in Mir's favor.
Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, pledged last month to
fulfill his country's commitments to the international station, but
also voiced strong support for Mir and the Russian space industry.
``The space sector is not only a prestigious sector which makes our
country a great power,'' Putin said, ``but it is also linked to
economic and scientific development.''
</P>
<P>
   During this commemoration of the nation's annual Astronaut Day,
Russian news agencies reported that Putin said he would include
money for Mir in next year's space budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests a continuation of Mir that the previous
administration of Boris N. Yeltsin said it didn't support,'' Pike
said. ``Is this part of a larger re-evaluation of Russia's
relationship with the United States, a signal of a new Russian
independence?''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir John Gielgud, one of the great actors of the English stage
who enthralled audiences for more than 70 years with his eloquent
voice and consummate artistry, died Sunday at his home in
Aylesbury, west of London. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last survivor of that triumvirate of legendary
theatrical knights _ Lord Laurence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson
and Gielgud _ who dominated acting in England and vitalized
Shakespeare in what became a golden age of classical theater. He
was especially celebrated for his performances as Romeo, Hamlet,
Benedick, Angelo in ``Measure for Measure,'' Prospero and various
kings of the realm. With equal ease, he demonstrated his finesse in
plays by Wilde and Chekhov and by his contemporaries, who ranged
from Shaw to Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   A quintessential man of the theater, he was also known as a
director, a producer and an author. He loved acting and was devoted
to the stage, but he always understood the contradictions of his
profession. ``Acting is half shame, half glory,'' he once said.
``Shame at exhibiting yourself, glory when you can forget
yourself.'' And on another occasion he said: ``Acting has rid me of
my frustrations and satisfied many of my ambitions. It is more than
an occupation or a profession; for me it has been a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Olivier was known for his physical daring and Richardson
had a gift for eccentric characterization, it was Gielgud who
elevated language. In his bearing as well as his speech, he was the
most lyrical of the three, a fact that could lead people to
underrate his versatility. The beauty with which the actor
transmitted Shakespeare in his one-man show, ``Ages of Man,''
caused Kenneth Tynan to offer the backhanded compliment that he was
``the finest actor on earth from the neck up,'' leaving other
anatomical claims to Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   What the Tynan judgment overlooked was Gielgud the risk-taker,
especially in the last half of his distinguished career, in which
he revealed himself as a masterly character actor in plays by
Pinter and David Storey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke is that people think of me as an intellectual
actor,'' Gielgud said. ``Yet I have always trusted almost entirely
to observation, emotion and instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   He was ``the greatest classical actor of all time,'' Sheridan
Morley, Gielgud's authorized biographer, said Monday. Morley's
book, ``John G,'' is scheduled to be published early next year.
</P>
<P>
   An indefatigable worker, Gielgud acted until the very end of his
life. In his late 80s he appeared principally in films and on
television. His final performance on stage was in 1988 in Hugh
Whitemore's ``Best of Friends,'' in which he played Sir Sydney
Cockerell, the curator of the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge
University.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of tributes published on Gielgud's 80th
birthday, Sir Alec Guinness said, ``John Gielgud did more to
liberate the English theater from the fustian attitudes of the '20s
and early '30s than any other man and paved the way for what is
best in London today.'' Guinness later wrote that Gielgud headed
the list of ``lasting influences on my professional life.'' In that
birthday book, Dame Peggy Ashcroft wrote about Gielgud that ``his
charm and his charisma have never flagged, and who knows what he
may have up his sleeve for us yet?'' He was one of the most
surprising of actors, and someone who could not resist a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his career, he achieved an even wider popularity for his
roles in films and won an Academy Award as best supporting actor
for playing the butler in the 1981 Dudley Moore comedy ``Arthur.''
He was amused that people were surprised by his success in a comic
role. As he said, ``I always thought you must try to find the
comedy even in parts like Lear and Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   The vulgar dialogue he spoke in ``Arthur'' seemed to contradict
his courtliness. Tall, elegant and dignified, with an imperious
profile, he could quite easily strike a stance of snobbishness.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, his last major movie role was as Prospero in
``Prospero's Books,'' Peter Greenaway's 1991 version of ``The
Tempest,'' fulfilling a dream of his to perform that Shakespearean
role on film. That was the fifth time he played Prospero;
repeatedly he reinterpreted a character, returning again and again
to Romeo, Hamlet and other roles. His fifth King Lear was in a 1994
radio production, directed by Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In one magnificent season early in his career he alternated with
Olivier in the roles of Romeo and Mercutio; he received more
admiring reviews for his Romeo, Olivier for his Mercutio. In the
course of his long life in the theater he played almost all the
great Shakespearean characters, in a number of cases affixing an
enduring imprint.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For someone who was known for his brilliant articulation of
Shakespearean verse and for his graceful stage presence, as a young
actor he was dismissed for his artificiality and his physical
awkwardness. His first drama teacher, Constance Benson, burst out
laughing in the middle of a rehearsal and said he walked ``like a
cat with rickets.'' For the young Gielgud, acting became a project
of self-education and self-improvement. He was his own most
demanding critic. Within a few years of his debut, he had worked
his way to the very top of his profession, and remained there
throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in London on April 14, 1904, the son of Frank
Gielgud, a stockbroker, and the former Kate Terry-Lewis. The name
Gielgud is Lithuanian, he said, ``not Scottish, as many people
imagine.'' He was christened Arthur John, but was always known as
John, or to friends, Johnnie. One of four children, he came from a
privileged background.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud had the lineage to be a great actor. His grandmother was
the actress Kate Terry, Ellen Terry was his great aunt, Edward
Gordon Craig was a cousin, and there were other actors and
theatrical managers in his family. His brother Val Gielgud was a
playwright, a novelist and a director. Besides their talent for the
theater, he said, the Gielguds and the Terrys shared ``the same
weakness: weak lachrymal glands.'' They were easy criers, something
that he was to use later to his advantage in performance.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in emulation of Gordon Craig, he set his earliest sights
on being a set designer. As a child, he said, he ``developed a
passion for painting for back cloths and designs in pastels for my
toy theater.'' He later wrote, ``I was stage-struck, mad about the
theater.'' Although he never lost his interest in design, he was
soon caught up by the idea of being an actor.

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His theatrical beginnings were inauspicious. At Hillside, his
preparatory school, he played the Mock Turtle in a production of
``Alice in Wonderland'' and sang, he said, ``with increasing volume
and shrillness in every verse.'' After attending Westminster
School, he rebelled against the idea of a university education and
decided to enter the theater, vowing that ``If I did not succeed
before I was 25, I would follow my parents' wishes, and work to
become an architect.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When he was 17, he made his professional debut, of sorts, as a
walk-on in an Old Vic production of ``Henry V.'' He played the
herald and had one line: ``Here is the number of the slaughter'd
French.'' As he later said, he made such a bad impression that when
he subsequently had walk-ons in ``King Lear'' and ``Peer Gynt'' he
was given no lines to speak. After three years at Lady Benson's
School, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, he played his first Romeo (opposite Gwen
Ffrangcon-Davies), and it was, he later wrote, a ``baptism by
fire.'' One critic, perhaps in anticipation of Tynan's remark, said
that ``Mr. Gielgud from the waist downward means absolutely
nothing.'' But within a year he was understudying Noel Coward in
the leading role in Coward's play ``The Vortex,'' and when the
author left the cast he replaced him. Later he was to credit Coward
with teaching him the art of timing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was playing Chekhov: Konstantin in ``The Seagull'' and
Baron Tusenbach in ``The Three Sisters.'' In 1926, he replaced
Coward again, this time in ``The Constant Nymph.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time his name was in lights was in 1928 in a farce
with Hermione Baddeley. It was, he said, ``an appalling concoction,
backed by the lady who had written it, called `Holding Out the
Apple.''' It was followed by two more disasters. For several years,
he said in his autobiography, ``Early Stages,'' he was on ``the
fringe of real success'' while in danger of being typecast as
``neurotic, rather hysterical young men.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Old Vic, where he played, in succession, Romeo,
Richard II, Oberon, Macbeth and Hamlet. It was in ``Richard II''
that he ``began to feel at last that I was finding my feet in
Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet,'' which he played at the age of 25, was the first of
the plays to transfer to the West End, where it joined two other
``Hamlets'' on the boards. The English critic James Agate said the
Gielgud performance of Hamlet was ``the high water mark of English
Shakespearean acting in our time.'' In other words, he had
fulfilled his vow to his parents. It was Agate who called him ``Our
First Player.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In these plays, as John Mortimer recalled, the actor's ``voice
ensnared and enslaved'' the audience. ``No one had ever spoken
Shakespeare with such intelligence and understanding.'' He added,
``No one ever mentioned a cat with rickets again.''
</P>
<P>
   The following season, Gielgud returned to the Old Vic, where he
was joined by another young actor, Ralph Richardson. In their first
play together, he was Hotspur to the Richardson Prince Hal. On
opening night, he was surprised to hear Richardson whisper to him
on stage during the dueling scene: ``Now you hit me, cocky. Now I
hit you.''
</P>
<P>
   As Richardson recalled: ``I found his clothes extravagant, his
conversation flippant. I didn't like him. But when I played Caliban
to his Prospero, John said, `Would you care to run over your scene
with me.' I thought to myself, `Not much.' But we ran it through
and he gave me about 200 ideas as he usually does and I thought, by
God he knows something about this here play.''
</P>
<P>
   They quickly became fast friends and mutual admirers. ``I was
always rather amazed at him,'' Richardson said. ``A kind of
brilliant butterfly, while I was a very gloomy sort of boy.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the Old Vic, the young Gielgud played Sergius in ``Arms and
the Man,'' Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night'' and ``King Lear.'' But it
was as ``Richard II in ``Richard of Bordeaux'' in his own
production in 1933, that he became a West End star. As he said,
``Queues coiled like serpents round'' the theater, as he was
``photographed, painted, caricatured, interviewed'' and lionized.
These were heady Shakespearean days, as he, often in tandem with
Olivier and Richardson, tackled the weightiest of classics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 he brought his ``Hamlet'' to Broadway, with Jessica
Tandy as his Ophelia. Again, there was another Hamlet in town:
Leslie Howard, and the two dueled for domination. The Gielgud
version ran for 132 performances, a record for ``Hamlet'' on
Broadway, until broken by Richard Burton in 1964, in a production
directed by Gielgud.
</P>
<P>
   In his first film, the silent ``Who Is the Man?'' in 1925, he
played a dope fiend, a role originally performed onstage by Sarah
Bernhardt. That was, he said, ``the most ridiculous part I played
on screen.'' Then Alfred Hitchcock persuaded him to be in ``The
Secret Agent,'' by telling him it was ``another Hamlet part.'' To
his dismay, ``Peter Lorre pinched all the best lines.'' ``The
Secret Agent'' opened the year of his Broadway ``Hamlet,'' and it
did not augur a promising film career. For many years, his
cinematic work was sporadic; the high points were Shakespearean, as
Clarence in Olivier's ``Richard III,'' as Cassius in Joseph
Mankiewicz's 1952 version of ``Julius Caesar'' and as King Henry IV
in Orson Welles' ``Chimes at Midnight.'' But his stage career
continued unabated during and after World War II and covered a wide
range of classics, as he proved to be equally at home in Wilde and
Chekhov, Sheridan and Congreve.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States in 1947 with ``The Lady's Not
for Burning,'' directing a cast that included himself and Burton.
``The Ages of Man,'' his one-man collage of excerpts from
Shakespeare, was a tour de force that he played in London, on
Broadway and on tour. In 1950 in ``a fresh start in a glorious
season at Stratford,'' he played Angelo, Cassius, Benedick and
Lear. Five years later he returned to Lear and astonished audiences
in George Devine's production designed by Isamu Noguchi. He was
knighted in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Through the next decades, he continued to direct as well as act,
with the emphasis on classics, although in 1965 he acted in Edward
Albee's ``Tiny Alice'' opposite Irene Worth, and several seasons
later he staged Albee's ``All Over'' on Broadway. In 1968 he played
the title role in the Peter Brook production of Seneca's
``Oedipus.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brook said: ``John is always in the present; he is modern in
his restless quest for truth and new meaning. He is also
traditional, for his passionate sense of quality comes from his
understanding of the past. He links two ages. He is unique.''

   In the 1970s Gielgud took a sudden and exhilarating step into
modern theater, first with David Storey's ``Home'' (1970) and then
with Harold Pinter's ``No Man's Land'' (1975). In both plays, he
shared the stage with his old friend Richardson. The director Peter
Hall had expected him to choose the ``posh part of Hirst'' in ``No
Man's Land'' because it was similar to other roles he had played.
Surprisingly he chose Spooner, the seedy poet in sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both felt we were paddling dangerously in uncharted seas,''
Gielgud said, ``but our shared success (in ``Home'' and ``No Man's
Land'') was a lively encouragement as well as a refreshing
challenge after the more conventional ups and downs of our past
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 Gielgud moved into experimental films, starring as a
tormented, aged novelist in Alain Resnais' ``Providence.'' With
that movie, he said, ``I felt I was in the avant-garde with a
vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   The following decade, while acting on stage in ``Julius
Caesar,'' Julian Mitchell's ``Half-Life'' and other plays, he
expanded his opportunities in films and television. In addition to
his role in ``Arthur,'' he was featured in the films ``Chariots of
Fire,'' ``Gandhi,'' ``Shining Through'' and ``Power of One,'' and
on television in ``Brideshead Revisited,'' ``War and Remembrance''
and ``Summer's Lease.'' For the last show, he won an Emmy as best
actor in a mini-series. Together with Olivier and Richardson, he
appeared in the television mini-series ``Wagner.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Gielgud was known for his faux pas, for
``dropping bricks'' in public. While having lunch with the
playwright Edward Knoblock, he said to his companion: ``Do you see
that man coming in? He's the biggest bore in London _ second only
to Edward Knoblock.'' Then realizing who was sitting next to him,
he retracted his statement: ``Not you, of course. I mean the other
Edward Knoblock.'' When he was directing Burton in ``Hamlet,'' he
went backstage after the performance and said, ``We'll go to dinner
when you're better,'' instead of ``when you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   His response to questions was candid. When the actor Michael
Hordern asked him for advice on how to play King Lear, Gielgud
famously replied, ``All I can tell you is to get a small
Cordelia.'' Years later, he commented about Robert Stephens' Lear
at Stratford-on-Avon: ``He had somebody else carry her on!''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 24 years, Gielgud lived in a 17th-century house in
Buckinghamshire. With its beautiful garden and ornate furnishings,
the baronial estate was Gielgud's own Brideshead. The garden was
tended by his companion of many years, Martin Hensler, who died
last year. Gielgud has no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with the New York Times in 1993, the actor
was slender and stately, unbowed by his years. Anticipating his
90th birthday the following April, he had actively discouraged any
celebration. ``If I can manage to to go on working, it's much more
interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1976, he had sold his home in London and moved to the country
_ and seldom returned to the city. ``Every street in London is full
of memory,'' he said. ``I've lost so many dear friends: Peggy,
Ralph, Olivier, Redgrave and, in America, Helen Hayes, Judith,
Lillian.'' Choking back his emotion, he added, ``Thank goodness
Alec Guinness is going strong.'' The poignancy was especially
resonant for someone like Gielgud, for whom the theater had been a
family.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth decade as an actor, he was still stagestruck, and
carried with him the history of the English theater in the century.
``I used to love being in the theater and having great actors come
to visit me.'' Although he did not often see plays anymore, he
resolutely read reviews and kept up with what was happening on
stage in London.
</P>
<P>
   When he was not working, he passed ``the time rather agreeably,
as long as one doesn't brood too much about death and the unhappy
things of one's life.'' He said: ``I get moments of great
depression. Fortunately, I've had very good friends who have been
critical of me. They haven't flattered me too much so that I
acquired a sense of my own importance. That's a danger for an
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a great reader, often finishing four books a week, and he
also watched television. For many years, his favorite shows were
``Cheers'' and ``Dynasty.'' Through the 1990s he never stopped
working, appearing on television and in 1998 in the film
``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his interest in experimental theater, for years he had
avoided doing works by Samuel Beckett, and said that he had talked
Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness out of doing the original London
production of ``Waiting for Godot.'' In retrospect, he regretted
not doing ``Endgame,'' and this spring he acted for the last time,
in a film of Beckett's play ``Catastrophe,'' as ``the victim''
opposite Harold Pinter, under the direction of David Mamet. The
film is part of a series of movies made of all Beckett's stage
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Gielgud's own writing was as elegant as his acting. His books
include the autobiographies ``Early Stages'' and ``An Actor and His
Time,'' and two collections of essays, ``Stage Directions'' and
``Distinguished Company.'' In ``Stage Directions'' he wrote, ``For
me the theater has always been an escape, a make-believe world,
full of color and excitement, fun, emotion, poetry and movement, a
world of striking characters and extraordinary personalities.'' One
of the most extraordinary was Gielgud himself.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir John Gielgud, one of the great actors of the English stage
who enthralled audiences for more than 70 years with his eloquent
voice and consummate artistry, died Sunday at his home in
Aylesbury, west of London. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last survivor of that triumvirate of legendary
theatrical knights _ Lord Laurence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson
and Gielgud _ who dominated acting in England and vitalized
Shakespeare in what became a golden age of classical theater. He
was especially celebrated for his performances as Romeo, Hamlet,
Benedick, Angelo in ``Measure for Measure,'' Prospero and various
kings of the realm. With equal ease, he demonstrated his finesse in
plays by Wilde and Chekhov and by his contemporaries, who ranged
from Shaw to Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   A quintessential man of the theater, he was also known as a
director, a producer and an author. He loved acting and was devoted
to the stage, but he always understood the contradictions of his
profession. ``Acting is half shame, half glory,'' he once said.
``Shame at exhibiting yourself, glory when you can forget
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Olivier was known for his physical daring and Richardson
had a gift for eccentric characterization, it was Gielgud who
elevated language. In his bearing as well as his speech, he was the
most lyrical of the three.
</P>
<P>
   He was ``the greatest classical actor of all time,'' Sheridan
Morley, Gielgud's authorized biographer, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An indefatigable worker, Gielgud acted until the very end of his
life. In his late 80s he appeared principally in films and on
television. His final performance on stage was in 1988 in Hugh
Whitemore's ``Best of Friends,'' in which he played Sir Sydney
Cockerell, the curator of the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge
University.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of tributes published on Gielgud's 80th
birthday, Sir Alec Guinness said, ``John Gielgud did more to
liberate the English theater from the fustian attitudes of the '20s
and early '30s than any other man and paved the way for what is
best in London today.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in his career, he achieved an even wider popularity for his
roles in films and won an Academy Award as best supporting actor
for playing the butler in the 1981 Dudley Moore comedy ``Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, his last major movie role was as Prospero in
``Prospero's Books,'' Peter Greenaway's 1991 version of ``The
Tempest,'' fulfilling a dream of his to perform that Shakespearean
role on film. That was the fifth time he played Prospero;
repeatedly he reinterpreted a character, returning again and again
to Romeo, Hamlet and other roles. His fifth King Lear was in a 1994
radio production, directed by Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in London on April 14, 1904, the son of Frank
Gielgud, a stockbroker, and the former Kate Terry-Lewis. The name
Gielgud is Lithuanian, he said, ``not Scottish, as many people
imagine.'' He was christened Arthur John, but was always known as
John, or to friends, Johnnie. One of four children, he came from a
privileged background.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When he was 17, he made his professional debut, of sorts, as a
walk-on in an Old Vic production of ``Henry V.'' He played the
herald and had one line: ``Here is the number of the slaughter'd
French.'' As he later said, he made such a bad impression that when
he subsequently had walk-ons in ``King Lear'' and ``Peer Gynt'' he
was given no lines to speak.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At 19, he played his first Romeo (opposite Gwen
Ffrangcon-Davies), and it was, he later wrote, a ``baptism by
fire.'' But within a year he was understudying Noel Coward in the
leading role in Coward's play ``The Vortex,'' and when the author
left the cast he replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet,'' which he played at the age of 25, was the first of
his plays to transfer to the West End. The English critic James
Agate said the Gielgud performance of Hamlet was ``the high water
mark of English Shakespearean acting in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 he brought his ``Hamlet'' to Broadway, with Jessica
Tandy as his Ophelia. It ran for 132 performances, a record for
``Hamlet'' on Broadway, until broken by Richard Burton in 1964, in
a production directed by Gielgud.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his first film, the silent ``Who Is the Man?'' in 1925, he
played a dope fiend, a role originally performed onstage by Sarah
Bernhardt. For many years, his cinematic work was sporadic; the
high points were Shakespearean, as Clarence in Olivier's ``Richard
III,'' as Cassius in Joseph Mankiewicz's 1952 version of ``Julius
Caesar'' and as King Henry IV in Orson Welles' ``Chimes at
Midnight.'' But his stage career continued unabated during and
after World War II and covered a wide range of classics, as he

the title role in the Peter Brook production of Seneca's
``Oedipus.''

   As Brook said: ``John is always in the present; he is modern in
his restless quest for truth and new meaning. He is also

DAVIS MAKES `TOUGH ON CRIME' A HALLMARK OF HIS ADMINISTRATION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It was the height of the bitterly fought
1998 campaign for governor of California, and Democrat Gray Davis
was trying hard to prove that he would be tougher on crime than the
Republican attorney general, Dan Lungren, running against him on a
record of two decades in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Davis insisted, he would be tougher on crime than
anybody. He would give judges discretion to sentence 14-year-olds
to death and consider supporting nonunanimous jury verdicts.
Indeed, he said in a televised debate, on issues of law and order,
he considered Singapore _ a country that executes drug offenders _
``a good starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   No one took that remark literally. But these days, Democratic
lawmakers say it sometimes seems as though Davis was only slightly
exaggerating. Halfway into his second year in office, the governor
is establishing himself as more of a conservative on criminal
justice issues than his Republican predecessors, or any other
elected official in California _ if not the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has essentially removed the incentive that makes
inmates model prisoners by refusing any recommendation the parole
board has made to grant a release. He has announced that any judge
he appoints should reflect his sentiments ``or resign.'' He has
blocked efforts to soften the state's ``three strikes'' law, which
can put someone in prison for life for stealing a bicycle if it is
their third felony conviction. He has vetoed a modest bill that
would grant the press greater access to inmates in the state's
closed-door prison system, which has been rocked in recent years by
corruption scandals, and has indicated that he will veto a similar
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the governor, who broke with the Democratic Party and
endorsed Proposition 21, the youth crime initiative that allows
14-year-olds convicted of felonies to be locked up in adult
prisons, has stocked the parole board and other posts with ex-law
enforcement officials who are considered hard-liners, very much
like his predecessor, Pete Wilson, had done. He has also sided with
police groups over civil rights organizations in refusing to
approve a bill that would track racial profiling, or the practice
of stopping motorists based on the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   California, already in a class by itself in terms of crime and
punishment because of its ``three strikes law,'' continues its lead
as one of the strictest states in the nation, if not the strictest,
on law and order, said Frank Zimring, director of the Earl Warren
Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, through a spokesman, has declined repeated requests, over
several weeks, for an interview, saying he was too busy. But the
governor has continually pointed to polls that give his approval
rating at more than 65 percent as proof that voters endorse his
stance on law and order. His spokesman, Michael Bustamante, says
that the governor campaigned as a centrist, made moderation a theme
of his first two State of the State speeches and told Democrats at
last year's state convention exactly how he planned to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Davis laid out how he intended to govern from the
center,'' Bustamante has said.
</P>
<P>
   As a political calculation, moving far right on crime and
punishment to show the electorate that he is a moderate Democrat is
a safe bet, political observers say. California is rather
conservative when it comes to crime issues, with voters
consistently approving initiatives that toughen laws against
offenders. In fact, California, which has the biggest court and
prison system in the country, led the prison-building boom, and
Davis is expanding it.
</P>
<P>
   But to the state's Democratic leaders, who were eager for change
after 16 years of Republican governors who made hard lines on law
and order the benchmarks of their administrations, the governor's
inflexibility on criminal justice issues _ largely seen by both his
supporters and critics as a political buffer against potential
challengers who might fault him for being soft on crime _ is
becoming the defining characteristic of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who authored the youth crime initiative that Davis has
endorsed, praised his successor as ``a pleasant surprise on the
stance he has taken on criminal justice, both in terms of his
appointments and his support of tough standards as well as
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's critics, almost all of them from within his own
party, say that in these good times, when the public is content and
the state coffers are flush, any governor would receive similar
ratings. In fact, they say, it is precisely during these times that
the governor can afford to show some independence rather than plod
along the politically safe path to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that has been somewhat surprising is the kind of
iron-clad approach he has,'' state Sen. Tom Hayden said.
``Absolutism is something that you expect from an ayatollah, but
it's surprising in a governor in a state that's very complex and
diverse. It's okay to lay down the rules, but there's been any
number of occasions when flexibility is called for. I've seen any
number of his appointees who share the same approach, but who
display routine flexibility. He's not bending to them. He's the
hard-liner in their ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   After a honeymoon year in which the governor's stance on crime
caused barely a ripple of attention (except for regular scoldings
in newspaper editorials), his stance has received greater scrutiny
and political disapproval in recent weeks. Or, as an editorial in
The Los Angeles Times put it, ``the honeymoon is over, brought to
an end partly by his prickly, controlling style and partly by his
aversion to taking political risk.''

</P>
<P>
   In March, the governor suffered his first major political defeat
when the state Senate blocked a conservative Republican from
serving another term as chairman on the state parole board because
of a federal court ruling that the board violated the Americans
with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   James Nielsen, a former three-term Republican state senator, had
been appointed to the board of prison terms, as the parole board is
called, by Wilson in 1991 and re-appointed in 1995. Davis
re-appointed him to fill out the remaining nine months of a term
last May and tried to extend it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate leader, John Burton, a Democrat from San
Francisco who is considered the most powerful legislator in
California, refused to hold a confirmation hearing on the
appointment. Burton, who has become increasingly vocal about his
disagreements with the governor over law and order, said that he
was outraged by a federal judge's ruling criticizing Nielsen (who
actively campaigned against Davis in 1998) as ``callous'' to the
rights of disabled prisoners seeking full access to parole
hearings. Some prisoners who used wheelchairs had to crawl up
stairs to get to the hearings and deaf prisoners who used sign
language had their hands shackled at hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Davis turned the political defeat into a victory by turning
around and appointing Nielsen to head the state youth parole board.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, in a recent interview, said that Davis' inflexibility
``because he thinks a Democrat becomes a moderate by being tough on
crime'' ignores the possibility that people can be ``redeemed.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to the high-profile parole case of Robert
Rosenkrantz, who has served 15 years in prison for second-degree
murder. In June 1985, Rosenkrantz, now 34, killed the man who told
his father at a high school graduation party that he was gay; he
was sentenced to 17 years to life. Prison officials say he is a
model inmate and numerous psychologists, as well as the
prosecutors, trial judge and detective who worked on the case all
recommended that he be released.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an appeals court took the unprecedented step of
ruling that the parole board had abused its discretion when it
found Rosenkrantz unsuitable for parole. The parole board had set a
release date for Rosenkrantz last year, but the governor had
stepped in and rejected the parole, saying Rosenkrantz ``was not
currently suitable'' for release.
</P>
<P>
   The case is jeopardizing another appointment Davis has
recommended to the parole board, because the appointee, Leonard
Munoz, a former Los Angeles police officer was part of the group
that rejected Rosenkrantz's bid for release.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the state Senate Public Safety Committee, John
Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San Jose, said that the parole board,
under the governor's edict to never approve the release of anyone
convicted of murder, ``have held Kafkaesque hearings in which
conclusions have nothing to do with the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, through a spokeswoman, Hilary McLean, has declined
to comment on the Rosenkrantz case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the governor has had to confront reporters who
want to know why he continues to reject a bill that would grant
journalists greater access to inmates. The bill, similar to one the
governor rejected last year, would restore the ability to conduct
interviews with inmates, a policy that was changed in 1995 by the
California Corrections Department after a series of scathing
articles in The Orange County Register.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Migden, a Democratic Assemblywoman who authored both
bills, said she thought it was important to keep the issue alive
even if the governor vetoed it again. Migden added that although
she was disappointed, she did not think the governor's stance on
law and order was out of line with the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he wants to get re-elected,'' she said, ``just as you
want to keep your job. Everybody wants to keep their job.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A politician, especially a Democrat, loses nothing in gaining a
reputation as an unyielding hard-liner on law and order, said
Zimring of the University of California. ``He loses nothing except
if someone were writing the next `Profiles in Courage,''' he said.
``I don't think Davis would make it into that. But politically?
There is no serious downside.''

   City of Light Makes a Claim to Music, Too
</P>
<P>
   Vienna, Austria, has long been called the City of Music, but
Nigel Simeone, a lecturer in the department of music at the
University of Wales in Bangor, makes a case for sharing the
distinction with Paris. His book ``Paris _ A Musical Gazetteer,''
scheduled to be published by Yale University Press on May 30,
suggests hundreds of sites associated with composers and performers
who have lived in Paris in the last 400 years, including such
non-Frenchmen as Chopin, Donizetti, Liszt, Mozart, Prokofiev,
Rossini, Stravinsky, Verdi and Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Landmarks include houses, monuments, graves, churches and
concert halls, with directions. The armchair traveler may
appreciate such arcane details as the fact that the Palais Garnier,
which houses the Opera, has 2,531 doors and 7,593 keys.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the book is devoted to brief biographies,
enumerating the places where composers and musicians lived or
stayed.
</P>
<P>
   The author outlines four separate walks, including a circular
walk from Les Invalides; the neighborhood of Passy; from the Opera
to Montmartre Cemetery; and from Place de l'Alma to the Etoile.
</P>
<P>
   Sites noted in the book include 12, place Vendome, Chopin's last
home; 4, avenue Carnot, Ravel's apartment; La Trinite, the church
where Messiaen was organist for 61 years; the Opera and the
Opera--Comique, the Theatre des Champs-Elysees, the Musee de la
Musique and various cemeteries, especially Pere-Lachaise and
Montmartre.
</P>
<P>
   The book costs $40 in hardcover, $18.95 in paperback. It can be
ordered by calling (800) 987-7323 or at www.yale.edu/yup.

   Roman Luxury in a Renovated Hotel
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its opulent furnishings and enviable location
just off the majestic Piazza del Popolo, Rome's recently reopened
Hotel de Russie vaunts a special attraction for a hotel in the
center of the city: a garden, three-quarters of an acre with
towering palms, magnolias, orange trees, rosebushes, a small grotto
and fountain.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel reopened last month after a two-year restoration.
Situated in an early 19th-century palazzo, it was for many years a
haunt of Russian dignitaries _ hence its name. It was also a
favorite among cultural celebrities: Picasso, Cocteau and
Stravinsky are among those who have signed the guest book.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II the palazzo was taken over by the Italian
military secret service and used as their center of operations. It
then became the headquarters of RAI, Italy's state television and
radio, until seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, part of the RF Hotels chain, was overhauled in the
$18 million renovation. There are 129 bedrooms including 27 suites,
each with two-line telephones, voice mail and satellite television.
The decor combines diverse styles: Baroque headboards coexist with
minimalist television stands and photographs of flowers by Robert
Mapplethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, the restaurant and bar service spills into the
garden, whose terraced slopes climb to join the Pincio Hill and the
Villa Borghese, Rome's liveliest public park. Next month a spa with
a Turkish bath, sauna, gym and beauty salon is set to open.
</P>
<P>
   Room prices start at $269 for a single, based on 2,190 lire to
the dollar, and go up to $1,461 for the Picasso suite, which has
lithographs by the artist. Prices do not include VAT or breakfast,
which ranges between $17 and $25 a person. Hotel de Russie, 9 Via

   A D-Day Museum Opens in New Orleans
</P>
<P>
   The historian Stephen E. Ambrose is not the first writer to
devote much of his career to a war. But Ambrose, the author of
``D-Day, June 6, 1944: the Climactic Battle of World War II,'' may
be the first to found a museum devoted to an amphibious invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The National D-Day Museum will open next month in a 19th-century
former brewery and an adjoining four-story glass-fronted pavilion
in the Warehouse District of downtown New Orleans.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans was the home of Higgins Industries, which built
landing craft that carried infantry platoons through rough seas
from ships to shore, allowing men and equipment to land on open
beaches, as they did in Normandy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the displays in the 70,500-square-foot museum will be a
reproduction of the boat designed by Andrew Higgins, the company
owner, whom General Eisenhower, in a conversation with Ambrose,
credited with winning the war. Other exhibits will include film
footage of the invasion at Normandy and battle artifacts from the
beaches, a vintage glider that is part of a scene recreating a
crash in a Normandy field, and a simulated hedgerow to show why
combat beyond the shore was so difficult. Nine oral history
stations will recount a variety of personal experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The National D-Day Museum, 945 Magazine St., at the corner of
Howard Avenue, (504) 527-6012, was developed at a cost of $25
million, a mix of federal, state and private funds. Ambrose
conceived of the project and played a major role in the
fund-raising. In 2001 the museum plans to open a section focusing
on the Pacific invasions.
</P>
<P>
   From June 2 to 9, the museum will be open only for those holding
preview tickets sold through the mail; it expects to open its doors
to walk-in visitors on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Tickets cost $7, $5 for ages 5
to 17.

   Newfoundland Celebrates the Vikings
</P>
<P>
   A thousand years ago, Leif Ericson and his crew of Vikings rowed
their longships to the rocky shores of Newfoundland, where they
founded the first European settlement of North America. This
summer, Newfoundland is host to ``Vikings! 1,000 Years,'' a
provincewide festival centered around L'Anse aux Meadows, the only
authenticated Norse settlement in North America.
</P>
<P>
   At the tip of Newfoundland's Northern Peninsula, a coastal
region famous for icebergs and seabird colonies, L'Anse aux Meadows
will welcome a flotilla of longships in a re-enactment of Ericson's
landing on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   At Norstead, a newly created ``port of trade'' near the remains
of the original sod and timber huts, visitors can watch Viking
battles and weddings and learn about ironworking and boat-building
from July 17 to Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the coast, the pristine fjords and volcanic
mountains of Gros Morne National Park look much as they did in
Viking times. Travelers can drive between Gros Morne and L'Anse aux
Meadows along the scenic Viking Trail, a seaside highway dotted
with tiny fishing villages.
</P>
<P>
   Cities and towns across Newfoundland will join the festivities
with a range of cultural events. The exhibition ``Full Circle:
First Contact'' will explore the interaction between the Viking
newcomers and the aboriginal people they called Skraelings (St.
John's Arts and Culture Centre, June 2 to Aug. 6; Corner Brook
Museum and Archives, Aug. 25 to Oct. 9). ``The Spiritual World of
the Vikings'' is the title of an exhibition July 16 to Aug. 17 at
the Resource Center for the Arts Gallery in St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Viking-style longships, including the Snorri, a U.S.-built
vessel that re-created Ericson's journey from Greenland to
Newfoundland in 1998, will also stop at ports throughout the
province in July.
</P>
<P>
   Maxxim Vacations of St. John's is offering 7- and 10-night
packages including flight, hotel and rental car. Tours from New
York or Boston start at $969 a person double occupancy.
Information: Maxxim Vacations, (800) 567-6666.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the ``Vikings! 1,000 Years'' celebration can be
found on the Tourism Newfoundland and Labrador Internet site,
www.gov.nf.ca/vikings, or by calling (800) 563-6353.

&HT;     BUSH VOWS TO MOVE U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush promised Monday that if
elected president he would station the U.S. ambassador to Israel in
the contested city of Jerusalem rather than await the outcome of
delicate Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made the commitment in remarks to 1,500 applauding
participants at a conference sponsored by the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an influential lobbying
organization founded in 1951 to support Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to address the organization
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's pledge that ``as soon as'' he takes office as president
he would ``begin the process of moving the United States ambassador
to the city Israel has chosen as its capital'' represents a break
with Clinton administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embassy is currently located in Tel Aviv, with only an
American consulate located in Jerusalem. Israel has designated
Jerusalem as its national capital and wants the U.S. embassy to be
moved to Jerusalem. Supporters of the Palestinian cause oppose
Israel's claim on Jerusalem, asserting that the divided city ought
to serve the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has helped broker a series of landmark
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements since 1993, says the U.S.
embassy should move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem only as part of
``final status'' peace negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority, representing Palestinians living on the West
Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``My support for Israel is not conditional on the outcome of the
peace process,'' Bush declared. Israel's five-decade-long ``special
relationship'' with the United States will continue during a Bush
presidency even if Israel's Arab ``adversaries cannot bring
themselves to make true peace with the Jewish state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign issued a statement that criticized Bush for
``irresponsibly'' attempting to ``politicize'' the Middle East
peace process. Bush seems ``confused about the Middle East peace
process,'' said Gore press secretary Chris Lehane, adding that Bush
is `` suffering from an antiquated analysis, reminiscent of the
Republican approach of the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance before the American Jewish lobbying
organization was part of a 36-hour whirlwind visit to the nation's
capital by the presumptive GOP presidential nominee who will cap
his visit with a rare Washington, D.C., news conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush initially planned to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Tuesday during Barak's scheduled visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak cancelled his plans to visit the United States and
meet with Clinton, Bush and Gore after fighting broke out amid the
planned withdrawal of Israeli security forces from a 22-year-old
security buffer zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Bush criticized the Clinton administration for
pressuring Israel to ``conform'' to U.S. timetables and blueprints
for peace and for an alleged ``attempt to take sides'' in Israeli's
most recent parliamentary elections to support Barak and his
pro-peace negotiations platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``America should not interfere in Israel's democratic process,''
Bush declared. ``And America will not interfere in Israeli
elections when I am president.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, campaigning on a pro-peace negotiations platform for the
Labor Party, defeated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
his Likud-led government last May 17 in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier remarks to the National Association of Realtors, Bush
hit upon contested domestic issues in his rivalry with Gore,
defending his proposal for a $483 billion federal income tax cut,
in part to help single mothers with two children who earn $22,000 a
year. Bush, decrying the tax code as a ``toll booth on the road to
the middle class,'' said such taxpayers are saddled with higher
rate of federal taxes on additional income than individuals earning
$220,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is conservative to cut taxes and it is
compassionate to trust people with their own money so she can save
and so she can dream and so she can build for her family,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to counter criticism leveled by Gore that his proposal
for a tax cut and Social Security rescue are ``risky,'' Bush
replied: ``They say it is risky to cut taxes. What is risky is
leaving unspent surpluses in Washington, D.C.''

SERVICE SLIPS, FARES BAFFLE ON BRITISH TRAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 28) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In old movies and some rose-tinted memories, rail
travel in Britain is an idyll of charm and predictability. Puffing
Billy steam trains chuff their way through bucolic villages.
Salt-of-the-earth families head with noisy cheer for outings in
third class. And, in first, silent toffs take shelter behind copies
of The Times of London to ignore one another.
</P>
<P>
   These days, rail travel in Britain boasts little charm and a lot
of unpredictability. The onetime gentility of first class has been
replaced by the competing cacophonies of cell phones ringing and
conversations that begin with sentences like: ``I can't hear you.
We're in a tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   In standard _ as the lower class is now called _ and sometimes
in first, rail travel is no more than a scrimmage to find a seat,
or face a journey standing. Arrival times are hit or miss; trains
sometimes do not move at all for lengthy periods.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most baffling aspect of British rail travel is
the price. Since the old British Rail was privatized in 1996, an
inefficient, unprofitable state monopoly has been replaced by
inefficient but generally profitable private operators that
preclude competition by maintaining regional monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Fare structures have become a tangle of elusive discounts and
incentives for early booking that have widened the gap between
standard and first class passengers _ but probably united them in
complaining about poor service. Last month, for instance, hundreds
of people on a train from London to Manchester became so incensed
when it broke down _ twice _ that they refused to leave the
stricken carriages to board other, equally crowded trains on the
same route. Instead, they staged a sit-in until their train was
towed into Manchester three hours late.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the public outcry that one British newspaper, The Sunday
Independent, has launched a campaign to protest what it calls the
sense that ``We the consumers often seem to have less and less
power and less and less choice.''
</P>
<P>
   For their parts, the rail companies, which still receive some
state subsidies in addition to large profits, insist that the
railways were in such bad shape under British Rail that years of
investment will be needed to lift them to a better standard. But
that doesn't explain the complexities of ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, one of the busiest routes between London and
Manchester, operated exclusively by Virgin Trains, a part of
Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which made its mark with cheap
trans-Atlantic flights. Here a traveler may pay anything from $32
(at $1.60 to the pound) round trip for a standard-class ticket
booked seven days in advance, to a staggering $345 for the top
first-class ticket, which actually exceeds some of Virgin's
round-trip fares between London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only complication. A discounted first-class
ticket for off-peak travel on this route can cost $96. And, on
weekends, people with ordinary standard-class tickets may upgrade
to first for a modest $8. Yet a flexible, standard-class ticket
without restrictions on when it may be used is $240.
</P>
<P>
   Rail groups offer five different special travel cards (not
counting the Britrail Flexipass discount cards that afford
Americans and other foreigners unlimited travel on the entire
system within a designated time frame). Thus, anyone under the age
of 26, or a full-time student, may pay $28.80 a year for a Young
Person's Railcard, offering a 34 percent discount on trains outside
peak commuting times. There's a similar card for the over-60s. But,
unlike in Germany and other European countries, there's no such
program for the 26-through-60-year-old business traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-Channel Eurostar trains and London's Underground are not
integrated into most of the above arrangements and require separate
booking.
</P>
<P>
   Technology offers a way through these thickets of confusion,
provided the traveler knows what to ask for and has Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   An American, for example, may contact Britrail on
www.britrail.com to buy a Flexipass discount card before leaving
the United States for a British vacation. The cards are available
only outside Britain and may be purchased from the Britrail Web
site, from travel agents or at (888) 422-2748 or (877) 677-1066.
Unlike the Classic Railpass, which is good for consecutive days of
travel, the Flexipass affords passengers the chance to choose 4, 8
or 15 days of travel within a two-month period. Prices range from a
four-day standard-class pass for $235 to a 15-day first-class pass
for $770.
</P>
<P>
   Britrail also offers a variety of links to other free sites,
such as www.railtrack.co.uk for British timetable information, and
www.raileurope.co.uk for Eurostar services to the continent.
Additionally, Virgin's Trainline (www.thetrainline.com) offers a
relatively simple system of planning journeys and purchasing
tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone travels with a laptop to make those
connections on the road. Britain's National Rail telephone service,
(44-345) 484950, is a useful source of information. The caller
speaks to a real person, but the real person does not always offer
full discount fare details unless asked specifically for the best
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   For travel in London _ with its bewildering mix of commuter
train, underground and bus services _ an equally useful service is
London Travel Information, (44-171) 222 1234, which offers
solutions to arcane questions such as: which is the best way to get
from Kentish Town to Wimbledon, say, or Shooter's Hill to Notting
Hill?
</P>
<P>
   However you travel, though, don't expect it to be cheap, and the
only real toffs you're likely to see will be those you glimpse in
chauffeured cars who abandoned the indignities of the railroads a
long time ago.

WORDS TO KAYAK BY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., New Zealand)   (For release Sunday, May 28)  
 (Editors: a 220 word information box appears at end of 2nd take)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hanging upside down, I'm suspended in a translucent green world.
As I hope for rescue, my hands stroke the sides of my kayak and I
hold my breath for what seems an eternity. I'm vaguely aware of the
pressure of the current sweeping me downstream.
</P>
<P>
   It briefly occurs to me that this is a weird way to travel.
</P>
<P>
   For almost four decades I've been hiking in the mountains that
surround California's Salmon River, but my path has always been
either perpendicular or parallel to the rushing waters that flow
from the snowfields in the wilderness high above. Now I'm learning
how to travel on the river itself.
</P>
<P>
   This is my first day at Otter Bar Lodge, which I had been told
was one of the nation's premier white-water kayaking schools, deep
in the Klamath National Forest along the Salmon. With my wife,
Leslie, and 12 other mostly novice paddlers, I have come to Otter
Bar for an intense week of river running and remarkably good food.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, I'm thinking that I might have done just
as well exploring water sports somewhere else (Maui comes to mind).
I've been tripped up and rolled over by an eddy line on the edge of
what some people might call a Class II rapid _ if they're being
kind. I'm bouncing downstream upside down and backward. A large
boulder raps me firmly on the back of my helmet to remind me of my
predicament. A moment later, there is another knock. The nose of my
instructor's boat is bumping my kayak's hull. I eagerly grasp it
and roll myself upright. Only my ego has been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Otter Bar clearly isn't for everyone. But if you are looking for
something more adventuresome than guided tours of Maya ruins or
Greyhound Bus-sized rafting trips on the other Salmon River (in
Idaho), this introduction to river kayaking offers an adrenalizing
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   We reach Otter Bar on a July evening more than two hours after
leaving the I-5 freeway near the California-Oregon border. If you
drive from San Francisco, it is an almost-eight hour excursion,
about as far away from California's growing urban sprawl as you can
get. You can also reach the lodge by flying to Eureka, Calif., and
being driven to the lodge in a van.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the Klamath National Forest, Otter Bar is tucked
between two of California's most remote mountain regions: the
Trinity Alps and Marble Mountains Wilderness Areas. These mountains
are the state's hidden jewels. Although not as high as the Sierras,
they are dotted with alpine lakes that feed the Salmon, Trinity and
Klamath Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkably rugged country, once the summer hunting and
fishing grounds for Native Americans and more recently a refuge for
loggers, gold miners and pot growers. The Klamath region today is
the least populated part of California.
</P>
<P>
   The pristine main lodge at Otter Bar, a sprawling ranch with a
comfortable dining room, a large living room with a stone fireplace
and four bedrooms, is set back from a bend in the river on an
immaculately manicured rolling lawn and is surrounded by smaller
cabins. The complex is adjacent to two ponds where aspiring
kayakers practice their rolls.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving, we settle in the single upstairs room, a kind of
crow's nest with a sweeping view of both the forest and the river.
The room is simple but comfortable, with lots of light and a shared
bathroom at the foot of the stairs. Other guests have rooms in the
lodge or in three cabins, each with their own bath.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner _ at which there was plenty of well-prepared food and
wine _ we meet Peter and Kristy Sturges, the lodge's owners. Peter,
the son of an old Rhode Island family, made his way to Northern
California in 1971 and became a fishing guide on the Klamath River.
Kristy grew up in Los Angeles and went to college in Santa Cruz.
After graduating, she took a teaching job in the nearby hamlet of
Sommes Bar.

   In 1981, Peter purchased the land on which he built Otter Bar
from the leader of a small religious cult who believed that the
land was the center of the earth. Originally, Otter Bar was to be a
back-country retreat featuring mountain biking, kayaking and
hiking, but it is so remote that it ultimately required a special
activity to attract visitors. ``It's so hard to get here that we
found that we needed a magnet to draw people here, and ultimately
that was kayaking,'' Peter said.
</P>
<P>
   Our class is mostly male and mostly in our 30s and 40s. Dale,
however, an environmental engineer from Crescent City, Calif., says
he is ``39 years and 297 months old.'' As the week goes on, he
impresses everyone with his endurance and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, we also meet our four instructors. The two senior
instructors, Peter and Creek, strike me as philosophical opposites
in the world of adventure sports.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kettering has an international reputation as a kayaker and
splits each year between a kayaking school in New Zealand and Otter
Bar. ``I never have winter,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhattan, Peter was a construction manager in the
United States when he left it behind more than a decade ago for a
life of kayaking and rock climbing. He brings a bit of the
precision of his past construction life to adventure sports.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast each morning, the day begins with a chalk talk
in front of the Otter Bar fireplace. One morning, Peter sketches
out a model for understanding risk in outdoor sports that he has
borrowed from a Canadian professor. He explains that for him, an
adventure is an activity with no certain outcome. Taken to extreme,
he adds, an adventure can end in a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to contemplate such ideas from the comfort of an easy
chair. For me, it becomes more problematic in the middle of a rapid
heading toward a large rock wall while trying to remember which
knee to use to keep my edge up.
</P>
<P>
   What our time at Otter Bar will help us discover is where the
boundaries are and how far out of our comfort zone we're willing to
push. ``Poor judgment leads to bad experience,'' he says, ``and bad
experience leads to good judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   If Peter exposes us to a sports philosophy, Creek (his last name
appears to have been lost in the 1960s), shares a very clear
philosophy of life. It is Creek's pronouncement on our first day
that sets the tone for me at Otter Bar. ``A perfect roll is the
equivalent of the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping,''
he intones.
</P>
<P>
   Creek is as close as you can come to being a true Jedi river
master. One morning, as we put our kayaks in the river directly in
front of the lodge, I notice that there is a small Deadhead sticker
on the back of Creek's kayaking helmet. He's an absolute joy _ a
philosopher as much as Peter is a technical master. ``This is about
life,'' Creek says shortly after we set out on the river one
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Discharged from the army in 1967, Creek became an activist and
then a Digger _ a member of a communal San Francisco group that
flowered in the Haight-Ashbury. From there, he moved to the edge of
the Trinity-Marble wilderness and joined the Black Bear commune
almost 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the original Black Bear members returned to the city,
but Creek stayed on. Now he drives a school bus for the tiny Forks
of Salmon school district and the local ambulance, and teaches
kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning begins with an incredible breakfast. French toast,
pancakes, German pancakes, souffles, and omelets all appear on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   After the first day, which we spend in a pond trying to learn to
roll, each morning we head to the river in small groups, each with
an instructor. Our basic equipment includes neoprene booties, a
life vest, a Capilene shirt, a waterproof nylon paddling jacket, a
helmet, nose plugs and a kayaking paddle. We would generally spend
the entire day with our initial group, having lunch together on the
river.
</P>
<P>
   An Eskimo roll is a crucial part of kayaking, making it possible
after being turned over by the current or a wave to right yourself
without leaving the boat. A roll is executed while underwater and
upside down. The kayaker leans forward, and with paddle out of the
water, sweeps the paddle across the surface of the water and snaps
the hips. If done correctly, the kayak rights itself elegantly.
</P>
<P>
   The Salmon River runs through a winding canyon. In some places,
there are steep rock walls hundreds of feet high. Elsewhere, the
forest comes right to the water's edge. There are deep pools that
separate rapids where the river plunges quickly. Otter Bar itself
is on a broad elbow in the river where it flows around a open
stretch of land surrounded by forest. The territory is striking and
wild.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, our fourth day, we go around two bends in the
river and after we enter a wide deep pool of slow-moving water,
it's time to roll. When my turn comes, I submerge into the
aquamarine world and examine my paddle blades above my head. I
position my blades and roll half way up and then splash! Back down.
One more time and this time, for reasons I can't fathom, I pop out
of the water and give a whoop.
</P>
<P>
   Finally! I've joined the fraternity. Unfortunately, it's hardly
a ``combat roll,'' made in the thick of a churning river.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the day has its ups and downs. We slide through the
Salmon, catching eddies, ferrying back and forth across rapids to
make sure we can hold our angles and performing the sweep-to-stern
draw paddle stroke, used to guide our boats precisely.
</P>
<P>
   The mantra that is drilled into us over and over again is
``angle, speed, edge,'' and when you do it right, your plastic boat
seems to disappear, in tune with the water.
</P>
<P>
   Our days are almost exclusively devoted to kayaking. We have one
afternoon off; some people go mountain biking, others hike in the
mountains near the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Evening activities usually involve reading and going immediately
to sleep. Everyone is exhausted after a day on the river. The
weather is warm but not hot. It can however, get really hot, which
makes being on the river wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Peter tells us on Thursday morning that we are now ``consciously
incompetent'' kayakers, but with practice we will become
``consciously competent.'' Of course, the art form is to become
``unconsciously competent.''
</P>
<P>
   The language of kayaking is almost as much fun as paddling
itself. We learn to ``peel out'' into rapids by holding a boat edge
up into the current and letting the river sweep us down stream.
Conversely, if you really want to show you have no river class at
all, you can ``slime'' your way into the current by just letting
your boat drift down stream.
</P>
<P>
   I manage to dump only once on Wednesday, when I trip across an
eddy line and Creek is there almost instantly to perform an Eskimo
rescue _ in which the upside-down kayaker grabs the rescuer's bow
and rights himself _ which is just as well, because I've managed to
lose my paddle.
</P>
<P>
   About six of the students excel, and head off after the fourth
day for an outing in Class III rapids. The rest of us manage, more
or less. Only one chooses to adopt an easier open kayak, which
takes away the fear of rolling over. Dale, the oldest of us, does
great, but never masters the roll.
</P>
<P>
   On our final day on the river, the Otter Bar vans rumble through
downtown Forks of Salmon, which is little more than a post office
and several buildings. A warm morning wind is blowing up the river
canyon. We put in just above the confluence of the North and South
Forks of the Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   It is our longest day on the river, lasting almost until 6 in
the evening with only a short lunch break. I'm getting it, but more
than once I find myself upside down watching the river rocks pass
underneath me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm teased because I haven't developed a correct boating
posture. I tend to lie back in my boat, Creek says, a little as if
I think I'm riding a Harley. To me, it seems more like a slouch
that would be appropriate for a roller-coaster ride. The correct
posture, of course, is to sit more upright.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, our last, I choose to spend another hour on
the pond hoping that my roll will become automatic. It doesn't. An
Eskimo roll in a kayak is one of the most counterintuitive things
I've ever attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Half the time it seems that the reptilian part of my brain takes
over and I end up halfway up gasping for air like a drowning fish.
But then every once in a while, as they say, you get shown the
light. It's the oddest feeling. There is no tension at all, just a
set of linked movements and then I'm right side up.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Peter is the philosopher. Kayakers have a way of
describing that feeling, he says. They call it ``grace under
pressure.'' GETING SPECIFIC:
</P>
<P>
   Otter Bar Lodge is in the Klamath National Forest, between the
Trinity Alps and the Marble Mountain Wilderness Areas in Northern
California. The lodge is on the banks of the Salmon River, about
halfway between Eureka, on the coast, and Yreka, inland on
Interstate 5.
</P>
<P>
   One can drive to Otter Bar; it's eight hours from San Francisco.
Those flying into the Arcata-Eureka Airport can be picked up for
the two-and-a-half-hour trip to the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   All Otter Bar kayaking courses, offered from April 18 through
Sept. 24, last seven days. Each session, limited to 14 students, is
focused for either advanced, intermediate, basic intermediate or
beginner levels.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of level, the cost is $1,690 a person, and includes
three meals a day, lodging and instruction. Children 10 to 14 can
attend two sessions, in July and August, for $650, or $750 if a
parent is not a student.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge provides kayaks, paddles and related gear. Students
must bring wetsuits, booties and other personal items. Wine is
served at dinner but there is no bar.

UNDATED: the riverbed.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ethic at Clearwater and at most other fly fishing schools is
``catch and release.'' This means no trout dinners. More important,
it means that the tiny hooks on the flies have no barbs, making it
imperative that one keep the line taut once a fish finds the end of
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My own experience was that the rare, hooked trout liked to swim
frantically in all directions. This generally prompted shouts from
the nearest guide about proper positioning, and I usually responded
to this instruction by joining my fish in a wild, thrashing dance
that must have looked something like Joe Cocker on speed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our guides would not have passed central casting. I had expected
weathered older men in goofy, fly-blown hats, spooning out fish
wisdom like cough syrup. Instead we got Mike Peters, an erstwhile
ski-racing coach from Mammoth, Calif., and Scott Saiki, a
27-year-old Hawaiian-born surfer and snowboarder whose command of
fly fishing technique was impressive even to his fellow guides.
Both were as patient as they were knowledgeable (and our second
visit to Clearwater last summer suggested that they were by no
means the exception). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clearwater's owner, Dick Galland, was a pioneer in some of the
early Outward Bound programs in Colorado and Texas, and one of his
earliest ventures in fishing instruction was a course he taught in
San Francisco in the late 1970s called Zen and the Art of Fly
Fishing. There is nothing too touchy-feely about Clearwater's
approach these days, but the emphasis remains clearly on how one
learns to fly-fish rather than on how many one might catch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This began to make clearer sense to me on the third day of our
``mastering'' class. We set off for a lower section of the Pit
River, a place that our guides referred to portentously as the Pit.
The fish beckoned to us from about 300 feet below the road, in
water that cut through a canyon spread with brilliant fall colors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wading slowly through the strong current, fighting to keep our
balance, it seemed that fly fishing had become a contact sport.
Then, wherever we stopped, it was as though we were meeting the
fish all over again, this time with the proper introductions. Our
nymphing began to look less awkward, and most of us actually caught
a few fish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon we found ourselves in an even more
spectacular setting, a spot along Hat Creek called Carbon Flats.
Iridescent grasses glowed in the clear water, and even from the
banks above we could see big silvery shapes working their way
lazily upstream. These trout, it turned out, were some of the most
famously coy fish in the west. But by then we were all casting well
enough to be satisfied just to stand in the slow current, soak in
the sun, and practice. When a few fish began to strike, we shared
the thrill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carbon was no less compelling when my father and I returned on
our second trip to Clearwater early last summer. This time we took
a couple of old friends who had been fly fishing for years, and the
four of us shared the wisdom and humor of two of the lodge's most
experienced guides, Tom Peppas and Art Teter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As spectacular as it had been to see this swatch of northern
California at the peak of its autumn foliage, June was even better.
The days were warm and long and we switched from neoprene waders to
lighter, more comfortable Gore-Tex versions from the Clearwater
rental shop. We returned to the Pit to do some more full-impact
nymphing, and then spent a quiet, enjoyable day learning to fish
from skiffs on the Fall River. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start I wished that I had put in a little
practice on my casting and knot-tying in the interim. But part of
the joy of fishing with guides was that we could brush up as we
went. If anything, Tom and Art were too accommodating, helping us
out of so many tangles (literal and figurative) that I was afraid
we weren't working hard enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, we felt that our mastering course had given us
enough confidence to go on fishing. The knots no longer felt so
complex, and we could start thinking about finer points like when
to change from one type of fly to another. But none of that seemed
to matter much when we went back to Carbon Flats. The setting was
again magnificent, and even on a Saturday morning, we had the
crystalline river all to ourselves. The trout, however, seemed to
see me coming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time, summoning all the delicacy I could, I cast again and
again to what seemed like a perfect spot, just ahead of my fat
prize. And the fish rose once again to taunt me, eating every bug
in sight save mine. (BBOX) &QR; 
How to be outsmarted by a trout &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ARRANGING AN EXPEDITION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For information about Clearwater Trout Tours, contact the
company at Clearwater, Box 90, Cassel, Calif. 96016 or call (415)
381-1173 (especially in the winter months) or (530) 335-5500. The
lodge is open for guided fishing from the beginning of the trout
season in late April until it ends in November. Classes usually run
from early May until October. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clearwater can be reached from San Francisco (just under six
hours by car), from Sacramento (about five hours) and from Reno
(slightly less than three hours). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLASSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The basic ``mastering'' class costs $995 a person for four
nights' lodging, all meals, equipment rental and instruction. There
are also intermediate and expert-level courses for both men and
women, as well as three courses designed for women, including a
women-only ``mastering'' course. Students must buy their own flies
and some of their own tackle and fishing licenses, at an added cost
of about $100 for the course. Tips to the lodge staff (10 percent
of meal and accommodation charges per guest) and the guides ($50 to
$90 per guest) are customary but optional. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Private guiding packages are available throughout the season for
$315 a person, including all meals and overnight lodging (double
occupancy). Intermediate and expert courses are taught every other
month. In winter the company frequently runs fishing tours to such
places as New Zealand's South Island, which is famous for its brown
trout, and Christmas Island in the south Pacific, a mecca for
bonefishing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EQUIPMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fly fishing is the gift that keeps on costing. Expect to pay in
the $500 range for a good rod and about $200 for a good reel. Not
to mention the vest, the waders (neoprene or Gore-Tex, depending on
the water temperature and the season), the wading boots and the
tackle. The lodge sells fine equipment in its store, but neither
the guides nor anyone else made any perceptible push to sell it.

TRACKING DOWN AN OUTFITTER FOR THE LEWIS-AND-CLARK WILDERNESS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A college classmate living in Arizona said he was going to
Montana in July to canoe along Lewis and Clark's route on the Upper
Missouri River. Though I had heard only part of the tape of Stephen
E. Ambrose's best-selling biography of Meriwether Lewis,
``Undaunted Courage,'' I was envious.
</P>
<P>
   My classmate is not alone in heading for the Lewis and Clark
wilderness: Lee V. Larson, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Land Management, which is responsible for the portion protected as
the Upper Missouri Wild and Scenic River, said that Ambrose's book
had stimulated trips on the 149-mile stretch. Whether the
Lewis-and-Clark boom is big enough to make the charts or not,
canoeing, rafting and kayaking are in a major surge.
</P>
<P>
   Try this: In Alaska there will be midnight rafting down the
Nenana River at the edge of Denali National Park from June 17 to
23. The moon will be full on the 16th, but no matter: close to the
North Pole at the solstice, the sun will be above the horizon for
nearly 21 hours. In the weird dusk, those on the rafts will glimpse
rapids and canyons on a two-hour trip before a very early breakfast
at the McKinley Chalet Resort along the Nenana.
</P>
<P>
   And Butterfield &AMP; Robinson of Toronto, a noted operator of
bicycling and walking trips with luxury accommodations, has a new
venture, Rivers and Oceans, which is offering six river and hiking
trips in remote parts of the Canadian Northwest. Some enter areas
where only this company has permission to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska midnight rafting is offered by the concession holder
at the park, Denali Park Resorts; Butterfield &AMP; Robinson is
likewise well established. But most people who want to kayak or
canoe far from home start from scratch in finding an outfitter
unless they have a friend's recommendation. Twice, I have called
upon outfitters and have not taken the trip because the employees
seemed vague on pick-up timing or I objected to something in the
documents I was to sign. More than is the case with a hotel or a
cruise, travelers entrust their lives to outfitters.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RIVER SURFING  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My college friend, Dr. Richard Oliver, is using a small
family-owned company in Anaconda, Mont., Upper Missouri River
Guides, that he learned about through its Web page,
www.uppermissouri.com. Glenn Monahan, the owner, is a retired
teacher who focuses on geology and elects to pitch some camps at
Lewis and Clark's historic campsites. As an additional
qualification, Monahan has written a guide to the river keyed to
the Bureau of Land Management maps.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is increasingly used to find small companies, but the
electronic woods are filled with rogues. In the case of outfitters
that operate in federal lands or waters, like Monahan's, there is
at least minimal protection: federal areas under the direction of
any of eight agencies, including the National Park Service, the
Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, have to get
permits annually.
</P>
<P>
   Larson of the Bureau of Land Management said: ``We have a fairly
comprehensive list of stipulations _ safety requirements, food
handling, credentials of the boatmen.'' Three broad goals are
involved, he said: safety of the participants, preservation of
public health and protection of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   A list of recreation areas on federal lands is available at
www.recreation.gov. This does not list operators, although camping
reservations links are provided.
</P>
<P>
   Most states license guides and outfitters, and shoppers should
ask companies if they have licenses. A small book, ``Top Rated
River Adventures: Canoeing, Kayaking and Rafting in North
America,'' (Picked-by-You Guides, $18.95, www.topguides.com) notes
any licensing requirements in the 14 states it includes, and gives
addresses for agencies or associations. (Entries in this book are
written by the outfitters themselves; the explanation of the
editor's selection method should be examined.)
</P>
<P>
   Some semiofficial agencies provide a list small enough to check
out by phone. In Fort Benton, Mont., at the first section of the
Wild and Scenic Upper Missouri, for example, the visitor center,
(406) 622-3864, maintains a list of only six river outfitters.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, experienced kayakers or canoers simply want to rent
boats in a remote state. Outfitters may have arrangements for this,
but of necessity the rental is probably also going to involve being
dropped off and picked up, so costs and schedules should be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all outfitters want participants to sign agreements
acknowledging the ``inherent dangers'' in their activities. The
Butterfield &AMP; Robinson Rivers and Oceans catalogue is blunt: ``All
of the trips in this brochure . . . entail risk of personal injury
or death from accident, illness or the conduct of other persons. .
. . Medical facilities may not be easily accessible and may not be
sophisticated.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WATCH FOR WAIVERS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, outfitters also ask clients to sign a waiver
asserting that the operator may not be sued even in the event of
gross negligence. Cindy Orlando, chief of concessions for the
National Park Service in Washington, said such waivers were legally
unenforceable and not consistent with National Park policy. She
said that permit holders had to carry liability insurance
appropriate for the type of activity and the number of clients, and
that where boating was involved, Coast Guard regulations applied.
</P>
<P>
   America Outdoors, an association of 500 outfitters with
headquarters in Knoxville, Tenn., maintains its membership list on
the Web at &QL; 
www.americaoutdoors.org. David L. Brown, the executive director,
said that its group has a code of ethics, but that when complaints
were received, it referred them to the agencies or states that
licensed the operators. Brown said his organization did not have a
standard waiver of liability and that most waivers used by
operators were created by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The group's membership list is free from (865) 558-3597, or
America Outdoors, P.O. Box 10847, Knoxville, Tenn. 37939. The Web
list is updated regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five operators organized as the Colorado River Outfitters
Association maintain their list at www.croa.org. John Rice,
president of the group, said members paid dues and subscribed to a
code of ethics. He said that there were 150 outfitters licensed by
the state, but that some were very small. A members' list leaflet
is available from Post Office Box 1662, Buena Vista, Colo. 81211.
</P>
<P>
   A more sophisticated step is represented by
www.adventureseek.com. This Web site of 230 operators includes many
big names, including Mountain Travel-Sobek, OARS and Backroads.
According to Jeff Kinder, a founder and vice president,
adventureseek works on the travel agent system: it gets a
commission for each booking. Client evaluations will be carried on
the site. Reservations can be made on line, by e-mail, on a
hypertext link or by phone.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of other adventure travel sites, but the
content is vast and the material overlaps. For example, Tim Gordon
of Gordons-guide in Fresno, Calif., says that www.gordonsguide.com,
has 800 outfitters listed, who pay an annual fee to be included.
Other big sites are www.away.com, &QL; 
www.greatoutdoors.com, www.iexplore.com; and www.gorp.com, which is
short for Great Outdoor Recreation Pages. Activities like camping,
canoeing or fishing can be searched on www.gorp, which seems to
include almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   The night whitewater trip in Alaska, offered this year for the
first time by Denali Park Resorts, a division of Aramark, will be
able to accommodate 32 people nightly in four rafts, with a guide
in each. The trip is described as quite wet; the 11-mile course
includes stretches labeled Splatter Rock and the Narrows. The
minimum age is 10, and the cost is $72 a person, including
breakfast. For reservations, call (800) 276-7234; for information,
visit www.denalinationalpark.com.
</P>
<P>
   The new Butterfield &AMP; Robinson trips, on largely uninhabited
water systems like the Klinaklini in British Columbia, require a
lot of logistics, including helicopter lifts. For all the rugged
surroundings, Butterfield &AMP; Robinson continues its emphasis on
supersoft nights: wine, tents you can stand in, towels and real
glasses are shipped ahead on cargo rafts, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers and Oceans Unlimited Expeditions merged with Butterfield
&AMP; Robinson to set up these new trips, which travel through
provincial parks and private lands that cannot accommodate vehicles
</P>
<P>
   The trips range from $2,350 to $4,950 a person for six nights.

<P>
   Upper Missouri River Guides can be reached at 315 West Fourth
St., Anaconda, Mont. 59711 and (406) 563-2770, as well as at
www.uppermissouri.com. The 46-mile, three-night White Cliffs Tour,
by canoe from Coal Banks to Judith Landing, Mont., costs $735 a
person, meals included.
</P>
<P>
   Float trips like this one on Class I rivers, with no rapids, are
safe enough for young children, but parents should discuss any
river trip carefully with an outfitter, and appraise their
children's tolerance for being confined for hours at a time in what
they may consider boring circumstances.

A MASTER OF THE STAGE IS GONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir John Gielgud, who died Sunday at 96, came to define the
great British Shakespearean actor, along with his contemporaries
Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson. Sir John, though, possessed
the most musical voice and the least histrionic delivery.
Self-possessed and ever dignified, he brought a mellifluous
sophistication but affable lightness to his work, whether it was
Lear's fool or Arthur's butler.
</P>
<P>
   He died peacefully at home in Buckinghamshire, according to
Laurence Evans, his former agent. It seemed as if Sir John might go
on forever as, unlike Olivier, his acting lost little gravity as he
aged. Even in Peter Greenaway's avant-garde 1991 film, ``Prospero's
Books,'' he stayed calm and authoritative while everyone ran amok
around him. It was in those Shakespearean roles _ Prospero, Hamlet,
Lear, in particular _ that he made his legend. There is regrettably
little of his Shakespearean work on film or tape, although he does
play second fiddle to (and victim of) Olivier in the ``Richard
III'' film and appeared with Marlon Brando in the movie of ``Julius
Caesar.'' He admired Brando and tried to lure him to the English
theater, but Brando wouldn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John put many of his best Shakespearean roles together into
a one-man show, ``The Ages of Man.'' Incoming Huntington Theatre
Company artistic director Nicholas Martin said, ``I saw `The Ages
of Man' six times. I followed him around the country, because I had
never seen acting that good, and I'm not sure I have since. He made
poetry as real as the most naturalistic acting, that was the metier
in which he expressed himself. He found humor and reality that no
one else could find in the text. Kenneth Branagh said that he was
the greatest actor from the neck up, but it was all there in his
heart and throat. As he got older he made poetry of anything _ like
his performance in `Arthur,' (in which he played Dudley Moore's
butler). He was arguably the greatest English-speaking actor of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John made his stage debut in 1921 as a herald in ``Henry V''
and made a name for himself four years later as Trofimov in
Chekhov's ``The Cherry Orchard.'' Among his acclaimed modern roles
were Harry in David Storey's ``Home'' and the poet Spooner in
Harold Pinter's ``No Man's Land'' in the 1970s. His last stage role
was Sir Sydney Cockerell in Hugh Whitemore's ``The Best of
Friends'' in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Bloom, who became a lifelong friend, said by telephone
from London on Monday that she first worked for him when she was 18
in ``The Lady's Not for Burning.'' (He was a director and producer
as well as an actor.) ``I don't think he was very keen on my
performance and thought he'd give me the sack . . . but he was very
warm and generous. When I played Cordelia, who only comes on at the
beginning and end, I would stand in the wings and just listen to
him as Lear. He had an aura and magnetism that was unmistakable
from his youth to the end and he could illuminate the text as if
you had never heard it before. As a young man he was physically
very beautiful with large blue eyes and an aquiline nose. I
appeared in `Ivanov' with him _ he had an extraordinary access to
emotion. He could cry at the same time, the same place every night
and it was absolutely genuine. It was a facility he had to be
deeply in touch with his emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran American Repertory Theatre actor Jeremy Geidt says he
was more influenced by Olivier and Guinness as a young British
actor at the Old Vic than by the more romantic Gielgud, but lists
Sir John ``as one of those actors you would walk across the street
to see even if he was in something bad.'' Geidt remembers ushering
him around Yale in the 1960s when he was appearing in a two-person
show with Irene Worth. ``He was incredibly modest and while he was
precise he was not pedantic.'' Asked if younger British and
American actors reacted against his style, Geidt said, ``In a way
he reacted against himself _ he knew that his voice and that high
emotional pitch could work against him and he was always trying to
find new ways. I think now if you hear some of the old recordings
they sound old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Gielgud summed up his career six years ago: ``I
managed to graduate from being a kind of romantic juvenile into an
adequate character actor.'' He was also known for being, as Martin
called him, ``an unwitting wit,'' i.e. for saying the first thing
that came into his head. He saw a friend at a wedding and warned,
``Don't go upstairs. The bride is hideous.'' After attending
Richard Burton's first Hamlet at the Old Vic, he said, ``I'll come
back and see it when you're better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John leaves no survivors.

have to be canceled because ballots were either damaged, lost or

workers dumped huge piles of ballot boxes in a jumble outside of
electoral offices. Officials at several Communal Electoral Offices,
known by the French acronym BEC, arrived at work Monday to discover

make its pilots speak English to the control towers _ lasted a mere
15 days. The airline had the idea that linguistic pride should be
put aside for safety considerations. Rather than having bilingual
airwaves that frequently confuse and infuriate pilots from other
countries, the goal was to have everyone speak English, as happens
at many European airports already. But it wasn't so easy. Last
month, the airline was forced to admit that it had underestimated
both the difficulties of such a conversion and the stubborn Gallic
pride that still persists among French pilots and air controllers.

 &HT;    DESPITE ACCUSATIONS OF VOTE TAMPERING, OBSERVERS REMAIN
CONFIDENT IN HAITI ELECTION
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ A day after Haiti held its first
relatively peaceful election in years, accusations flew over
reports of stolen ballot boxes and counting irregularities,
although international observers said they remained generally
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are receiving some reports of problems with the count and
we're looking into those,'' said Mary Durran, spokeswoman for the
210-member Organization of American States observer team. ``It's
too early to tell how serious the problems are and what effect they
may have on the outcome. But on the whole, we think the vote went
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday election was seen as crucial for poverty-stricken
Haiti, which hasn't had a functioning parliament since President
Rene Preval dissolved the body in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, thousands of paper ballots and cardboard ballot
boxes were found strewn in the streets near a downtown election
bureau office where the materials were stored overnight, prompting
a flurry of accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Durran said the ballots had already been counted, and observers
were investigating whether the count sheets that recorded the
totals had been turned in separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean the vote will have to be cancelled,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Observers were also checking into reports that armed men had
stolen ballot boxes at some of Haiti's rural polling places, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders quickly charged that the reports were
evidence that their opponents had tried to manipulate the election
results. They called for a special commission to investigate the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disaster,'' said Claude Mroumain, head of the
Generation 2004 Party and part of a five-party opposition coalition
known as ``Espace de Concertation,'' which translates roughly as
``Common Ground.'' ``This puts Haiti in a new crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have charged for months that supporters of
former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide were scheming to
manipulate the election. Aristide was not running, but his Lavalas
Family Party was backing hundreds of candidates for seats in
parliament and local government. Aristide is expected to run for
president this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote was postponed three times in the past six months,
and there were 15 political murders in the weeks leading up to the
election. Despite two murders on Sunday, the vote seemed free of
the widespread violence that had plagued Haiti's past elections.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands streamed to the polls, Voters in the impoverished
Caribbean nation chose candidates to fill some 7,500 posts
including 19 Senate seats, the entire 83-seat Chamber of Deputies
and 133 mayors.
</P>
<P>
   many anxious to cast a vote they hoped would set their troubled
country on the road to recovery. More than $500 million in
international aid to Haiti has been held up by its lack of a
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Durran said it would be several days before observers could make
a definitive statement about the election, but stressed that even
with the scattered reports of problems, it appeared the vast
majority of polling places had finished the process without
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 11,000 polling places in the country,
which should give you an idea of the scale,'' she said. ``Our
impression at this moment is that any problems affected only a
minority of stations.''

&HT;     LAZIO IS A LINK BETWEEN HOUSE CONSERVATIVES AND MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     and JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., navigated his way to
political prominence in Congress through a most unlikely route:
Getting Republican conservatives and moderates and even some
Democrats to like him.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the likely Republican to face Hillary Rodham Clinton for
the U.S. Senate seat in New York, spent seven years in the House
developing political antennae that won him praise from former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (on the right) and Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo (on the left).
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, 42, is ``light-hearted and very informal and relaxed,''
and prone to flipping coins in a back room of the House chamber to
ease tensions, said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not your typical stuffy senator,'' Portman said.
</P>
<P>
   Portman and Lazio have a running practical joke in which one of
them secretly slips an ugly green fruit from New Zealand to the
other, usually during public speaking engagements, to test the
other's grace under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The green fruit, which he says looks a little like a Kiwi fruit,
</P>
<P>
   has surfaced at unexpected times in Lazio's coat pocket and in a
box containing an award.
</P>
<P>
   After New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani cleared the way for
Lazio's Senate bid by withdrawing from the race last Friday,
Portman said Lazio told him: ``There will be plenty of
opportunities to get me with the green fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman said Lazio's sense of humor has helped him forge
connections between conservative and moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets along with everybody in the (Republican) conference,''
Portman said. ``He comes in with a self-deprecating joke and puts
people at ease. People know if they work with him, he's not going
to be hogging all the limelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically, Lazio is also well positioned to bridge
differences within his party. While he is a fiscal conservative and
was a supporter of the failed balanced budget amendment, he is more
moderate on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who grew up in West Islip, N.Y. and graduated from Vassar
College in 1980 and American University law school in 1983, started
his career in Congress in 1993 as an unpredictable maverick.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of 40 Republicans voting for President Clinton's
family medical leave measure, and he was one of 51 Republicans
voting with the Clinton administration to overturn the ``gag rule''
which had made it illegal for medical personnel at federally funded
family planning clinics to discuss abortion with patients.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, Lazio was voting with Clinton and the Democrats 72
percent of the time, according to a Congressional Quarterly study.
Partly because of the highly publicized 1993 incident on a Long
Island commuter train in which a gunman killed six and wounded 19,
Lazio voted with the Democrats to ban certain kinds of
semiautomatic weapons and for the ``Brady Bill,'' requiring a
five-day wait for handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   His pro-environmental voting record was enough for him to win
endorsement from the usually pro-Democratic Sierra Club and the
League of Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio opposed Clinton's efforts to lift the ban on gays in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   And although he favors maintaining the legal framework of
abortion contained in the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade
decision, he voted to continue the ban on federal funding for
abortion and also to ban late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995 with Republicans in control of Capitol Hill, Lazio was
voting 82 percent of the time with Gingrich. His pro-Clinton voting
that year dropped to 34 percent, according to Congressional
Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was there for Gingrich on important votes. He voted for
term limits for House members, the balanced budget constitutional
amendment,and school vouchers. In 1996, he voted to permit states
to bar illegal immigrants from public education.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in the public housing arena that Lazio made his mark
in the Gingrich revolution.
</P>
<P>
   With so-called Section 8 rental subsidies and 1.5 million units
of housing, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
underwrites the shelter needs of 3 million impoverished Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long viewed the HUD system as breeding
dependency on government, turning mostly urban public housing
projects into islands of entrenched poverty, crime and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995 with his appointment as chair of the House
Banking and Financial Services housing subcommittee, Lazio labored
to remake that system.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio picked his target issue with care. New York leads the
nation in public housing units with 196,949. Illinois is second
with 75,302 and California is third with 45,262.
</P>
<P>
   Three years of defeat, compromise and negotiation ultimately
ended with victory in 1998 when President Clinton signed the HUD
spending bill for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, public housing would no longer be the
reserve of the poorest of the poor. Units would be open to a
greater percentage of the working poor, those just a rung or two up
from the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio pushed for the mix, arguing that it would diminish the
sense of despair and isolation the poorest of the poor feel in huge
blocks of public housing apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income housing advocates countered that without public
housing, those at the lowest end of the poverty scale would have
nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the law required able-bodied, non-working adults in public
housing to perform eight hours of community service a month. But to
get the bill past Clinton's veto pen, Lazio and others on the GOP
negotiating team acceded to several Democratic wishes. Chief among
these was the inclusion of 90,000 new rental vouchers under the
Section 8 subsidy program.
</P>
<P>
   The final legislative product won praise from across the
political spectrum. ``This bill completely overhauls America's
indefensible current public housing system,'' said Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a change for the better,'' Cuomo said. ``It
fundamentally transforms public housing.''

   Remembering Shaw
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm planning a visit to George Bernard Shaw's estate in
Hertfordshire, England, and would like to know of events there
commemorating his death 50 years ago. _ Lauren Lindyet, Syracuse,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The 50th anniversary of Shaw's death is indeed being
recognized at his former home in the Hertfordshire village of Ayot
St. Lawrence, 26 miles north of London. Performances and
exhibitions are among the events.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's Corner, as the Edwardian house is known, was the
dramatist's home from 1906 to 1950. It is now a house museum
operated by the National Trust. Visitors can explore the rooms,
which remain as Shaw left them. Personal items, like a collection
of hats and walking sticks, as well as photographs of Shaw's
friends _ T.E. Lawrence, Gandhi and Alfred Hitchcock, among them _
are displayed throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   This year's anniversary events include a weekend of performances
on July 21 to 23. Two plays will be presented by the Shaw Society:
``Why She Would Not,'' which explores male and female relations,
and ``The Inca of Perusalem,'' a wry take on would-be world
dictators. Performances start at 6:30 p.m.; tickets are $15 (at a
rate of 67 pence to the dollar).
</P>
<P>
   On June 8 and Sept. 7, visitors may take guided walks around
Ayot St. Lawrence. The 90-minute itinerary is based on Shaw's
``Rhyming Guide,'' which is written in verse and illustrated by
Shaw. The tour includes visits to the village's 15th-century Old
Church and the 18th-century Ayot Manor. The cost is $7.45.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 29, a literary exhibition will include Shaw's
rehearsal copy of ``Pygmalion'' and his Nobel Prize certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's Corner is open Wednesday to Sunday from April 1 to Oct.
29. Admission is $2.60. Information: (44-1494) 755567.
</P>
<P>
   Another Side of Rio
</P>
<P>
   Q. A Brazilian friend suggests I visit the favelas near Rio de
Janeiro. Does anyone arrange trips from Rio? _ Rene Pattinger, New
York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are some 570 favelas surrounding Rio de Janeiro. These
culturally vibrant settlements, which started out as shantytowns
many years ago, have become popular destinations for travelers
interested in seeing how most urban Brazilians live. The favelas of
Rocinha and Vila Canoa are the focus of trips offered by three
local companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeep Tour takes small groups on daily, three-hour visits to
Rocinha, Brazil's largest favela, with 250,000 inhabitants, about
10 miles from Copacabana. After visiting with residents, the group
explores on foot the narrow streets lined with fanciful and often
brightly painted buildings. The commercial center includes a market
that sells produce and medicinal herbs.The favela's samba school,
where Carnival costumes and floats are made, is also on the
itinerary. Tours cost $30 a person. Information: (5521) 522-1620.
</P>
<P>
   Qualitours also offers daily tours to Rocinha. The visit begins
on the northern edge of the favela, where you can admire the view
of Sugar Loaf. The second stop is near the post office for an
optional motorcycle ride through the favela. A visit with a local
family and a trip to the market are also included. The price is $35

   Paris in Picasso's Day
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm interested in going to some of the sites in Paris that
are associated with Picasso. Do you know of places I might visit? _
Loretta Collins, Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A. When Pablo Picasso traveled to Paris for the 1900 Universal
Exhibition, he was immediately drawn to the city's creative
atmosphere and ended up spending some 40 years there.
Unfortunately, most of the places where he lived and worked are
either no longer standing or not open to the public. But you can,
of course, still stroll through the neighborhoods that he helped
make famous.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood of Montmartre, with its winding streets and
steep stairways, was Picasso's first home. What was known as the
Bateau--Lavoir (Laundry Barge) at 13, place Emile Goudeau, where
Picasso lived between 1904 and 1909, burned down in 1970, and has
been replaced by a concrete structure that now houses artists'
ateliers. The Bateau-Lavoir is where Gertrude Stein came to sit for
her portrait. Not far away, the Moulin de la Galette, a dance hall
depicted by Picasso in a painting of the same name, once stood at
79, rue Lepic beneath two windmills. It was destroyed in 1960 and
nothing on the site today tells of its existence, not even a
plaque. However, two other places that Picasso frequented _ the
cabaret known as Lapin Agile, at 22, rue des Saules, and the Mere
Catherine (the subject of a 1905 painting) at 6, place du Tertre _
are still in operation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, Picasso moved to an apartment at 11, boulevard de
Clichy. The area is still full of establishments from his era, like
the club Moulin Rouge, and the Wepler Brasserie at 14, place de
Clichy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912 he moved to Montparnasse. Today's Place Pablo Picasso,
at the crossroads of the Rue Vavin and the Boulevard du
Montparnasse, commemorates the time Picasso spent at various
addresses in the area, including 242, boulevard Raspail and 5 bis,
rue Schoelcher. He was a regular in two brasseries, which you can
still visit _ Closerie des Lilas, 171, boulevard du Montparnasse,
and La Rotonde, 105, boulevard du Montparnasse.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he lived at 7, rue des Grands Augustins, on
the Left Bank, around the corner from his newest lover, Dora Maar.
It was here that he painted ``Guernica.''
</P>
<P>
   The Picasso Museum in Paris is a wonderful place to view
paintings, sculptures, collages and ceramics from all of the
artist's major periods. The museum, in the 17th-century Hotel Sale
at 5, rue Thorigny, is open Wednesday through Monday from 9:30 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. and until 8 p.m. on Thursdays. Admission is $5.25 (at
a rate of 7.3 francs to the dollar), $3.40 for those 18 to 25.
Information: (33-1) 42.71.25.21.

   SCOTUS-CABLE-TV (Washington) _ Declaring for the first time that
programming on cable television is entitled to the highest level of
First Amendment protection, the Supreme Court on Monday struck down
a federal law that required many cable systems to limit sexually
explicit channels to the late-night hours. The vote was 5-4, with
an unusual lineup of justices that reflected differing views both
on the extent of the problem the 1996 law was passed to address _
the unwanted ``bleed'' of signals from cable channels that a
household had not ordered _ and on the degree of constitutional
``flexibility'' the government should receive in its effort to
shield children from exposure to graphic sexual images. By Linda

   CLINTON-LAW-LICENSE (Washington) _ An Arkansas disciplinary
committee recommended on Monday that President Clinton be disbarred
because of ``serious misconduct'' in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case. A majority of the panelists who met on Friday to
consider two complaints against the president found that he should
be disciplined for false testimony about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, the state Supreme Court said in releasing the
committee recommendation. The recommendation goes to a Pulaski
County Circuit Court judge in Little Rock for disbarment
proceedings. If the judge disbars Clinton, the president can appeal
to the state Supreme Court. By Don Van Natta.

   ISRAEL-LEBANON (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
long-planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon seemed to be suddenly
accelerating out of control Monday, with Hezbollah guerrillas
driving Israeli-allied militias out of border command posts and
northern Israeli residents fleeing south in fear of Hezbollah
rocket attacks. Israeli warplanes repeatedly bombed Hezbollah
followers moving into the border zone, killing five civilians and
wounding another 25, according to reports from Lebanon. Fearing
Hezbollah reprisals, the Israeli army ordered frontier residents
into bomb shelters, but hundreds chose instead to leave and drive
far out of Katyusha rocket range. By William A. Orme Jr.

   CALIF-DAVIS-JUSTICE (Sacramento, Calif.) _ In the 1998 campaign,
Gov. Gray Davis said he would be tougher on crime than his
Republican opponent. No one took that remark literally. But these
days, Democratic lawmakers say it sometimes seems as though Davis
was only slightly exaggerating. Halfway into his second year in
office, the governor is establishing himself as more of a
tight-fisted conservative on criminal justice issues than his
Republican predecessors, or any other elected official in
California _ if not the nation. The governor has essentially
removed the incentive that makes inmates model prisoners by
refusing any recommendation the parole board has made to grant a
release. He has announced that any judge he appoints should reflect
his sentiments ``or resign.'' He has blocked efforts to reform the
state's notorious ``three strikes'' law, which can put someone in
prison for life for stealing a bicycle if it is their third felony
conviction. And he has vetoed a modest bill that would grant the
press greater access to inmates in the state's notoriously
closed-door prison system, which has been rocked in recent years by
corruption scandals. By Evelyn Nieves. (1800 words)

   Much is riding on statement by DA today
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Torpy
</P>
<P>
   and Bill Rankin
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a four-year absence from trying a case, Fulton
County District Attorney Paul Howard today will stand before a jury
and a national audience to argue why football star Ray Lewis should
be found guilty of murder.
</P>
<P>
   In opening arguments, Howard and his team will contend that
Lewis and co-defendants Joseph Sweeting and Reginald Oakley, in
Atlanta for some Super Bowl partying, rushed from Lewis' rented
limousine and stabbed two Decatur men to death.
</P>
<P>
   Howard knows how much is riding today, knowing strong first
impressions often win cases. Defense attorneys can swoop in and win
over jurors with emotional closing arguments. Prosecutors must to
build a foundation with a solid opening and then legitimize their
case, witness by witness.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's case was bolstered Monday when Judge Alice D. Bonner
said the prosecution can use a statement Lewis gave police the
morning of the slayings. Howard is sure to contend Lewis lied to
protect himself and his codefendants.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had told Bonner that Lt. Michael Smith
threatened to ruin Lewis' career if he didn't speak to police. But
the judge ruled that Lewis' statement was freely and voluntarily
given.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy trial is anticipated and Howard must unveil a verbal
road map in the hour-long opening to show jurors where they are
being taken in the upcoming weeks. Howard, an accomplished trial
attorney, hasn't tried a case since being elected in 1996, having
played the role as administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest shining moment is the opening for the
prosecution,'' said former Cobb County District Attorney Tom
Charron, who now trains prosecutors at the National Advocacy Center
in Columbia, S.C. ``The opening argument is crucial, especially in
a lengthy case. At the beginning, jurors are the most open they are
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard's quick murder indictments of Lewis and two friends were
roundly derided as a ``rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lewis' high-priced legal team then quickly upped the ante by
filing a speedy-trial request, thereby telling Howard to prove his
case _ and prove it fast. The defense move pushed prosecutors into
a legal two-minute drill, forcing them to quickly gather evidence
and round up reluctant witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after less than four months of investigation, Fulton
prosecutors say they are ready to go. Observers say it's one of the
fastest murder cases on record.
</P>
<P>
   Former DeKalb County District Attorney Bob Wilson disagreed with
the quick indictment, saying Howard, who is up for re-election this
year, had to rush his investigation and trial preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Paul did a bang-up job; we'll find out soon,'' Wilson
said. ``The eyes of the public are on (Howard). If he doesn't win
against Ray Lewis, then in the eyes of the public, it's a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckhead stabbing case, in many ways, is a simple crime:
early-morning trash talk turns into deadly street brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a powder keg awaiting a spark. Both Lewis' party
and the victims' party were drinking. Both sides were armed. Both
had members with criminal records. Both even had a rapper who
reveled in tales of the mean streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the case becomes very complicated with witnesses at the
frenzied scene telling conflicting stories of men with knives and
punches thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in gobs of blood, three defendants, dozens more witnesses,
some DNA testing and things can get pretty confusing.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the defense hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys will sometimes trumpet sketchy and conflicting
witness testimony. Other times, they will try to paint the victims
_ Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar, in this case _ as troublemakers
who threatened the Lewis party into defending themselves. Lewis'
lawyers will portray him as a ``peacemaker'' who tried to defuse
the angry scene.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of the victims have bristled at the
defense accusations, saying they are being victimized again. Also,
they think the dead men have become forgotten by the blaring
celebrity of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't need to be OK for someone to have money and get
off; that's telling society it's OK to do these things,'' said
Kellye Smith, Lollar's fiance when he died. Smith and Lollar's
daughter, India, was born several weeks after her father was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing a sense of the victims will be important to
prosecutors Howard, Clint Rucker and Sheila Ross Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker, 35, and Finley, 29, two of Howard's young rising stars,
were set to try the case alone until recently when the DA stepped
in, he said, to even the odds against a cast of venerable defense
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Rucker, a former high school quarterback, switches
between head-on rushes and a gentle bedside manner.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is intense and direct. Prosecutors are generally in the
driver's seat in a criminal case, usually outgunning defenses with
time invested, investigation and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This case may be different. With the time crunch, the cast of
defense attorneys and the facts of the case _ no witnesses have
placed a knife in Lewis' hand _ anything can happen.

NOW'S THE TIME FOR NOBODY TO COME TO OUR NATION'S AID
</HEADLINE>
  By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressman Tony Schnell is a man completely without principle,
a witless, soulless, gutless good-for-nothing who came out of
nowhere and has done zero, zilch, zippo since. He's a nobody, a
nonentity, a big, fat goose-egg.
</P>
<P>
   Think I'm being harsh? Eh, I say these things about Tony because
I love the guy. In fact, I like the good-for-nothing galoot so
much, I'm now running his reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tony, I'm convinced, is a man for our times. A steady stream of
no-accounts and n'er-do-wells flows through our nation's capital,
but fellows like him don't drift by often. We need to grab his tie
and hold on.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you an example of Tony's abilities: He has never,
ever uttered a word on the floor of the House of Representatives,
but he's so feared by his colleagues that they recently passed a
bill designed to shut him up permanently. A guy like that, you just
gotta believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Schnell is an empty suit of the truest sort. He
doesn't exist. He's the creation of Internet pranksters.
</P>
<P>
   A year or so ago, messages began circulating on the Internet
warning computer users of a dastardly plan to charge them extra to
send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings came from a loquacious lady named Kate Turner,
obstensibly an assistant to Richard Stepp of the law firm of
Berger, Stepp and Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service, Kate said, is losing $230 million a
year in revenue because of the Internet, prompting a plan to offset
losses by imposing a 5-cent surcharge on each piece of e-mail sent.
</P>
<P>
   The author of this bill was none other than Congressman Tony
Schnell, a technological know-nothing who _ according to some
versions _ ``has even suggested a $20 to $40 per month surcharge on
all Internet service'' on top of the nickel-an-e-mail charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sit by and watch your freedoms erode away!'' Kate said.
``Send this e-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your
friends and relatives to say `No!' to Bill 602-P.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages spread rapidly and began to mutate. Some versions
identified Tony as a Republican in the U.S. House, while others
made him a liberal ``back-bencher'' in Canada. The Postal Service
began to share the blame with the Federal Communications
Commission. In time, Tony grew agitated with e-mail sapping profits
from long-distance telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. postmaster, the FCC and, for all I know, the Royal
Canadian Mounties all issued statements saying the proposal was
bogus, that nobody was talking about a special Internet tax, that
Tony Schnell was a nobody.
</P>
<P>
   But on Capitol Hill, the e-mail, letters and phone calls poured
in. ``The reality is that more people are communicating with us on
this than any other subject _ more than abortion, more than Elian,
more than gas prices,'' says Rep. Fred Upton, a real, live
Republican from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   So Upton wrote a bill to block the nonexistent Schnell's
nonexistent proposal. And it passed, despite some objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are considering today is a fabricated solution to an
imaginary problem,'' Rep. John Dingell, a real, live Democrat from
Michigan, intoned on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is not bogus,'' Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a real,
live Republican from Louisiana, retorted. ``There are real lawyers
litigating in the courts on this issue today.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC, for its part, politely called Upton's bill
``superfluous.'' Congress, a commission spokesman said, ``has a
right to legislate policy, and we respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, I'm not a big fan of Internet hoaxes. But the saga
of Tony Schnell is making me reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you like to see Congress finally do something to shore
up Social Security? Wouldn't you like to see campaign finance
reform?
</P>
<P>
   Why not get the fake Schnell to write fake bills proposing, say,
that the Social Security Administration send out cans of cat food
instead checks every other month, or that the Federal Elections
Commission issue candidates big boxes of Glad trash bags to carry
away campaign donations?
</P>
<P>
   Before you can say, ``You've got mail,'' real, live congressmen
will jump into action and stop Tony.
</P>
<P>
   I already have a slogan for his reelection: ``What the hell.
Maybe it's time for Schnell.''

 &HT;    Director's life remembered at Peabodys
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ A bittersweet mood hung over Monday's luncheon for
the 59th Peabody Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The elation of those winning what's widely considered to be
broadcast journalism's highest honor was undercut by the absence of
Barry Sherman, the University of Georgia professor and longtime
Peabody director who died from a sudden heart attack three weeks
ago at the age of 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still disbelieving Barry's dead,'' said Peabody board
member Ed Bark, echoing many of those at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
where the luncheon was held. ``I was walking by the hotel the other
night and saw someone who looked just like Barry _ it was like in
`The Sixth Sense.' I keep half expecting him to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes talked about the standard of excellence Sherman
set for the awards, which are administered annually by the UGA
school of journalism and mass communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering what is an appropriate tribute,'' Barnes told
an opulent, opera-house-style room packed with such notable
journalists and celebrities as Peter Jennings, Tom Wolfe and
Lorraine Bracco. ``But being here and seeing all of you here, what
(he would have wanted) is to continue this great work.''
</P>
<P>
   A film tribute of Sherman was shown. Later, Sheila Nevins, while
accepting a 15th Peabody for her work in original programming at
HBO, said that ``the Peabodys were Barry Sherman'' and that she now
thinks of her award as the ``George Foster Peabody Barry Sherman
Award.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta reporter Dale Russell accepted a Peabody for the
investigative team from WAGA-TV, which won for its series on racial
profiling by U.S. Customs agents at Hartsfield International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's humbling,'' Russell said of the event, which was hosted
by NBC's Matt Lauer. ``I look around this room and see Bud
Greenspan, Aaron Sorkin (creator of `West Wing') _ I wanted to ask
him who got shot in that last episode.''
</P>
<P>
   WAGA news director Budd McEntee called the Peabody ``the
ultimate'' and said that, at a time when many local news
organizations are cutting back on investigative reporting, winning
such an award helps keep a unit like the I-Team together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirms why we do what we do, and reaffirms the mission,''
he said. ``These awards confirm the need for more investigative
reporting.'' Other winners echoed that thought. Jennings said that
ABC's Peabody for its 24-hour, globe-trotting coverage of the new
millennium ``confirms for me Americans are interested in the rest
of the world.'' CBS's Bob Simon, who won for international
reporting, said, ``It's reassuring to know that if you do bad
things in Cincinnati or the Philippines or Bosnia, you're going to
wind up on this screen,'' referring to the film montage of winners
that preceded the awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we're here, when I see all these other
winners,'' said David Chase, creator of HBO's ``The Sopranos.'' ``I
never expected to be anywhere near this award, because of the
nature of our show.''
</P>
<P>
   Also winning were the producers of the PBS ``Frontline''
documentary ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County,'' which was the
highest rated show on GPTV last year and has been repeated numerous
times.
</P>
<P>
   Co-producer Rachel Dretzin, who spent five months in Georgia
filming teenagers whose widespread sexual activities led to a 1996
syphilis outbreak in suburban Atlanta, said she was ``astonished''
by the reaction to the film. Co-producer and husband Barak Goodman
added, ``We expected a certain amount of resistance, and we got
some of that. But the community also took responsibility for what
happened. We got them to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the memory of Sherman that continued throughout the
ceremony. As HBO's Nevins put it, ``Everybody's saying `Barry would
have liked this,' or `Barry would have liked that.' But you know
what Barry would have liked? He would have liked to be here.''

FRANCE TELECOM AND PARTNER NEGOTIATE FOR OLD POLISH PHONE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France Telecom and a Polish partner, Kulczyk Holding,
received exclusive rights Monday to negotiate the acquisition of a
35 percent stake in the former Polish phone monopoly,
Telekomunikacja Polska, for roughly $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ushers in what will presumably be the final steps in
the sale of Poland's state phone company to private investors, one
of the largest privatizations in the formerly Communist-ruled
Eastern Europe. The award brings with it the right to raise the
ownership stake to 51 percent by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also opens up Eastern Europe to France Telecom, which
has been struggling to regain momentum after stumbling badly this
year in its international expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is expected to accelerate, because France Telecom is
now also considered the front-runner to acquire Orange PLC,
Britain's third-largest cellular phone provider, which Vodafone
AirTouch agreed to sell when it reached a deal to acquire
Mannesmann of Germany in February.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Wasacz, the Polish treasury minister, told a news
conference in Warsaw that the deal provided Telekomunikacja Polska
with a partner capable of supplying ``the knowledge, know-how and
technology necessary to assume a leading market position.''
</P>
<P>
   If France Telecom and Kulczyk, which is controlled by the Polish
entrepreneur Jan Kulczyk, complete the negotiations by June, they
will have an option to acquire a further 16 percent later, giving
them full control of the Polish phone company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Polish treasury sold 15 percent of Telekomunikacja
Polska on the stock market and another 15 percent to company
employees. It plans to retain 45 percent of the company after the
full entry of France Telecom and Kulczyk.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a gamble for France Telecom because Telekomunikacja
Polska remains a lumbering dinosaur in a market rapidly shifting to
wireless phones and the Internet. Telekomunikacja, stymied for
decades by Poland's former Communist rulers, has 71,000 employees
and faces growing competition from an array of fresh and nimble
wireless phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Polish government, fearful of heavy job reductions and
eager to preserve a Polish national phone business, has shielded
the giant former monopoly by taking a slow path toward
deregulation, issuing licenses that allow only a single rival in
each of Poland's major cities and reserving lucrative long-distance
lines to Telekomunikacja Polska until 2002 and international
service until a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the government has assured Telekomunikacja Polska
one of four potentially lucrative licenses for a new generation of
wireless phones that will provide users with basic Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of government hesitation over the sale,
overhauling Telekomunikacja Polska has proceeded fitfully, and only
recently has it begun major investments to enhance its wireless and
Internet services. On Friday, it announced a $1 billion bond
offering to help accelerate the financing of those investments.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom's sole competitor in the bidding was the Italian
carrier, Telecom Italia. Michel Bon, the chief executive of France
Telecom, has been trying to hasten development of international
activities ever since France Telecom abandoned a partnership with
Deutsche Telekom, its German counterpart, early this year in a
venture known as Global One. Deutsche Telekom already owns a 51
percent share of the Hungarian phone company, Matav, and a 22
percent share in Poland's No. 2 cell phone provider.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Warsaw, Telekomunikacja Polska says it has roughly 9
million customers in a country of 42 million people. In the first
quarter, it said net profit rose 450 percent, to the equivalent of
$109 million, on a 25 percent revenue increase, to $760 million. &QL;

MADISON AVENUE MAKING A PUSH TO ADVERTISE ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLISON FASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The brain drain is becoming a serious problem for
Madison Avenue, top executives say, as talented professionals are
lured by other industries, particularly those involving the
Internet, and talented students eschew advertising for dot-coms,
Wall Street, consulting companies and even Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's low salaries for entry-level positions, the lack of
training programs, the notion that advertising is part of the old
economy or misperceptions about what advertising is, agencies and
trade organizations say they realize it's time to advertise
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we know how to do is market,'' said O. Burtch Drake,
president and chief executive at the American Association of
Advertising Agencies here, known as the Four A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for more and better talent coming into the business
has been around for two to three years now,'' he added. ``It's not
a shortage of people interested in advertising; we just want to be
sure we're getting the best-qualified people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the Advertising Educational Foundation here has
put up a Web site at www.AEF.com to answer questions from
prospective industry employees. The site, which was built by two
employees at Advanced Media Concepts here, Richard Goldstein and
Todd Rengel, is updated regularly. The two have since opened their
own Web agency, Animus Rex.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the ad industry clients embrace the new economy, so does
the industry itself,'' said David Bell, chairman of the foundation,
who is also chairman and chief executive at True North
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The site has been organized into different channels based on
recommendations from participants in the foundation's ambassador
program _ professionals who visit campuses to meet informally with
students studying or interested in studying advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can harness the power of the Web to be ubiquitous,'' said
Paula Alex, managing director at the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   One channel focuses specifically on college students, offering
detailed information about how agencies are organized, how to
prepare for a job interview and how to develop a portfolio of work
for those interested in becoming copywriters or art directors.
</P>
<P>
   That channel has links to other resources, like the online job
board at www.AAAAdvertisingJobs.com, set up by the Four A's by an
agency known as Little Tornadoes here. Job seekers can search the
directory of posted positions by agency, location or job function
and apply online. There were 463 jobs posted from 378 agency
offices as of last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Other channels at www.AEF.com offer more general information
about advertising's relationship to society and the economy. They
include a reference library with news articles on advertising and
advertising-related topics, an academic journal and a schedule of
coming events. There is also a channel offering ``interactive
dialogues'' with participants in the ambassador program, for online
question-and-answer sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was an advertising student about a year from now when
this puppy's really humming,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mason, executive vice president and human resources director
at BBDO Worldwide here, part of the Omnicom Group, described Web
sites like the foundation's as helpful because they were
representative of how students now obtain information.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to another industry problem _ retaining
employees who are pondering an exit _ Web sites are ``not the best
or only vehicle,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to have discussions and tell them how well they're doing,
and when they can move ahead,'' Mason said. ``Keep a person from
sitting there wondering what's happening with their career.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said he found it more difficult to retain employees with
about two years' experience than to find talented entry-level
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who see the dollar signs, we can't compete; we're
not going to even try,'' he added. ``Find out what else a person is
missing.''

 &HT;    Parity, stigma top mental health concerns
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Georgia, more than 1.6 million residents struggle with mental
illness, and one in every eight have severe conditions. To raise
awareness and help those in need, Rosalynn Carter has for more than
a decade hosted the annual Georgia Mental Health Forum, where 350
consumers and policy-makers gathered Monday at the Carter Center in
Atlanta to hear Surgeon General David Satcher talk via
teleconference about a historic 500-page report he released in
December on mental illness, compiled from more than 3,000 studies.
The report found that nearly half of all mentally ill Americans do
not seek treatment and, in many cases, face an enduring stigma, a
lack of services and inequity in insurance coverage. As many as
825,000 Georgians sought mental health treatment last year.
</P>
<P>
   Carter took a break from the forum to talk with Atlanta
Journal-Constitution medical writer Diane Lore about the report's
impact on mental health policy and care.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you assess the state of mental health care in this
country? Are people getting the treatment they need?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would say we would rank as ``poor'' ... or ``could do a lot
better.'' At least half of the people who need treatment still
don't get it. And many of those who are critically ill are
absolutely not getting the care they need. We still have a cycle of
people getting hospitalized for a short while and then landing back
on the street. We really need a plan where they can go to a
community center where they can get the care they need.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The confidentiality of mental health records has been a
concern for you. How is that issue developing nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's still pretty dismal. With managed care, we still have so
many people who can access records. We still have not made any
progress with a bill in Congress. And it's still a very important
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What changes would you like to see in mental health?
</P>
<P>
   A: The main, most important thing, at the national level is to
pass laws requiring parity in insurance. I think that would do the
greatest good in eliminating stigma. ... (A lot of people believe
that) if insurance covers (a condition), then it must be all right
to have. We've had 31 states pass parity laws, but often they are
very narrow in scope. Also, insurance often gets around true parity
by imposing higher co-payments and fewer days for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there things happening _ in Georgia or elsewhere _ that
you would hold up as models for diagnosis, treatment or prevention?
</P>
<P>
   A: I believe Skyland Trail, a treatment facility here in
Atlanta, is doing an excellent job, because its services are simply
state of the art. I also think (the companies) Community Friendship
and Project Interconnections, which deal with the homeless mentally
ill and are located here, are taking a good approach. The National
Alliance for the Mentally Ill is also supporting a program for the
seriously mentally ill called Program for Assertive Community
Treatment that is wonderful. It takes a holistic approach, which is
really a good way to go. Depression and anxiety screening days also
are helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the best changes to occur in the field of mental
health in the past 10 to 15 years?
</P>
<P>
   A: Scientific research and the development of the consumer
movement. Those two things have made a total difference in what's
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what would you change in mental health if you could?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would wipe out stigma. Stigma remains our greatest
challenge. There seems to be a little glimmer of hope, but we still
have a long way to go. Part of the reason is the misconception that
mental health is the result of a weak will or a moral defect or bad
parenting. Too often, families still believe that if (patients)
wanted to, they could just snap out of it. That's part of the
reason the surgeon general's report is so important _ it gives us a
real chance to have science back our case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What impact do you think the surgeon general's report will
have?
</P>
<P>
   A: The report gives us the scientific basis we need to make a
case to policymakers. It will help us tell the public the true
facts (about mental illness) instead of the myth and
misconceptions. It also calls attention to mental illness on a
national level, promoting awareness and helping people do away with
the stigma.

MICROSOFT SAYS U.S. SAW BREAKUP REMEDY AS HARMFUL 5 YEARS AGO 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft filed an unexpected brief with a federal
judge on Monday that quoted from a 5-year-old government legal
document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up
Microsoft would be ``against the public interest'' and ``dangerous
to the economy's welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was part of the public record from an older
antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first
suit against the company. The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the
final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the
judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who did not ask for another filing
from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice
Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28
asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the
remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
Then, 12 days later, Microsoft responded with its own proposal, a
short list of narrow restrictions on its behavior, while denouncing
the government's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a reply to
Microsoft's brief, saying the company's proposal was ``a cosmetic
remedy'' of no real worth. That was to have been the last filing.
But a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company
``believes it is appropriate for the company to have a reply to
focus on a few issues raised in the government's last brief.''
</P>
<P>
   While citing the old Justice Department documents, Microsoft
also repeated several legal arguments it had made previously. Among
them, the company stated that the courts have never broken up a
company for antitrust violations; all of the previous breakups have
been a result of settlements of antitrust suits. ``For all its
sophistry in discussing the case law, the government fails to
identify a single precedent for its radical breakup proposal,''
Microsoft wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not respond to Microsoft's filing,
but a lawyer who is close to the government's current case said it
``relies on statements made before Microsoft had engaged in the
numerous illegal acts found in the current case.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal document quoted in the Microsoft brief was taken from
the court record of the Justice Department's first antitrust suit
against Microsoft, which was resolved in 1995. That case was
settled when Microsoft accepted several behavioral restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law known as the Tunney Act, any settlement of an
antitrust suit must be put up for public comment before the judge
can decide whether to approve it. And much of the industry comment
then was disparaging; executives called the proposed settlement
inadequate and argued that Microsoft ought to be broken up instead.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to those public comments, the Justice Department
filed the brief Microsoft quoted Monday. In it the government's
economist then, Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, wrote that
breakup remedies ``designed to return the market to equilibrium''
are ``likely to be of the form of penalizing whatever firm happens
to be leading, Microsoft in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the lawyer who is close to the government's case
said, ``That Microsoft repeatedly violated the law after the
previous proceeding demonstrates why structural relief is necessary
now.''

 &HT;    Bedding maker's planned buyout folds
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of WestPoint Stevens fell as much as 36 percent Monday
after it called off a proposed management buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The West Point-based towel and bedding maker announced late
Friday that high financing costs killed a buyout offer of $22 a
share from a group led by Chairman Holcombe Green Jr. The news
pushed the stock to a 52-week low of $11.50 Monday. WestPoint
Stevens closed at $13.25, down $4.75.
</P>
<P>
   The canceled bid followed the Federal Reserve's move to raise
the overnight bank-lending rate by half a point to 6.5 percent, the
highest in nine years. That prompted a major investor to withdraw,
WestPoint Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it has abandoned its plan to seek a
buyout, merger or recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with its lagging stock, WestPoint Stevens hired Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. in November to help it consider options. Green's group
raised the price of the buyout from $21 a share in March after a
group of shareholders sued the company, charging that the original
offer undervalued their stock.
</P>
<P>
   On a conference call with investors Monday, WestPoint Stevens
said it will now look for acquisition candidates while it tries to
increase sales with new products, said Tim Ghriskey, senior
portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp.
</P>
<P>
   WestPoint Stevens said during the call that it plans to cut
costs by consolidating operations at some mills and by outsourcing
some of its manufacturing, said analyst Kenneth Smith of
Robinson-Humphrey Co.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an ambitious plan that requires a significant change
from the way they've been doing things,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a wait-and-see approach,'' said Smith, who
downgraded the shares to ``underperform'' from ``outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower demand for WestPoint Stevens' products have hurt sales and
profit in recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan analyst Noelle Grainger noted several risks for
current earnings estimates, such as a lack of management guidance
over the past six months, weak business trends and possible
downtime at mills.
</P>
<P>
   Grainger is holding estimates at $2.17 a share for the year but
cut the stock to ``market performer'' from ``long-term buy.''

TOYSMART.COM WILL CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toysmart Inc., a once-hot Internet retailer that captured the
eye _ and the money _ of the Walt Disney Co., said Monday that it
has instead closed its online doors after failing to drum up
investor support.
</P>
<P>
   The company collapsed Friday, after negotiations over new
funding crumbled and its board _ mostly Disney employees _ opted to
shut everything down. Toysmart.com will close its headquarters and
shop in Waltham, Mass., and a distribution center in Worcester,
Mass. Disney had invested $45 million in the company since August.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the retailer's 170 employees were packing boxes Monday,
and a few sadly joked that they might sell themselves on eBay's
auction site as a prepackaged team of high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best we could,'' Toysmart.com chief executive David
Lord said Monday. ``I'm trying the best I can to help our
employees. That's my only concern right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com had hoped to carve out a niche in a competitive
marketplace by offering safe, educational toys to parents. Its
now-closed Web site had offered plenty of plush Disney toys,
puzzles, and games _ but no plastic toy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the company stumbled as the ranks of Internet toy stores
grew, investors began snubbing dot-coms, and Disney reconsidered
its Internet strategy, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any one of those you can probably overcome,'' he said. ``But
all three _ it's too great a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Toysmart.com has been trying to reorganize
its operations to please Disney and other investors. It laid off 55
employees and mapped a new strategy of selling to businesses and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But after negotiations over the new investment broke down,
Toysmart.com's board voted to shutter the company. ``Everyone said,
`Well, that's it then,' '' Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lord purchased the online toy business he had developed
for the Holt family, which retained a 1 percent equity stake in
Toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lord, Toysmart.com grew to to approximately $10 million in
revenue in 1998, according to corporate research by Hoover's Inc.
The closely held retailer did not release its annual sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the graveyard of dot-com companies, Toysmart.com will not be
alone. Gift shop Violet.com and education toy retailer Red Rocket
have closed ther Web sites, and last week, British apparel merchant
Boo.com announced its imminent demise after failing to attract
much-needed investment.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Craftshop.com, an Internet arts and crafts retailer
backed by Andover-based CMGI Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in Wilmington, Del. The Connecticut retailer hopes to
sell off its assets, including its domain name and Web store.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the dot-com failures have only begun. In a
report last month, Forrester Research predicted that financial
performances, heavy ad spending, and competitive pressures will
drive most online retailers out of business by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of traditional stores are taking their spin at the
Internet game, (and) much more emphatically,'' said David
Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Internet-only merchants, retail giants like Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Toys ``R'' Us Inc. have such recognized names that
they do not have to dig deeply into their pockets to advertise
their Web stores.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester also sounded a warning after Disney paid $20 million
in August for a controlling stake in Toysmart.com. ``Beware of the
mouse's appetite,'' its analysts wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Disney, it was a good move,'' Cooperstein said. ``For
Toysmart.com, it was a dangerous game. It wasn't like this was a
venture capitalist in Silicon Valley willing to focus on potential.
Disney is very concerned when things don't pan out the way it
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Disney chief executive Michael Eisner said
his company's Internet holdings were in no danger of failing. ``Not
only will Disney's Internet assets survive, they will thrive,''
Eisner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But his company's Go.com Internet unit, which includes
Toysmart.com and Disney Online, is grappling with employee turnover
and slower-than-anticipated growth. And now, Toysmart.com is being
eliminated from Disney's Internet roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can't talk (as) to what Michael Eisner is speaking
of,'' said Lord, Toysmart.com's chief executive. ``I only know that
Go.com has stated that it's changing and is being redefined. I
guess we're a part of that.''

 &HT;    EarthLink to provide Internet access for Sprint
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EarthLink Inc. will be the Internet service provider for
Sprint's new high-speed wireless service, the companies announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based EarthLink, which merged several months ago with
MindSpring Enterprises, will provide the ``core set of Internet
tools'' that Sprint will use in providing broadband _ that is, the
connection capable of handling massive amounts of data rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of high-speed link is considered necessary for
transmitting video, audio and graphics, as well as for passing
along huge amounts of data without forcing an endless wait upon the
recipient. Sprint will provide the service by transmitting from a
tower to a 13.5-inch by 13.5-inch digital transceiver on the home
or business of the customer.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink already has software available for broadband provided
via cable modems and digital subscriber lines, and the deal with
Sprint adds a wireless option, said EarthLink spokesman Kurt Rahn.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink's technology is already in use in Phoenix as part of
Sprint's first trial of the wireless service, he said. Sprint says
the service allows Internet download speeds up to 5 mbps.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which owns 26.7 percent of EarthLink, plans to expand
the service to other cities later this year. In Atlanta, the
license for fixed wireless is owned by WorldCom, which has an
agreement to buy Sprint _ subject to regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, one of us will roll it out,'' said Sprint
spokesman Robert Hoskins. ``Atlanta is a pretty big market.''

SENATOR KERRY PLANS LEGISLATION TO NARROW `DIGITAL DIVIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Mass. _ Taking aim at the ``digital divide,'' US Senator
John F. Kerry of Massachusetts on Monday said he and Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York will introduce legislation offering
tax credits to phone and cable companies for rolling out
broadband-speed Internet access in poor and hard-to-serve rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a hearing on broadband availability, Kerry said he
and Moynihan, both Democrats, are working out the final details on
the tax credit plan and hope to file their bill, with Republican
support, no later than next week.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit, if adopted, might have its biggest impact in
rural parts of the South and West. But it could have at least some
impact in Massachusetts, where 151 of the 351 cities and towns _
mostly west of Worcester _ reported no cable modem or telephone
digital subscriber line offerings in a mid-April survey by the
quasi-public Massachusetts Technology Collaborative in Westborough.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's proposal came at the New England edition of a series of
national hearings sponsored by the Federal Communications
Commission and state utility regulators. The goal is to get ideas
on how to accelerate the development of broadband-speed Net access,
which by most estimates is currently available to fewer than 4
million American homes.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he, Moynihan and Senate Finance Committee staffers
have still to determine how much of a tax credit companies would
get. But he said in an interview, ``It will be generous. We want to
get it out there fast. I think there is definitely bipartisan
support for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said the proposed measure has raised a host of issues,
including questions of what level of subsidy phone companies should
get relative to cable companies and those offering fixed wireless
services for high-speed Net access. ``The minute you get into
starting talking about this credit, you get into all sorts of
issues of what is qualifying and what is not,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants at Monday's hearing at Middlesex Community
College said a plan like Kerry's could prove crucial to bringing
high-speed access to poor or rural parts of the country where big
carriers otherwise might have little incentive to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rural areas are going to get left out unless there are
some pretty strong incentives put into place by policymakers,''
said Tod A. Jacobs, a telecommunications strategist and managing
director with J.P. Morgan in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said cable companies can roll out 1.5-megabit-per-second
broadband access at a cost of about $143 per home in the 10 percent
of neighborhoods that are most densely settled. But he said the
service to sparsely populated areas easily can cost $1,000 per
subscriber, making it prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, barely 50 percent of customers of Bell Atlantic and
GTE, which are merging this summer, are in neighborhoods that are
both close enough to switching facilities and have average
household income of $75,000, the two conditions likeliest to
determine where phone companies offer DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Only 34 percent of customers meet such criteria in US West's
Rocky Mountain/High Plains service territory, and only 29 percent
in the Bell South region.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Gabel, a Newton-based professor at Queens College
in New York who is credited with some of the country's most
far-reaching studies of broadband access availability, cautioned
that Kerry's plan could be fiendishly complex to implement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just figuring out a way to do this for phone service was
difficult enough,'' Gabel said, referring to federal subsidies for
rural telephone service. Gabel cautioned that the complexities of
sorting out how much of a subsidy should be offered for cable
modems, various types of DSL and multiple fixed-wireless schemes,
in many geographies and markets, could be fatally complicated for
Congress to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   And Victor Glass, executive director of the National Exchange
Carrier Association, which represents 1,100 independent, mostly
rural phone companies, said all evidence shows that ``rural phone
companies are rapidly deploying a broadband network,'' taking
advantage of newer technologies that are cheaper and easier to use
in areas that may have only 10 or 20 phone lines per square mile.
At least 150 of his group's members are now offering the services.

 &HT;    Lewis jury satisfies prosecution, defense
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four of the jurors have sat on juries before. Another
two said they didn't think they were up to the daunting task. Yet,
here they are.
</P>
<P>
   A jury dominated by nine black women was chosen Monday to sit in
judgment over the Buckhead stabbings case. It is composed of 10
women and two men, 10 black people and two white people. Five
alternates also were selected for the anticipated monthlong trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors have had family members arrested and have been crime
victims. Some teach Sunday school, some watch Jerry Springer and
``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the prosecution and the defense both said they liked what
they got.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy with the jury,'' said David Wolfe, a lawyer
for defendant Reginald Oakley. ``It's a group of people that will
be attentive and responsive to their obligations under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he was pleased
to have all the women jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They provide the conscience and soul of this community,'' he
said. ``I couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard then added, ``I'd take 12 Martians to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   With his six strikes, Howard made sure at least some jurors
would not serve. These included a man who called half of Atlanta's
police officers ``dirty'' and a civil defense lawyer who provided
free legal help to indigent defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 chosen, all admitted to having heard something about
the case. The limo stood out the most. Other than that, things were
kind of sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed he might have did it or he might not,'' said
Juror 56 of water cooler discussions on the case. She has served on
a jury. It was a good experience, she said.
</P>
<P>
   During five days of jury selection, it became apparent that
jurors have big-city sensibilities, yet several retained a
small-town familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about her initial reaction to reports of the Buckhead
stabbings, Juror 31 shrugged and said: ``To me, it's nothing new.
There's always someone getting hurt. Same old same old.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 30-something woman, like many others on the original
pool, knows a fellow juror _ a finance account manager who was an
old high school chum. Out-of-town journalists were struck by how
many in the pool knew each other, demonstrating that no matter how
big the metro area gets, Atlanta, the city, remains small in many
respects.

THE HEAT ARE FEELING THE PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a time to be charitable. The Miami Heat are in pain, and
cannot be held fully responsible for the things they are saying.
</P>
<P>
   The problem starts with the top man, of course, and that means
president/coach/strongman Pat Riley, as opposed to owner Mickey
Arrison. Riley works his teams hard _ so hard, in fact, that the
players develop a sense of entitlement. The reasoning goes
something like this: No one works harder than us; therefore, we
deserve to win.
</P>
<P>
   And when, for the third straight year, it does not work out to
their satisfaction when playing the hated New York Knicks, both
coach and players search for a reason other than their own
fallibility. On Sunday, the convenient scapegoats were referees
Dick Bavetta, Danny Crawford, and Bennett Salvatore.
</P>
<P>
   New York shot 31 free throws to our 21 . . . Too many touch
fouls in the final four minutes . . . Some of our guys took it to
the hoop and couldn't get to the line . . . It shouldn't have been
a jump ball in the final 12 seconds; Zo should have been at the
line . . . Majerle never fouled Houston at the end of Game 6 . . .
Sprewell never called that final timeout . . . The league and NBC
both want New York and LA in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, as the monarch says in ``The
King And I.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley began his postgame press conference lamenting the
officiating. Tim Hardaway refused to speak of anything else,
basically accusing the officiating trio of cheating. Alonzo
Mourning insisted repeatedly that Miami was the better team and had
been done in by the referees. The truth is that the Heat are in
understandable denial.
</P>
<P>
   Both Games 6 and 7 were as much lost as they were won, and in
the sober light of some future day the coaching staff undoubtedly
will acknowledge Miami's culpability. Right now, the loss is too
painful to analyze properly, but when Riley &AMP; Co. examine the
evidence, they will admit the truth. They are too smart not to do
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so how did Miami twice snatch defeat from the jaws of
victory? Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   1. By losing an 18-point second-quarter lead in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   2. By scoring 25 points in the second half of Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   3. By Mourning allowing 37-year-old Patrick Ewing to slip inside
him for a crucial follow-up dunk with 1:57 remaining in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   4. By P.J. Brown fouling Chris Childs in the backcourt with 1:31
remaining in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   5. By Dan Majerle missing a technical foul shot in the second
quarter of Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   6. By allowing the Knicks _ the Knicks! _ to score 9 points in a
second-quarter stretch of 45 seconds in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   7. By failing to hold a 6-point lead with 4:44 remaining in Game
7.
</P>
<P>
   8. By the 6-9 Mourning's inability to exploit the 6-6 Larry
Johnson in the fourth period of Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   9. By no one other than Hardaway scoring a basket in the final
seven minutes of Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   10. By Mourning foolishly attempting to steal a Johnson entry
pass to Ewing, said transgression (carrying about 10 percent chance
of success) leading to an open Ewing dunk that became the winning
basket with 1:20 remaining in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   11. By Jamal Mashburn's combined 6-for-27 shooting in Games 6
and 7, culminating in his passing up the final shot he absolutely
should have taken and allowing his team's fate to be decided by sub
Clarence Weatherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   12. By Anthony Carter and Weatherspoon each missing makeable
shots that could have (a) tied and (b) won Games 6 and 7,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   13. By shooting a Shaq-like 11 for 21 from the foul line in Game
7.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, the refs beat 'em, all right.
</P>
<P>
   As much as it is ever possible to even use the term in a heated
matchup such as this, the sad reality is that Miami really did have
control of both Games 6 and 7 with four minutes to go. And Game 7
was at home. But whether New York found a way to win or Miami found
a way to lose _ take your pick, but I'm opting for the latter _ New
York took both games, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that New York deserved to win because the
Knicks had more people turning in big individual performances and
making more big plays when the last two games were being decided.
Ewing turned in 15-18 and 20-10 games and had the aforementioned
monster put-back in Game 6 and the winner in Game 7. Latrell
Sprewell had a huge 20-point first half in Game 7. Chris Childs
scored 13 consecutive New York points in a second-half stretch.
Most of all, the entire New York team played exemplary team defense
when it was most needed. Miami can squawk and moan from now till
the Twelfth of Never, but the record will show that in the final
combined 7:02 of Games 6 and 7, with 6-point leads at the
four-minute mark of each game, it was outscored, 16-3.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed, the Heat work hard for Riley. They might be right.
They really might be the hardest-working team in a league of
across-the-board hard workers. They work hard, and no one doubts
how badly they want to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have empathy for any coach, or any team, that puts as much
into it as they do,'' saluted New York coach Jeff Van Gundy, a
former Riley assistant and a great Riley admirer.
</P>
<P>
   That's very nice, but in the crucible of professional sport,
perceived virtue is not its own reward. You've got to make shots
and you've got to think clearly, too, and in the biggest moments of
Games 6 and 7, the Heat did neither.
</P>
<P>
   The brainwashed Heat are like members of a Doomsday Cult who are
slowly learning that their most cherished beliefs are just so much
propaganda. They were convinced they would win because they were
worthy. It's always hard to accept the fact that you lost because
you just weren't good enough.

 &HT;    Few in Baltimore believe Lewis is guilty
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Mother's Federal Hill Grille, in a gentrifying
section of red-brick row houses within walking distance of the
Baltimore Ravens shiny new stadium, no longer offers ``Free Ray
Lewis'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   They're sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The infamous black Navigator limousine, recently
blood-splattered and bullet-riddled, doesn't spend much time parked
on its lot out near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Its service is requested virtually every night.
</P>
<P>
   And talk-show fans in west Baltimore, where the row houses
aren't as tidy, can't escape the Ray Lewis-is-innocent drumbeat
coming from their radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it,'' says Larry Young, whose morning show on
WOLB-AM attracts nary an anti-Lewis caller, ``it's still the talk
in barber shops, beauty salons, restaurants, bus corners, cabs.
That's about all people are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lewis' murder trial set to start today in Atlanta, the
outpouring of interest and opinion in Baltimore soon could reach
Super Bowl-esque levels of fervor. The feeling here is that the
hometown hero needs to win the judicial equivalent of an away game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baltimore sees it as a big influencing factor in the way the
community is looked at,'' says architect Darryl Hawkins over eggs,
pancakes and coffee at the Federal Hill bar. ``Baltimore has enough
bad press right now, what with the incredible proliferation of
killings. And heroin is crippling Baltimore. This trial is just
another black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, like virtually everybody else interviewed across
Baltimore the past few days, says Lewis is guilty _ of bad
judgment. Few believe he actually stabbed Jacinth Baker or Richard
Lollar. ``Wrong place, wrong time, wrong crowd,'' is the phrase
repeated almost mantra-like throughout this port town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's guilty of stupidity and hanging out with stupid people,''
says Bill Richards, a semi-retiree sipping rum at the Windsor Inn
Crab House, a favorite Monday night haunt of Lewis and other
Ravens. ``You make $6 million a year, you ought to be hanging
around the yacht club or the country club.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulars at the Windsor Inn speak of Lewis mainly as a
football player, and what the most-feared middle linebacker in the
game means to a team _ and a town _ that hasn't had much sports
cheer of late.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is the city where Johnny Unitas and Cal Ripken
ruled. Talent-wise, Ray Lewis might be their equal. And with the
Colts finally replaced by the unproven Ravens, and with the Orioles
enduring yet another sorry season, fans here dream of football
glory this fall.
</P>
<P>
   John Ziemann compares Lewis to Unitas _ the ultimate Baltimore
compliment _ an old-school, nails-tough player who willingly signs
autographs. A guilty verdict would leave a gaping hole in the
Ravens' defense, Ziemann says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be a critical blow. It would not be a crucial
blow. It would be a great wound,'' says Ziemann, president of
Baltimore's Marching Ravens, the 400-member team band. ``But wounds
do heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some more easily than others. The Lewis saga highlights parts of
the city's underbelly that won't stay hidden. Beyond the glittering
new football and baseball stadia, the Inner Harbor's
revitalization, and its progressive political leadership, Baltimore
can't shake its drugs and crime. Roughly 115 people have been
murdered in Baltimore this year, a pace likely to continue the
city's decade-long, 300-plus-murder-a-year average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 29 or so (murders) ahead of the pace of last year,''
says Young, the radio host who served more than two decades in the
Maryland Legislature. ``We are at the point where enough is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's audience is predominantly black, and their opinions
mirror a recent Baltimore Sun poll. Fifty-four percent of black
people say Lewis is innocent; 33 percent of white people agree. Yet
only 5 percent of black people believe Lewis is guilty, compared to
30 percent of white people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks are probably saying, `He's one of ours,''' says
Hawkins, the black architect. ``Conversely, maybe whites are taking
the approach that he's another spoiled, rich, catered-to athlete
again in trouble.''

<P>
   ROISSY, France _ There is calm once again inside the control
towers here at Charles de Gaulle airport just outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Air France's bold decision to do what was once unthinkable _
make its pilots speak English to the control towers _ lasted a mere
15 days.
</P>
<P>
   The airline had the idea that linguistic pride should be put
aside for safety considerations. Rather than having bilingual
airwaves that frequently confuse and infuriate pilots from other
countries, the goal was to have everyone speak English, as happens
at many European airports already, as well as around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't so easy. Last month, the airline was forced to
admit that it had underestimated both the difficulties of such a
conversion and the stubborn Gallic pride that still persists among
French pilots and air controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Some refused to cooperate, and the debate about the subject so
dominated the workplace and the airwaves that everyone agreed no
safety benefit was gained. Airline officials say they will have to
meet, talk and persuade before they try it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking people to give up the language of Moliere,''
said Pierre Caussade, Air France's director of technical
operations, who made the original decision to convert to English
and still sounds a bit astonished at how it could have all gone so
wrong. ``What we speak in this business is codes and numbers and a
shorthand. The goal is not to abandon French but to have a common
technical language.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone saw it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Within days a group of air traffic controllers had organized
themselves in opposition. Even before the project began, the
headline on the newsletter for Alter, one of the smaller pilots
unions, was straightforward: ``English at Charles de Gaulle
airport? NO.'' Keep speaking French as before, the publication
urged.
</P>
<P>
   There are some people here wondering what Air France could have
been thinking. The defense of the French language is hardly a dead
passion. There are no fewer than 15 commissions at work in various
government ministries here looking for French words to match terms
_ usually English _ that threaten to creep into the French
language. The government regularly churns out new suggested French
terms to substitute for words like ``computer chip,'' ``hacker''
and ``startups.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from the frenetic, coffee-gulping, foot-tapping control
towers seen in disaster movies, the soundproof control stations at
Charles de Gaulle, the world's eighth-busiest airport, have a quiet
efficiency about them. Even when planes are leaving one minute
apart there is a sense of orderliness.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers watch the screens and the clouds, wearing
headphones and holding small black microphones close to their
mouths, doling out directions in short, virtually incomprehensible
sentences. Then they listen for the pilots to repeat the directions
and respond. At some times in the day, about 50 percent of what
they say is in English. At other times, only 20.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the controllers have accents in English that would make
Inspector Clouseau proud. In fact, almost everyone acknowledges
that the level of English among controllers and pilots was one of
the underlying problems with Air France's decision. A recent
article in Le Figaro said that American air controllers had
nicknamed the French flights the ``keskidi-flights'' a reference to
the often overheard French phrase ``Qu'est-ce qu'il dit?'' meaning,
What is he saying?
</P>
<P>
   Patrick LeNoel, an air controller who was at work recently
overseeing the traffic on the ground near the B, D and F terminals,
said that he agreed in principle with Air France's decision. But
the 15 days proved that even pilots and controllers who wanted to
go along with the decision often didn't have the skills yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``with English, the French still have a
ways to go. There were a lot of misunderstandings and some were
doing it and some were not and in some cases you would speak and
they just did not react. The whole thing wasn't well thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Air France did not try a countrywide conversion all at once.
Instead it tried to go slowly, asking its pilots to speak English
only at Roissy. But some complained that since they spoke English
outside of the country, French through the rest of France and then
English as they approached Europe's busiest airport the change was
too disorienting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, air traffic controllers complained that the pilots
just did not react when they were spoken to and that time was lost
repeating messages.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in charge of the air traffic at Charles de Gaulle say
there were no serious incidents in the 15 days that had anything to
do with Air France's new language policy. Nor do they believe that
there have been any accidents before because of the two-language
policy. Rather, safety analysts have always maintained that the
best policy is a one-language airport.
</P>
<P>
   Some pilots and controllers did not see it that way. ``There was
a small group whose reaction was very strong,'' said Jean-Pierre
Fremontel, the union representative for the largest air traffic
control union at Charles de Gaulle. ``This was a technical decision
but some were shocked by the symbolism of being asked to speak
English in their own country,'' he said. ``They did not like that
at all. The airline was looking at the problem far too narrowly,
overlooking the political significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon both pilot and air traffic control unions asked Air France
to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first few days, the controllers said, `OK, it's a
little difficult but getting better,' '' said Jean Jezequel, the
manager of air traffic control at the airport. ``But then we began
getting comments that it wasn't working at all. It was bringing
tension into the control room and the controllers were saying that
sometimes they just didn't know what language to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Jezequel and other officials say they will be studying all the
data they collected in the 15 days to take a look at what happened.
``It is a problem a lot less simple than it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Caussade from Air France says the airline will try again soon.
But Fremontel, the union official, said it wouldn't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were made to go backward and it's not easy to turn that
around,'' he said.

   By fighting mock battles with its siblings a lion cub masters
skills useful for bringing down zebras, and a child learns tactics
helpful for survival in a competitive human society.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, like cubs and children, also play, in more
sophisticated ways.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's ``thought experiments,'' for example, were a form of
intellectual play that helped him understand the implications of
relativity.
</P>
<P>
   When the celebrated popularizer of science Carl Sagan wrote his
novel ``Contact'' (in the movie adaptation of which Jodie Foster
travels almost instantly to a distant star system), Sagan needed to
consult his friend Kip Thorne for technical help.
</P>
<P>
   Thorne, a relativity expert at the California Institute of
Technology, undertook the playful task of analyzing Sagan's
fictional scheme for traveling through black holes and discovered a
fundamental error. Thorne went on to devise a remotely plausible
alternative travel plan exploiting ``worm holes'' instead of black
holes to communicate with distant parts of a spatially folded
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Thorne's idea not only lent credibility to Sagan's novel but
gave rise to a half dozen serious scientific papers dealing with
the possibility of time travel. It also played a major role in
Thorne's best-selling book for science fans called ``Black Holes
and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In similar spirit, an imaginative and irreverent English
scientist who writes under the pen name Daedalus has been tweaking
scientific orthodoxy in weekly columns for the last 36 years.
Daedalus' true identity is Dr. David E.H. Jones, a physical chemist
on the faculty of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in England.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of his fans _ scientists and scientifically
literate readers _102 of Daedalus' columns have been anthologized
by Oxford University Press as ``The Further Inventions of
Daedalus.'' (The first compilation of his columns, ``The Inventions
of Daedalus,'' was published by W.H. Freeman &AMP; Co. in 1982.)
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``court jester in the Palace of Science,''
Jones is an expert in chemical spectroscopy and other sober
subjects, and since 1988 his column has been published weekly by
the impeccably serious scientific journal Nature. But his research
projects have sometimes flown wildly off the track of mainstream
science.
</P>
<P>
   One of his achievements was the construction of a fraudulent
perpetual motion machine, for which he offered a small prize to
anyone able to deduce what made it keep turning with no evident
source of power.
</P>
<P>
   After some two decades the machine still operates, he said,
``and although one scientist came close to guessing its secret, no
one has won the prize.'' Perpetual motion, of course, is prohibited
by the second law of thermodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Another of his projects led to the discovery of arsenic in a
lock of Napoleon Bonaparte's hair and the consequent suspicion that
the French emperor had been poisoned by his English captors on the
island of St. Helena, where he spent his final days. It turned out,
however, that the wallpaper in Napoleon's St. Helena bedroom was
colored with an arsenic-based green dye, and poisonous arsenic
fumes were inadvertently released from the paper by mold. If
Napoleon died of poisoning, it was apparently accidental.
</P>
<P>
   One of Jones' engineering successes was the construction of a
bicycle so unstable as to be unridable. Useless as a vehicle, the
bicycle became the basis of an article by Jones in a publication of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called Bicycle Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bicycle itself is long gone,'' he said, ``but I am now
celebrated as the founder of modern bicycle theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Daedalus' ideas begin as jokes and end up as serious
contributions to science; some 21 percent of his published ideas
(which have appeared in New Scientist, The Guardian and Nature), he
says, have turned out to have at least some basis in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Jones regards Daedalus' crowning achievement as the prediction
of buckminsterfullerene _ a chemical family of hollow carbon
molecules. In its issue of Nov. 3, 1966, the British magazine New
Scientist published a column by Jnes titled ``Hollow Molecules''
that said: Daedalus ``has conceived the hollow molecule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' it continues, ``would be a closed spherical shell of a
sheet polymer like graphite, whose basic molecule is a flat sheet
of carbon atoms bonded hexagonally rather like chicken wire.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 two Americans and one Briton discovered just such a
molecule, giving birth to an entirely new branch of organic
chemistry. In 1996 the discoverers were awarded a Nobel Prize in
Chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are one or two columns in my new book likely to have
equally illustrious futures,'' Jones said, ``but I'm not going to
tell you which ones they are.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not likely to be the Daedalus nuclear pogo stick or the
black hole garbage disposal machine or a scheme, based on recent
findings in molecular biology, to hasten the sentences of prisoners
by aging them artificially.

&HT;     UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 2000 INCLUDES MAJOR REINSTALLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in trying out Windows 2000, but I don't want
to lose my Windows 98 setup. I understand you can dual-boot with
both operating systems, but would I have to reinstall all my
applications to get them to work in Windows 2000?
</P>
<P>
   A: This question comes up each time Microsoft releases a new
operating system, and the answer is always the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you will need to reinstall the programs you want to use
with both Windows 98 and 2000 in a dual-boot setup. This is because
Windows 2000 and Windows 98 do not share the same Registry, or
master configuration file, and in a sense do not know about each
other.
</P>
<P>
   When you install a Windows program, it tells the operating
system key information about itself by adding information to the
Registry. Often, the program cannot run without accessing the
information stored in the Registry.
</P>
<P>
   So long as both operating systems are using the File Allocation
Table, or FAT, file system, you can find the folders for your
applications in either Windows 98 and Windows 2000. But if you try
to click on a program installed in Windows 98 and you're running
Windows 2000, it probably won't launch. And if it does, it may
behave strangely.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to install the program again in Windows 2000, you
can usually use the same installation path. However, some Windows
programs have their configuration files separate from the Registry,
and these files may include pointers to the operating system. So,
when you reinstall under Windows 2000, it may change the pointers
so they no longer work with your Windows 98 setup.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you will probably need two installations in two separate
folders _ one for Windows 2000 and one for Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   The situation gets even more tricky if you want to use the High
Performance File System, or HPFS, available with Windows 2000.
Here, you will almost certainly need separate installations of all
software, and you will need to set Windows 2000 up in its own
partition on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is a business operating system, and given its
complexity, if you don't need it for business purposes, you may
want to stay away and keep your computing life simple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a notebook computer that is three years old. I
recently had to buy another battery because the old one began to
need charging more frequently. When I first got it, it would go
three hours without a charge. When I finally replaced it, it was
down to 30 minutes. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: Certain types of batteries develop what is known as the
``memory effect.'' It is caused by not letting the battery
completely discharge before you begin recharging it.
</P>
<P>
   The battery basically develops a kind of floor for recharging.
Let's say your battery started with three hours of life, but you
started charging it when it had used up only two. Do that enough,
and the battery will only take a two-hour charge. If you notice
it's only getting two hours and you decide to play it safe by
recharging after 90 minutes, that will become your new starting
point.
</P>
<P>
   This happens primarily to older nickel-cadmium batteries, and to
a lesser extent to nickel-metal-hydride batteries. More modern
lithium ion batteries are relatively resistant to it.
</P>
<P>
   There is some controversy as to whether the memory effect really
exists.
</P>
<P>
   But millions of home videocam owners who have replaced $80
batteries can attest to its existence!

 &HT;    Furcal's flair turns heads around NL
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He will begin seeing more curveballs now and feel a
greater effort to move him off the plate. And more pickoff attempts
once he reaches first, if just to make him feel the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The National League will get serious about Rafael Furcal now,
probing for what the Atlanta rookie cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   The answer thus far: not much.
</P>
<P>
   With the season one-quarter done, Furcal, at 19 the youngest
player in the major leagues, has gone from spring training curio to
Opening Day gamble to Rookie of the Year candidate. Batting .324 as
Atlanta opens a nine-game road trip tonight in Milwaukee, he is
vying to become just the third 19-year-old in major league history
to hit .300. The others were Mel Ott and Cesar Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, as flabbergasted as anyone, have seen nothing like
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one. Never,'' said first baseman Andres Galarraga, a
major-leaguer since 1985. ``The way he talks, the way he acts, the
way he plays, everything, he's like no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Furcal leads all major-league rookies in average, on-base
percentage (.405) and walks (15) and is tied with Anaheim rookie
Adam Kennedy with 10 stolen bases. Only Kennedy and Texas' Ruben
Mateo have more hits. While Houston catcher Mitch Meluskey has
superior power numbers among first-year NL players, Furcal has
reached base (51 times in 36 games) and scored more times (26 runs)
than any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never dealt with a kid who was so far advanced at such an
early age,'' said Pat Corrales, the dugout coach, who is in his
41st year of professional baseball. ``There was no doubt in his
mind from Day 1 that he could play here. He had to convince some
other people, but not in his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicappers breaking down candidates for Rookie of the Year
might place Furcal above Meluskey and San Francisco's Calvin Murray
among NL position players. But St. Louis left-hander Rick Ankiel
(3-2, 3.94) has drawn raves for his polish at just 20 years old; he
is 13 months older than Furcal. Cincinnati's Rob Bell, dealt away
by Atlanta two winters ago in the Bret Boone-Mike Remlinger deal,
is right behind Ankiel.
</P>
<P>
   If it is too early for such flattery, no one realizes it better
than Furcal, who gave a incredulous grin when someone suggested he
might win the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is too long,'' he said. ``I'm not thinking about
anything except right now. We have 120 more games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been thunderstruck by his early performance.
Skeptical early, hitting coach Merv Rettenmund concluded in spring
camp that Furcal swung a stronger bat from the left side, which
would make for a good platoon mix with shortstop Walt Weiss, who is
stronger from the right.
</P>
<P>
   But seven weeks have convinced Rettenmund that he was 100
percent wrong. Furcal is better right-handed (.333, with a .395
slugging percentage) than as a lefty (.300).
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up the other day and he was hitting .337,''
Rettenmund said. ``And I just said to myself, 'What if? What if he
wins a batting title?' I mean, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have a time when it goes bad. But I can't compare him
to another Rookie of the Year because I've never seen a 19-year-old
play in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing time for Weiss and Furcal has become a sensitive issue.
Manager Bobby Cox's original concern was to make sure Furcal got
his two or three starts a week at short or second. Now, the concern
is why keep such a force on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll work out,'' Cox said. ``I don't want to make any comment
until I talk to Walt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weiss understands the impact of a young player. He was the
AL Rookie of the Year in Oakland in 1988 when the Bash Brothers A's
came together. Weiss had played three years at North Carolina
andlus three seasons in the minors before winning the award at age
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's gotten better and better already,'' Weiss said.
``I've seen improvement from spring training to now. He brings a
dimension to the club that they haven't had in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Furcal's fielding is as uneven as advertised. After a 34-error
season at Class A, he has seven misplays already, fourth most among
NL shortstops. His .948 fielding percentage does not compare
favorably with the .971 rate from Weiss, Ozzie Guillen and Jose
Hernandez last year.
</P>
<P>
   The concensus in the organization is that Furcal's fielding will
improve steadily. However, no evidence exists that Furcal can
maintain this offensive pace. He hit just .293 against the Class A
Carolina last summer. Scouts have noted that he has proved himself
against the major league fastball and will even drive, not punch,
the outside pitch to the opposite field. The next response should
come in curves and sliders, as well as increased traffic inside.
Furcal has yet to be hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Writers' Association of America has voted just
three Atlanta players as its rookies of the year Earl Williams in
1971, Bob Horner in 1978 and David Justice in 1990. The Sporting
News, on a ballot of managers and coaches, voted its rookie award
to Chipper Jones in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   None of them hit .300. None of them was 19. And surely, none of
them stirred the ghost of Mel Ott.

ERITREA'S PERMANENT WAR

<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. _ With Ethiopian troops deep inside western
Eritrea, it would appear that Ethiopia had scored a decisive
victory in the perennial war between the two sides. But the chances
are small that the Ethiopian army will conquer Eritrea, or even
consolidate its hold over much of the country, where food and water
are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is often portrayed as another example of Africa's
hopelessness, but this is not even an African war per se. The
combatants are Semites whose languages bear similarity to Hebrew
and Arabic. Indeed, it is useful to see the Horn of Africa as a
fragment of the Middle East dislodged from Eurasia, where the style
of warfare, with tens of thousands of casualties, is more
reminiscent of, for example, the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, than
of any African conflicts of the past decade. While the Horn is
likely to disappear from the news, the dispute is likely to prove
intractable.
</P>
<P>
   And given the pattern of this 40-year-long conflict, it is
possible that the Eritreans will resort to what, arguably, they are
more accomplished at than any other people in the world: guerrilla
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, I saw Eritrean guerrillas build trench warrens
lined with slate and sandbags, convert cluster bomb parts into
flywheels for trucks, use the tips of spent tank shells for rain
gauges in their desert agricultural stations, make wash basins out
of exploded shells and store blood in refrigerators powered by wind
and solar energy. In a mountainside hut, I saw amputees operate an
Italian-made machine that produced 10,000 sanitary napkins per hour
for women guerrilla fighters at the front.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of conflict in their sun-blistered moonscape of a
country, Eritreans have raised their resourcefulness to levels
rarely seen elsewhere. While I watched guerrillas produce
chloroquin tablets to fight malaria, the pharmacist in charge told
me that he planned to start producing the materials from which
chloroquin is composed, ``since we can't depend on anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with satellite photographs, in the 1980s it was difficult
for Western intelligence agencies to estimate Eritrean battle loses
because of the Eritreans' ability to get their dead and wounded off
the field more quickly than all but the most sophisticated armies.
</P>
<P>
   War has engendered a monastic approach to existence in Eritrea,
where people have raised deprivation and absolute self-reliance to
the status of religion, even as both Orthodox Christianity and
Islam have been de-emphasized. In Eritrea, a nation of 4 million
people fighting one of 61.7 million, a situation of permanent siege
has led to the breakdown not only of religious barriers, but of
sexual ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a society where clitoridectomy and infibulation used to be
common, the culture of war has liberated women. A third of Eritrean
soldiers are female, and in the 1980s they accounted for 30 percent
of the casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea's evolved sense of equality is a paradoxical byproduct
of Italian colonialism. Whatever its faults, Italian occupation was
seen by Eritreans as preferable to feudalistic domination by
Ethiopia. Italy had occupied Eritrea by 1899, envisioning it as a
staging post for a future invasion of Ethiopia. So the Italians
built a rail and road network that, by uniting the territory,
facilitated the growth of Eritrean national consciousness, spanning
sectarian lines. When Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Eritreans
fought in large numbers on the Italian side.
</P>
<P>
   Today, what the outside world sees as an incomprehensible war
has a relentless logic to it. Ethiopia, dominated by ethnic Amharas
from around the capital of Addis Ababa, has often been less a
nation than an empire, with the Amharas ruling Tigreans, Oromos and
others. Consolidating that empire means subjugating the Eritreans,
who control access to the Red Sea, without which Ethiopia is a
land-locked state.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II defeat of the Italians led eventually to a U.N.
mandate that made Eritrea a semi-autonomous territory of Ethiopia.
But Emperor Haile Selassie never respected the autonomy agreement,
and a guerrilla movement grew up in Eritrea, with war breaking out
in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, after the overthrow of Selassie and the consolidation
of power in Ethiopia by a new Stalinist dictator, Mengistu Haile
Mariam, Tigreans, too, revolted. The 1980s saw Ethiopia embroiled
in war and famine. Fighting ended in the early 1990s with
Mengistu's departure and the emergence of the Tigreans as the new
rulers in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   While the Eritreans and Tigreans were uneasy allies against
Mengistu's regime in the 1980s, the Tigreans, once ensconced in the
Ethiopian capital, have adopted the imperialistic legacy of their
former enemies.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Addis Ababa is trying to consolidate its empire
in the Horn of Africa, much as Moscow is trying to do in Chechnya.
While the Ethiopians seem to be winning now, history shows that
there is no such thing as victory in the Horn of Africa. And like
the Iran-Iraq war, this is not a conflict that the West can do
anything about.

ART ON LOAN MUST BE PROTECTED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Gov. George Pataki's desk awaits a bill that most certainly
has been passed by the New York Legislature with the best of
intentions: it would enhance the authority of state law enforcement
officials to seize loaned art work that officials suspect of having
been stolen at some point.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal, as currently drafted, would be likely to
sabotage its stated goal, the recovery of stolen art, while dealing
an irreparable blow to New York's position as the world's leading
magnet for art and cultural exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was proposed by Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan
district attorney, after a conflict over ownership of two Egon
Schiele paintings that were on loan to the Museum of Modern Art in
1998. Morgenthau issued a subpoena requiring the museum to keep the
paintings, rather than returning them to the lenders, while the
courts considered a claim that they had been sold under coercion in
Europe during the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   The state Court of Appeals blocked Morgenthau's subpoena, citing
a 1968 law signed by Gov. Nelson Rockefeller that prohibited civil
seizure of internationally loaned art. The current legislation
would legalize this kind of seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau argues that New York should not be a haven for stolen
art. As an art lover, and more deeply, as the son of a Holocaust
survivor, I could not more passionately agree with that principle.
But this proposed amendment would backfire.
</P>
<P>
   It is already extremely difficult to persuade individuals and
institutions to lend art for exhibitions. The threat that works
might be seized if a prosecutor found some reason to suspect a
history of theft would be one more deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders virtually never have any awareness that their works of
art may have a tainted past; if they thought such a thing likely,
they would hardly be offering the art for a public exhibition. But
they still want to feel assured that their art is protected, and by
providing that protection, the Rockefeller-era law has invited art
from all sources to New York's museums, helping them become the
finest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   By discouraging owners from lending any art to New York, the
amendment would also aggravate the very problem it seeks to
address, by keeping more art away from public view, where stolen
works are most likely to be spotted.
</P>
<P>
   New York has a superb record in support of Holocaust victims and
their families who were victims of art confiscation. Several New
York museums have already released lists of paintings whose
Nazi-era provenance is not fully known. And recently, the state's
Holocaust Claims Processing Office, created by Pataki, was
influential in helping Austrian claimants recover a picture held in
a North Carolina museum.
</P>
<P>
   Civil procedures already exist to aid claimants. In the case
that sparked the current controversy, it turned out that one of the
seized Schiele paintings was in fact returned after the war to
relatives of the original owners; the other had been mistakenly
given to the family of a different victim. What possible role the
New York criminal justice system can usefully play in sorting out
complex ownership claims _ frequently multinational in nature _
remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a prosecutor wished to look into the facts of a
particular case, the authority to investigate crime is unaffected
by the existing law _ only the right to seize property is barred.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to gain, and much to lose, by beginning to
treat civil disputes over title as criminal matters. Theft of art
is an immoral act which, when coupled with the stealing from
Holocaust victims, cries out for redress. But in seeking redress
for such evil actions, we must take care not to enter into a
pattern of destructiveness with far-reaching, unintended
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders who generously make their art available to the public
should be protected and encouraged, not threatened, if we are to
address the claims of those with legitimate grievances while
preserving New York's cultural primacy.

VOLCKER TO HEAD PANEL PUSHING FOR INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long-range goal of worldwide accounting standards _ making
it possible for companies to compile one set of books for investors
everywhere _ may be moving closer to reality with new efforts to
put together an international standards setter that will be
accepted in both the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, was named
Monday to head a new body that will choose the people who will set
the international standards. The 14 people they select will replace
the current International Accounting Standards Committee, which has
been dominated by accounting professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The path to truly international accounting standards has been a
rocky one because standards vary widely among nations and because
the United States, with the most comprehensive standards and in
some ways the most restrictive, has been loath to accept
international standards.
</P>
<P>
   But that has begun to change as American regulators conclude
that their principal advantage in forcing large companies to comply
with American standards may lose its effectiveness in coming years.
That weapon is the requirement that any foreign company that wants
to list its stock on an American market, like the New York Stock
Exchange or Nasdaq, must reconcile its books to American accounting
rules.
</P>
<P>
   New technology has opened the possibility of international stock
markets that span national boundaries and make it easy for an
investor in the United States to buy shares in a foreign company
that has no American listing. ``I worry about what happens in an
electronic market, where the value of a listing is likely to be
diminished,'' Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a round of international negotiations last year and early
this year, Levitt held out the prospect of possible American
acceptance of international standards to prompt a change in the way
those standards are set. He became the chairman of a body that
chose Volcker and 16 other trustees of the new organization. The
trustees' job will be to pick the standard setters and then raise
money to keep the body in business.
</P>
<P>
   Volcker said he hoped the board would be appointed by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 people are to be chosen based on technical expertise,
without quotas on where they are from. At least five of them are to
have experience as practicing auditors and at least three are to
have been preparers of financial statements in jobs like chief
financial officers. At least three others are to have experience as
users of such statements, like investment analysts, and one is to
have an academic background. Of the 14, seven are to be liaisons
with national accounting standards bodies, including the Financial
Accounting Standards Board in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There is still no assurance that the SEC or any other country's
market regulator will accept international standards. But the
progress makes it more likely that the SEC will at least gradually
move toward international standards, possibly by certifying that
accounts that comply with a particular international standard will
not have to reconcile that part of the books with U.S. standards,
even though other parts must be so reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of accepting international standards in the United
States have shifted somewhat in recent years. A few years ago, much
of corporate America was pushing for it, in some cases because they
hoped international standards would be looser than American ones.
But some of that support has vanished because more recent
international standards have been more rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most emotional battles in accounting covers merger
accounting rules. The FASB, citing in part the fact that
international standards do not allow a form of merger accounting
known as pooling, has proposed ending that type of accounting. That
move, which would hurt reported profits of many companies that make
acquisitions, has touched off complaints to Congress and could lead
to legislation aimed at reversing the FASB decision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to Volcker, the other members of the trustees for
the International Accounting Standards Committee are: Roy Andersen,
chief executive of Liberty Life, a South African company; John H.
Biggs, the chairman of TIAA-CREF, an American money management
firm; Andrew Crockett, general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements; Roberto Teixeira Da Costa, former
chairman of the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios of Brazil; Guido A.
Ferrarini, a law professor at the University of Genoa in Italy; L.
Yves Fortier, chairman of Ogilvy Renault, a Canadian law firm;
Toshikatsu Fukuma, chief financial officer of Mitsui &AMP; Co.;

Reporting Council; Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of
Association Francaise des Enterprises Privees; Jens Roder, a senior
partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers; David S. Ruder, a former
chairman of the SEC; Kenneth H. Spencer, the chairman of the

OVERALL, SOX PITCHING A SUCCESS SO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give Ramon Martinez some regular work, some warmer weather, and
a healthy hamstring, and his days as the weak link in the Red Sox
rotation will be over, perhaps as soon as Friday night in Yankee
Stadium, when he begins a three-game set that will be bookended by
Martinez brothers, as Pedro goes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are a quarter of the way through the season, and despite
an early exit by Ramon the Elder in Sunday's 7-5 loss to Detroit _
he lasted just 2 1/3 innings after a 10-day layoff because of a
sore left leg _ the team's pitching has been the unqualified
success story of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Sox' offseason moves _ the trade for Carl Everett,
the signing of free agent lefty Jeff Fassero, the pickup of the
released Pete Schourek _ the best thing that happened to this team
may have been pitching coach Joe Kerrigan failing to persuade the
Cleveland Indians to hire him as their manager last November.
</P>
<P>
   Every season, general manager Dan Duquette places different
pitchers on Kerrigan's palette _ from Bret Saberhagen and Steve
Avery in '98 to Mark Portugal and Pat Rapp and Kent Mercker last
year to Schourek and Fassero this spring _ and every year Kerrigan
responds artfully. The bullpen has thrived, too, despite three
closers in three seasons: Tom Gordon in '98, Tim Wakefield last
season, and now Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about Pedro and four paupers, either, though it's a
comforting thought for the Sox that Pedro the Younger, who opens
the Toronto series Tuesday night, is 5-0 this season after a Boston
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got depth,'' Kerrigan said. ``That's what got us through
last year, and we've got depth again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to go through probably 15-18 pitchers. It
never fails. I don't like to think about it, but that's the reality
of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, 25 men threw at least one pitch for the Sox.
Thirteen made starts. Last season, the Sox opened with a rotation
of Pedro Martinez, Saberhagen, Rapp, Portugal, and Wakefield. This
season, it's Pedro and four other guys, and the results have been
splendid. There are two constants _ Martinez and Kerrigan _ that
have had as great an impact on the culture of this town as Keith
Lockhart, and without the baton.
</P>
<P>
   Let the rest of the baseball world play 17-16 games. Here, it's
Pitching First. And when has that ever been the case?
</P>
<P>
   In their first 40 games, the Sox have held the opposition to
three runs or fewer 23 times. That's more than any other team in
baseball, including the Maddux-Glavine-Millwood Braves (20) and the
Big Unit D-Backs (17). The Sox are 19-4 in those games, which
include two 1-0 losses and Saturday's 2-1 setback to the last-place
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Sox pitchers _ Pedro Martinez, Schourek, and Fassero _
rank among the AL top seven in earned run average. The Sox have
walked fewer batters than any other team in baseball, have allowed
fewer home runs, and are second in the American League in
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have done a heck of a job,'' manager Jimy Williams
said. ``They really have. They should feel pretty darn good about
themselves _ their deliveries, their execution, making pitches,
getting out in front of hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, after stepping into Kerrigan's garage and retooling his
mechanics, already has as many wins (5) as he had all of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each start, his old habits fade more and more,'' Kerrigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek hasn't had similar results, with just two wins in his
eight starts, but his .240 batting average against is second to
Pedro's .157 among Sox starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a power-oriented guy _ power fastball, power curve _
and he's made the transition to a ground ball-efficient pitcher,''
Kerrigan said. ``He's getting hitters early in the count on his
sinker, and his changeup now is almost as good as his curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give the credit to him, because he had to make
that transition in his own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose, whose next start will come on national TV Saturday
against the Yankees, weathered some early jolts and has pitched
well, both as a spot starter and out of the pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's adapted very well to the traditional fifth-man role,''
Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sox starters rank first in the league, the bullpen is
a close second to the Yankees. Kerrigan said the unsung hero of the
month is Wakefield. By starting the first game of a recent trip in
Baltimore, after throwing in relief the night before, Wakefield
kept the Sox from having to place Ramon Martinez on the DL and
spared the bullpen from being overtaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody in the big leagues who could have done
that,'' said Kerrigan. Those are words that Wakefield should take
to Duquette when he pushes for the Duke to pick up his contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck and Bryce Florie are getting closer to arriving as
reinforcements. Hipolito Pichardo, the former Royal, is also being
groomed for a relief role as he makes his way back from elbow and
shoulder injuries. Saberhagen insists he has enough comeback left
in him.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Kerrigan hauls out a mannequin to serve as a
batter during tutorials. He used one with a young Pedro Martinez in
Montreal, when he helped him perfect the art of pitching inside. He
calls his dummy the Pitcher's Pal.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Sox, there's no question who ranks as a pitcher's
best friend.

ANNAN BACKS INDEPENDENT ADVOCATES  WHO  PROTEST GLOBAL INEQUITIES  

</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan, hoping to
dissuade the disparate forces of anti-globalization from attacking
a United Nations millennium assembly in September, told a gathering
of independent groups Monday that the solution to global
inequalities is not confrontation but cooperation with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all members of the United Nations are hearing this message,
the leaders of some private organizations say. They see doors
closing, not opening, to them as they try to play a larger part in
United Nations work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever cause you champion, the cure does not lie in
protesting against globalization itself,'' Annan said on the
opening day of a weeklong Millennium Forum of independent groups _
some of which had supported attacks on the World Trade Organization
in Seattle and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in
Washington. ``The poor are poor not because of globalization, but
because of too little, because they are not part of it, because
they are excluded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Annan praised private agencies and advocacy groups for
their successful work on social issues and urged them to join hands
with him and with business leaders to rectify economic wrongs,
several independent groups were reporting that they are feeling a
backlash at the United Nations, as countries try to limit their
access and activities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years nongovernmental organizations _ known around the
world as NGOs _ have been increasingly active in and around the
United Nations in fields as diverse as international criminal law,
the environment, arms control and women's rights. They have often
framed issues succinctly and done the most successful lobbying for
world attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   These organizations gain access to the United Nations and its
meetings through a committee of the Economic and Social Council
which has the power to deny them accreditation. Most at risk are
human rights and democracy groups, which come under close scrutiny
from countries like China, India, Cuba and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the 19-member accrediting committee did not approve a
number of groups until more discussions could be held. Among those
in danger of losing access to United Nations events is Freedom
House, the New York-based research organization that measures
democracy and press freedom worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation against Freedom House, made by China with backing
from Cuba and Sudan, is on a technicality: that the organization
tricked the United Nations into providing unauthorized interpreter
services during the Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva to
translate for Chinese-speaking members of their delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese included members of Falun Gong and the China
Democracy Party, but they were not speaking for their own
organizations, which do not have access, but for Freedom House,
said Michael Goldfarb, spokesman for the organization. Translation
was provided freely by the United Nations, he added. ``We work by
the book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Karatnycky, president of Freedom House, called the move
against his organization ``an attempt by closed societies to muzzle
free comment and the open discussion of human rights violations at
the United Nations.'' The case will be taken up again in June by
the committee, whose members are Algeria, Bolivia, Chile, China,
Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Lebanon,
Pakistan, Romania, Russia, Senegal, Sudan, Turkey, Tunisia and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Weiss, president of the Hague Appeal for Peace Foundation,
said that groups interested in publicizing human rights abuses in
Chechnya are coming under similar pressure from Russia. She said
the current committee, which was elected in January to a four-year
term, appears to have a majority weighted against rights
organizations. The extent of this trend will be apparent next
month, when final decisions on access will be announced for a
number of groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. and governments can't survive without the partnership
of organized civil society,'' Weiss said, echoing Annan's remarks.
``We should be embraced, not feared.''

EVEN ON THE FIELD, ALL EYES ON PEDRO MARTINEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His initial stretching and maybe a rubdown and light bike work
out of the way, Pedro Martinez will take to the Fenway Park field
at 6:35 p.m. sharp Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He'll do a little more stretching and a little light jogging,
moving forward and backward. He'll play long toss deep on the
outfield grass for 5-7 minutes, starting close to the catcher and
then backing up until he is throwing the ball 200 to 250 feet, and
then moving back in again. Then it's into the bullpen for 48-54
warmup pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Introductions will be made over the PA system. The national
anthem will be performed. Martinez will take the mound against
Chris Carpenter and go after his eighth win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the 30,000-plus cramming the park, plus the hundreds of
thousands tuning in on NESN, won't be the only ones anticipating
Martinez Magic.
</P>
<P>
   It happens on the field and in the clubhouse, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pedro takes the mound, there's always that chance that
that's the day,'' said catcher Jason Varitek. ``He's that good of a
pitcher. That could be the day that he does something perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys on the field behind the Red Sox ace talk of wanting to
make the plays for every pitcher. They talk of knowing the hitters
and playing a couple of steps this way or a couple of steps that
way, depending on what the hitter does against a power pitcher, not
just what he does against Pedro. They talk of preparing just as
thoroughly, whether it's Pete Schourek on the mound or Pedro
Martinez. They talk of playing just as hard whether it's Ramon or
his little brother.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of a Pedro game as another day at the office.
Certainly, they want to make all the plays and play as hard for one
pitcher as they do for another. But business as usual?
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to miss anything, cause he's as exciting as you
can get,'' said first baseman Mike Stanley. ``He's the best in the
game of baseball right now and maybe in a long time. Any time could
be a special time. He's had 17 strikeouts before and he's certainly
capable of doing 20.''
</P>
<P>
   They watch. They learn. They anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan had a similar effect on the Texas Rangers when
Stanley was with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was another guy, too, where if you were on the bench, you
weren't up in the clubhouse messing around because any given night
could have been a special night,'' Stanley said. ``You're not
sitting there doing idle things like you would be on the bench if
someone else were pitching, because of the whole atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley saw several of Ryan's special moments. He caught a
no-hitter. He was on the bench for another. He saw Ryan take a few
more into the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement in the park spreads across the field. And it can
work a couple of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get excited and see him striking out 15 and just not
really be in the game and be more of a fan,'' said third baseman
John Valentin. ``That can happen. And it's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   It can get tough when Martinez is mowing down hitters and the
fielders don't have to field much, said Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played behind Roger (Clemens) and I played behind Pedro and
it's very similar,'' Valentin said. ``When Roger was here, he was
very dominant, and as a defensive player, when not too many balls
are hit to you, it's not a real good thing. When a ball is hit to
you, you can get caught on your heels a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek is one player who doesn't have that problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the exact opposite,'' said the catcher. ``His
ball is pretty explosive. His ball can take off on you in a
heartbeat and he's got a lot of movement on a lot of his pitches.
My level is probably raised even more when he's on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   It's important to be ready from the start, said shortstop Donnie
Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he's going to get around the plate and you know the
hitters are up there hacking because they don't want to fall behind
in the count because he has four dominant pitches,'' Sadler said.
``You have to be on your toes at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time Pedro walks out of the dugout, the crowd stirs, said
Stanley, ``and each time a guy gets two strikes, they start waving
the K cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity level rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not distracting. It elevates your awareness a little
bit,'' Stanley said. ``It elevates your excitement level to make a
great play if he needs it because you hate to waste any of his
starts. You want to go out there and get the big hit if you can, to
make the defensive play if the ball comes to you, to make sure you
keep him going.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has been going, and going, and going.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are mind-numbing. The one earned run in his last
four starts and 0.90 earned run average overall. The 7-1 record.
The 88 strikeouts and only 11 walks. The opponents' batting average
of .157.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates aren't the only ones who marvel at Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro is in the heart of his career,'' Stanley said. ``I
didn't see Nolan when he was younger. But I've talked to guys who
have been in the league, like a Harold Baines. I talked to him the
other day at first base and he's been in the league 20 years, maybe
21, and he hasn't seen anybody better.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just players.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan tries to enjoy it all as a
coach. As a fan. As a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he does for me and for the rest of the staff is he really
exposes holes of the hitters,'' Kerrigan said. ``Maybe it's some
way of getting a hitter out you haven't thought of, or you haven't
seen in the past. Whether it be something that the hitter chases in
the dirt or something he swings at high out of the strike zone, he
just exposes the hitters' weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a skill, the coach said, that Martinez keeps improving. He
studies batters against other Red Sox pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of physical skills and the intellect he
has,'' Kerrigan said. ``I think that's something he has learned and
gotten smarter with every year. He really pays attention to
previous swings and previous at-bats and what he does with a guy.
He'll get a certain hitter out one way _ he might throw him four
straight curveballs and then the next at-bat he might not see a
curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach differs from that of Atlanta's Greg Maddux,
another Kerrigan favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maddux will get you out a certain way all the time until he
sees that you can make an adjustment to that, and then Maddux will
make an adjustment,'' Kerrigan said. ``If you can't hit a
particular spot or particular pitch or particular speed he's going
to go to that until you prove otherwise. Pedro doesn't like a
hitter to get a read off him.''
</P>
<P>
   Different folks. Different strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Same results.
</P>
<P>
   And fun to watch. From the living room. The stands. The dugout.
The field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit there and you're in awe watching this guy,'' Kerrigan

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Supreme Court changed the rules of
worship at Judaism's most revered shrine when it ruled Monday that
women can have group services at the Western Wall, can wear prayer
shawls and read aloud from Torah scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   A legal ban on women's services at the shrine, in keeping with
strict Orthodox Jewish tradition, was challenged in court by Women
of the Wall, a group that demanded the right to have services in
the same way men worship at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules in force at the Western Wall, which follow
Orthodox custom, men and women worship in separate areas divided by
a partition, and only the men have services while the women worship
individually. Monday the court gave the government six months to
arrange for group services for women at the shrine, complete with
prayer shawls and chanting from the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come out of the Middle Ages,'' said Anat Hoffman, a
leader of the women's group. ``Today the Western Wall became part
of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was roundly condemned by Orthodox officials and
rabbis, who called the decision a divisive assault on Jewish law
and practice at Judaism's most sacred shrine. It was the latest in
a series of Supreme Court rulings on matters of religion and state
that have been criticized by Orthodox leaders as anti-religious.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy religious affairs minister, Yigal Bibi, a member of
the National Religious Party, said the Supreme Court had issued yet
another ruling that would ``nullify the state of Israel as a Jewish
state and turn it into a state of all its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, thrashed out over 11 years in the courts and in three
government committees, raised the question whether the Western Wall
is a religious site where worship must follow strict Orthodox
practice, or a national place of pilgrimage where Jews of all
persuasions can have services in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine of massive stones, venerated by Jews for centuries,
is a remnant of a wall that surrounded a plateau where the ancient
Jewish temple stood before it was destroyed by the Romans in A.D.
70.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts by Women of the Wall to have prayer services there, and
by Conservative and Reform Jews to have mixed services of men and
women, have drawn verbal abuse and sometimes violence by strictly
Orthodox Jews who consider such gatherings an affront to their
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Women of the Wall, made up of more than 100 liberal Orthodox,
Conservative and Reform women backed by a few hundred women abroad,
did not challenge the segregation of men and women but sought to
have traditional services in the women's prayer area, wearing
prayer shawls and reading aloud from the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   Such group worship was outlawed by a regulation governing Jewish
holy places that barred ``holding a religious ceremony that is not
according to local custom.'' That was interpreted by the Chief
Rabbinate and the Religious Affairs Ministry, which oversee prayer
arrangements at the Western Wall, as Orthodox custom. Violating the
regulation carried a penalty of up to six months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Government committees that examined the case ruled against
changing standing practice on the ground that it might provoke
violence, and suggested alternative sites for women to have
services adjacent to the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   But in Monday's ruling, a three-judge panel rejected such
alternatives, asserting that they failed to uphold the women's
right to prayer at the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petitioners have the right to pray according to their
custom in the Western Wall plaza as well,'' Judge Eliahu Matza
wrote in his opinion, endorsed by the two other judges. ``It is
unacceptable that concern about a violent reaction by any sector of
the public will lead to denial of the exercise by another sector of
its right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who is a Jerusalem city council member from the leftist
Meretz Party, said the ruling ``is moving the Western Wall out of
the complete monopoly of the ultra-Orthodox,'' and will make it
possible for the first time to have bat mitzvah services there for
girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voices of women, who are half of the Jewish people, were
silenced in the holiest place to Jews,'' she said. ``This was a
stain on the state of Israel and Jerusalem. Monday that stain has
been removed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moshe Gafni, a legislator form the strictly Orthodox United
Torah Judaism Party, called the court decision a ``shocking blow to
observant and traditional Jews around the world, and a stab in
their back.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the ruling would ``turn the holiest place to the
Jewish people into a place where none of us will be able to pray,
because it will be the site of the worst kind of sacrilege, against
all the rules of Jewish law and the entire Jewish tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The religious affairs minister, Yitzhak Cohen, from the strictly
Orthodox Shas Party, said he would submit a bill to Parliament that
would counter Monday's ruling by specifying what forms of worship
are permitted at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   A religious moderate, Rabbi Michael Melchior, the minister of
diaspora affairs, also criticized the ruling, warning that it could
lead to ``terrible and violent dispute'' if it was carried out. He
urged a compromise. ``We can't resolve the central problems of our
society by one side bending the other,'' he said, ``only through
dialogue and agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative movement in Israel, which reached its own
compromise with the government on mixed prayers by men and women at
a site adjacent to the Western Wall, welcomed Monday's ruling as
``a great day in the struggle for religious pluralism in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But it caused hardly a ripple Monday morning at the Western
Wall, where hundreds of worshipers paid no attention to Hoffman and
four other women who arrived from the Supreme Court to celebrate
their victory.
</P>
<P>
   As they draped arms around each other and read a psalm of
thanksgiving from a prayer book, Rivka David, an Orthodox school
principal from Tel Aviv, looked at them as if they were from
another planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer is a personal thing,'' she said. ``This is a show.''

CHINESE DEFINE HUMAN RIGHTS IN THEIR OWN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ Like many Chinese, Y.M. Zhou thinks the United States
has a warped and hypocritical view of human rights in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have human rights,'' declared Zhou, 33, an employee
of a foreign bank in Shanghai. ``The US doesn't have the right to
criticize us. The US has problems of its own _ killings in the
schools and that poor Cuban boy,'' he added, referring to the raid
that returned Elian Gonzalez to his father, an incident that was
portrayed in China as armed government agents bursting into an
innocent family's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US uses one standard to judge countries in other stages of
development. But we are like the US 100 years ago,'' Zhou asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and labor conditions in China have been at the
center of a rancorous Washington debate that culminates Wednesday
with the US congressional vote over granting China permanent normal
trade status. American labor unions and some victims of persecution
in China have banded together against the legislation, arguing that
the United States should retain the little leverage it has annually
to influence Beijing over its suppression of political and
religious dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou's views reflect a much different concept of human rights
than that of most Americans. The Chinese government says human
rights mean access to food, shelter, medical care, education, and
equal opportunity. And for nearly 50 years, few people in China
have questioned that definition. Yet here in Shanghai, China's most
Westernized city and its wealthy, commercial capital, there is a
small, but growing number of middle-class people with access to the
Internet and foreign travel who are beginning to think of human
rights in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government is mixing the concept, changing the definition
of human rights and trying to confuse people,'' complained Huang, a
42-year-old former government worker who declined to give his first
name for fear of reprisals. ``There's an international standard of
human rights and it's not eating! Food is just a basic need, and if
a government can't provide people with food, it has no right to
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Chinese have human rights, Chen Jie, a 24-year-old
pianist, was blunt. ``Not at all! Prisoners are treated like pigs .
. . and even I feel I don't have any human rights. Every leader
should be elected. But as long as we have only the Communist Party,
it will never be done. We need other parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Chinese government has issued a steady
diet of media reports on the perceived unfairness of US criticisms
of China, and dark threats about how relations and commerce with
the United States would suffer if Congress does not pass the trade
deal. China recently released a report denouncing human rights in
the United States, and a separate booklet hailing advances in human
rights in China under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, human rights include freedom of speech,
religion, press and assembly, the right to a fair trial, and the
right to form political parties and contest free elections.
</P>
<P>
   But one look at ``Fifty Years of Progress in China's Human
Rights,'' a recent Chinese government report, underscores that the
leadership here defines human rights as a ``people's democratic
political system,'' land reform, the education of women, the
probihition of prostitution, drugs and gambling, the elimination of
ethnic discrimination, and economic advancement.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that living conditions, literacy, and the
wealth and gender gap have vastly improved since 1949, when the
Communist Party took charge. But the report makes no mention of the
times when government policies went awry. China suffered the worst
famine in history in the late 1950s, which claimed an estimated 30
million lives. Many Chinese suffered or extreme political and
cultural persecution during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report praises the goverment for feeding 22 percent
of the world's population on 7 percent of its arable land, raising
incomes dramatically, providing health care, and coping with
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that the Chinese constitution ensures freedom
of speech, assembly, press, and religion. But it fails to mention
that all those rights are overriden by Article 51, which says
freedoms ``may not infringe upon the interests of the state, of
society or of the collective.'' That clause has justified the
imprisonment of countless political and religious dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, another recent official report, ``US Human Rights
Record in 1999,'' paints ``A Clockwork Orange''-like vision of an
ultraviolent America filled with trigger-happy police and
out-of-control gangs. The 10-page Chinese report condemns the
United States for having the world's highest rate of deaths by gun
violence, the world's highest per capita prison population, prison
labor, police brutality, judicial corruption, racial
discrimination, gaping income inequities, long working hours,
domestic violence, and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The examples of US defects are attributed to US media, including
The Boston Globe, whose Web sites are often blocked here to prevent
Chinese from reading them. And even as it quotes American press
articles that criticize US authorities, the report condemns the US
media as ``a propaganda machine used by authorities to manipulate
public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that ``the US government needs to keep an
eye on its own human rights problems, mind its own business and
stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention in the reports or in the Chinese press of
the frequent arrests of political dissidents and members of banned
religious sects, such as Falun Gong, or of the long prison terms
meted out in closed hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US is not perfect. I also question their purpose for
criticizing us; it's not about human rights, but political gain,''
said Lu Qing, 26, who works for an export company. Even so, she
acknowledged ``we do not have enough human rights here. . . . Our
biggest problem is low salaries. If people don't have enough money,
they don't have enough energy to change society.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen Linxin, 28, said the first step to improving human rights
would be a free media ``so we can hear different voices and judge
for ourselves what we want. The government controls everything, so
even when people are oppressed, the public doesn't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet like other critic of China's human rights record, Chen urged
Washington to normalize trade relations, not only for commercial
reasons, but also to speed China's political liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   Normal trade ``will make China more open, more free, and . . .
it will help our human rights situation by improving living
standards and helping us develop a middle class,'' he reasoned.
``Because if we have enough middle-class people, that more than
anything will help force democratization.''

QUALITY TIME (AND DIAPERS) AT 10 DOWNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair, nudged in public by his
wife, Cherie, to take some of the paternity leave his government
has just authorized for British parents, is canceling his public
appearances this week to spend time with her and Leo, their baby
son.
</P>
<P>
   A 10 Downing Street spokesman said the only appointment Blair
would keep was his weekly session with Queen Elizabeth II on
Tuesday. He will leave the handling of prime minister's questions
in the House of Commons on Wednesday and the chairing of the
Thursday cabinet meeting to his deputy, John Prescott. Mother,
father and newborn son will leave London at midweek for Chequers,
the official country retreat in Buckinghamshire where they will be
joined for the weekend by the couple's three other children, Euan,
16, Nicky, 14 and Kathryn, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Downing Street, which has kept a tight lid on publicity
surrounding the birth at the Blairs' insistence, released the first
picture of the couple and Leo, who was born early Saturday morning.
Fourteen more photographs were offered for sale through a London
agency with proceeds to go to charities supporting children's and
breast cancers. The photos were taken by Mary McCartney, 30, the
daughter of the former Beatle, Paul McCartney. Her mother, Linda,
who was well known for her photography, died of breast cancer in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Mrs. Blair, 45, a noted employment rights lawyer, had
praised the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, 59, for taking
a week off that month to be with his newborn daughter, and she had
pointedly urged the ``widespread adoption of his fine example.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, 47, said he could not abandon his job, but
he promised to devote as much time as he could to the baby and
specifically to take up night diaper duty. Noting that pledge, his
press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said the decision did not
reflect a big shift in attitude. &QL;

DEVELOPER OF CANCER DRUG PLEASED WITH HUMAN TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  ( For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Responding to reports that the highly-touted
anticancer drug endostatin has failed to impress in its first human
tests, Dr. Judah Folkman of Children Hospital in Boston told
thousands of cancer specialists Monday that he was ``very pleased''
with the drug's early trials in Boston and hinted there will be
more good news ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a standing-room-only crowd at the American Society of
Clinical Oncology meeting, Folkman, who developed endostatin in
Boston labs, urged specialists not to be discouraged if the drugs
don't work right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it takes a long time . . .,'' Folkman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman was making the first public comments to cancer
specialists about the drug's effectiveness since a National Cancer
Institute official was quoted in the Globe earlier this month
saying ``no dramatic benefits,'' have been seen in endostatin
trials going on now in Boston and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
   That report sent the stock in Maryland-based Entremed Inc.,
which makes endostatin, into a tailspin. Investors have been
closely following the development of endostatin and Folkman's
progress ever since a scientist predicted in 1998 that Folkman
would cure cancer within two years. That hasn't happened but the
enthusiasm of some investors and scientists has barely been dented
as they await results of the endostatin trials.
</P>
<P>
   Because patients began receiving endostatin in the Boston study
in October, two months ahead of the other centers, Folkman seemed
to hint Monday that the drug's effectiveness improves over time.
Folkman, however, does not directly oversee the trials, from which
no official data has been reported, and cannot speak publicly about
them. However, he said Monday ``We are very pleased with the
results at the Boston hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   He also disclosed the results of other cases in which so-called
angiogenesis inhibitors, of which endostatin is one, have proved to
be powerful cancer fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike standard cancer drugs that attack tumors directly,
angiogenesis inhibitors cut off the tumor's blood supply and slowly
strangles them, or at least halts their growth.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman said Monday that in about 80 cancer patients, mostly
children, the drugs destroyed growths that would have killed them.
``If we'd given up in the first month or two, they wouldn't be
around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic cases was that of a Vermont teenager
who in 1998 had a volleyball-sized pelvic tumor that resisted all
therapies. She had been ``sent home to die,'' Folkman said, but
after months of treatment with an angiogenesis inhibitor, the
growth began to shrink and today she is free of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, Tonya Kalesnik, of Colchester, may be alive only
because her doctor went to a Folkman lecture at a time when
specialists had tried every treatment they knew but failed to halt
her tumor's growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday, Kalesnik said she was in
constant and excruciating pain, incontinent, and her legs were
increasingly numb as the tumor grew.
</P>
<P>
   Kalesnik's doctor got in touch with Folkman and eventually
prescribed interferon alpha, an infection-fighting substance that
is a weak angiogenesis inhibitor. It is also effective in blocking
a substance some tumors secrete, which signal the body to grow more
blood vessels. Kalesnik's tumor, called a giant cell tumor, was of
a type that doesn't spread through the body but kills through sheer
size.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman prescribed nightly injections of interferon alpha but it
wasn't until three months had passed that doctors observed that the
tumor seemed to have stabilized. ``It was the first time it had
done something other than grow,'' said Kalesnik, who is taking a
break from her freshman year at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, the tumor shrank by about 80 percent,
and Folkman believes she may be able to stop taking the drug within
a few months. Because the anti-angiogenesis drugs work slowly, in
small doses over along periods of time, Folkman said the standard
way of conducting initial clinical trials may not be appropriate.
In other words, angiogenesis inhibitors might be thought not to be
effective against tumors if they grow despite treatment, but
treating for longer periods might eventually rein in the cancer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening
growths, called hemangiomas. Folkman showed slides of infants with
enormous, disfiguring tumors that are made of thousands of blood
vessels. These life-threatening growths, which also produce
substances that tell the body to create more blood vessels, also
responded well to interferon treatment, he said. Previously, no
other anticancer treatment had worked.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman said about 40 reports have been disclosed on tests of
angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer. Most have been inconclusive but
some show promise that will be explored in wider testing.

COURT STRIKES DOWN LIMITS ON EXPLICIT CABLE TV SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Del.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring for the first time that programming on
cable television is entitled to the highest level of First
Amendment protection, the Supreme Court on Monday struck down a
federal law that required many cable systems to limit sexually
explicit channels to late-night hours.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 5-4, with an unusual lineup of justices. Both sides
agreed that shielding children from sexually explicit material, the
purpose of the law, was a legitimate goal, but differed on the
extent of the problem the 1996 law was passed to address and on the
degree of constitutional ``flexibility'' the court should give the
government in its effort to protect children.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, joined by
Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Kennedy's opinion discussed the ``basic speech
principles'' that he said were at stake in the case, a challenge
brought by Playboy Magazine's cable operations, which include
Spice, AdulTVision, Adam &AMP; Eve and the Playboy channel. All came
within the law's definition of being ``primarily dedicated to
sexually-oriented programming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the law of free expression is one of
vindication in cases involving speech that many citizens may find
shabby, offensive or even ugly,'' Kennedy said. He added: ``The
citizen is entitled to seek out or reject certain ideas or
influences without government interference or control.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters were Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Antonin
Scalia, both of whom wrote dissenting opinions, and Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, both of whom
signed Breyer's dissent. ``Our prior cases recognize that where the
protection of children is at issue, the First Amendment poses a
barrier that properly is high, but not insurmountable,'' Breyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case, U.S. vs. Playboy Entertainment Group, No.
98-1682, was the validity of Section 505 of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996. Adopted as a floor amendment with little debate, the
section was intended to address the problem of ``signal bleed,''
caused by a cable system's failure to scramble a signal well enough
to avoid a fuzzy image or some sound from coming through to those
subscribers who have not paid for a particular channel and do not
want it.
</P>
<P>
   Section 505 required that for a channel ``primarily dedicated to
sexually-oriented programming,'' a cable system that lacked the
technology to block the signal completely had to limit the channel
to hours when children were unlikely to be watching. A Federal
Communications Commission regulation set the time as between 10
p.m. and 6 a.m., and many cable systems chose that ``safe harbor''
option rather than investing in the technology needed for complete
blocking.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the law contained another approach in a
separate section, Section 504, under which cable operators had to
provide an effective blocking device for any subscriber who wanted
one.
</P>
<P>
   A special three-judge federal District Court in Wilmington,
Del., ruling in 1998 in Playboy's challenge to the law, held that
Section 504 could protect customers just as well without being as
intrusive as the systemwide time segregation required by Section
505.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the district court said, Section 505 was not the
``least restrictive means'' to achieve the government's goal, and
was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion affirming that decision, Kennedy made several
points that could significantly limit the government's ability to
regulate content in new communications technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In applying ``strict scrutiny,'' the highest level of First
Amendment protection, to cable programming, Kennedy identified what
he called a ``key difference'' between cable and broadcast
television and radio, for which the court has applied a lower level
of scrutiny and permitted more regulatory leeway.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the broadcast media, cable systems have the capacity for
``target blocking,'' he said, adding: ``Technology expands the
capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution
if we assume the government is best positioned to make these
choices for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Corn-Revere, a lawyer who represented Playboy, said in an
interview Monday that this analysis would also apply to the
Internet and could prove important in turning back efforts to
regulate speech in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of judges Monday also rejected the Clinton
administration's defense of Section 505 as necessary because
parents could not be counted on to request individual blocking
devices from their cable company. That was an unwarranted
assumption, Kennedy said, adding: ``Even upon the assumption that
the government has an interest in substituting itself for informed
and empowered parents, its interest is not sufficiently compelling
to justify this widespread restriction on speech.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Breyer said that by not depending on
individual parental action, Section 505 ``offers independent
protection for a large number of families.'' He said the government
had an ``independent interest in offering such protection''
regardless of choices made by individual parents about monitoring
what their children watch.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL TAKE FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were also these other developments Monday on a busy day at
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bag Suits
</P>
<P>
   Dividing 5-4, the court ruled that manufacturers of cars made
before federal law required air bags cannot be sued under state
negligence laws for failing to have the passive safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Geier vs. American Honda Motor Co., No. 98-1811, was
the latest in a particularly contentious and unpredictable area of
the court's docket, federal pre-emption of various state court
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer wrote the majority decision, which upheld a ruling last
year by the federal appeals court here that a suit against Honda
for failing to include an air bag in a 1987 Accord was pre-empted
by the federal regulation in effect at that time that permitted a
gradual phase-in of passive restraints.
</P>
<P>
   For 1987 models, manufacturers were required under a 1984
regulation to equip only 10 percent of their models with either air
bags or automatic seat belts. All cars manufactured after Sept. 1,
1989, had to have passive restraints, and all cars beginning with
the 1998 model year were specifically required to have air bags for
both the driver and front-seat passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said the Department of Transportation had deliberately
chosen a gradual approach, to promote public acceptance and give
manufacturers time to develop better systems. Permitting state
negligence suits created an unacceptable conflict with the state
regulatory approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the dissenting opinion, Stevens charged the majority with an
``unprecedent extension of the doctrine of pre-emeption that failed
to treat state court systems with proper respect.
</P>
<P>
   While the regulation at issue is no longer in effect, there are
millions of cars still on the road from the period in question.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia
and Kennedy. Souter, Thomas and Ginsburg joined the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Employment Disputes
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into an issue of growing importance in labor-management
relations, the court agreed to decide whether employers can enforce
binding arbitration agreements that employees are increasingly
required to sign as a condition of being hired.
</P>
<P>
   The question in Circuit City Stores vs. Adams, No. 99-1379, is
whether the federal Arbitration Act, a 1925 law that excludes
certain employment contracts from its coverage, applies to ordinary
labor agreements of this type. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in San Francisco, held in this case that arbitration as
part of an ordinary employment contract could not be enforced. All
other federal courts to address the issue have found such
agreements enforceable. Nearly 10 percent of the American work
force is covered by mandatory arbitration agreements, according to
a brief from the National Academy of Arbitrators.

BREAKOUT NOVEL LIKELY TO TAKE CHARLES BAXTER BEYOND `WRITER'S
WRITER'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are certainly worse things to be called, even for a
writer. But being tabbed ``a writer's writer'' has slowly and
steadily been woven into a hair shirt for Charles Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when it seemed a worthy accolade, this notion
that his fine work, both novels and short stories, had won great
admiration from his fellow writers. But there were times lately
when being ``a writer's writer'' seemed much less of an accolade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts as a compliment,'' Baxter said in an interview,
``but it soon becomes a kind of backhanded compliment. For being `a
writer's writer' is also a way of saying your work is out of touch
with readers. So I have very mixed feelings about that
description.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter's days as ``a writer's writer'' seem to be coming to an
abrupt end. Popularity, even best-selling popularity, may be next
for the 53-year-old writer because of his exceptional new novel,
``The Feast of Love'' (Pantheon, 308 pages, $24).
</P>
<P>
   This is an inspired look at love in its many permutations, a
jazz-riff version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' transported to
Ann Arbor, Mich., and the new millennium. ``The Feast of Love''
manages to be heartfelt and erotic, hilarious and poignant,
scathing and bittersweet. And it is as irresistible as a
Valentine's Day box of truffles.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a Baxter novel is getting reviews filled with
superlatives. Suddenly, a Baxter novel is the lead recommendation
of Amazon.com. Suddenly, a Baxter novel is receiving a push from
independent booksellers. And suddenly Baxter, a soft-spoken and wry
academic from the University of Michigan, is on an extensive
cross-country book tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all very heartening to a writer,'' Baxter said. ``But
I have also tried to cultivate a steely Zen detachment about it. Of
course, I hope people like the novel and recommend it to their
friends. But there are limits to how much I can intervene on the
book's behalf at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A writer's writer'' has been replaced by a new phrase attached
to Baxter _ ``author of a break-out book.'' This is the phenomenon
when a literary writer bursts into the spotlight with a novel that
greatly expands his readership.
</P>
<P>
   Cormac McCarthy had this happen to him when his terse
masterpiece, ``All the Pretty Horses,'' ended his many years of
writing obscurity. The most recent phenomenon was Kent Haruf, with
his understated Colorado elegy, ``Plainsong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Feast of Love'' bears more than passing similarity to
``Plainsong.'' Both novels celebrate the daily lives and dreams of
``ordinary'' people, their stories spun forth in their plainspoken
voices in alternating chapters. Both novels build toward a
conclusion where menace and tragedy must be confronted in hopes of
approaching redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Feast of Love,'' however, is firmly grounded upon the most
universal of human longings.
</P>
<P>
   As the character Chloe muses, ``When people are staring off into
their neighborhood infinity ... what are they thinking about?
That's what I'm trying to grasp. I think they're stupefied,
thinking about love, mostly, how they once had it, how they got it,
how they lost it, and all the people they loved or didn't love, how
they ended up royally hating somebody, like, the weirdness and
wetness of it. Bradley says they're thinking about money, but I
know they're not. Love comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   Chloe and Bradley play signal roles in Baxter's ode to love.
These two, as different as pierced tongues and baggy chinos,
demonstrate Baxter's wondrous dexterity as a writer, his ability to
concoct fully realized characters and authentic voices. These
people leap off the page and into the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Chloe is a punk Madonna, impulsive, trusting, tart, wise beyond
her education and years. She works as a waitress in a coffee
emporium at the mall, is in love with a reformed drug addict named
Oscar, dabbles briefly in porn to make ends meet, consults a
psychic and firmly believes: ``You can't always get what you want
but sometimes you get what you need _ truer words than that have
been spoken, but not much truer, and for sure not in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is a lumpy toad of a fellow, trustworthy, solid,
forlorn, often encountered walking his dog (also named Bradley). He
is the owner of the coffee emporium at the mall, but also a visual
artist of some talent, if muddled vision, an unfortunate at love,
having lost his first wife to another woman, his second wife to
another man. But Bradley still keeps questing for companionship
because he firmly believes ``In truth, there are only two
realities: the one for people who are in love or love each other,
and the one for people who are standing outside all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chloe and Bradley are joined in the novel by an aging
philosopher/professor and his wife; a tough-nut, me-first female
attorney and her fierce married lover. All are somehow persuaded to
share their tales of love and loss with a plot-stuck, insomniac
novelist named Charles Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   This opening gambit in the novel seems fraught with danger
because of its self-consciousness. In fact, one of Baxter's writing
compatriots warned against using himself as a minor character,
arguing that it was ``like pushing a wheelbarrow across a tightrope
above Niagara Falls.'' Baxter was undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ground the story in somebody who seems to exist,''
he said, ``somebody who writes novels in Ann Arbor, before all
these characters take off in their speculations, their anecdotes,
their fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   The marvelous collage of characters sprung from Baxter's
imagination without any real research. The younger ones were
probably shaped by his writing students and his 21-year-old son,
the middle-age ones by his wife of 25 years and their friends. What
amazed him was how freely the voices all flowed forth.
</P>
<P>
   After six books of fiction, including two novels, Baxter spent
four years writing ``The Feast of Love,'' with some real rewards.
But what happens in the marketplace still remains uncertain so soon
after publication. If his ninth book, with all its building buzz,
does not crest on the best-seller list, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if Stalin just said that this was not
literature,'' Baxter emphasized, ``and it's not as if my life is in
danger. In America, we worry too much about being a hit or making
the big score. That is not to say I wouldn't be delighted if a lot
of readers enjoyed my book. But I'm not about to let it drive me
crazy either.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By some plans, Russia's Mir space station should have been long
dead, with most of its structure incinerated by a fiery re-entry
through Earth's atmosphere and the remains of the giant spacecraft
resting on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mir remains in orbit. Even as astronauts from the space
shuttle Atlantis were preparing the nascent International Space
Station for future occupancy, a pair of astronauts aboard Mir were
busily repairing worn components and preparing it for future
visits. Previously abandoned, battered and showing all the effects
of its sometimes troubled 14 years in space, Mir just keeps going.
</P>
<P>
   Long the subject of premature obituaries, Mir, the pride of the
cash-starved Russian space program, is being given longer life due
to last-minute money from Western investors. With the help of more
than $20 million in private investment and spacecraft supplied by
Russian partners, it appears the life of the 130-ton space station
may extend past its 15th anniversary in orbit next February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not surprised that the Russians found a way to keep Mir
up,'' said Marcia Smith, a space analyst with the Library of
Congress' Congressional Research Service. ``It is a source of great
national pride and they are very resourceful.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mir's continued operation delights Russia and some space
enthusiasts worldwide, the United States and other partners in the
International Space Station see Mir's continuation as a potential
threat to the international project. How can Russia, they ask, with
its limited resources, both support Mir and keep its commitments as
a major partner in the new station?
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which is
leading the international project, notes that Russia is a sovereign
nation with the right to do what it wants with Mir and the rest of
its space program. But NASA officials express chagrin that the
international project is more than two years behind schedule,
mainly because of Russian delays in completing critical components
that have resulted from inadequate financing.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, told a congressional
subcommittee last month that he was highly frustrated that Russia
would agree to a venture to extend Mir operations after saying that
it would abandon the station and concentrate its resources on the
international project. ``They always seem to have a little extra
money around for Mir but not the International Space Station,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said earlier that Russia must keep its agreement to
concentrate its resources on the new project. ``The Russians have
got to focus, and the primary focus is meeting their commitment to
the International Space Station,'' he said, ``If Mir saps their
strength in meeting their commitments, then we have serious
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two modules of the $60 billion international station,
one American and one Russian, have been in orbit since the fall of
1998 awaiting the arrival of a crucial third component, a
Russian-made service module that is to provide initial living
quarters and laboratory space for the growing station. Program
officials say the Russian segment, which must be in place before
more parts are added to the station, is ready and set to be
launched in July.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the delayed Russian-made service module is the
current mission of the U.S. shuttle Atlantis, which docked with the
new station 210 miles above the Earth on Sunday to refurbish the
complex. Atlantis' seven-member crew was to swap out deteriorating
Russian electric batteries, transfer 1,000 thousand pounds of
supplies for future crews, and raise the station's decaying orbit
by 26 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russian astronauts Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr
Kalery continue their 60-day mission of putting Mir back into
working order and assessing the orbiting outpost for future
renovations and commercial applications. The crew arrived at Mir on
April 6 and concentrated on making the station habitable again
before starting a program of scientific research. The astronauts
found and patched what they reportedly believed was the source of a
persistent air leak, and used supplies brought up by an unmanned
Progress cargo craft to repair and restock the station.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, the Russian astronauts conducted a five-hour
spacewalk outside Mir to inspect its outer hull and retrieve
experimental packages left out by previous crews. They discovered
that a solar power panel that had stopped working in March
apparently suffered a short circuit that charred external wiring.
Also, they tested a new glue designed to seal cracks in aging
spacecraft. The glue, which its developers said could be used to
fill small cracks and leaks in any spacecraft, was applied to a
special test panel and left outside Mir to be retrieved later.
</P>
<P>
   All of this activity comes just nine months after Mir was
supposedly abandoned in preparation for nudging it out of orbit
with rockets and letting it burn up in the upper atmosphere. The
Russian government pledged to put no more money into the station
and let it die, unless private financing was found to keep it in
orbit. Several groups proposed schemes to save Mir, but none could
come up with the estimated $100 million to $200 million per year
needed to operate the station.
</P>
<P>
   This situation changed at the beginning of the year when a group
of Western investors formed a company called MirCorp and began
raising money. MirCorp, chartered in Bermuda and based in
Amsterdam, received initial financing of about $20 million from
Gold &AMP; Appel Transfer SA, a Caribbean-based venture capital holding
company. In February, MirCorp signed an agreement with RSC Energia,
the privatized Russian company that built and operates Mir, for
commercial use of the station for the remainder of its life.
Energia, which is 38 percent owned by the Russian government,
became the majority stockholder in MirCorp and retains ownership of
Mir.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp has announced plans for the station that include turning
it into a space hotel for wealthy tourists willing to pay $20
million for a unique vacation, leasing space to pharmaceutical and
other companies wanting to do proprietary research in space, and
establishing Internet and entertainment businesses there.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Manber, an American who is president of MirCorp, said in
an interview that the company had raised $40 million so far, and
intended to raise another $100 million before a possible public
stock offering next year. Manber said the company had almost raised
enough money for its next announced mission to Mir, sending up a
crew this fall with equipment to start Internet services from orbit
and beginning renovations of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not promised things that we have not delivered,''
Manber said. ``We have hit our technical milestones and have hit
the basics of our business model, and are very optimistic about our
chances. With each success we have, we think we can raise more
money on the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Manber said that, according to the accounting and investment
firms the company is consulting about a stock offering, MirCorp
could raise between $300 million and $500 million through a public
stock offering. If this happens, he said, the Russians could come
away with up to $200 million to revitalize their space industry and
the company would have more money to upgrade the station and
perhaps even build a new central module for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the core module of Mir is 14 years old,'' Manber said.
``If you build a new core and add the newer modules of the current
station, then you have a much younger station in space available
for commercial uses for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   James E. Oberg, a former NASA engineer and Houston-based expert
on the Russian space program, said MirCorp was not assured success,
``but I admire them for giving it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken a risky, innovative approach and the basis of
opportunity is taking chances,'' Oberg said, ``A lot of the things
they are proposing are off-the-wall ideas, but some have merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles P. Vick, a space analyst with the Federation of American
Scientists in Washington, said he did not believe there was enough
private interest and money available to finance expansive Mir
plans. ``I don't think the capital is there, unless it is put in by
governments. It just seems like a limited program that won't go
very far.''
</P>
<P>
   John E. Pike, another federation analyst, said the changing
political climate in Russia might be shifting in Mir's favor.
Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, pledged last month to
fulfill his country's commitments to the international station, but
also voiced strong support for Mir and the Russian space industry.
``The space sector is not only a prestigious sector which makes our
country a great power,'' Putin said, ``but it is also linked to
economic and scientific development.''
</P>
<P>
   During this commemoration of the nation's annual Astronaut Day,
Russian news agencies reported that Putin said he would include
money for Mir in next year's space budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests a continuation of Mir that the previous
administration of Boris N. Yeltsin said it didn't support,'' Pike
said. ``Is this part of a larger re-evaluation of Russia's
relationship with the United States, a signal of a new Russian
independence?''

COMMENTARY: MIDEAST REALITY CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After all these years of Israelis and Palestinians talking about
the core issues _ Jerusalem, refugees, prisoners, territory _ you'd
think there would be no surprises left now that we have reached the
endgame. But in fact the final peace talks are turning out to be
more explosive and shocking then either anticipated. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because for three decades whenever issues such as Jerusalem,
territory or Palestinian refugees returning to Israel were raised,
Israelis and Palestinians had their stock answers ready: ``The
(other side) is simply going to have to accept our demand for (fill
in the blank) because we can't possibly compromise on that issue.
Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, although both sides have talked about all the
issues involved in this endgame for decades, when it came to the
hard compromises they were usually talking to themselves. And
what's great about negotiating with yourself is that you never have
to really give ground, so your public is never surprised.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Israelis and Palestinians are talking through
various secret channels (talks that Israel temporarily froze Sunday
due to the recent violence in the West Bank) about the concrete
compromises that are required to make an actual deal possible, it
is almost as though they are talking about these issues for the
first time _ and their people and coalitions are not fully
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   So many Israelis are shocked at news leaks suggesting that a
final deal with the Palestinians will require Israel to give up 90
to 92 percent of the West Bank, not 60 or 75, which was the working
assumption all these years. Many Israelis are going to be shocked
to hear that despite their insistence on retaining a united
Jerusalem, the Palestinians will have their own administrative
capital on the outskirts, in Abu Dis, with some access to and
oversight of Palestinian areas in East Jerusalem. Many Israelis are
going to be surprised to learn that despite all these years of
insisting there be no return of Palestinian refugees to pre-1967
Israel, some Palestinians will be returning under the guise of
``family reunifications.'' Without these compromises, there will be
no deal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Palestinians, after 30 years of declaring that they
will not cede to Israel one inch of the West Bank, they will be
ceding 8 to 10 percent, on which 80 percent of the Jewish settlers
live; Jerusalem will remain the unified capital of Israel, and,
while there will be a symbolic return of some Palestinian refugees
to pre-1967 Israel, it will only be symbolic. Without these
compromises, there will be no deal.
</P>
<P>
   And these are just the hard compromises that have leaked. There
will be more surprises. This whole thing reminds me of a couple who
for years have suffered through a bad marriage. They are now
meeting secretly with their divorce lawyers to work out the
separation and the only question is: When do we tell the kids?
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are working on all the details
in Stockholm, but they haven't told the kids yet (although many are
getting inklings).
</P>
<P>
   This helps explain the current surge of Palestinian-Israeli
violence. The Palestinians are enraged at Yasser Arafat because
their fathers and sons are still in Israeli prisons for committing
violent acts against Jews that Arafat ordered. But Arafat is now
negotiating with the Israelis about a deal that might not result in
all the prisoners getting out, and he has not made their release
his top priority. Meanwhile, you have Israeli families that are
upset because they have had loved ones killed by these Palestinian
prisoners, and some of them are going to be released as part of a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problem,'' says the Middle East expert Stephen Cohen,
``is that no one in either society can say to his neighbor to just
forget about this prisoner issue for now _ even though they know
that to get a final deal that could ensure that more people are not
killed, and more prisoners not taken, there is going to have to be
a compromise in which some Palestinians who killed Israelis are
going to stay in jail and others are going to be freed.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of peace is that the more separated you want to be,
the more cooperation and cutting of slack is required to get a
deal. That is why the endgame is going to require a whole new set
of compromises, a whole new politics really, for both Palestinians
and Israelis. But when will they tell the kids?

FORMER GM OFFICIAL INDICTED IN CELEBRATED ESPIONAGE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A former senior executive at General Motors has been
indicted, accused of defrauding the automaker by taking boxes of
its confidential documents with him when he jumped to a top job at
Volkswagen in 1993. The indictment, announced Monday, revives one
of the most celebrated cases in recent years involving accusations
of industrial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The six-count indictment by a federal grand jury here accuses
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former vice president for
worldwide purchasing, of wire fraud and the interstate
transportation of stolen property. The Justice Department asserted
that Lopez copied extensive GM computer files on auto parts costs
and future car models and took them to VW when he took the top
purchasing job there.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's longtime lawyer, Plato Cacheris, said that Lopez denied
breaking any American laws but would not come to the United States
to defend himself. And while the Justice Department said Monday
that it would seek Lopez's extradition from Spain, Cacheris said
that Spain's extradition treaty with the United States did not
allow Spanish citizens like Lopez to be extradited against their
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case that is a waste of time and money; he will
never be tried,'' Cacheris said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and the Spanish Embassy had no comment
Monday evening on how or whether the extradition treaty might apply
to Lopez. Many such treaties limit the extradition of a country's
own citizens to stand trial, particularly on charges of nonviolent
crimes, for which countries' laws may differ considerably.
</P>
<P>
   The United States on rare occasions has been able to persuade
foreign governments to extradite people even if their cases are not
clearly covered by an extradition treaty. But such a move would be
politically difficult for Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez left Volkswagen three years ago and has been working ever
since as an auto consultant in Bilbao, the industrial center of
Spain's economically depressed Basque region. Lopez has tried with
little success to start his own auto company in his Basque hometown
of Amorebieta, partly as a way to reduce unemployment there.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Lopez's surprise resignation and departure to
Volkswagen on Mar. 15, 1993, GM executives became concerned about
the large volume of confidential documents which he and his
assistants had requested in the four preceding months. GM ended up
suing VW, accusing it of having used the documents. VW settled the
civil case in January 1997, agreeing to pay GM $100 million but not
admitting any wrongdoing; Lopez had resigned from VW two months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   German prosecutors had also filed charges against Lopez accusing
him of having stolen GM documents, but dropped the charges in July
1998, after he agreed to make charitable contributions totaling
400,000 marks, worth $224,000 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   GM cautiously welcomed the announcement of the indictment.
``Obviously, these are decisions with which we agree and we will
continue, as we have in the past, to provide support to the Justice
Department in connection with their handling of this matter,'' the
automaker said in a statement. ``We will not, however, comment on
the specific charges contained in the indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   VW officials did not return calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's announcement, the Justice Department revealed that
the grand jury had actually returned the indictment last October
under seal. The Justice Department did not reveal why the
indictment was unsealed Monday, other than to note that a formal
extradition request would soon be made to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's exertions to cut costs were legendary in Detroit. When
GM was tottering at the edge of financial disaster in the early
1990s, he and his aides, and even their spouses, made a point of
wearing their wristwatches on their right wrists and vowing not to
move them back to their left until GM was once again earning record
profits.
</P>
<P>
   In a city that still reveres red meat and junk food, Lopez
turned heads by requiring that his aides live on a ``warrior's
diet'' of fruit, whole-grain products, as little meat as possible
and no alcohol except an occasional glass of wine, and only good
wine was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lopez wrung somewhat lower prices from the thousands of
companies around the world that sell the auto parts from which GM
assembles its cars. The legal wrangling has centered on whether he
took GM's prices to VW, which would have allowed VW to compare what
it was paying the same suppliers for the same or similar parts, and
then demand lower prices in every case in which GM had negotiated a
better deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez tried to persuade GM to build a low-cost factory in the
Basque region at which suppliers would play an unusually large
role, sometimes sending their employees to help install parts at
the assembly line. He went to VW when GM rejected the idea, but VW
ended up not building a factory in the region either. VW has since
opened an experimental factory on Lopez's model in Brazil, while GM
and Ford are also building such factories in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Only adding to Lopez's mystery has been the car accident in
which he was involved two years ago. Cacheris said that his client
had suffered brain damage and significant memory loss in the
accident and would be unable to assist in his own defense. But
Lopez has continued to promote his dream of a Basque auto factory
over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last autumn, Lopez voiced regret that he had
ever left GM, given that VW never built his dream factory. ``If I
had known that, I wouldn't have changed'' jobs, he said. ``It was
my error.''

U.N. AIDE IN KOSOVO FAULTS NATO ON UNEXPLODED BOMBS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARLOTTA GALL  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  PRISTINA, Kosovo _ One boy was killed and two other children were
seriously wounded by a cluster bomb on Sunday, and a United Nations
official said Monday that NATO had delayed the marking and removal
of its unexploded bombs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since refugees returned to Kosovo in June, more than 100 people
have died in mine and bomb accidents, and hundreds have been
wounded. An estimated 40 percent have been the victims of cluster
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   One cluster bomb releases up to 200 bomblets that scatter over a
wide area and should explode on impact. But de-miners have found
there is a high failure rate, as high as 20 percent in some areas,
and the bombs lie on the surface or often dig into the earth.
Children and farmers often find the bright-colored,
shuttlecock-shaped bombs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did not provide detailed information on the airstrikes that
dropped 1,392 cluster bombs on Kosovo until two weeks ago, nearly a
year after the conflict ended, said John Flanagan, program manager
of the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Center. It
coordinates civilian organizations clearing mines and unexploded
ordinance across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely frustrating,'' Flanagan said. ``Ten months
after the conflict finished, we are just getting to grips with the
information, and it shouldn't be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   De-mining teams have been able to mark only 60 to 70 percent of
the cluster bomb sites so far, which that could have been done
earlier if they had had the information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo has also failed to
meet its commitments to survey and mark the bombed areas, he said.
``It became clear that we did not have all the information, and the
marking was not done,'' Flanagan said. ``Sometimes the first we
knew of a strike area was when there was a casualty.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sore topic has been whether depleted-uranium munitions
were used in the air campaign in Kosovo. NATO finally admitted in
February that such munitions were used. Last week the United
Nations secretary-general, Kofi Annan, wrote to the NATO
secretary-general, George Robertson, asking for detailed maps
showing where those strikes were made in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Annan asked for precise areas of the strikes and for assistance
to undertake ``systematic radiation measurements and sampling.'' He
also asked for help in preventing damage from the munitions.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some debate about the danger of depleted-uranium
debris, there is no doubt about the danger of cluster bombs, which
has shocked both peacekeeping soldiers and civilian de-miners.
``Cluster bombs almost always cause multiple casualties, and it is
nearly always young people who get injured,'' Flanagan said. ``We
did not anticipate the number of them used and their attractiveness
to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees in the camps were not warned of the dangers of cluster
bombs, he added, and even soldiers under the NATO command were not
always well-informed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 and a half months before April this year, there were
478 casualties in Kosovo from mines or bombs, and 100 of them were
fatalities, Flanagan said. With the arrival of spring, the casualty
figure has climbed again, to 15 casualties in April. Four de-mining
teams are concentrating on clearing cluster bombs and hope to clear
all the 333 known sites of surface bomblets this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the bomblets from a single bomb can scatter over a large
area. When he applied directly to the United States military,
Flanagan said, he finally received vital details like the direction
of attack of the plane and wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He blames the structure of NATO and of the peacekeeping force as
much as anything for the delay and lack of help. ``It is an
attitude we are going to have to change in the future,'' he said.
Under their mandate, peacekeepers have restricted themselves to
clearance they judged essential to their mission, and they have
left the mine clearance to civilian, United Nations-financed teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of work was done, and then there was a line drawn in the
sand,'' Flanagan said, alluding to the fact that many military
explosives experts were pulled out, even while cluster bomb sites
remained unmapped and uncleared. ``They could have made a
significant dent in the situation.''

RUDENSTINE, RECORD FUND-RAISER, RESIGNS AS PRESIDENT OF HARVARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Neil L. Rudenstine, a scholar of Renaissance poetry who recently
led the largest fund-raising campaign in the history of higher
education, announced Monday that he will step down next spring
after a decade as president of Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   After startling his colleagues in 1994 with a three-month leave
of absence because of exhaustion, Rudenstine won wide praise on the
Cambridge, Mass., campus for uniting its historically disparate
deans and has been a fervent supporter of affirmative action.
Undergraduates, however, often found him remote, and some in higher
education believe he failed to fully exploit the platform afforded
the steward of the nation's oldest and most prestigious university.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine, 65, said he is unsure of his plans, but sees this as
an apt moment to retire, as the institution of 18,000 students and
2,000 professors embarks on a new era of strategic planning and,
inevitably, another capital campaign.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Rudenstine believes the information technology
revolution and globalization of the economy herald a tectonic shift
in the academy, akin to the switch from small colleges to large
research universities at the turn of the century, and the vastly
expanded access to higher education after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The totality of the institution will be a different
configuration,'' he said Saturday in an interview in the library of
the president's mansion, about a mile off Harvard Square. ``That
ought to be a challenge for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine is a rare combination of prodigious fund-raiser and
scholar. From the poetry and music performed at his 1991
inauguration to his personal oversight of more than 250 tenure
appointments, his intellectual acuity was always on display. Yet
his legacy is most clearly etched in Harvard's bank accounts,
having raised $2.6 billion _ more than $1 million a day _ over six
years from some 175,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe it was his earnest commitment to Harvard's academic
future that pushed so many donors' hands deeper into their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the strongest factors in philanthropy in general is
that people give to people, as well as institutions,'' said William
H. Boardman, a top Harvard administrator who traveled with
Rudenstine as he met one-on-one with more than 500 potential
donors. Typical, Boardman said, was the reaction of the late John
Loeb, who said after meeting the president in the early 1990s, ``I
spent a half hour with Neil Rudenstine and I felt like I've known
him all my life.'' ( Loeb gave $72 million in the campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   On campus, Rudenstine installed the first provost, or
university-wide academic officer, in Harvard's modern history,
attempting to overcome the traditional autonomy of its 12 schools.
Through monthly meetings of a council of deans, he encouraged
unified approaches to institutional issues and cross-fertilization
among the faculty on topics like the environment, the brain, Latin
America and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard has this tradition of every tub on its own bottom,''
said Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government. ``In the
past, that has meant that the sum of the university is not greater
than its parts. What Neil has been good at is getting the parts to
work together so the sum total is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for prolific handwritten notes, Rudenstine has a
humble, often rumpled persona, and often ran late for appointments
(his leave, in 1994, began when he slept through a series of
appointments in New York). While he counts among his most memorable
moments encounters with students, undergraduates said they rarely
saw him between a welcome handshake during freshman year and
commencement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could go through the rest of your time here and never see
him in the yard,'' said Fentrice Driskell, a junior who is
president of the undergraduate council. Alan Wirzbicki, president
of The Crimson, the school newspaper, said Rudenstine ``was clearly
a brilliant fund-raiser, but to most students, that's all he was,
Harvard's fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Rudenstine has been a quiet leader among his peers,
though he has spoken boldly about the importance of affirmative
action, first through a 62-page report in defense of diversity,
and, in 1997, gathering a coalition of university presidents to
sign an advertisement in major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harvard doubled the number of women on its faculty,
from 85 to 183, and assembled a dream team of scholars in its
Afro-American Studies Department.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Louis Gates Jr., the department chairman, recalled when
Rudenstine was first appointed and, over lunch, urged him to write
a list of his ``ideal department _ even if they're impossible to
recruit.'' Gates jotted William Julius Wilson, Cornel West, Lani
Gunier, Jamaica Kincaid, Anthony Appiah. ``He looked at me and said
go for it _ and we hired all these people,'' Gates said. ``There
were all these people who theorized about multiculturalism _ there
were very few administrators who were able to envision that theory
and to implement it.''

ANTIDEPRESSANTS EASE HOT FLASHES, CANCER STUDY SHOWS  
 BY LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN  
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Minn., Mass., La., Canada, Britain)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Relatively small amounts of antidepressant drugs
quickly eased the frequency and severity of hot flashes in some
women with breast cancer, a researcher said Monday at the meeting
of the American Society of Clinical Oncology here.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer patients often complain of debilitating hot
flashes from early menopause induced by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent new use for antidepressants presumably will also
benefit women suffering hot flashes during menopause and men who
suffer hot flashes during hormonal therapy for prostate cancer,
said the researcher, Dr. Charles L. Loprinzi of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Although hormones known as estrogens and progesterones can
relieve hot flashes, many doctors shy away from prescribing them
for women with breast cancer because of concerns that hormones may
stimulate the growth of malignant tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Hot flashes can come as night sweats, be part of mood swings and
disrupt sleep and work.
</P>
<P>
   There are now three studies that show the benefit of
antidepressants on hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the antidepressant drugs ``so clearly work and are
reasonably tolerated,'' they may offer an effective alternative for
women who do not want to take hormones, Loprinzi said at the
meeting. However, Loprinzi said that the antidepressants do not
completely relieve hot flashes in every woman.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were effective in smaller amounts than are used in
treating depression, said Loprinzi, who has conducted two of the
studies. They involved two common antidepressants, Prozac and
Effexor, that are SSRI's, or selective serotonin-reuptake
inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   In March, researchers from Georgetown University reported a
similar benefit in a third study among 27 women using Paxil, also
an SSRI. said Loprinzi. In the pilot study from Georgetown in
Washington, the women kept diaries of the frequency and severity of
hot flashes while they took increasing amounts of Paxil for six
weeks. The women also completed questionnaires. All women knew they
were taking Paxil.
</P>
<P>
   The two studies with Prozac and Effexor were scientifically more
rigorous because neither the women nor the doctors knew what drug
the women were taking, Loprinzi said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for this new use of antidepressants came from anecdotal
observations among women who reported unexpected improvement in
their hot flashes while they were taking the drugs to fight
depression.
</P>
<P>
   The study reported Monday was the largest of the three,
involving 229 women who were divided into four groups, Loprinzi
said. The federally funded study began when all women kept a diary
of their hot flashes for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Then the women took pills for four weeks. Three groups took
different doses of Effexor _ either the full dose, 150 milligrams,
used in treating depression, the half dose, 75 milligrams, or the
quarter dose, 37.5 milligrams. A fourth group received a placebo,
or dummy pill.
</P>
<P>
   The half dose seemed to be the most effective and best tolerated
in easing hot flashes, Loprinzi said. In this group, Effexor
reduced hot flashes by 61 percent, compared with the number of hot
flashes they had before the study began.
</P>
<P>
   A small number of participants experienced nausea, dry mouth and
a decreased appetite. None reported common side effects associated
with use of the antidepressants, such as diminished libido,
dizziness or nervousness, Loprinzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how the drugs ease hot flashes is not known, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loprinzi said that researchers elsewhere are conducting a fourth

<P>
   In a separate report, a large Canadian study found that a
shorter course of radiation following a lumpectomy for early stage
breast cancer is as effective as a standard longer regimen. The
shorter, three-week course of daily radiation gives higher doses.
The standard daily five-week course gives lower doses.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first large rigorous, scientifically controlled study
of the length of radiation after lumpectomy in women who had no
evidence of spread of breast cancer to the lymph nodes, said Dr.
Timothy Whelan of the Hamilton Regional Cancer Center in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The study reflects debate between Canadian and European doctors,
who believe the shorter course is as effective and can save scarce
health resources, and American doctors who favor the longer course.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 1,234 women in 10 cancer centers in Canada began in
April 1993. Half the group received the three-week course of
radiation, and the other half received the five-week course.
Overall survival was the same in both groups. The rate of local
cancer recurrence in the breast was 2.5 percent among women who had
the shorter course and 3.3 percent among those with the longer
course.
</P>
<P>
   In commenting on the Canadian paper, Dr. Jay Harris, a Harvard
radiation oncologist, said the research was of high quality. But he
urged caution in changing practices in the United States. He said
no change should occur until more time had passed to assure that
late complications such as heart attacks do not appear after five
years and until completion of a separate British study that will
continue longer than the Canadian one.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris said the findings would be applicable to Britain and
Canada, where radiation therapy is more restricted because of a
lack of facilities.

GIVING CREDIT FOR IMPROVED TEXAS SCHOOL SCORES &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;

AUSTIN, Texas _ I have heard the political line on TAAS often
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with Texas Gov. George W. Bush throughout much of the
country, I have listened to him brag repeatedly about the
improvements in student test scores in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And in Austin last week, Jim Nelson, Bush's hand-picked state
education commissioner, was elated as he announced that this
spring's statewide TAAS results had reached new heights.
</P>
<P>
   It was more good news for state bureaucrats and the would-be
president in their command posts and for thousands of students and
teachers on the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   Battlefield terms come to mind because the educational process
has become almost a war in our increasingly competitive world. In
the emerging global economy, we are told, our children aren't
merely competing against classmates for the best grades and the
best colleges, they are competing with kids on the other side of
the world for tomorrow's best jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a level of competition with which I am not totally
comfortable, because I fear our children may be sacrificing too
much of their childhoods for the sake of their futures. But I don't
pretend to be an educational expert.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, public education also is enshrouded in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates duel over educational records and
policy. Principals and teachers are under fire to improve student
performance _ and their campus report cards _ so that taxpayers can
be assured that they are getting their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   And, from an early age, Texas students are drilled on the
importance of our state's primary academic measuring stick, the
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (or TAAS) test, which they
begin taking in the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   The closest stretch of the front lines to my house is Kiker
Elementary School in suburban, southwest Austin, and the soldier I
know best is my 10-year-old daughter, Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Although seriously crowded, Kiker is a good school, thanks to
dedicated teachers and a large dose of parental involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who completes the fourth grade this week, is a good
student. And, fortunately, she is blissfully ignorant of how
important her test scores are to politicians, great and small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you worry much about the TAAS test?'' I asked her the
other day. ``Nah,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   She passed TAAS without any trouble in the third grade, and she
most likely passed this year, although we haven't seen her latest
scores yet.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor did have the distinction of being the last of Kiker's 200
fourth-graders to finish the math section of the TAAS when it was
administered last month. But that didn't seem to bother her.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite part was the writing test. Most of her friends
thought the writing exam was ``boring and hard,'' but she thought
it was ``fun and easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever it was, 98 percent of Kiker's fourth-graders passed
the writing test, one of Taylor's teachers announced after an
awards ceremony last week. She said the overall TAAS results at
Kiker were ``phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiker is an above-average school in a wealthier-than-average
school district. But improvements in TAAS scores were widespread
this spring. Test scores of minority students still lag behind
Anglos, but they continue to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The TAAS scores are less important to Taylor than they will be
to her younger brother, Adrian, who will have to pass the state's
standardized tests each year to be promoted to the next grade. That
law, which the Legislature enacted last year at Bush's urging, went
into effect with this year's kindergarten class.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the only TAAS test that students have to pass is the
exit-level test given in high school. They have to pass that test
to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   TAAS will be replaced within a few years with new standardized
exams covering more subjects, and there may be a rough inaugural
period.
</P>
<P>
   But the improving TAAS scores are good news _ and not simply
because students are scoring higher on standardized tests. More
importantly, let us hope, they reflect improvements in our public
education system.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, students, teachers, principals, parents _
and even some politicians _ deserve credit.

NO CRUISE CONTROL IN M:I-2?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Embargoed until after May 24, 2000) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turning ``Mission: Impossible'' into a viable movie franchise
was, to paraphrase a line from the espionage action attraction's
new sequel ``M:I-2,'' a mission very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The film faced agonizing delays at every step. Just getting off
the ground, to start with; for some two years following the 1996
``M:I's'' release, producer-star Tom Cruise was tied up working on
Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' one of the longest-running
productions in film history. And even after perfectionist Cruise
found the time to focus his attention exclusively on ``M:I-2,'' a
satisfying script for the picture proved frustratingly elusive. And
once the massive logistical task of filming the sequel finally got
under way, the production's main locations in and around Sydney,
Australia were hit with a plethora of problems both man-made and
beyond human control.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main concern overriding all of the individual
development, scheduling and production difficulties was the driving
desire to make a better movie. Although it was a blockbuster
international hit, Brian De Palma's first ``Mission'' film was
widely criticized for being incomprehensible, poorly paced and, by
some fans, a betrayal of the popular 1960s television show from
which it was derived. Profitable as it was, the film was viewed in
many quarters as the epitome of soulless commercialism; the kind of
thing that made Cruise a superstar in the likes of ``Top Gun'' and
``Cocktail,'' but which the more mature star of ``Jerry Maguire,''
the Kubrick film and ``Magnolia'' is evidently striving to
transcend.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise placed his hopes for a better second ``Mission'' on John
Woo, the Chinese director who made an international splash with the
balletically violent Hong Kong crime melodramas ``A Better
Tomorrow,'' ``The Killer'' and ``Hard Boiled.'' Since coming to
Hollywood, Woo has gradually worked his hyper-aestheticized,
bullet-riddled style into what would otherwise have been
standard-issue action pictures such as ``Broken Arrow'' and
``Face/Off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tom offered this project to me, I was a little surprised
because I'd never dreamed of making a `Mission: Impossible,'''
notes the 54-year-old Woo in broken yet somehow precise English.
``But he said that this would be a totally different movie, no need
to connect it to the first one. He wanted every episode to have a
different style from a different director; he wanted this one to be
John Woo's `Mission: Impossible.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was not good at special effects, that I'm
computer-blind,'' Woo adds with a throaty laugh. ``I like the real
thing and my style is more about the character, that people would
care more for him than they would about a computer. Tom agreed, and
he also wanted to make a classic, romantic spy movie, which I
thought was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The plotline that was settled on resembled the best example of
that particular approach: Alfred Hitchcock's 1946 ``Notorious,''
written by the esteemed Ben Hecht.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty much something that I wanted to play with,''
notes screenwriter Robert Towne, who came up with the ``Notorious''
gambit. ``You can actually use a love triangle to both generate
suspense and evolve the characters emotionally, while revealing
plot.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``M:I-2,'' Cruise's Ethan Hunt is assigned by the Impossible
Missions chief (Anthony Hopkins in a flavorful cameo) to convince
international jewel thief Nyah Hall (British actress Thandie
Newton) to re-enter the life of a former lover, Sean Ambrose
(Dougray Scott), a more ruthless master thief. Ambrose has stolen
an experimental virus antidote from an Australian pharmaceutical
manufacturer, and must be stopped by any means necessary from
obtaining and unleashing the killer bug it was tested against.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is the fact Hunt and Hall fall in love
before he sends her off to seduce Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inspired by the movie `Notorious,' '' Woo confirms.
``We just took the spirit of it, though. The idea was to have good
and evil both in love with the same woman. Tom and Robert Towne
came up with that whole structure for this movie, just try to make
it modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Towne, the widely revered screenwriter of some classic '70s
films himself (``Chinatown,'' ``Shampoo''), has been Cruise's
favorite script doctor for years. He tried, with mixed results, to
add a little narrative sense to ``Days of Thunder,'' ``The Firm''
and the first ``Mission,'' but the assignment he chose to accept
this time around was probably the most daunting yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were other writers involved with this before I was,''
Towne explains. ``And John had been on it for some six to eight
months. He had developed some flashy action sequences in his own
unique way and preproduction had gone rather far down the line to
implement them. So I based my story on what he presented me. It was
certainly different, but let me put it this way: unless you're
deeply masochistic, it's not something that you'd want to do very
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, having said that, it was great fun to do. The challenge
was to fit a story into that `Mission: Impossible' world, and make
that world and story as credible as possible. In a word, I tried to
seek the right tone. It's never going to be gritty realism, but
within its own fantastical framework, it had to have a certain
demanding discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Demanding was the operating adjective once production finally
got under way in Australia last May. Rain washed out entire
shooting days and curtailed others. A major hailstorm even damaged
a number of expensive vehicles _ before Woo, a cinematic master of
mechanized mayhem, was prepared to wreck them.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I were looking at some casting tapes when we heard,
virtually, this explosion,'' recalls Paula Wagner, Cruise's
producing partner. ``We looked up, and hail the size of baseballs
was coming from everywhere at terminal velocity. And we had 40 days
of rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Other complications included a local cinematographer, Andrew
Lesnie (``Babe''), who had never shot a film in anamorphic
widescreen before and had to be replaced with American ``Top Gun''
shooter Jeffrey Kimball. Though Woo insists the change was made
solely to help speed up the already behind-schedule production _
and he heartily recommended Lesnie to his next employer, ``Lord of
the Rings'' director Peter Jackson _ the move did not endear the
above-the-line bosses to the Australian crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little difficulty because of the union thing, too,''
Woo adds. ``They had just started, so they made so many rules, and
there's only one union for everything _ actors, stuntmen, crew. But
we were able to compromise, and they turned out to be very
dedicated and talented people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other problems arose. Scott hurt his back during one of the
film's numerous, ridiculous motorcycle stunts, prompting another
weeklong delay. Even worse, permits to film an elaborate climactic
chase through the streets of Sydney were refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that they couldn't afford to block the traffic
for four weeks while we shot the scene,'' Woo says,
characteristically polite but still perturbed. ``But we had to stop
the whole production again and redesign all the action.''
</P>
<P>
   But the worst moments for Woo were on a mesa in Utah. That's
where Ethan Hunt's introductory scene, a rock climbing vacation,
was filmed; and where Cruise insisted on doing all of his own
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand feet up. With only a single, thin cable to hold
him, and nothing to catch him on the ground or prevent him from
smashing into the cliff face during harrowing jumps.
</P>
<P>
   Through seven nail-biting takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up on top of the mesa, praying for him and sweating and
panicking,'' Woo admits. ``I couldn't even watch the monitor, I was
so worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Post-production rumors have made it seem like Cruise was even
more worrisome in the editing room, as pressure mounted to ensure
the over- budget (more than $100 million, originally priced at $80
million) and past due (first slated for release last Christmas)
film achieved a commercially crucial PG-13 rating. Top Hollywood
action editor Stuart Baird was brought in to assist with the
cutting, some believe to tone down Woo's trademark ballistic
overindulgence.
</P>
<P>
   But while acknowledging that creative conflicts occurred at
various stages of the long, tortured production, Woo insists Cruise
never tried to hijack the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom gave me a lot of great respect,'' Woo says. ``Arguments
happen in every movie; they just draw attention. But he listened to
me all the time. Even when he had different ideas, in the end he
always wanted my approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to see whether a worldwide audience feels
``M:I-2'' is as improved as its makers hoped.
</P>
<P>
   But for Woo, typically, success will be judged in personal
rather than economic terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a rich and romantic film,'' he says, ``And I
feel like so many people understand me now and encourage me. I hope
this makes them want me to make more good movies for them.''

ARKANSAS LEGAL PANEL RECOMMENDS CLINTON BE DISBARRED 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme
Court recommended on Monday that President Clinton be disbarred
because of his ``serious misconduct'' in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional
Conduct, concluded that Clinton should receive the most severe
sanction _ the loss of his state license to practice law _ for
providing false testimony about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Under the committee rules, the disbarment recommendation will
now be considered by a Pulaski County circuit court judge in Little
Rock, who will oversee any disbarment proceedings. If the judge
decides to disbar Clinton, the president can appeal that decision
to the Arkansas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in an interview broadcast on Monday night that he
would vigorously defend himself, but he would not participate in
disbarment proceedings in Arkansas. Clinton said he had promised
the American people after the impeachment trial ended that he would
not ``personally involve'' himself in such matters until he left
office. ``It's not right,'' he said in an NBC News interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I agreed even to appeal it is that my lawyers
look at all the precedents and they said there's no way in the
world, if they just treat you like everybody else has been treated,
that this is even close to that kind of case,'' Clinton said. ``So
the precedents contradict this decision and ultimately the decision
has to be made by a judge. And so we're going to give the judge a
chance to do what we believe is right, and I think that's the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had argued earlier this month that his 20 years of
public service should persuade the panel to be lenient and not
impose any sanction harsher than a reprimand. He also insisted
again that he did not technically lie before a federal judge in the
Jones case. The president maintained that his answers under oath
denying a sexual relationship with Lewinsky were technically
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton was the first president to be held in
contempt of court by a federal judge. The president could avoid the
disbarment proceedings if he voluntarily surrendered his Arkansas
law license, but his personal lawyer, David E. Kendall, also
rejected that option on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recommendation is wrong and clearly contradicted by
precedent,'' Kendall said on Monday. ``We will vigorously dispute
it in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision on Monday moves Clinton one step closer to
becoming the first American president to be disbarred while still
in office. Richard M. Nixon was disbarred in July 1976 by the
Appellate Division of the New York state Supreme Court on charges
of obstruction of justice connected with the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's recommendation to disbar Clinton surprised some
legal experts, who said that it seemed harsh when compared to
similar attorney disciplinary cases decided in Arkansas. The
committee imposes sanctions on as many as 100 people a year who are
licensed to practice law in Arkansas. Only in cases in which a
lawyer has stolen money from a client does the seven-member
committee typically recommend disbarment, the most severe penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not practiced law since the early 1980s, between his
first and second terms as governor of Arkansas. And although he has
said he does not intend to practice law upon leaving the White
House in January 2001, the president, a Yale Law School graduate,
has vigorously defended himself against the state disciplinary
proceedings. It is not clear what practical effect a disbarment
would have on Clinton's career after he leaves the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman declined to comment, referring all
questions to Kendall. But White House officials said they were not
encouraged about the president's chances after eight of the
committee's panelists had recused themselves, most of them citing
potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Six panelists of the disciplinary committee heard the
president's case on Friday. Five are lawyers and the sixth is a
retired school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Monday to the Arkansas Supreme Court's clerk,
James A. Neal, the executive director of the disciplinary panel,
wrote that disbarment proceedings should begin ``against attorney
William Jefferson Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the committee had concluded ``that certain of the
attorney's conduct as demonstrated in the complaints constituted
serious misconduct in violation'' of two rules of the Arkansas
Model Rules of Professional Conduct, wrote Neal, whose retirement
from the panel was also announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee on Friday considered two complaints against the
president, one filed by the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a
conservative organization in Atlanta, and another by Judge Susan
Webber Wright, the federal judge who presided over the case in
which Paula Jones accused Clinton of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   During a January 1998 deposition in that case, Clinton testified
under oath that he had not engaged in a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky. Although the president has continued to insist that his
answer was ``legally accurate,'' Wright disagreed. On April 12,
1999, she held the president in contempt, fined him $90,000 and
referred the matter to the Arkansas bar committee for possible
disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Wright did not suggest a specific penalty. But the Southeastern
Legal Foundation had asked that Clinton be disbarred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the committee's decision sends a message to the
American people that the rules which govern attorney conduct will
be enforced,'' said Matthew J. Glavin, the president of the
Southeastern Legal Foundation. ``This committee, under tremendous
public and political pressure, has done its duty in issuing a
serious sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers had attempted to put off the proceedings
until the president left office, and they were surprised when the
committee had refused the bid to delay the matter.

FRENCHY BORDAGARAY IS DEAD; THE COLORFUL DODGER WAS 90 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frenchy Bordagaray, who staged a one-man mustache revival in the
major leagues while playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1936,
becoming the personification of the Daffy Dodger, died April 13 at
a nursing home in Ventura, Calif. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of Depression America, the Dodgers of the 1930s were
down and out. The seats at Ebbets Field (usually empty) were
crumbling, and the ball club was mired in the second division. Babe
Herman, who ran himself into the three-men-on-a-base fiasco of the
1920s, was long gone. But the Dodgers still had their characters,
most notably Manager Casey Stengel and a free-spirited
outfielder-third baseman known as Frenchy.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley George Bordagaray got his nickname from his mother when
he was growing up in Coalinga, Calif., in a family of French
descent. His father wanted the boy to be a violinist, but he
preferred to play sports, starring in baseball, football and track
at Fresno State University.
</P>
<P>
   Bordagaray debuted in the major leagues with the Chicago White
Sox in 1934 and joined the Dodgers the following season. When he
arrived at spring training in Daytona Beach, Fla., in 1936, he
stunned the baseball world by wearing a mustache and goatee. The
mustache was grown the previous winter for a bit part in the
Hollywood movie ``The Prisoner of Shark Island,'' an account of the
jailing of Dr. Samuel Mudd for complicity in the assassination of
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Mustaches had been as common as spittoons in the baseball
clubhouses of the 1890s, but only a few players had worn them after
the turn of the century. Wally Schang may have been the last one to
grow a mustache before Bordagaray, when he caught for the 1914
Philadelphia Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making $3,000 a year playing baseball, so I figured I
could at least have fun while I was not getting rich,'' Bordagaray
once explained. ``But after I had it about two months, Casey called
me into the clubhouse and said, `If anyone's going to be a clown on
this club, it's going to be me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bordagaray shaved, and the mustache wouldn't make a comeback
until the 1970's, when Charlie Finley, the Oakland owner, slipped
$300 to every Athletics player who grew one.
</P>
<P>
   Bordagaray found other ways to torment Stengel. When he was
picked off second base in a game with the Chicago Cubs, Stengel
argued with the umpire that Bordagaray had been standing on the bag
the whole time. But Bordagaray told Stengel that he had been
tapping the bag and had been caught in between taps.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers finished seventh in 1936, Stengel was fired
and Bordagaray was shipped to the St. Louis Cardinals. The would-be
violinist then switched to the fiddle and washboard, playing in
Pepper Martin's Mudcats band on the Fox theater circuit at $50 a
show.
</P>
<P>
   Bordagaray later played for the Reds and the Yankees, then
returned to the Dodgers during World War II. He donned a fake beard
as a member of the Battling Beavers team in the 1944 Red Skelton
film ``Whistling in Brooklyn,'' filmed in part at Ebbets Field.
</P>
<P>
   Antics aside, Bordagaray, a right-handed hitter, had good speed
and a fine batting eye, playing 11 seasons with a career average of
.283.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Victoria, of Ventura; two sons,
Stanley II of Palo Alto, Calif., and Christopher of Port Orchard,
Wash.; two daughters, Stanna Lee Jones of Lindsay, Calif., and
Germaine Bordagaray of Ventura; a brother, Ernie, of Bakersfield,
Calif.; two sisters, Isabelle Storey of Seal Beach, Calif., and
Rose Nay of Fresno, Calif.; seven grandchildren; and six
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Bordagaray's baseball career ended in midsummer of 1947, when he
was suspended for the rest of the season for attacking an umpire
while managing the Greenville (S.C.) Spinners of the South Atlantic
League. After that, he turned to buying property for conversion to
cemetery use.
</P>
<P>
   Bordagaray loved being the center of attention, as he no doubt
was one day when his Dodgers beat the Cardinals, 4-3. ``I accounted
for all seven runs,'' he recalled. ``I knocked in four myself and
played a Terry Moore hit into a three-run homer.''

REBELS FREE HALF OF FORCE FROM THE U.N. IN AFRICA WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Nearly half the peacekeepers seized in Sierra
Leone this month have been released, the United Nations said
Monday. Officials added that they hoped that releases would
continue in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   With the freeing of 29 additional troops Monday, 233 of the 500
hostages have now been turned over, United Nations officials said
here.
</P>
<P>
   But as more hostages have been released, rebels have also been
calling for their leader, Foday Sankoh, to be freed, raising
concerns that the rebels may continue to hold the troops while
bargaining for their leader's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed strengthening
the United Nations force, to 16,500 from the authorized 13,000. He
also said in a report to the Security Council that even more
soldiers might be needed later.
</P>
<P>
   In his report and in comments to reporters, Annan blamed Sankoh,
who is in the custody of the Sierra Leone government, for the
crisis in the country. Annan recommended that the council consider
imposing new sanctions on Sankoh and his Revolutionary United
Front, adding that the guerrilla leader had no future role in
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe by his behavior he has excluded himself from the
process,'' Annan said. The secretary-general said Sierra Leone's
diamonds, which financed Sankoh, should be taken out of rebel hands
and turned over to the government and people of the country. The
diamonds are one of Sierra Leone's few natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown on Monday morning, two Nigerians on duty were killed
when armed men described as former Sierra Leone army soldiers
entered the Nigerians' barracks and demanded the release of a
fellow soldier who was apparently being detained there.
</P>
<P>
   A gun battle erupted, and the Nigerians and a former soldier
died. Several former Sierra Leone soldiers were reportedly injured.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, about six mutilated bodies wearing
peacekeepers' uniforms were found northeast of Freetown. U.N.
officials said they did not have enough information to know
victims' identities.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian soldiers were sent to the area to examine the site and
the bodies. But the group does not have a forensic expert,
according to a spokeswoman for the United Nations here, Marie
Okabe. Uniforms of Nigerian and Zambian troops were stolen a few
weeks ago, so the presence of just uniforms would not necessarily
identify the men, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims appear to have been shot in the head at close range.

 &HT;    Murderously melodic: Eminem raps everything
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   What will really bother mainstream America about this album is
that it contains every off-putting scenario a sick mind could
conjure up. But then it has the nerve to be a melodic nightmare.
Something the kids can sing along to.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem (producer Dr. Dre's most gifted protege since Snoop Dogg)
spins incredibly twisted tales of murder, makes fun of Christopher
Reeve and sings a death threat (``Kill You''). Then, in his nasal,
smart-aleck tone, the Grammy-winning rapper born Marshall Mathers
continues to fire away at every boy band, nosy reporter and suing
relative in sight. Leaving in his wake a second album so well-done
it earns its parental advisory sticker and accolades at the same
time.

 &HT;    Though her dream of singing stardom has yet to come true, Jan
Smith of Snellville, Ga., has found her calling as a vocal teacher
for the rock set
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her motherly eyes, Southern accent and T-shirt and jeans,
Jan Smith, 43, of Snellville, Ga., doesn't seem at first glance
like someone who'd have a triple platinum rock album hanging on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her sunny office _ in a converted grammar school
building just down the road from Emory University _ she looks more
like a hip schoolteacher waiting at a utilitarian metal desk for a
conference with a student. But there it is, the glamorous trophy,
tucked in a frame like a photo of a favored child.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque is from MTV supergroup matchbox twenty, the scruffy
Orlando rock band that has sold a phenomenal 10 million copies of
its 1996 debut album, ``Yourself or Someone Like You,'' with the
radio hits ``Push,'' ``3am,'' ``Real World'' and ``Back to Good.''
Smith's big voice, honed through years fronting Atlanta rock bands,
isn't on the album. But her imprint is everywhere. She is lead
singer Rob Thomas's vocal coach.
</P>
<P>
   When the baby-faced rock star was at the studio microphone
bouncing out the lyric ``well I will, well I will,'' Smith was by
his side, talking to him like a trainer in the corner of a boxing
match: ``Slow down. Go with me. Reach for it.'' She listened to
playback for hours, helping producer Matt Serletic pick the best
tracks, the ones where Thomas' passionate bar-band vocals nailed
the songs. When the band began its tour of clubs, Smith was there
too, hanging with kids in sock caps and flannel shirts during smoky
sound checks. And at this year's Grammy Awards, the tough vocal
maestro was backstage in Thomas' dressing room, helping him warm up
before performing the record and song of the year, ``Smooth,'' with
Carlos Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in stores today is the new matchbox twenty CD ``mad
season,'' on which Smith directed vocals. And lead singer Thomas
doesn't hesitate to give her mountains of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the bomb. She has done amazing things for me,'' he says
on the eve of his highly anticipated follow-up's release. ``Get a
hold of the last matchbox twenty album and listen to this one. They
are testaments to Jan. She's really taught me the subtleties of
singing. Since I met her, I have gained two octaves on my voice.
I'm from the school of `I can sing and I don't need anybody to show
me.' But Jan has made all the difference in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The international stage of the Grammys is a long way from the
modest house in Forest Park, Ga., where Smith grew up, watching the
awards show each year plopped in front of her parents' television
set. She remembers the moment in 1974 when her idol, Joni Mitchell,
picked up the Grammy for ``Down to You'' from ``Court and Spark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There just weren't a lot of girls with guitars back then,''
Smith recalls. ``I knew right then that these were the people who
were it. The Grammy became an icon for me. It is everything I grew
up believing in.''
</P>
<P>
   While other girls at Forest Park Senior High were trying out for
cheerleading, Smith sat in her room hunched over a microphone
recording four-part harmonies into a Sony reel-to-reel. Her father,
the songleader at McDonough, Ga., Heights Baptist Church, fueled
her passion by taking her to gospel shows at Atlanta's old
Municipal Auditorium. At 15, she joined a rock band called Messiah,
playing local dances and clubs. By 1979, when her friends began
flashing engagement rings, Smith was one of Atlanta's barefoot Rock
Chicks, tossing her long blonde hair while screaming into the
microphone at clubs such as Alex Cooley's Electric Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her instincts for vocal interpretation are uncanny,'' recalls
Mike Greene, the old friend and Atlanta musician who went on to
become president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences (the Grammy folks). ``She is a straight shooter who leads
by example and lives life very large.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a member of the boys' club took its toll. By age 17, Smith
found herself in drug rehab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that whole hippie thing. The music was infested with
drugs,'' she recalls. ``I tell people, `Hey, the real Woodstock
happened in my lifetime.'''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the excesses of the world of rock, Smith enrolled at
Georgia College in Milledgeville and earned a degree in psychology.
For eight years, she worked in a DeKalb County, Ga., day program
for disturbed adolescents. But her muse kept tugging at her sleeve.
She went back to singing at nights, with the dream of making it as
a rock star.
</P>
<P>
   Success as a singer was elusive _ no major recording contracts,
no hit records. Then something completely unexpected happened: She
found her life's work as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1986 visit to the old Clark Music store in Atlanta, she
ran into the owner of the Atlanta School of Rock, who asked Smith
if she would be willing to give voice lessons to the lead singer of
a local band, the Torpedos. Almost by accident, she discovered that
she could take the elements of classical vocal training _
breathing, intonation, reaching for the diaphragm _ and apply it to
the often reckless and free-form world of rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most instructors are classically trained and don't consider
rock legitimate,'' she says. ``In classical music, you are trained
to reflect what the composer wants. Rock is such an individual
thumbprint for a vocalist, and you don't want to change that. Think
about Bonnie Raitt or Eddie Vedder. When you turn on the radio, you
can recognize their sound immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, Smith had so many clients in her Rolodex that she was
able to quit her day job. Eventually she opened a small studio,
where she worked with local acts such as Kristin Hall and
Collective Soul. It was through her relationship with that
Stockbridge band that she met 15-year-old Serletic, a Stone
Mountain prodigy who was then playing in the studio with the group.
As his star rose in the early 1990s, Serletic often turned to Smith
for help in getting the best out of the young vocalists he had
begun producing.
</P>
<P>
   Such as Rob Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Serletic sent the high school dropout _ with his torn
jeans and a sock hat pulled over his head _ to Smith's Decatur,
Ga., office for some advice. At the time, Thomas' voice was
powerful but raw. Like many rock stars, he wasn't sure he needed
anyone (especially a tough, middle-aged woman) to tell him what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, it's all about attaching to the emotional
side and feeling what you're singing,'' Thomas explains. ``But on
the technical side, it's about breath control and opening up your
throat. That was the hardest part at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith stood by Thomas' side at Tree Sound, the Norcross, Ga.,
recording studio where matchbox twenty's first album was recorded.
He found that she was no pushover, her clipped voice putting him
through the paces like a horse trainer with a whip.
</P>
<P>
   The visibility, which Smith describes as ``an incredible ride,''
has been more than she ever imagined. She has a waiting list of
people clamoring for her services and plans to open a division of
Jan Smith Studios in Nashville this summer. Underneath the crisp,
professional exterior, however, she often relaxes into the
starstruck teenager who dreamed of having her own Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part,'' she says, ``is to be at the prime of my
career and know it may never happen for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith still wants to be a star in her own right. But at 43, with
years of knocking on doors be-
</P>
<P>
   hind her, is that still a possibility?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hasn't she made it as an artist herself? Who the hell
knows,'' says Eddie Owen, owner of the Decatur club Eddie's Attic.
``Anybody who works in this business knows being at the right place
at the right time is one ingredient you can't muster up on your
own. ... If you're an artist and ever feel you've lost your
chances, it's all over. I believe it takes keeping a mystical eye
on the grand prize to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith seems to have that covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are here for two things: To help each other, and
to have a good time,'' she says. ``We are each doing here what the
spirit has called us to do. You don't take money with you, or fame.
Elvis is dead. He's still dead.
</P>

   ``(Music) is the language of the heart. The closest I know I can
be to God is when I'm singing.''

 &HT;    Book excerpt sets stage for city's 1913 brush with anarchy
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Infamous Leo Frank lynching case revisited in Atlanta magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A painful chapter of Atlanta's history will be spotlighted June
13 when Alfred Uhry's Tony Award-winning musical ``Parade'' debuts
at the Fox Theatre. It's the story of the city's most infamous
homicide case _ the murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan and the
conviction and lynching of Jewish businessman Leo Frank more than
80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case that has obsessed former Atlanta writer Steve Oney.
Now, after a dozen years of research, Oney has finished what is
touted as the definitive book about the episode, with several
explosive revelations. To be published next winter, the
as-yet-untitled book is excerpted in the June issue of Atlanta
($3.50).
</P>
<P>
   In the two-chapter excerpt, Oney sets the scene for the tragic
events of April 26, 1913, and points out the chasm that existed
between the haves and have-nots, as well as a growing
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   While elegantly attired Atlantans attended a touring performance
of the New York Metropolitan Opera Company (Arturo Toscanini was
conducting and Enrico Caruso was singing), children as young as 10
were laboring 11 hours a day in mills and factories. One of them
was Mary Phagan, who was found dead the next morning at the
National Pencil Co. As Atlanta Editor in Chief Lee Walburn notes in
his column, the subsequent trial and lynching would be as close as
the city has ever come to anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  FINAL WORDS: In a fitting Memorial Day issue, Time ($3.50)
pays tribute to American veterans with a selection of last letters
from soldiers who were killed in action in both world wars, Korea
and Vietnam. Eloquent and heartbreaking in their simplicity, these
are the final words from ordinary men to their loved ones. ``These
epistles haunt the soul the same way the best war poems do,''
writes historian Douglas Brinkley, ``perhaps even more poignantly,
because we know what their authors didn't. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In one note, a soldier stationed in India writes his girlfriend
a marriage proposal and describes a rainbow he had seen an hour
after sundown. His sweetheart wrote back saying she'd marry him,
but he never got the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Selected from Andrew Carroll's Legacy Project, a nonprofit
initiative that seeks out historically significant wartime letters,
these final notes will be published as a book next May.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE GREAT OUTDOORS: The premiere issue of Wildlife Journal
($3.95) hits the stands this week, with informative and
well-written articles ranging from a profile of former ``Wild
Kingdom'' star Jim Fowler to an update on the Endangered Species
Act. Published by Emmis Communications and edited by Marietta-based
Steve Walburn, son of Atlanta magazine editor Lee Walburn, the
quarterly is devoted to covering all aspects of wildlife and the
natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  QUICK READS: Atlanta Citymag ($3.95) offers a summer guide to
what's hot, from fashions to travel. Also of note is a profile of
TV and movie casting queen Shay Bentley-Griffin, who has supplied
local talent for projects such as TNT's ``Andersonville'' and
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.''

 &HT;    Barry Sherman's legacy of excellence
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A bittersweet mood hung over Monday's luncheon for
the 59th Peabody Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The elation of those winning what's widely considered to be
broadcast journalism's highest honor was undercut by the absence of
Barry Sherman, the University of Georgia professor and longtime
Peabody director who died from a sudden heart attack three weeks
ago at the age of 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still disbelieving Barry's dead,'' said Peabody board
member Ed Bark, echoing many of those at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
where the luncheon was held. ``I was walking by the hotel the other
night and saw someone who looked just like Barry _ it was like in
`The Sixth Sense.' I keep half expecting him to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes talked about the standard of excellence Sherman
set for the awards, which are administered annually by the UGA
school of journalism and mass communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering what is an appropriate tribute,'' Barnes told
an opulent, opera-house-style room packed with such notable
journalists and celebrities as Peter Jennings, Tom Wolfe and
Lorraine Bracco. ``But being here and seeing all of you here, what
(he would have wanted) is to continue this great work.''
</P>
<P>
   A film tribute of Sherman was shown. Later, Sheila Nevins, while
accepting a 15th Peabody for her work in original programming at
HBO, said that ``the Peabodys were Barry Sherman'' and that she now
thinks of her award as the ``George Foster Peabody Barry Sherman
Award.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Dale Russell accepted a Peabody for the investigative
team from Atlanta's WAGA-TV, which won for its series on racial
profiling by U.S. Customs agents at Hartsfield International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's humbling,'' Russell said of the event, which was hosted
by NBC's Matt Lauer. ``I look around this room and see Bud
Greenspan, Aaron Sorkin (creator of `West Wing') _ I wanted to ask
him who got shot in that last episode.''
</P>
<P>
   WAGA news director Budd McEntee called the Peabody ``the
ultimate,'' and said that, at a time when many local news
organizations are cutting back on investigative reporting, winning
such an award helps keep a unit like the I-Team together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirms why we do what we do, and reaffirms the mission,''
he said. ``These awards confirm the need for more investigative
reporting.'' Other winners echoed that thought. Jennings said that
ABC's Peabody for its 24-hour, globe-trotting coverage of the new
millennium ``confirms for me Americans are interested in the rest
of the world.'' CBS's Bob Simon, who won for international
reporting, said, ``It's reassuring to know that if you do bad
things in Cincinnati or the Philippines or Bosnia, you're going to
wind up on this screen,'' referring to the film montage of winners
that preceded the awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we're here, when I see all these other
winners,'' said David Chase, creator of HBO's ``The Sopranos.'' ``I
never expected to be anywhere near this award, because of the
nature of our show.''
</P>
<P>
   Also winning were the producers of the PBS ``Frontline''
documentary ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County,'' which was the
highest rated show on GPTV last year and has been repeated numerous
times.
</P>
<P>
   Co-producer Rachel Dretzin, who spent five months in Georgia
filming teenagers whose widespread sexual activities led to a 1996
syphilis outbreak in suburban Atlanta, said she was ``astonished''
by the reaction to the film. Co-producer and husband Barak Goodman
added, ``We expected a certain amount of resistance, and we got
some of that. But the community also took responsibility for what
happened. We got them to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the memory of Sherman that continued throughout the
ceremony. As HBO's Nevins put it, ``Everybody's saying `Barry would
have liked this,' or `Barry would have liked that.' But you know
what Barry would have liked? He would have liked to be here.''

 &HT;    Carter: Mental illness stigma
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Georgia, more than 1.65 million residents struggle with
mental illness, and one in eight have severe conditions. To raise
awareness, and help those in need, Rosalynn Carter has for more
than a decade hosted the annual Georgia Mental Health Forum, where
350 consumers and policy-makers gathered Monday in Atlanta to hear
Surgeon General David Satcher talk via teleconference about a
historic 500-page report he released in December on mental illness,
compiled from more than 3,000 studies. The report found that nearly
half of all mentally ill Americans do not seek treatment and, in
many cases, face an enduring stigma, a lack of services and
inequity in insurance coverage. As many as 825,000 Georgians sought
mental health treatment last year. Carter took a break from the
forum to talk with medical writer Diane Lore about the report's
impact on mental health policy and care.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you assess the state of mental health care in this
country. Are people getting the treatment they need?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would say we would rank as ``poor'' ... or ``could do a lot
better.'' At least half of the people who need treatment still
don't get it. And many of those who are critically ill are
absolutely not getting the care they need. We still have a cycle of
people getting hospitalized for a short while and then landing back
on the street. We really need a plan where they can go to a
community center where they can get the care they need.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The confidentiality of mental health records has been a
concern for you _ how is that issue developing nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's still pretty dismal. With managed care, we still have so
many people who can access records. We still have not made any
progress with a bill in Congress. And it's still a very important
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What changes would you like to see in mental health?
</P>
<P>
   A: The main, most important thing, at the national level is to
pass laws requiring parity in insurance. I think that would do the
greatest good in eliminating stigma. ... (a lot of people believe)
if insurance covers (a condition), then it must be all right to
have. We've had 31 states pass parity laws, but often they are very
narrow in scope. Also, insurance often gets around true parity by
imposing higher co-payments and fewer days for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there things happening _ in Georgia or elsewhere _ that
you would hold up as models for diagnosis, treatment or prevention?
</P>
<P>
   A: I believe Skyland Trail, a treatment facility here in
Atlanta, is doing an excellent job, because its services are simply
state-of-the-art. I also think Community Friendship and Project
Interconnections, which deals with the homeless mentally ill and
are located here, are taking a good approach. The National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill is also supporting a program for the seriously
mentally ill called Program for Assertive Community Treatment that
is wonderful. It takes a holistic approach, which is really a good
way to go. Depression and anxiety screening days also are helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the best changes to occur in the field of mental
health in the past 10 to 15 years?
</P>
<P>
   A: Scientific research and the development of the consumer
movement. Those two things have made a total difference in what's
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what would you change in mental health if you could?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would wipe out stigma. Stigma remains our greatest
challenge. There seems to be a little glimmer of hope, but we still
have a long way to go. Part of the reason is the misconception that
mental health is the result of a weak will or a moral defect or bad
parenting. Too often, families still believe that if (patients)
wanted to, they could just snap out of it. That's part of the
reason the surgeon general's report is so important _ it gives us a
real chance to have science back our case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What impact do you think the surgeon general's report will
have?
</P>
<P>
   A: The report gives us the scientific basis we need to make a
case to policymakers. It will help us tell the public the true
facts (about mental illness) instead of the myth and
misconceptions. It also calls attention to mental illness on a
national level, promoting awareness and helping people do away with
the stigma.

HARVARD PRESIDENT TO STEP DOWN NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE DEMBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ After nine years at the pinnacle of higher
education, Harvard University president Neil L. Rudenstine said
Monday that he plans to step down in June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine, 65, will leave Harvard far wealthier and stronger
than at any time in its history, both friends and foes agreed. Many
called him a local and national leader among his peers. Even those
who fault him for failing to take full advantage of the bully
pulpit that is Harvard praise his national leadership on the issue
of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a good run, and it's time for someone else,''
Rudenstine said. ``The institution is strong enough financially
where someone else ought to be willing to step forward and do some
bold things.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he departs, Rudenstine will have served a decade,
three years longer than the national average for college
presidents. He came back from a three-month medical leave in
1994-1995 to raise the largest sum ever for an institution of
higher learning _ $2.6 billion _ to resolve the question of
Radcliffe's future, and to begin a long process of unifying a
balkanized campus. Observers on and off campus said he will be
remembered most for those three efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leaves the institution in the strongest financial postion
it's been in in its whole life,'' said Rudenstine's predecessor,
Derek Bok.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard today is more inclusive, more cohesive, more
interdisciplinary and more engaged with the larger world,'' added
Robert G. Stone Jr., who heads Harvard's governing board. Stone and
other members of the Harvard Corporation will likely begin the
process of searching for Rudenstine's successor this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine said he is proudest of his work developing the
Afro-American Studies Department into the preeminent such program
in the nation, with such academic superstars as Henry Louis Gates
Jr., Cornell West and William Julius Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, the department chairman, in turn, joined others in
praising Rudenstine's national leadership on diversity, the one
issue on which he abandoned his typical behind-the-scenes approach
to take a public stand. Rudenstine organized other presidents to
fight efforts to gut affirmative action and published evidence of
the benefits of a diverse campus to society.
</P>
<P>
   He was not as successful in bringing diversity to all aspects of
campus, however. While three of the five Harvard vice presidents
are women, up from one when he arrived, all eight of the deans he
appointed are white males.
</P>
<P>
   His presidency is marked by some other contradictions. He
recruited top faculty in many fields, including professor Lani
Guinier in the Law School and Laurel T. Ulrich, a Pulitzer Prize
winner, in history, but made little dent in Harvard's
student-faculty ratio, which at 8 to 1 is higher than some
comparable institutions. Harvard College expects to add more
faculty in the near future, however, with funds from the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He more than doubled the number of senior women faculty from 85
to 183, but acknowledges that the percentage of women in the
faculty remains low.
</P>
<P>
   He began the process of breaking down the independent tradition
of Harvard's professional schools, reinstating the position of
provost to help set university-wide academic policy and
establishing high-profile interdisciplinary programs on the
environment, and cognitive science among others.
</P>
<P>
   But the schools remain independent fiefdoms for the most part.
``Neil was too nice a guy'' to make a lot of progress in that area,
said a former university faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine defends his efforts in that arena, saying, ``It took
more than a century to create the current system. I think it would
be odd if you could change all of that in a decade _ and I'm not
sure you want to change it all. Besides, I don't think banging
heads in a university is a way to make progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine was a Rhodes Scholar who graduated from Princeton and
studied for three years at Oxford. With an expertise in Renaissance
literature, he received a doctorate from Harvard, where he later
taught, then left for Princeton where he was a faculty member and
senior administrator. He served as Princeton's provost from 1977 to
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Over his tenure as Harvard president, some have faulted him for
taking too soft a stance on internal matters, or taking too long to
make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil is adverse to conflict, so he finds hard decisions harder
than some. He is so nice, he hates to hurt people,'' said a
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also revered for his thoughtfulness, his strength of
intellect and deep commitment to liberal arts education in an
increasingly specialized world.
</P>
<P>
   ``His administration will be remembered for its integrity and
authenticity,'' said Stanley Ikenberry, president of the American
Council on Education. ``He was successful in moving the university
to a new level. And he is viewed by his peers as a moral and
intellectual leader and mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil's style is not prone to exhibitionism. But within the
academic community, he has been a strong voice,'' Ikenberry said.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of the job also proved draining at times. In 1994,
Rudenstine surprised the faculty and administration by taking a
three month medical leave, saying he was exhausted. He said upon
his return in early 1995 that he spent much of the time reading and
writing, something that the job as president didn't allow him to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said Rudenstine had been an effective
advocate for research funding and student financial aid. Much of
that work was one-on-one, according to Ikenberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept his sights _ and ours _ on what we are here for _ the
intellectual and academic matters,'' Jeremy Knowles, dean of the
faculty of arts and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Rudenstine also served as a unifying force
among disparate colleges and universities, according to Tufts
president John DiBiaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's called us together to talk about issues of mutual
concern,'' said DiBiaggio. Rudenstine, he said, hosted several
dinners for local presidents from both public and private
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine said his biggest regret is mishandling the purchase
and planned development of 52 acres of land in Allston. The
university stirred Mayor Thomas M. Menino's ire for its secret
purchase of the land over many years. But Rudenstine squared the
matter with the city last year, by agreeing to pay $40 million in
lieu of taxes to the city over the next 40 years and to build new
student housing there.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Harvard University also announced a $20 million
loan project to renovate or build housing for low to middle-income
residents in Boston and Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we are where we want to be but Harvard,
stepping up its commitment, was moving to the right direction and I
think Neil had a lot to do with it,'' said Cambridge Mayor Anthony
Galluccio. ``We are a little disappointed to hear the news because
I think he is someone we could have worked with to strengthen the
town-gown relationship.''

COURT SIDESTEPS CONSTITUTIONALITY IN ARSON AND FALSE CLAIMS
RULINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind., Vt.) (See also SCOTUS-CABLE-TV, SCOTUS-CLEANAIR) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court took a step back Monday from its
ongoing confrontation with Congress over the boundaries of federal
authority, interpreting two federal laws in a manner that avoided
the need to rule on challenges to the statutes' constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   The court unanimously interpreted the federal arson law as not
applying to a house used solely as a private residence. Dewey J.
Jones, sentenced to 35 years in federal prison for throwing a
molotov cocktail into a cousin's house, had challenged his
conviction on the ground that Congress' power to regulate
interstate commerce did not extend to making such an act a federal
crime. The justices Monday vacated the conviction on the narrower,
purely statutory ground that the law ``does not reach an
owner-occupied residence that is not used for any commercial
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   In a second case, the court ruled that Congress did not intend
to make the states liable to suit by private plaintiffs under the
False Claims Act, a federal law that allows individuals to sue on
the government's behalf for claims of fraud in government
contracting.
</P>
<P>
   This 7-2 decision avoided the deeper constitutional issue of
whether states are immune from such suits under the 11th Amendment,
which the court has invoked several times recently to shield state
governments from the application of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a sign that the justices are by no means finished
with their examination of the limits of congressional authority,
the court accepted a new and potentially far-reaching case about
federal authority for decision in its next term.
</P>
<P>
   The new case is a challenge to federal jurisdiction under the
Clean Water Act over isolated wetlands, including seasonal ponds
and small lakes that are not connected to navigable, interstate
waterways but serve as habitats for migratory birds. A regional
solid waste agency in Cook County, Ill., which was denied a permit
from the Army Corps of Engineers to fill in such a wetland for use
as a waste disposal site, is arguing that Congress lacks authority
under the Commerce Clause to regulate such areas.
</P>
<P>
   According to a brief filed in the case by the National
Association of Homebuilders, there are 8.3 million isolated
wetlands in the country. Under its regulations, the Army Corps of
Engineers, which has the authority to issue permits under the Clean
Water Act, broadly defines the waters under its jurisdiction to
include ``intrastate lakes, rivers, streams'' as well as prairie
potholes, wet meadows and ponds, and including waters used by
migratory birds that cross state lines.
</P>
<P>
   In denying the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County
permission to fill 17.6 acres, which included seasonally wet
depressions left from a former strip mining operation, the Army
Corps of Engineers said there were numerous migratory birds nesting
at or using the site, including a large colony of great blue
herons.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago, upheld the
corps' position in a ruling last year that noted the cumulative
effect on the economy of the ``millions of people'' who hunt, trap,
or observe migratory birds. Even if there is no effect on commerce
from the destruction of a particular isolated habitat, the court
said, ``the aggregate effect is clear, and that is all the Commerce
Clause requires.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the soundness of that analysis is in fact far from
clear following the Supreme Court's decision last week that struck
down the civil remedy provision of the Violence Against Women Act
on the ground that violence against women lacked a sufficient
connection with commerce. The justices received appeal in the new
case, Solid Waste Agency vs. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, No.
99-1178, in January but deferred acting on it until after deciding
the Violence Against Women Act case.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two federalism cases the court decided Monday, the result
in the False Claims Act case was the more surprising because the
court itself, in an unexpected order on the eve of argument last
November, had greatly raised the constitutional stakes. The court
asked the lawyers to address the question of whether a private
individual has standing to pursue a False Claims Act suit on behalf
of the government. Had the answer been no, the heart of a law that
Congress first passed in 1863 to curb fraud against the government
by Civil War contractors would have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But having opened the door to that prospect, the court shut it
firmly Monday. The court was unanimous in ruling that private
plaintiffs do have standing, both because of the long historic
pedigree of what are known as ``qui tam'' actions and because the
plaintiff is standing in the shoes of the government, which has
suffered an actual injury.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the court's opinion in this case,
Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. Stevens, No. 98-1828. A
former employee of the Vermont state agency had brought a False
Claims Act suit charging that the agency had mishandled a federal
grant. In response, Vermont argued that under the 11th Amendment,
which the court has interpreted as barring suits in federal court
against states, the state was immune from suit. Both the federal
District Court in Vermont and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in New York, rejected the state's position.
</P>
<P>
   The court Monday avoided the 11th Amendment issue, ruling
instead that the act's reference to the liability of ``any person''
who commits fraud against the government does not refer to states,
at least when the plaintiff is a private individual. The government
has the authority to take over the prosecuting role in a False
Claims Act case, and the decision Monday left open the prospect
that the government itself could still sue a state. The decision
also raised the possibility that the False Claims Act could be open
to other constitutional challenges based on the separation of
powers.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by
Justice David H. Souter, said the law's text ``makes it perfectly
clear'' that Congress intended the word ``person'' to include
states.
</P>
<P>
   Both in this case and in the arson case, Jones vs. United
States, No. 99-5739, the court applied a longstanding rule that
laws of dubious constitutionality should be interpreted, if
possible, in a way that avoids the constitutional issue.
</P>
<P>
   In applying that rule in the arson case, Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg's unanimous opinion said that ``arson is a paradigmatic
common-law state crime'' that Congress could not casually have
meant to federalize without saying so explicitly. The law ``is not
soundly read to make virtually every arson in the country a federal
offense,'' Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration defended the law's broad application
on the ground that private homes were connected to interstate
commerce through their receipt of natural gas through interstate
lines as well as through the interstate mortgage and insurance
markets. The 7th Circuit accepted this analysis when it upheld .
Jones' conviction. But Ginsburg said the analysis defied the
``common perception'' of what it means to ``use'' something in
interstate commerce. Here, the owner simply ``used the property as
his home, the center of his family life,'' she said.

AMAZON RESCINDS HONOR IN SHORT STORY CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Okla.)  By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Monday, the first PEN/Amazon.com Short Story Award was
announced and Meera Nair of Brooklyn won the $10,000 prize. It was
one of the largest prizes for an undiscovered writer _ for her work
entitled ``Video,'' about the havoc wrought on a young Indian
couple's marriage by the sexually explicit culture of the West.
With a disclaimer, Amazon is running the full text of the story
despite some complaints over the graphic descriptions of sex _ and
despite the fact that the story was found to be ineligible for the
award.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Amazon and PEN rescinded the prize, which includes
publication on Amazon and in The Boston Book Review, and gave it to
someone else when it was discovered that Nair had been published
previously in a national magazine, which technically meant she was
not a beginner.
</P>
<P>
   The judges gave the prize instead to one of the runners-up,
Marlene Reed Wetzel, of Bixby, Okla., for ``A Map of Tripoli,
1967,'' a love story about an American woman and a Jewish-Italian
man, set in Libya just before the Six-Day War. It is the first
published work of fiction for Wetzel, who is 63, and has lived and
worked in the Middle East. Up to now, Wetzel has published articles
only in local papers in the Oklahoma area, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com ruled Nair ineligible because one of her previous
stories had appeared in The Threepenny Review, which violated the
competition's rules that entrants must not have published a work of
fiction in a nationally distributed magazine with a circulation of
over 5,000. Nair had told Amazon about the Threepenny Review story,
but neither she nor Amazon initially realized that the magazine had
such a large circulation. The decision was made after someone
called Amazon's attention to The Review's circulation figures. The
judges for the prize were Sherman Alexie, David Guterson and
Jamaica Kincaid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nair will be allowed to keep the $10,000 and her story
remains on the Amazon Web site, said Patty Smith, an Amazon
spokeswoman. In the story, an Indian husband watches a pornographic
video and tries to persuade his wife to perform the acts he sees.
``Some of them did object to the sexual nature'' of the piece,
Smith said of the customers. ``Some people did not share the
judges' enthusiasm for this wonderful story.''
</P>
<P>
   But the customers' reaction had nothing to do with the prize's
withdrawal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Amazon was very fair,'' Nair said. ``I don't think
they had any qualms'' about publishing the story.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said 12,000 people entered the contest. The submissions
ranged from apocalyptic fantasies to stories about children and
horses. The other runners-up are Thomas Cockrell, Holiday Reinhorn
and Paul Rusconi, whose stories are available on Amazon.

FOX LENDS NAME, CLOUT TO PARKINSON'S ADVOCACY GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ The office of the Parkinson's Action
Network here is now answering the phone with a Hollywood name:
``Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, founder Joan Samuelson will be in Washington for
a news conference with Fox, the star of the television show ``Spin
City, to announce the formation of the new research and advocacy
effort the two will team up on.
</P>
<P>
   Both consider it a perfect match. Fox provides the celebrity
clout and fund-raising ability that Parkinson's advocates have long
wished for. And Samuelson brings expertise as a longtime lobbyist
for Parkinson's funding and research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm sitting at the feet of a master,'' Fox said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the two have a mutual admiration, they both have the
disease, a neurological disorder that causes tremors and restricts
mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Parkinson's, you're off and you're on,'' Fox said, adding
that he had lived with the disease for about 10 years, while
Samuelson had had it for about a dozen. Their symptoms are alike,
he said, as is their dependence on medicine to control their
shaking, though the medicine takes time to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Joan and I have morning meetings together before our
meds have kicked in,'' Fox said. ``We're like a couple of Keystone
Cops. One or both of us can't open our bottles of water or pick up
papers. It's a comedy of errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson, who formed her Santa Rosa-based organization in 1991,
will become the president and CEO of the Michael J. Fox Foundation.
The popular actor, whose last ``Spin City'' segment airs Wednesday,
will be chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he decided to join the Parkinson's organization because
of Samuelson. ``You sit in a room with Joan and she starts to talk
and she is the most compelling person,'' he said. ``She has a sense
of purpose and commitment and she has a huge stake in this, as do
I.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million Americans have Parkinson's, 40 percent of them
under age 60. They include former boxing champ Muhammad Ali, writer
Pauline Kael and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that after meeting Samuelson he looked into the
Parkinson's Action Network, which is one of four major Parkinson's
groups but the only lobbying one. ``It's a quality organization
with a good reputation and track record,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of ``Spin City's'' one-hour finale Wednesday, viewers
will be invited to call a toll-free number, which will link them to
the Santa Rosa operation for donations. Samuelson's office has put
together a phone bank to handle the calls.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times for Samuelson, who has tried to recruit
Fox to Parkinson advocacy since the actor announced in November
1998 that he had the degenerative neurological disorder.
Samuelson's first coup was to persuade Fox to appear in September
before Congress, and help her plead for more research money.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health paid for about $78 million in
Parkinson's research last year.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson, 50, a lawyer, learned she had the disease when she
was 37. She founded Parkinson's Action Network chiefly to boost
awareness of the disease and lobby for a greater share of the
government research pie.
</P>
<P>
   She spends about a third of each year in Washington, and other
time on the road giving speeches and attending brain research
conferences. But there's never been enough focus on raising private
money for brain research, she said, and this is where working with
Fox will make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to help,'' Samuelson said. ``Mike will call me
and say, `Oh, I was talking to James Taylor ... or Elton John ...
or Sting and they want to know what they can do. Oprah wants to
know what she can do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson said when the two talked in Washington last fall, Fox
told her to let him know what more he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took that as a pretty clear invitation,'' Samuelson said.
``I broached the idea of combining his private fund-raising effort
in collaboration with our advocacy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 38, said he and Samuelson have a lot in common. ``Neither
one of us are administrative types but we're terrible at
delegating. We both tend to want to do it all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both workaholics,'' agreed Samuelson, who said that
beyond their professional connection is a growing personal one.
``He's a friend. I watch him on the TV interviews and I think about
the guy behind the celebrity. This is a real passage for him.''
</P>
<P>
   She attended the final taping of ``Spin City,'' and said, ``I
felt almost like a traitor with people being so sad that he was
quitting the show, because it's almost like their loss is our
gain.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The actor said he would put his energies into working on the
foundation's Web site (michaeljfox.org), which won't be operating
until Wednesday, and ``being part of the national conversation''
about Parkinson's, which he refers to as ``PD.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox foundation became a new organization by absorbing the
Parkinson Action Network. Samuelson sees her relationship with Fox
as a ``partnership'' and said her organization smoothly became the
Fox foundation by board action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no point in going out and creating a new nonprofit
organization,'' she said. ``We already are one. So the board met
and we added Mike to the board and officially changed the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson said the group would grow from its current seven
employees, and create both an executive board and a science board
to award research grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of the nitty-gritty to work out,'' she
said, including her salary, which with Parkinson's Action Network
is $76,000. She said the new board probably would combine some of
Fox's big-name friends with existing Parkinson's Action board
members.
</P>
<P>
   For now the foundation will continue in Santa Rosa, but the
headquarters eventually will be in New York with separate offices
in Washington and probably Sonoma County.

DUMPED BALLOTS RAISE WORRIES IN HAITI VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ The results of an undetermined number of
legislative races from the election on Sunday may have to be voided
because ballots were either damaged, lost or left susceptible to
fraud when tired and poorly trained poll workers dumped hundreds of
ballot boxes in a jumble outside electoral offices.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at several Communal Electoral Offices, known by the
French acronym BEC, arrived at work Monday to discover that the
ballot boxes had been left there overnight because poll workers
could not find room for them inside. Some boxes were open, and
thousands of ballots and other documents were found scattered on
the sidewalk or street.
</P>
<P>
   International election observers said that the chaotic delivery
of ballots could make recounts impossible in some areas if there
were close margins or if the official tally sheets, which were
supposed to have been delivered separately, were contested because
of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes cannot be recounted because everybody is treading on
them,'' said Mary Durran, the spokeswoman for the observer mission
from the Organization of American States. ``It seems the vote will
have to be canceled in a number of polling stations in the BEC's of
Port-au-Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers outside the electoral office in the Delmas neighborhood
spent the morning piling up ballot boxes into a 6-foot mound.
Handwritten lists were scattered about in some places, while
workers scooped up handfuls of scattered ballots and put them back
into boxes. ``There was no place to store them in the building, and
it was late in the night when they brought the boxes here,'' said
Jean-Louis Fritz, the lawyer for the Provisional Electoral Council,
which organized the elections, the country's first in three years.
``The police helped them to do their job, but they were very busy.
They put them here and left.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of fraud has always been a worry in a cumbersome
electoral process where votes are tallied by hand. Some opposition
parties had expressed fears that Family Lavalas, the party of
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, would try to manipulate
the vote. But election observers found no evidence of that, noting
that in some cases damaged Lavalas ballots were clearly visible on
the street.

ETHIOPIA WILLING TO NEGOTIATE BUT REFUSES TO STOP FIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ As envoys arrived here to try to end the
outbreak of war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Ethiopian prime
minister said Monday he was willing to talk but would not stop
fighting as the talks go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall negotiate while fighting,'' the leader, Meles Zenawi,
told diplomats from other African nations Monday. ``We shall fight
while negotiating. Both roads lead to peace. Whichever road leads
us to peace quicker, that will be the road we follow in the final
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting reignited 10 days ago, when Ethiopia mounted an
offensive it says is aimed at ending the costly two-year war over a
disputed border. Monday, Zenawi spoke from a position of strength:
Ethiopia has pressed deeply into Eritrean territory, saying it will
not leave until Eritrea abandons territory it captured in the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Serri, the European Union's special envoy to the Horn of
Africa, came here Monday after three hours of talks with the
president of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki. Also, Ahmed Ouyahia, the
special envoy of the chairman of the Organization for African
Unity, is meeting with Ethiopia's leaders. Both diplomats support a
peace plan brokered by the OAU but neither said a breakthrough was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mission's work has only just begun,'' Serri, an
undersecretary in the Italian Foreign Ministry, told reporters in
the Eritrean capital, Asmara. ``I don't think situations always
stay the same. I think they move and I am here to move it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yemane Gebremeskel, a spokesman for the Eritrean government,
said they too were willing to resume talks, which broke off earlier
this month in Algeria. But, despite what appear to be severe
setbacks on the battlefield, he said Eritrea was willing to settle
the dispute militarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any problem with diplomacy,'' he said in a
telephone interview Monday night from Asmara. But he added: ``The
war will continue and we will see who will prevail at the end of
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the U.S. World Food Program said Monday it would sent
the first shipment of food into Eritrea, in an effort to feed
hundreds of thousands of Eritreans who have fled fighting in the
western part of the nation. Officials said they would fly 40 tons
of high-energy biscuits into Asmara on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both nations have agreed in principle on a peace document.
Eritrea has said it wants a cease-fire first, but Ethiopia wants
the details nailed down before the fighting ends.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the fighting over in western Eritrea, a battle was
shaping up at the town of Areza, according to a military analyst
here from a western nation. That battle could be decisive
militarily and extraordinarily fierce, he said.

COURT TO HEAR CLEAN AIR TEST OF CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn:   Mass., N.J., N.Y., Conn., Maine, Md., N.H., Pa.,
R.I. , Vt., Ohio, Mich. , W.V.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear a clean air
case that casts a constitutional shadow over the ability of federal
agencies to administer programs within broad grants of authority
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal of a ruling overturning two major clean air
standards, the Clinton administration said the decision last May by
a three-judge panel of the federal appeals court here was a
``radical departure from settled law'' that raised ``issues of
extraordinary governmental concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, to be argued next fall, has the potential to be not
only one of the most important cases on the court's docket for its
next term, but also one of the most important cases in decades
about the allocation of authority in the modern administrative
state.
</P>
<P>
   In invalidating new standards that the Environmental Protection
Agency adopted in 1997 for ozone and small airborne particles, the
appeals court held that the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by the
agency, provided so little guidance as to amount to an
unconstitutional delegation of law-making authority by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-to-1 decision was the first time that a federal regulatory
program had been struck down under the ``nondelegation doctrine''
since 1935, when the Supreme Court invoked it to invalidate two New
Deal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, led by the Supreme Court in its post-New Deal stance
toward agency discretion, federal courts have generally deferred to
administrative agencies' interpretations of their authority under
their governing statutes, many of which are as open-ended as the
Clean Air Act, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act, which dates to 1970, directs the
Environmental Protection Agency to set national air quality
standards at levels that ``in the judgment of the administrator''
and ``allowing an adequate margin of safety'' are ``requisite to
protect the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   If that mandate amounts to an unconstitutional delegation,
experts in administrative law have warned, then so do the broad
marching orders Congress has given to such agencies as the Federal
Communications Commission, which is charged with regulating
broadcasting in light of ``public interest, convenience, and
necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the clean air regulations, the appeals court
said the environmental agency lacked ``any determinate criterion
for drawing lines'' and was ``free to pick any point between zero
and a hair below the concentrations yielding London's Killer Fog,''
a reference to an air pollution crisis that killed 4,000 people in
one week in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The nondelegation doctrine grew out of concern for the
constitutional separation of powers, and has received expressions
of support in earlier cases from Chief Justice William Rehnquist
and Justice Antonin Scalia. The argument for the doctrine is that
it helps maintain political accountability by preventing Congress
from legislating in broad generalities while avoiding
responsibility for unpopular regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone and small particle regulations at issue in this case,
Browner vs. American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257, were
decidedly unpopular in the business community, which argued before
the appeals court that the new standards would impose huge costs on
regulated industries without proportional benefits to public
health.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether the Clean Air Act
permits, or requires, a cost-benefit analysis. The American
Trucking Associations, U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other industry
groups, while agreeing with the Clinton administration that the
court should hear the administration's appeal, have filed a
separate appeal urging the justices to adopt a cost-benefit
interpretation of the statute.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not act Monday on that separate appeal, which
evidently remains under active consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Even aside from the nondelegation issue, this would be an
important environmental case. The agency tightened the existing
standards for ozone and for the first time adopted a standard for
small, sooty particles, a major component of smog. The American
Lung Associated participated in the case at the appeals court level
to defend the new standards as important public health measures, as
did the states of New Jersey and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The case pits the Northeastern states against the Midwestern
industrial states whose emissions reach the Northeast on the
prevailing winds. In addition to Massachusetts and New Jersey, New

 &HT;    Mandy's gift
 &HT;    By Jenn Hildreth
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mandy Young woke up from a coma nine years ago, big tears
started rolling down her face when she felt around in the hospital
bed for where her left leg should have been.
</P>
<P>
   She looked up at her parents and asked, ``Will God let me grow a
new leg, like trees grow new branches?''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Young will never forget that moment in her daughter's life,
even as she now brims with joy watching Mandy _ a bright, happy
18-year-old about to graduate from Salem High School _ inspire
onlookers on the softball field.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy survived the amputation against great odds, just as she
has survived a string of other life-threatening illnesses related
to a rare immune-deficiency disease that she has had since birth.
It is named ``Mandy's Disease,'' for her. ``Other people see this
girl who only has one leg and is just playing softball, and they
think about how they gripe and they groan. Then they see me out
there working as hard as I can just to be like them,'' Mandy said.
``People ask, `How do you do it?' and I say, `How do I not do it?'
When you grow up in this type of environment, you don't ask
questions; you just live it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandy does not have a prosthetic leg, but she joined the
Sluggers, a team coached by her parents in the Rockdale County
recreation league, in 1995. She uses a crutch to help her play
third base and a designated runner when she steps up to bat. Last
fall, she was named captain of the Salem varsity slow-pitch team.
She has played two years with a traveling team (1996 and 1997), and
has repeatedly earned All-Star honors with the Sluggers. She'll
play in three All-Star games, beginning June 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``She isn't afraid, she will dive for balls,'' said Lisa, who
watched in awe as Mandy dropped her crutch and dived to catch
game-ending line drives in consecutive games a few weeks ago.
``She's going to make every effort to get the out, and I can't
think of anybody else that I would feel more comfortable with at
third base.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandy also is a force at the plate, where she bats by balancing
on her right leg and twisting her torso into her swing. In a
regular season that ended last week, she was one of the Sluggers'
top four batters with a .540 average and .612 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   She played catcher for the Salem team, the only position she
could play, because she was not allowed to use a crutch. Linda
Rice, Salem's slow-pitch coach, said Mandy's attitude, skill and
knowledge earned her one of 16 spots on a team that drew more than
40 girls to tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the type of person that has a command about her,'' said
Rice, who lauded Mandy's leadership behind the plate and her
ability to drive in runs. ``She looked like this was all familiar
to her, and it was just another day on the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were many times in Mandy's life that doctors told Lisa
and her husband, Speed, that their daughter probably would not live
to see another day, much less play in a softball game.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy's body cannot detect or fight off infection the way that
most people's do. The condition is so rare that Mandy is the only
person in the world who has been diagnosed with it, according to
Dr. Bruce Beeber at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston
hospital. She makes the 12-hour drive to the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda, Md., at least twice a year for tests and
examinations, to monitor her situation and to further the study of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her difficulty is in germ-killing power,'' Beeber said. ``She
might start with what would be for another person a rather simple
skin wound, but infection would end up spreading very rapidly,
causing tissue damage that could end in something like
meningitis.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandy has had spinal meningitis _ a life-threatening bacterial
infection that affects the fluid surrounding the spinal cord and
the brain _ three times. Most stricken are lucky to survive it even
once. She once had a cold that turned into double pneumonia by the
next morning, and as a 3-year-old had a stomach abscess that caused
her weight to drop to 17 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy willingly talks about her disease; she has described it to
television audiences on the ``Montel Williams Show'' and ``Extra''
_ and many regard her story as amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my end, I think `miracle' is not the wrong word to use
for her,'' Beeber said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before her ninth birthday, Mandy and her younger
sister, Alex, were jumping around in the bedroom of their home in
Conyers. Mandy slipped and cut her left leg on the corner of the
bed. The cut didn't bleed, but Lisa still put antibiotic cream over
it and wrapped it in a bandage. The next day, the skin had rolled
back from the abrasion, and Lisa immediately took Mandy to the
hospital because the wound ``looked like raw meat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the following weeks, Mandy became very sick. She was put on
intravenous medicine for a week and was sent home from the hospital
on antibiotics, but something still was desperately wrong. One
doctor suggested that it was a reaction to a virus picked up from a
classmate on the bus, and another thought the sickness might be
related to a severe case of homesickness; the Youngs recently had
moved from Hickory, N.C. So the family visited Mandy's
grandparents' home in North Carolina, but on the trip back, her
condition got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy started moaning from the throbbing, cramp-like pain in her
left leg, and Speed stopped at a rest area near Suwanee, so they
could call Mandy's doctors. As Lisa talked on a pay phone outside
of a McDonald's, she glanced back over at her family's mini-van,
and her eyes widened in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Speed was holding Mandy in his arms, and Lisa saw a rainbow of
pink streaks forming on the back of Mandy's leg. They decided to
take Mandy back to Egleston, where doctors had treated her before.
By the time they arrived, Mandy was screaming in pain and begging
the nurse to put her in a hot bath, a ``cure-all for our family,''
Lisa said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mandy's toes had started to turn black, and the
blackness was creeping up her left foot and onto her leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better prepare yourself now,'' Speed told his anxious
wife, ``because they're going to have to amputate.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hot water in the bath brought out quarter-sized black
blisters all over Mandy's leg, doctors diagnosed the condition as
gas gangrene _ which started from the small cut Mandy had gotten
from her bed _ and she was transferred to Crawford Long Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The gangrene spread so fast that, when Lisa asked the doctors
how much they were going to have to amputate, they told her that it
wasn't important _ Mandy probably was not going to live through it,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy's blood pressure dropped so low that doctors called the
Youngs in to say a final goodbye to their unconscious daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Mandy pulled through, and a month later, instead of
saying goodbye, Lisa and Speed were explaining to Mandy why she no
longer had a left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you've prepared at that point just goes out the
window,'' Lisa said. ``We said to her, `God gave us a choice to
make: We could either let you die and go to heaven right now, or we
could keep you, but the doctors would have to take one of your
legs.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the Youngs returned home after the amputation, Lisa said,
she lay down on top of Mandy's pairs of shoes and cried. But
Mandy's attitude was _ and remains _ so positive, that Speed said
it was tough for anyone else to get down.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy decided that she wanted to try gymnastics, so she did. She
learned how to ride a bicycle with a special pedal. She shoots
baskets in the driveway, swims, plays volleyball and walks with the
rest of the students in her physical education classes.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Mandy would practice softball with Speed and Alex in
the back yard, and she just loved diving for the ball. Yet when
Mandy told Lisa that she wanted to play for a team in 1995, Lisa
was a little apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we were really taken (aback) by it, and we didn't
think it would happen,'' Lisa said. She went before the Rockdale
Girls Softball Association board and was happily surprised when the
board accepted her proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Smith, who was president of the board at the time, said
that her biggest concern was for Mandy's safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be a positive experience for her, and it
worked out really well,'' Smith said. ``I think that it inspired a
lot of people. Sometimes in sports, people tend to get too caught
up in winning and losing, and it maybe put some focus on what we're
really out there doing. ... It allowed (Mandy) to participate in
something that she had never done before, and it was like she
wasn't handicapped. For a little while, she was just a normal kid
doing a normal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, essentially, is what Mandy wants out of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big thing is, I want to be just like everybody else,'' said
Mandy, who plans to commute to Clayton State and major in education
next year. ``I don't want to be outcast or looked at differently
just because I only have one leg or because I have a disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith doesn't look at her differently, but she can't help but
marvel. When Mandy is playing, Smith said, ``Time doesn't matter.
Things don't matter. There's the game, and you can be a part of
something that maybe can be bigger than you are for a little
while.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market plunged early Monday as jittery
investors dumped the technology stocks that many already agreed
were overpriced and also sold some of the so-called old economy
stocks that had actually been doing reasonably well recently.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the market closed, the major indexes had done
what has become normal recently, rebounded, leaving the market down
only moderately. Enough investors, apparently, are still looking to
buy on the dips, despite the Federal Reserve's clear warning last
week of higher interest rates in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the old economy stocks did not recover very much,
however. Among these was General Motors, which disappointed
investors by limiting the exchange of its stock for shares in its
Hughes Electronics subsidiary. GM finished down 9 3/8, or about 11
percent, at 77 5/8. It fell as low as 76 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   The morning sell-off sent the technology-heavy Nasdaq index down
217 points, or 6.4 percent. That left it below the 3,321.29 it
closed at on April 14, after a week in which the index fell a
record 25.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 257
points, or 2.4 percent, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
fell 38 points, or 2.7 percent. Both remained just above their
April 14 closes.
</P>
<P>
   But at the close, after investors bought up stocks from Intel
and Yahoo to Cisco Systems and eBay, the Nasdaq index finished down
just 26.19 points, or 0.77 percent, at 3,364.21.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the late rally, Monday became only the third day
in the last six weeks in which the Nasdaq composite closed with a
daily change of less than 1 percentage point. As recently as 1995,
less than one day in five ended with a change of more than 1
percent, but volatility has been rising since then.
</P>
<P>
   Led by late rallies in J.P. Morgan and IBM, the Dow Jones
industrial average closed down just 84.30 points, or 0.79 percent,
to 10,542.55. And the S&AMP;P 500, led back by AT&AMP;T and Intel, was off
6.23 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,400.72.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices rose a little and yields, which move
in the opposite direction, slipped as some investors shifted their
money from stocks to bonds. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year
note fell to 6.44 percent, from 6.48 percent on Friday. The price,
which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 12/32,
to 100 14/32. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.19 percent
from 6.20 percent on Friday, while the price rose 8/32, to 100
28/32.
</P>
<P>
   And the price of crude oil for June delivery, which had popped
above $30 a barrel last week, fell $1.28, or 4.3 percent, to $28.61
a barrel after the president of OPEC said the organization of oil
producers would pump more oil to keep its price within its desired
range of $22 to $28 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the slump in all the major stock indexes was a
continuation of the selling that began last week after the Federal
Reserve raised its short-term interest rate target half a
percentage point to 6.5 percent and signaled that more rate
increases were likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are realizing that higher interest rates won't be good
for high multiple technology stocks; that technology stocks may be
sensitive to the economy,'' said Richard McCabe, chief market
analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   As the threat of higher interest rates has sunk in, analysts are
also beginning to reconsider their outlook for corporate earnings
for the S&AMP;P 500, which were spectacular in the first quarter of
this year, rising 23.5 percent from a year earlier, and are
forecast to be strong this quarter, up 18.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc of America
Securities, said Monday that he was cutting his forecast of S&AMP;P 500
earnings growth for this year to 12 percent from 13.7 percent. ``By
the second half of this year we expect to see far fewer positive
revisions and far more negative revisions in earnings,'' he said.
``And I don't know if the market is prepared for that.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus, a stock market bull who just four weeks ago was
recommending that investors put 80 percent of their portfolio into
equities, cut that recommendation back to 70 percent, while he
raised his bond recommendation to 30 percent and has nothing in
cash. ``Our 70/30/0 allocation is still moderately optimistic,
compared with `normal' recommendations'' of 60 percent to 65
percent of a portfolio in stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What may make earnings disappointments harder for investors to
take is that earnings forecasts for the current quarter and this
year have been rising recently. According to First Call/Thomson
Financial, which collects analysts' forecasts, the earnings growth
rate forecast for the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 index has risen to
18.8 percent for the second quarter from a 16 percent prediction at
the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the forecast for the second quarter has
actually climbed from 17.6 percent on March 1. Usually, analysts
trim their current-quarter earnings predictions during that quarter
by 2 percentage to 3 percentage points, as the companies give
clearer guidance on what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co., said,
``What people are just beginning to realize is that a second shoe
is going to drop; technology companies will have their fair share
of earnings disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbera said that some investors and analysts had argued that
the technology sector would be relatively immune to higher interest
rates because these companies had been raising their money in the
stock market, through new stock issues, or have bought other
companies using their own stock.
</P>
<P>
   But he argues that the Fed's ability to slow economic growth
will put pressure on stocks, and therefore, make it difficult for
technology companies to raise new funds or buy new companies. And
that will hurt their earnings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although he is bullish on the near-term earnings outlook,
Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill
Lynch, agrees. ``I think you are going to see a lot of
disappointments soon'' in the technology sector, he said. ``What if
your strategy was growth through acquisitions and nobody wants your
stock anymore?'' he asked.

SPORTS COLUMN: THIS REPEAT IS REPLETE WITH DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Miami Heat sounded like the hiss from a radiator
when it's over-steamed. Jamal Mashburn, Tim Hardaway, Alonzo
Mourning, et. al. were complaining, after an 83-82 loss in the
deciding Game 7 of their playoff series against the Knicks on
Sunday. They were charging that there was ``a conspiracy'' by the
referees and the league to make sure that the Knicks won. They
imagined that a Los Angeles-New York final series would be a
TV-ratings bonanza, a commercial aspect surely not lost on David
Stern and his minions.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly plausible that Stern, sultan of the National
Basketball Association, indeed went to bed in Westchester with a
smile on his face. But the outcome of the game had profoundly less
to do with the refereeing than it did with Miami's shooting free
throws as if heaving a medicine ball _ hitting 11 of 21 overall
from the foul line (to the Knicks' 28 for 31); or the fact that two
of its best shooters, Mashburn and Hardaway, connected on just 9 of
35 shots from the field; or that Mourning did an unfortunate
impersonation of Willie Sutton, missing a dunderheaded steal
attempt to allow his man, Patrick Ewing, a clear getaway to the
basket for the winning jam. Consider also that Pat Riley, the glass
of fashion and a basketball brain to match, called two timeouts
with 26 and 12 seconds to go and 1 point down, and was unable to
concoct a good shot for his team either time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed in their reaction,'' Jeff Van Gundy, the
Knicks' coach, said Monday of the Heat. ``They're attacking the
credibility of the league. I can understand their disappointment,
and I have a lot of respect for the Heat, but it's not right. I
think what they're saying may have a subconscious effect on the
league and the officials in our upcoming series.''
</P>
<P>
   The series beginning Tuesday night against the Pacers, that is.
It is a coach's job to clear out any mental viruses that may affect
not only his team, but those who would have influence over its
fortunes. Namely, the referees.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy doesn't want the referees bending over backward to be
nice to people like Reggie Miller (just imagine for a moment, Knick
fans, anyone trying to be nice to Reggie), and Van Gundy is taking
no chances. Referees are more or less people, Van Gundy
understands, and they don't want to be perceived as soft on the
Knicks. So he reacts to the reaction, to ward off any evil eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for people to give credit to another team after
a loss,'' said Van Gundy. ``It's always some external force.''
</P>
<P>
   The external forces, in this case, were such aliens as Childs,
Ewing, Camby and Sprewell, fresh from their spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   As for a conspiracy, anything's possible. But when checking
conspiracies, the Heat should make an investigation in their own
arena, starting maybe with the janitor. I mean, who put the lid on
the basket so the Heat could miss five free throws in the waning,
crunch moments of the game? It wasn't Van Gundy, or any of the
three referees, that anyone saw, anyhow. But where was the janitor,
and, for that matter, the butler?
</P>
<P>
   This is the lone matter from the Miami series that Van Gundy has
any concern with, other than fatigue, of course. And having little
time to draw up schemes to outnoodle Larry Bird and his cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Knicks, meanwhile, after a bruising series against
Miami, get their legs, and their lungs, in proper order to combat
the Pacers?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly. These are professionals, and, except for a
sore-ankled Allan Houston, appear reasonably sound of body. Even
that battered antique, Patrick Ewing, has tapped some spectacular
reservoir of energy to come back in the last half of the last two
games to play as well as he has ever played.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Reggie won't let anyone's mind wander. ``I hate
the Knicks,'' he said Monday afternoon in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie says these things because he enjoys driving people nuts.
He's like the kid at the zoo who jabs a stick through the bars to
annoy the lion when he's snoozing. It also motivates Miller,
apparently, to have people abhor him. Nice work if you can get it.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the blather, he's a marvelous, clutch player. ``And
Jalen Rose is having a career year, and Mark Jackson is a great
orchestrator and the Pacers have the best 3-point shooters and best
free-throw shooting team in basketball,'' said Van Gundy. ``It's
going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Heat series, this one is a rematch from last year. So a
fan may be excused his ennui. After all, same old teams, same old
rivalry _ and same old drama, suspense, intrigues, tension,
pressure and passion. ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' can hardly
do better. &QL;

CHIEF EXECUTIVE APPOINTED AT GRUNER &AMP; JAHR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gruner &AMP; Jahr, the publisher of seven consumer magazines in the
United States including McCall's, Fitness and Parents, has named a
chief executive, three months after the departure of its previous
chief.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel B. Brewster, the president and chief executive of
American Express Publishing, resigned from that job Monday and will
take over at Gruner &AMP; Jahr on June 5. American Express Publishing,
which is a partnership between the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner
and the American Express Co., publishes four consumer magazines,
including Food &AMP; Wine and Travel &AMP; Leisure.
</P>
<P>
   For Brewster, the challenge will be to bring vitality to a group
of magazines that are not noted for their dynamism. Because of
their subject matter, which is largely geared toward family,
fitness, interior decorating and teen-age entertainment _ they have
missed out on two of the most abundant areas of magazine
advertising: luxury goods and Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gruner &AMP; Jahr publishes more than 80 magazines around the world,
mostly in Europe. Its magazines in the United States have been
particularly vulnerable to the recent changes in the consumer
marketplace, specifically, the consolidation of newsstand
wholesalers _ a trend that has by most estimates hurt the entire
industry by driving up costs _ and the tremendous fall-off in
subscriptions that had been generated in the past by American
Family Publishers and Publishers Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
   The move to hire Brewster signals a significant shift in the
company's strategy. Bertelsmann AG, the German media company that
owns 74.9 percent of Gruner &AMP; Jahr, sold its stake in AOL Europe
last year for about $8 billion, and Brewster has been given the
task of routing a portion of that windfall into reviving the
American magazine division.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have given me an absolute commitment that they are going
to substantially invest in their core titles,'' Brewster said
Monday. ``They will give me funding to pursue acquisitions, and we
will also have sufficient resources to develop new products
internally.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the company's first acquisitions may be Inc. magazine,
executives involved in the negotiations said. Gruner &AMP; Jahr has
just entered the second round of bidding for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. is also negotiating to buy Inc.; the asking price is
$200 million, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Gruner &AMP; Jahr's turnover rate has been among the highest in the
magazine industry, according to past and current executives, with
some employees _ including the last chief executive _ departing for
Internet businesses. John Heins, the former chief executive,
resigned in February to join Netscape as a vice president for
international sales and marketing. In another recent departure,
Andreas Wiele, the company's chief operating officer, resigned on
May 9 to join Axel Springer Verlag, based in Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>

TAIWAN OFFICIALS HOPEFUL ABOUT IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH MAINLAND
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ In their first public statements since taking
office, two of Taiwan's top security officials expressed cautious
hope Monday that relations with the mainland will gradually improve
in the wake of President Chen Shui-bian's inaugural speech and a
surprisingly nonbelligerent reply from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   And in Beijing on Monday, officials stressed that China would be
``pragmatic'' in its dealings with Taiwan, though they still
demanded that Chen unequivocally agree that Taiwan is part of ``one
China'' under Beijing's ultimate authority.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, China was pillorying Chen, who in the past
advocated Taiwan's formal independence, and some experts said that
military conflict was nearly inevitable. If Taiwan officials are
relieved and pleased by how well their first days have gone and by
the sudden shift in mood, they were coy about it in interviews
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural address on Saturday, Chen promised not to
declare independence and made soothing comments about a shared
history and culture. In a cryptic statement that the officials
refused to elaborate on Monday, he referred to the ``question of a
possible future `one China.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, after accusing Chen of being evasive, replied in a
vague statement of its own that now-frozen talks might resume if
the two sides could ``express in their own way orally'' their
support for the ``one China'' principle.
</P>
<P>
   More tangibly, both sides seem intent on allowing direct
commerce across the Taiwan Strait, perhaps as part of a trade
agreement as they both enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not disappointed'' by Beijing's response was how Tsai
Ing-wen, the new head of Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council, put it
Monday. ``My own reading,'' she said, ``is that they have softened
their position somewhat to try and find ways to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiou I-jen, deputy chief of Taiwan's National Security Council
and a member of Chen's inner circle, would say only, ``At least the
situation has calmed down.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, both officials laid out the same
best-case vision: that by expanding economic, cultural and other
ties through negotiation, the two sides could, as Tsai put it,
``build the confidence we need to address the political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's speech, she asserted, had ``generated some good
momentum,'' and she added that ``we'll try to do something to
maintain that momentum'' but refused to give examples.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing Monday, officials told reporters that China would be
``pragmatic'' in its approach to Taiwan, that it understood the
political constraints on Chen and would watch to see if he moves
toward accepting the idea of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were unyielding on the meaning of that term, saying,
``There is only one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the
government of the People's Republic is the only legal government of
China.''

 &HT;    Vignette Corp. buy software maker for $1.7 billion
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In what would be the largest acquisition by an
Austin company, Vignette Corp. said Monday it will pay $1.7 billion
for a small California software maker that will extend the reach of
its e-commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   But in another indication of Wall Street's newfound skepticism
in Internet-related stocks, Vignette shares plunged 20.4 percent,
or $8.94, to close at $34.88 in Nasdaq trading. They had fallen as
low as $30.75.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow Vignette agreed that OnDisplay adds
important features to Vignette's e-business platform. But some said
they were puzzled by the pricetag on a company that lost nearly $17
million in 1999 on revenues of only $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty frothy deal,'' said Bill Chappell of the
Robinson-Humphrey equities firm in Atlanta. ``I'm a little
surprised by the price,'' he said, adding, ``but that doesn't mean
it's not a strategic fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of putting a rational value on Internet-based
startups has dogged venture capitalists, stock underwriters and
investors since the Internet phenomenon captured investors'
attention a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was only this spring that investors began taking a hard look
at a company's prospects for profitability, which has a lot to do
with the the 35 percent Nasdaq correction since March 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last six weeks, any company that made a purchase has
gotten creamed,'' said Fred Bush of Tejas Securities in Austin.
``People are starting to be more value focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the $1.7 billion for OnDisplay is 50 times the
company's expected revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Antley, who heads the technology practice for the Atlanta
law firm of Southerland, Asbill and Brennan, said there is too
little history to measure what Internet companies are worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is like a once-in-a-century phenomenon, and
people are willing to take extreme risk to be one of the big
players in 15 years,'' Antley said. ``You see in these values just
how much Vignette is gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Vignette's stock was also hurt by bad timing. The Nasdaq
composite index on Monday dipped to its lowest point this year
before eaking out a fractional gain late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq closed down 26.19 at 3,364.21. At its low Monday, the
Nasdaq was off nearly 218 points at 3,172.65 _ a level not seen
since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Vignette Chief Executive Greg Peters called the deal ``landscape
changing.'' The Austin company is regarded as a leader at helping
medium and large companies to establish online businesses, manage
how their Web sites look and function and interact smoothly with
customers.
</P>
<P>
   OnDisplay, based in San Ramon, Calif., is focused on the part of
e-commerce that is invisible to the end-user, but no less important
to the success of an online business.
</P>
<P>
   As ``back-office'' technology, the company's software performs
such tasks as making sure that supplies of products that appear on
the Web site are available in inventory, and it automatically bills
the customer for the purchase. In addition, it can direct the sale
to a Web-site's lowest-cost supplier of products and assign the
lowest-cost shipper to deliver it, said Erik Josowitz, Vignette's
vice president of product strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always manage the customer-relationship side, which means,
when you visit a company's Web site, how your personalize it, shop,
buy and order,'' Josowitz said. ``But it's necessary that those
things connect to something.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal must be approved by OnDisplay's shareholders, who will
receive 1.58 Vignette shares for each share of OnDisplay. Shares of
OnDisplay Inc., the fourth company Vignette has acquired in the
past year, closed up 88 cents at $54.13 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, in an interview from San Ramon where he was visiting
OnDisplay's employees, said the two companies considered where the
e-business market is headed and what OnDisplay's contribution would
be worth.
</P>
<P>
   It's an optimistic view, shared by many analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Internet consulting company Forrester Research, for instance,
estimates that e-business market will grow to $1.3 trillion in
2003, up from $43 billion two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the largest acquisition by an Austin company, the deal also
runs counter to a trend of local companies being gobbled up by
bigger businesses from others states or, sometimes, other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   At $1.7 billion, which is based on Friday's closing prices for
shares in both companies, the deal is bigger than several recent
acquisitions that changed Austin's technology industry. In 1996,
IBM acquired Tivoli Systems for $743 million and Computer Sciences
Corp. bought Austin's Continuum Corp. for $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, GEC of London paid for Tracor Corp., an Austin
defense-technology company.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest acquisition involving an Austin company came last
year, when Cincinnati Bell Inc. paid $3.2 billion for IXC Inc., a
telecom company that had fiber-optic cable buried in key U.S.
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Vignette wasn't the only company whose acquisition plans got
hammered by Wall Street on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In another deal between electronic-commerce companies,
webMethods Inc. of Fairfax, Va. said it would acquire Active
Software in a stock deal valued at $1.3 billion. WebMethods lost
$15, or 17.2 percent, to close at $72, while Active Software
slipped 92 cents to close at 32.8.

DOUBT IS CAST ON CREDIBLE ELECTIONS IN ZIMABWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Widespread political violence and unfair
electoral practices ruled out the possibility of credible
democratic elections in Zimbabwe, an international delegation
concluded Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's government received another blow, when the nation's
highest court threw out charges against two of President Robert
Mugabe's severest press critics.
</P>
<P>
   The National Democratic Institute, fielding a team of
representatives from five African countries as well as the United
States and Canada, said the run-up to Zimbabwe's parliamentary
elections, due to be held June 24-25, was marred by ``acute
political polarization and intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only had the southern African nation failed to meet its own
constitutional Declaration of Rights, the delegation found, but it
also had violated international conventions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   At least 23 people have been killed and thousands more have been
badly beaten in politically inspired attacks over the past three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violence has created an atmosphere of anxiety and fear. It
has substantially restricted the exercise of freedoms of opinion,
expression, association, assembly, and movement, as well as the
right to be secure from physical bodily harm due to political
affiliation,'' the delegation stated. ``Immediate and concerted
efforts are therefore required to make improvements to the
political environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, against which the team lodged most of its
accusations, dismissed the report. ``When we had independent
elections in 1980, we had worse violence than this, and those
elections were declared free and fair,'' said Information Minister
Chenhamo Chimutengwende.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Zimbabwe's highest tribunal threw out a government
attempt to prosecute two local journalists for stirring ``alarm and
despondency.'' Ray Choto and Mark Chavunduka, both of the Standard
newspaper, were detained 17 months ago and tortured for two weeks
after publishing a story of a possible military coup. The Supreme
Court ruled that the state's case against them was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Chavunduka, the Standard's editor, is currently completing a
year at Harvard as a Nieman fellow.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was hailed both as a triumph of the rule of law and a
victory for Zimbabwe's beleaguered media, which have been
repeatedly threatened and harassed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Violence began three months ago, shortly after the fledgling
Movement for Democratic Change rallied voters to reject Mugabe's
draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe responded by exploiting the highly emotional issue of
land, casting the opposition as a puppet of the white minority and
unleashing his supporters against white commercial farmers.
Pro-government mobs have invaded more than 1,300 farms since late
February, violently intimidating black farmworkers into pledging
support for Mugabe's party. In recent weeks, university teachers,
students, and prominent businessmen have also come under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about Zimbabwe's instability, South African President
Thabo Mbeki has urged the international community to fund land
reform in Zimbabwe, where the whites hold a vast majority of the
country's best farmland. Mbeki met with President Clinton Monday at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Western donors have tied aid for land reform to peaceful
elections, but so far Mugabe has done little to end the violence.
Nor has he played by fair electoral rules, analysts said. The
government has so far failed to release the new voter rolls and
voter-district maps, making it impossible for parties to nominate
parliamentary candidates across the country ahead of the May 29
registration deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party filed a petition with the High Court to
force the state to release the voter information and extend the
nomination period.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation urged Mugabe to end the violence, promote
dialogue among competing parties to ensure a safe campaign
environment, release the voter rolls, and remove media bias. In the
past month, according to the local Media Monitoring Project, 93
percent of voices in political stories on local television news
have been aligned with the ruling party. The state owns the only TV
broadcasting service.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, Bill Kovach, head of the Nieman
fellowship program at Harvard, applauded the Supreme Court's ruling
in favor of Choto and Chavunduka. ``The timing is great,'' he said.
``It is encouraging to see the rule of law still trying to assert
itself'' in Zimbabwe.

OAS SUSPENDS ELECTION MONITORING IN PERU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA _ Throwing Peru's troubled presidential election into even
deeper turmoil, the Organization of American States on Monday
suspended its election monitoring here because of concerns about
fraud and a faulty computerized vote-counting system.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS announced its decision the same day that Alejandro
Toledo, the US-trained business school professor who has mounted a
heated challenge to President Alberto K. Fujimori, submitted a
letter to elections officials formally withdrawing from Sunday's
runoff vote. The move prompted one high-ranking Peruvian elections
official to declare that Toledo had ``forfeited'' the race and
handed victory to Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by the organization's office in Lima, the
OAS said it decided to end the work of its 20 observers in Peru
``because of a lack of consistency and precision observed'' in the
National Office of Elections Processes, the country's main voting
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Stein, the former Guatemalan foreign minister who heads
the observation team in Peru, told reporters Monday afternoon
outside the US Embassy that the organization ``is not leaving the
country, only asking our workers to temporarily abstain from their
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been consistently documenting problems in the general
management of the electoral procedures that could compromise the
legitimacy of the vote on the day that has been designated,'' Stein
said, adding that a more detailed report of their concerns would be
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first round of elections was held on April 9, the OAS
and other international observer groups, most of them from the
United States, have complained of voting irregularities largely
attributed to Fujimori's government.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the OAS, which was invited by Fujimori to oversee the
elections, publicly asked the national voting agency to postpone
the runoff vote, scheduled for Sunday, to correct technical
problems in the agency's computer system. On Thursday, Toledo
announced his withdrawal from Sunday's vote, calling for a later
election date and for supporters to withhold their vote as an act
of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the past week have thrown the country's elections
into a dizzying tailspin, causing widespread confusion among
voters, uncertainty among investors, anger at the observers, and
concerns among officials from the United States and other countries
about Peru's democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said it supported the OAS
decision and called for Peruvian officials to take measures to
ensure a fair vote. Meanwhile, another US-based observer group said
it has put its plans to send observers to Peru on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not boarding any planes right now, but we're hoping
there'll be more dialogue among everyone,'' said Kenneth Wollack,
president of the National Democratic Institute, which planned to
send about 20 observers to Peru. ``Postponing an election is
preferable to one that is fatally flawed whether in Peru or any
other country.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo campaign officials delivered a letter to the National
Office of Elections Processes Monday afternoon detailing the
challenger's decision to pull out of the race unless the date is
changed to mid-June and guarantees are made for clean elections.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Bringas, a juror for the elections office, told the
Associated Press Monday afternoon that Toledo's letter was
equivalent to a ``forfeit'' and that by default Fujimori should be
declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Observers and Peruvian election officials are at odds over a
vote-counting computer system, which was tested on Sunday in front
of observers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, Peruvian officials declared the test a
success. The OAS, however, said serious problems still existed _
mostly that the software being used could not properly transmit
simulated data to the central offices from outside computers and
therefore could not adequately count the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who is seeking a third term, won the first round of
voting with 49 percent to Toledo's 40. Fujimori has refused to
change Sunday's vote and did not offer immediate comment on
Monday's developments.

SPEED OF BORDER COLLAPSE SURPRISES ISRAELIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Ehud Barak rose to power a year ago with a pledge to
end Israel's bloody, 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expected it to end this way.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's withdrawal Monday from its security zone in southern
Lebanon looked more like a disorganized rout as members of its
allied militia fled their posts ahead and Israelis living near the
border were ordered into bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which the situation deteriorated appeared to
surprise everyone, including Prime Minister Barak, who convened an
emergency Cabinet meeting to discuss the rapidly changing situation
in an area long under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expecting several difficult days,'' Barak told state
television last night, ``but we know how to respond soundly to
every possible attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid deployment of Hezbollah forces into areas abandoned by
Israel and its proxy Lebanese militia has made Lebanon a much more
dangerous place for Israeli forces, prompting discussion of moving
up the deadline for the final pullout from July 7.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Hezbollah raised its flags over 14 villages and
South Lebanon Army soldiers gave themselves up to the rebel group,
Israeli jets strafed a former Israeli military position to destroy
tanks and other heavy equipment left behind by fleeing SLA
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Two Lebanese civilians were reported killed in the bombing
raids, prompting fears of retaliatory strikes by Hezbollah
guerrillas, who in some areas are now just a mile away from
Israel's northern border. The Israeli military ordered people in
northern towns into bomb shelters as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid breakdown of Israel's control over south Lebanon, and
the speed with which Hezbollah fighters are taking over, has
stunned not only Israelis but south Lebanese, many of whom had
fought for Israel for years against the Hezbollah militants, who
are backed by Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of relatives of men in the Israeli-financed and armed
South Lebanon Army besieged border crossing points, begging for
refuge in Israel. Israeli officials have indicated that SLA
fighters and their relatives will be resettled in Israel, but it
was unclear if those at the border would be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials expressed dismay that UN forces, stationed in
south Lebanon since Israeli forces first entered in 1978, did not
stop the guerrillas from taking over the newly abandoned areas.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerating collapse of the so-called security zone
increased pressure on UN special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen to put in
place security arrangements after the Israeli withdrawal. While UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan announced plans Monday to increase the
UN troop presence, UN officials said any increase would come only
after a final Israeli pullout had been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, weary of steady troop losses from its occupation, had
initially wanted to withdraw as part of a peace deal with Lebanon
and Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. When that proved
impossible, Israel hoped that either the United Nations would move
in to police the areas or that the Lebanese army would re-establish
control over south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But the sight of Hezbollah fighters and sympathizers waving
victory signs as they plundered abandoned outposts for weapons was
a reminder of the risks entailed in withdrawing. The unilateral
pullout is popular among Israelis, except for those who live in the
northern border communities.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's deputy defense minister warned that Israeli troops
could be sent back in if its border communities were attacked.
Although few military specialists said that Israel would stage
another full-scale invasion like the one in 1982, there is little
to keep Israel from cross-border retaliatory raids as long as it
has no peace treaty with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone wants to avert the need for us to go in again, the
way to do that is to keep Hezbollah away from the border,'' Ephraim
Sneh, the deputy defense minister, told Israel army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has always said that it is fighting to oust Israel
from south Lebanon, but the group's spiritual leader has also
indicated that the rebels may keep fighting even after Israel
withdraws.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, Hezbollah rocketed an Israeli post
in an area called the Sheeba Farms near the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights, part of its campaign to force Israeli forces to also
withdraw from a strip of territory on the Golan heights that
Hezbollah says is part of Lebanon.

 &HT;    Burglars take the stand
 &HT;    By Andrea Ball
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The 1995 robbery began poorly, producing only an
old television that couldn't be pawned. So the three San Antonio
crooks gave it another shot.
</P>
<P>
   They distracted the clerk at the storage facility on Burnet Road
in North Austin, chose a second unit and opened its silver Master
lock with an illegal skeleton key.
</P>
<P>
   This time they hit it big: $500,000 in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in a black suitcase,'' Joe Cortez, one of the burglars,
testified in federal court Monday. ``We unzipped it and it was full
of gold coins.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities say the coins belonged to atheist leader
Madalyn O'Hair, son Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter Robin
Murray-O'Hair _ and that the three burglars unwittingly walked off
with the spoils of a kidnapping plot that left the O'Hairs dead.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the stolen gold came out Monday as the kidnapping
trial of Gary Paul Karr entered its second week.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, 52, is charged with holding the family hostage for the
$500,000 in gold. Prosecutors have continued to build their case by
following the money trail they say explains the O'Hairs 1995
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cortez, Jamie Valdes and Joe Cardenas told jurors how
they discovered the gold and how they spent it. All three were
granted immunity for admitting to the theft.
</P>
<P>
   It was Oct. 3, 1995, and high school buddies Cortez and Valdes
were looking for an easy score. Cortez had a skeleton key that
could open Master locks, so they headed to Austin to break into
storage units. They recruited Cardenas, a casual acquaintance, to
drive.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson's acquittal was on the radio as the trio searched
for a storage facility. They stopped at the first one they saw and,
after the unsuccessful theft of the TV, walked away with a black
suitcase filled with $500,000 in shimmering American Eagles,
Canadian Maple Leafs and South African Krugerrands.
</P>
<P>
   In nonchalant testimony, the burglars talked about driving to a
fast food restaurant and opening the suitcase in the trunk of their
car. After finding the gold, they went in for hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to a bookstore revealed that each coin was worth between
$300 and $400. They returned home, divvied up the loot and parted
ways, Cortez testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd see (Valdes) when the money ran out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crooks traded the gold for cash in jewelry and coin stores
across San Antonio, often using friends to divert attention from
themselves. They never cashed in more than $10,000 at a time to
avoid filing a report with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Then they started spending. Cars, black leather couches, big
screen televisions, clothing, gold necklaces, diamond rings, $1,500
dollar watches. Cortez treated a half-dozen friends to a four-day
trip to Las Vegas. Cardenas bought a Mitsubishi Eclipse. Valdes
paid his girlfriend to stay home from work.
</P>
<P>
   And they all went to strip clubs. A lot of them, each man
spending $800 to $1,500 a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tip (the dancers) and buy drinks for them and everyone,''
Valdes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you didn't get receipts to prove how you spent the money?''
asked Tom Mills, Karr's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could go ask them. They still remember me,'' Valdes said
as the jury laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, the men had wasted away their sudden fortune.
By the time the FBI came calling in 1999, they had sold their
gold-funded goodies, saying they needed the money.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's lawyers sought to paint the three burglars as
inconsistent witnesses whose testimony was tainted by the immunity
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the federal trial has focused on David Waters, the
O'Hairs' former office manager whom prosecutors say masterminded
the kidnapping and killed the family. Karr, they say, helped hold
the family hostage.
</P>
<P>
   But Karr's attorneys claim the Michigan man was hired to guard
the family as they planned to flee the country. Plagued with IRS
troubles, the O'Hairs had often spoken of escaping to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair's son, William Murray, testified Monday that he believed
those were empty threats and that his mother had a love-hate
relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved to hate it and would make disparaging remarks about
it,'' said Murray, who was estranged from his family at the time of
their disappearance. ``But it also gave her access to hundreds of
thousands _ sometimes millions _ of dollars each year that she
couldn't get anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen witnesses testified Monday in a fast-paced trial that
could go to the jury early next week. Fifteen prosecution remain to
be called. Defense attorneys expect their case to take up to three
days.

BORDER PATROL AGENT KILLS UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ FBI agents Monday were investigating the
fatal shooting of a young Mexican immigrant by a Border Patrol
agent during a struggle on the banks of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   A Border Patrol surveillance unit using night-vision equipment
spotted a group of apparently four people crossing the shallow
river east of Brownsville, Texas, at 5 a.m. Sunday and radioed for
backup, said spokesman Ramiro De Anda.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Border Patrol Chief Harry Beall said one of the agents
who responded got into a scuffle with an undocumented immigrant
after he found him hiding in some brush and attempted to detain
him.
</P>
<P>
   During the struggle, the Mexican national wrestled the agent's
baton away from him. The officer, believing the man intended to
grab his gun, drew his semi-automatic pistol and fired twice, Beall
said. The immigrant was shot once in his upper chest, Beall added.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old man was taken to a hospital in Brownsville,
where he died around 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently, he was determined not to be taken into custody and
he was willing to fight for the officer's weapon to prevent it,''
said Beall. ``The officer feared for his life and unfortunately had
to resort to deadly force.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other immigrants in the group were detained and a fourth
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to identify the agent involved in the
shooting, but said he was a 32-year-old native Texan who has been
on duty more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Beall said the shooting victim's companions said he was a
Mexican citizen from the state of Quintana Roo, in the Yucatan
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Monday, the Mexican consulate in
Brownsville said: ``Incidents like this hurt and damage the
relationship between Mexico and the United States and threaten the
harmony of residents on both sides of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, a Border Patrol agent detaining a group of
immigrants near the riverside community of Santa Rosa, Texas, shot
an undocumented immigrant who allegedly pulled a pistol on the
officer. The immigrant, who was shot in the arm, is jailed on
charges of assaulting a federal officer. The agent has returned to
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's shooting was the latest in a series of shootings of
undocumented immigrants near the border, including the May 13
killing of a Mexican youth by a 75-year-old rancher outside
Brackettville, Texas.

FIDELITY MAGELLAN BOUGHT TECH STOCKS JUST BEFORE FALL-OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Magellan fund manager Robert Stansky
introduced more than 50 high-tech stocks to his portfolio in the
first quarter, according to the massive fund's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky added such names as Sycamore Networks, Akamai
Technologies, Veritas Software, CMGI, and Priceline.com during the
period ended March 31. All those stocks have shed from 20 percent
to 51 percent of their value since the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decline in many new technology stocks since March
10, Stansky wrote in the report that several stocks, including
Sycamore, Juniper Networks, and Redback Networks, had contributed
to the fund's gains in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   None of the bets on these young companies was large relative to
the size of the fund, which had assets of $109 billion on March 31.
Stansky bought $818,230 worth of Juniper and $314,683 worth of
Sycamore, his biggest plays among the new stocks in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky said in the report he relied in part on market
psychology to judge the young technology stocks. ``I had to
evaluate how the market might reward those with the brightest
potential long into the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's not clear is whether Stansky has stuck with those
volatile picks since the market fell. Fidelity declined to comment
on the fund's holdings, which are made public twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lowell, an independent Fidelity watcher at
FidelityInvestor.com, noted, ``It sure sounds like you've got a
commitment to the group.'' He said Stansky had raised Magellan's
high-tech exposure to 35.2 percent at March 31 from 22.1 percent
six months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first quarter, Magellan had a return of 4.85
percent year-to-date. Through Friday, the fund was down 3.9 percent
for the year _ better than the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index,
Stansky's benchmark, which was down 4.24 percent. The Nasdaq
Composite index, home to most upstart technology stocks, was down
16.68 percent through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Stansky's holdings likely have rewarded investors. To
name two, Lycos and Arrowpoint recently agreed to be acquired in
multibillion-dollar deals.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky said he thought many stocks were still pricey at the
time of the report, including technology stocks and cyclical
stocks. Stansky said, ``Strong growth in the US economy is long in
the tooth. At some point, that growth will slow, which could slow
the communications and Internet expansion.''

   Muslim separatist leaders have called for a three-day hunger

   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement has apologized for
saying Germany has not yet been ``cured'' of its Nazi past. The
remark in a television interview caused a political storm, with
French politicians from a range of parties denouncing the leftist
and often outspoken minister, who was discussing a German proposal

showed that deep down, Germany was ``still dreaming of the Holy
Roman Empire,'' adding, ``It hasn't cured itself of its past

   A two-week-old strike of armored truck security guards that has

CHINA TRADE BILL INSPIRES TWO SIDES TO GO TO CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With just two days to go before Congress decides
whether to upgrade economic ties with China, corporate supporters
opened a $1 million advertising blitz on Monday and labor opponents
stormed Capitol Hill as both camps struggled to recruit a few
undecided lawmakers who hold the key to victory or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which considers the vote on
permanent normal trade relations its top remaining legislative
priority, now expects a narrow win. But administration officials
say they still need six to eight undecided Democrats and a similar
number of uncommitted Republicans to vote their way if the measure
is to pass the House, where a vote is scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups have filled the airwaves as their $8 million
advertising campaign _ corporate America's costliest legislative
campaign ever _ climaxes this week. The United States Chamber of
Commerce assigned a lobbyist to each undecided lawmaker on its
target list, while President Clinton has set aside several hours
each day this week for telephone calls and face-to-face meetings
with wavering Democrats, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, insisting that they still have a chance to defeat
the measure that they call a threat to America's working class, are
turning up the heat on a small group of Democrats who need union
support in the fall elections. Union officials planned a Capitol
Hill vigil for Tuesday and are flying in members to apply pressure
to lawmakers in the hours before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Last minute horse-trading with several undecided members also
continued on Monday. Two Texas congressman wanted help with a gas
pipeline, while a Minnesota lawmaker urged the Clinton
administration to protect iron ore workers, congressional aides and
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The final lobbying flurry underscored how the China trade vote
has become a test of political strength for both business and
labor. Business executives boasted that they had run their most
effective vote-getting effort in recent years by taking a page from
labor's political play book, organizing grass-roots, home-district
lobbying efforts as well as national and regional advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending so many people at these members that they can
go home each night and tell their children they're famous,'' said
Thomas Donohue, president of the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said they had mobilized members nationwide and
honed their political message not just on trade, but also for the
fall elections, when they hope to make Democrats the majority party
in Congress. John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO; James Hoffa,
president of the Teamsters, and George Becker, president of the
United Steelworkers of America, planned to spend the remaining two
days visiting a handful of Democrats and Republicans whom union
officials feel might still vote no on the trade issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a painstaking, member-by-member campaign,'' said Peggy
Taylor, the AFL-CIO's legislative director.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and opponents largely agreed on the vote count in the
House, where the matter is likely to be decided. White House
officials said they had about 65 Democratic votes and wanted seven
more; Republicans had 145 committed yes votes and hoped to recruit
another 10. If both achieve their goals, that would give a
comfortable cushion over the 218 needed, but White House officials
acknowledged that they had to fight for every new supporter.
Approval by the Senate appears more certain.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that Congress should grant China permanent
trade status for both economic and national security reasons.
Ending the annual congressional review of China's trading rights
would guarantee American companies the full benefits of China's
entry to the World Trade Organization, the administration says. A
negative vote, it says, could lead to a diplomatic standoff with
Beijing and instability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, led by labor unions as well as environmental, human
rights and consumer groups, argue that China does not deserve
permanent trade status because it does not adhere to Western labor
or environmental standards. Unions also say they fear that more
open trade with China would encourage companies to move good
industrial jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   On many other trade issues in recent years, unions have proven
more politically effective than big business, defeating many of the
administration's trade goals including its efforts to win ``fast
track'' trade negotiating authority. But business groups, including
the Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Commerce, determined
late last year that the China vote was too important to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-member Business Roundtable took the lead in advertising
in 27 congressional districts, including a barrage of ads during
the congressional recess and another blitz over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Some individual corporations have also run ads supporting
upgraded trade relations. Motorola has been among the most active,
spending more than $1 million on newspaper and television ads
during news shows. The Illinois-based telecommunication company has
invested more than $1 billion in China and fears that European
competitors will benefit at its expense if Congress denies China
the new trading rights.

LACK OF `BLACK BOX' HAMPERS INQUIRY IN PENNSYLVANIA CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cockpit voice recorder was not working in the
twin-engine turboprop that crashed near Scranton, Pa., on Sunday
morning, and apparently never worked, because it was the wrong
model for that airplane, the National Transportation Safety Board
said Monday. And the plane did not carry a flight data recorder,
the other kind of ``black box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This seriously hampers the investigation, let's face it,''
said George W. Black Jr., the safety board member assigned to the
crash scene, as investigators looked for clues that could explain
why the plane, on a flight from Atlantic City, crashed as it made
its second approach to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International
Airport, killing all 19 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now reduced on this accident to having only radar data
and whatever information we can glean from that,'' along with
statements from witnesses, Black said. The investigators also have
statements from a crew member to an air traffic controller,
including, ``we've lost both engines.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators continued to analyze the wreckage Monday, and were
seeking to retrieve fuel samples from the soil, trying to explain
why the engines appeared to have failed. A preliminary analysis of
a sample taken from the truck used to refuel the plane found no
problem. The truck was at Republic Airport, in Farmingdale, N.Y.;
the plane was operated by Executive Airlines, which is based there,
and was being flown as a charter flight.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was a BAE Jetstream 31, which is popular with commuter
airlines, and in that role it must carry a cockpit voice recorder
and a flight data recorder. The voice recorder also captures
cockpit sounds, including engine pitch. Black said investigators
now hoped to get that information from tapes of the pilots'
conversations with air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder captures engine performance, and, in
some cases, records warnings as they are issued to the crew. Under
Federal Aviation Administration rules, planes with six or more
passenger seats and for which two pilots are required must have
cockpit voice recorders, but charters do not have to have flight
data recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Black said that the voice recorder on the plane that crashed
needed 120 volts alternating current, but that the plane supplied
28 volts direct current.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jetstream 31's carry voice recorders with an inverter, a
device that turns direct current into alternating current. But this
one did not, Black said, and that would have been obvious every
time the recorder was tested. Federal regulations require the
planes to be equipped with a test device that indicates if the
recorder is working.
</P>
<P>
   An airline that flies the Jetstream 31 said Monday that its
procedures call for checking the cockpit voice recorder before the
first flight each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people say that the flight data recorder tells you
what happens and sometimes, if you're lucky, the cockpit voice
recorder tells you why something happened,'' Black said. ``So now
we don't have what happened because we have no data recorder and we
also do not have the voice recorder, which might have explained to
us some of the conversations between the crew during this last part
of the flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to understand why both engines failed.
Failure of a single engine is unusual, but both at once is
extremely rare. Of the many possibilities, a flight data recorder
and cockpit voice recorder together might have made clear what
happened; for example, if one engine faltered and the crew tried to
shut it down but mistakenly turned off the wrong engine.
</P>
<P>
   Turboprops are essentially jet engines with a propeller attached
and have about the same reliability as other jet engines, in
contrast to the piston-driven engines common in single-engine
planes. As Black said Monday, ``one of the reasons for having two
engines is so that you can have two almost totally independent
systems, separate fuel feeds, separate ignition systems, just as
this kind of a backup.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire after the crash is an indication that the plane still
had fuel aboard, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the safety board has found problems
with black boxes. After a Boeing 747 operated by Tower Air slid off
a snowy runway at Kennedy Airport in 1995, investigators found that
its flight data recorder was scrambling the data.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crashes that the safety board investigates are of
planes with no recorders, because they are privately owned, general
aviation planes. But the results of those investigations are often
less authoritative than those with better data.

 &HT;    Hopefuls try to qualify for U.S. Open
 &HT;    By John Manasso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The golfers all came out to the U.S. Open local
qualifier at Braelinn Golf Club in Peachtree City with different
variations on the same theme.
</P>
<P>
   Some came not to embarrass themselves. Some came with the idea
of making history. Some came to get more tournament practice. Some
came because they like playing with the ''local hotshots.''
</P>
<P>
   But they all held out for the dream _ to earn one of the 88
slots open to qualifiers for this year's U.S. Open at Pebble Beach
next month. From Braelinn, the top 11 out of a field of 146 golfers
advanced to the sectional, which is June 6 at Roswell's Sittindown
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The sectional is much more rigorous. The sectional is a one-day,
36-hole tournament with a field that includes players who were
exempt from the local qualifier, including many who have PGA Tour
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the elusive idea of the average Joe making the U.S.
Open remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, man, a bunch of times,'' Alvin Jackson said of the
prospect of making the field at Pebble Beach. Jackson, who shot a
75 at Braelinn, is a former college basketball player who was
drafted in the sixth round by the Utah Jazz in 1981. Golf is his
new game when he isn't teaching physical education class at Rosa
Taylor Elementary in Macon. ''You just don't know. (Making the
Open) would be nice, trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Golf Association holds nearly 100 local qualifying
tournaments throughout the country, offering club pros, amateurs
and golfers on the mini-tours, such as Hooters and buy.com
(formerly Nike), the chance to make the Open.
</P>
<P>
   All they have to put up is $100. This year, a record 8,457
golfers throughout the country signed up. That's more than 500 than
competed last year.
</P>
<P>
   As golf continues to boom in popularity, these qualifiers have
become more select and they're not as ''Open'' as they once were.
Gone are the days when any local hacker could sign up. The ones at
Braelinn all had to have a handicaps of 1.4 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Sunday golfer is a rarity. The most common
golfers at the local qualifiers are the ones who play the most:
high school, college, club and touring pro golfers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the qualifiers have become so popular that Braelinn
could not handle all of those who signed up. Ninety other golfers
played at Griffin Country Club, with the top six moving on.
</P>
<P>
   The low medalist at Braelinn was Javier Sanchez, who qualified
for four consecutive U.S. Opens from 1993 to 1996. Sanchez fired a
7-under 65.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he was told in 1996 by USGA officials that he was
the first player to qualify four years in a row by going all the
way through the local qualifiers. If he qualifies through
Sittindown Creek _ the same course he qualified through in 1994 and
1996 _ five times also would be a record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure no one has done it five times and I'm hoping to be
the one to do it,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Four qualifiers at Braelinn made it without a playoff. They were
Chip Drury (66), Roland Thatcher (67), Charles Howell (68), Thomas
Roddy (68). Eight others tied at 69 and went to a playoff for six
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Bolli, Reid Edstrom, Ryan Hybl, Chip Deason, Matt
Weibring and Bill McDonald were the others. McDonald escaped after
four holes, with Brian Duncan, 16, of Greenville, S.C. Duncan, who
was a member of the final threesome to come off, shot a 31 _ the
low 9-hole score of the day _ on the back nine to make the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The six Griffin qualifiers were West Latimer (66), Jimmy
Johnston (67), Takeshi Mitsunaga (67), Don Wright (70), Rich Taylor
(70) and Heath Slocum (71), who defeated two others in a four-hole
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more recognizable names at Braelinn was that of Matt
Weibring, a sophomore on Georgia Tech's team whose father D.A.
plays on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Weibring said his father is exempt for the Open and is hoping
they can become only the second father-son pair to make the Open
after Jack and Gary Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't get to see him so often,'' Weibring said. ''He's
designing courses and playing and I'm at school. We're always going
our different ways. It would be cool to spend a week with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a player of Weibring's pedigree, David Nell, 48, of
Sharpsburg plays only once a week. Nell, a warehouse clerk in Union
City, called himself, ''the tinnest of tin cups.''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 or 15 years, he has made it to the sectional once. He shot
a 76 at Braelinn.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fun,'' Nell said of the sectional. ''I got to see some
of the Tour players, a couple of guys I've heard of and read about.
I get a kick out of some of the guys I play with _ the local
hotshots and college players.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nell makes golf his hobby, Kyle Ritter, 26, of Canton
hopes to make it his career. Ritter, a former Illinois State
player, works part-time at Townlake Hills in Woodstock and hopes to
get good enough to get a sponsorship on one of the mini tours.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy seeing the better golfers to see what it takes,''
Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lawson, a sophomore at nearby Starr's Mill, also got a
chance to see what it takes, competing in his first qualifier.
Lawson was hopeful after making the turn at 1-under, but he
finished with a 2-over 74. He lives less than a mile from Braelinn
and said he plays it ''every other day.'' U.S. Open dreams aside,
he was just seeking not to embarrass himself.
</P>
<P>
   Did he accomplish that?
</P>
<P>
   ''That's debatable,'' he said.

TWO MERGERS HIGHLIGHT E-COMMERCE TRENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Calif., Texas)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The consolidation of the business-to-business
software market accelerated Monday with two big deals. The Vignette
Corp. said it was acquiring OnDisplay Inc. in a $1.7 billion stock
swap, while WebMethods Inc. is buying Active Software Inc. in a
stock deal valued at $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies specialize in software that seeks to
integrate business processes within companies or transactions
between companies. Because this task requires multiple
capabilities, analysts say there will be more such mergers as
competitors strive to offer a complete package. Although most of
the companies pursuing this market are small start-ups, IBM,
Microsoft, Oracle and other heavyweights have indicated they will
have competing offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As B-to-B technology matures and advances, customers are
asking more of each individual vendor,'' said Clark Spurrier, a
principal with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which advised both
Vignette and WebMethods. ``This is not just layering and added
functionality. It's expanding into new product categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Vignette fell $8.9375, to $34.875, while OnDisplay
rose 87.5 cents, to $54.125. WebMethods fell $15, to $72, and
Active Software dropped 93.75 cents, to $32.0625, all on Nasdaq.
Analysts said the shares were caught in the early technology
sell-off but that the mergers made sense.
</P>
<P>
   Vignette, based in Austin, Texas, sells a suite of applications
called V/5, designed to allow companies to personalize individuals'
interactions with their Web-based systems. OnDisplay, based in San
Ramon, Calif., offers software that allows business information
like purchase orders, inventory status checks, invoices and product
catalog data to be integrated and exchanged among suppliers and
distribution partners.
</P>
<P>
   Vignette will swap 1.58 shares for each share of OnDisplay,
valuing the company at $69.22 a share. Based on Friday's closing
price, that is a 30 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers increasingly require coordination between
enterprise systems, suppliers and multiple online marketplaces,''
Greg Peters, Vignette's president and chief executive, said in a
statement. ``The acquisition of OnDisplay furthers Vignette's
stated mission to provide the broadest and deepest application
platform to support the needs of companies who are serious about
building businesses online.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMethods, based in Fairfax, Va., makes software that allows
the computer systems of a company to communicate with systems of
the company's suppliers and customers. Active Software, based in
Santa Clara, Calif., makes software that integrates a company's
internal computer systems, like order management and accounting, to
communicate with each other and run together. WebMethods and Active
have worked together at high-profile customers like Federal
Express, Juniper Networks and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Active Software's shareholders will receive
0.527 share of WebMethods for each Active Software share. Based on
WebMethods' close of $87 a share on Friday, the deal values Active
Software's shares at $45.85, a 39 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Scholler, an analyst with Meta Group, said that customers
increasingly wanted their enterprise application integration
software, the domain of Active, to mesh seamlessly with their
business-to-business integration software, or B2BI, the domain of
WebMethods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately these things are going to drive together as the
infrastructure vendors start to deliver the platform technology on
which a business can build its e-presence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Yates, an analyst with Forrester Research, said that
because these two deals happened at the same time, ``what looked
clever yesterday has landed Vignette in a bind today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With this deal,'' he said, ``Vignette has thrown down the
gauntlet to commerce-platform competitors like Open Market and
BroadVision to develop a system-to-system commerce story of their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those companies had already formed partnerships with
Active, and now get WebMethods as part of the package. WebMethods
``is now stronger than OnDisplay,'' he said. &QL;

ASTRONAUTS FINISH FIRST PART OF MISSION AT SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   (Undated) With external renovations of the international space
station completed, the Atlantis astronauts turned their repair
skills to the inside of the yet-to-be inhabited outpost late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The highest priority of the shuttle's maintenance mission is an
overhaul of the electrical power system within the Russian segment
of the two-room station.
</P>
<P>
   The five-man, two-woman shuttle crew plans to replace four of
six large power storage batteries, four electronic devices that
control the charging and discharging of the batteries and a pair of
small voltage regulators.
</P>
<P>
   During the first foray into the station, astronaut Susan Helms
and cosmonaut Yuri Usachev planned to replace two of the 165-pound
batteries in the Russian module. The complete overhaul will
continue through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious to get in there and get to work,'' Atlantis
commander Jim Halsell told mission control as the astronauts were
awakened Monday evening. ``Is there anything to keep us from
getting under way early?''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew became the first humans to visit the fledgling
station since June as they docked late Saturday. The station's two
modules tower nearly 80 feet above the shuttle's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   As they floated aboard the station Monday, the Atlantis
astronauts lugged along portable fans, surgical masks and small air
quality monitors to fend off any of the same ill effects reported
by the June visitors. Those included headaches, itchy eyes and, in
one instance, nausea from poor air circulation.
</P>
<P>
   NASA said improvements in the air flow provided by the shuttle
should prevent any new ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the flight is to prepare the first two modules of
the station. They were joined in Earth orbit in December of 1998
for the tardy arrival of the Russian crew module in July.
</P>
<P>
   Stalled by Russian economic and rocket problems, the addition of
the crew module will furnish the outpost with an independent life
support system, including the equipment that cleanses the air. Its
arrival will permit the first resident crew of astronauts and
cosmonauts to arrive in November.
</P>
<P>
   The battery system in the Russian segment began to falter late
last year, a circumstance that would not have been so critical to
the outpost had the arrival of the crew module not slipped so far
behind schedule. At least three of the six batteries must function
in order for the two currently orbiting modules to link with the
Russian crew module.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, Atlantis astronauts Jeff Williams and Jim Voss
embarked on a near seven-hour spacewalk, scaling the exterior of
the international station for a wide range of repairs.
</P>
<P>
   During the trek, Williams and Voss re-secured a wobbly American
cargo crane, assembled and installed a similar Russian crane,
replaced a broken U.S. communications antenna and attached eight
new hand rails.
</P>
<P>
   Those tasks removed a potential obstacle to the addition of the
crew module in July. They improved the ability of NASA ground
control teams at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to communicate
directly with the outpost rather than through the Russian ground
station in suburban Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the station's construction will require an estimated
49 spacewalks, totaling 304 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The United States leads a 16-nation partnership in the
seven-year construction effort.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium envisions a complex spanning an area equal to two
football fields placed side by side, housing a crew of seven. The
project will be used for cooperative research in medicine, physics
and biology.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership also hopes to use the station for the
development of hardware that will enable human explorers to return
to the moon as well as explore Mars and other deep space
destinations.

<P>
   Mark Reynolds Hughes, the multimillionaire founder of Herbalife
International, a nutritional supplement company that has been
controversial for both its products and sales methods, died last
weekend in his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 44.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' death appeared to be from natural causes, a spokesman
for Herbalife said. An autopsy is to be completed later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' body was found by relatives in the bedroom of his
beach-front house on the Pacific Coast Highway about 11 a.m.
Sunday. He is believed to have died late  &UR;  &LR; Saturday or early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was born in Los Angeles and had only a ninth-grade
education. According to the Herbalife Web site, he became
interested in nutrition at 18, when his mother, JoAnn Hughes, died
from an accidental overdose of prescription diet pills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 Hughes began selling Slender Now, a weight-loss product
made by Seyforth Laboratories. The company sold its product using
direct sales, in which an independent sales representative buys the
product at a discount, then sells it to the public, and each
distributor gets a royalty from the sales of every additional
distributor he brings in. It was a method Hughes used successfully
to market and distribute Herbalife.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, Seyforth failed, and Hughes, one of its top
sales representatives, began selling exercise equipment and
weight-loss products for another company before teaming with
Richard Marconi, a former colleague at Slender Now, to start
Herbalife in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes started selling Herbalife _ based on ``natural and herbal
ingredients'' _ from his car. In five years he was a millionaire.
In 1985, he paid $7 million for a house owned by the country singer
and actor Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   His infomercials, featuring testimonials from people who had
used Herbalife products, were shown on cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Hughes took Herbalife public. Members of his sales
force, at the time estimated to be more than 700,000 in the United
States, Canada, Australia and Britain, were known to wear badges
saying ``Lose weight now/Ask me how!''
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of Herbalife's success came controversy. Federal
and California health agencies accused the company of violating
labeling standards and using improper sales practices. According to
The Associated Press, regulators contended that the company was
making medicinal claims. Medicines are regulated by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, while nutritional supplements are not.
</P>
<P>
   Some health experts doubted the efficacy of Herbalife products,
saying that in some instances they relied too heavily on laxatives
and caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Herbalife, while admitting no wrongdoing, settled with
California by paying $850,000 in fines and agreeing to take some
products off the market.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, Hughes announced plans to buy the outstanding
stock of his company, but he reportedly abandoned those plans last
month because of trouble obtaining financing.
</P>
<P>
   Herbalife reported 1999 retail sales sales of $1.79 billion, in
46 countries, and a worldwide sales force of more than 1 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is survived by his third wife, the former Darcy LaPier;
his father, Jack Reynolds; his grandmother, Hazel Hughes; three
half-brothers, Kirk Hartmen, Jon Hughes and Don Hughes; and a son,
Alexander Hughes.

AMAZON RESCINDS HONOR IN SHORT STORY CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (Eds: Subs 4th graf, Amazon.com ruled ..., to add circulation
figures from magazine's Web site.) 
By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Monday, the first PEN/Amazon.com Short Story Award was
announced and Meera Nair of Brooklyn won the $10,000 prize. It was
one of the largest prizes for an undiscovered writer _ for her work
entitled ``Video,'' about the havoc wrought on a young Indian
couple's marriage by the sexually explicit culture of the West.
With a disclaimer, Amazon is running the full text of the story
despite some complaints over the graphic descriptions of sex _ and
despite the fact that the story was found to be ineligible for the
award.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Amazon and PEN rescinded the prize, which includes
publication on Amazon and in The Boston Book Review, and gave it to
someone else when it was discovered that Nair had been published
previously in a national magazine, which technically meant she was
not a beginner.
</P>
<P>
   The judges gave the prize instead to one of the runners-up,
Marlene Reed Wetzel, of Bixby, Okla., for ``A Map of Tripoli,
1967,'' a love story about an American woman and a Jewish-Italian
man, set in Libya just before the Six-Day War. It is the first
published work of fiction for Wetzel, who is 63, and has lived and
worked in the Middle East. Up to now, Wetzel has published articles
only in local papers in the Oklahoma area, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com ruled Nair ineligible because one of her previous
stories had appeared in The Threepenny Review, which violated the
competition's rules that entrants must not have published a work of
fiction in a nationally distributed magazine with a circulation of
over 5,000. Nair had told Amazon about the Threepenny Review story,
but neither she nor Amazon initially realized that the magazine's
circulation was higher than that; according to its Web site, The
Threepenny is a ``quarterly review of the arts and society'' with a
circulation of ``10,000+.'' The decision to rescind the award was
made after someone called Amazon's attention to the magazine's
circulation figures. The judges for the prize were Sherman Alexie,
David Guterson and Jamaica Kincaid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nair will be allowed to keep the $10,000 and her story
remains on the Amazon Web site, said Patty Smith, an Amazon
spokeswoman. In the story, an Indian husband watches a pornographic
video and tries to persuade his wife to perform the acts he sees.
``Some of them did object to the sexual nature'' of the piece,
Smith said of the customers. ``Some people did not share the
judges' enthusiasm for this wonderful story.''
</P>
<P>
   But the customers' reaction had nothing to do with the prize's
withdrawal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Amazon was very fair,'' Nair said. ``I don't think
they had any qualms'' about publishing the story.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said 12,000 people entered the contest. The submissions
ranged from apocalyptic fantasies to stories about children and
horses. The other runners-up are Thomas Cockrell, Holiday Reinhorn
and Paul Rusconi, whose stories are available on Amazon.

<P>
   In signs of an intensifying digital rush in the American book
industry, three trade publishing giants and Microsoft are poised to
plunge deeper into the emerging electronic literary market.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Trade Publishing, a unit of Time Warner, is expected
to announce Tuesday the creation of a separate online publishing
venture called iPublish.com and iWrite, an unconventional hybrid
that will solicit manuscripts from would-be authors for review for
electronic publication.
</P>
<P>
   And in a dueling morning new conference, Microsoft _ along with
Simon &AMP; Schuster, a unit of Viacom and Random House, a unit of
Bertelsmann _ will detail the giveaway of electronic versions of
Michael Crichton's most recent book, the thriller ``Timeline,''
along with agreements to publish more than a dozen Star Trek titles
in electronic form readable only on Microsoft's new reader software
for hand-held and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic pace of developments indicates that the industry is
fast reaching a critical mass in its embrace of technology that
could reshape the market, although skeptics still argue that
electronic books are at least two years away from gaining
widespread popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's alliance with two of the nation's top trade
publishers is the company's first successful deal to obtain popular
new titles for its software, which has thus far had little to offer
readers except older public domain titles and fairy tales. And over
the next three weeks, a person close to Microsoft said, there will
be more such announcements.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Microsoft executives will introduce their first
marquee author, Crichton, who will try to pick up where his fellow
best-selling writer Stephen King left off in March, when copies of
his electronic novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' ignited a two-day
burst in 400,000 orders that overwhelmed booksellers like
Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, ``Timeline'' is a story about historians employed by
a technology billionaire not unlike Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates. In the fictional realm, the entrepreneur wants to build a
theme park with ancient artifacts, so historians are dispatched
through time travel to feudal France, where they confront the
thrills and chills of swordplay and pitch-filled catapults.
</P>
<P>
   In the evolving world of electronic publishing, the chills come
from lowly competitors, who are challenging large mainstream
publishers to take new risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large conglomerates realize now that they better learn by
doing rather than to continue to observe not one, not five, not 50,
but hundreds of startup.coms that are entering this market,'' said
Robert E. Baensch, a former publishing executive and director of
New York University's Center for Publishing, who predicts that a
mass market for electronic books is two to three years away.
</P>
<P>
   But until then, the mainstream publishers that dominate the
business appear unwilling to wait _ even if it is not clear yet how
protected the electronic titles are from hackers. It took about two
days before King's novella was successfully hacked and posted
online.
</P>
<P>
   One executive in the electronic book industry said that talks
were already under way with Microsoft and other software and device
manufacturers to try to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Time Warner's start-up, iPublish, is already
considering ways to experiment with the very form of the book. A
top Time Warner corporate executive said it would probably publish
short offerings of digital nonfiction and fiction from established
authors like David Baldacci and Walter Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of 15 employees who started last fall, the new
electronic publisher will also offer condensed versions of print
books. Serial books are also in the offing and will be priced by
installment.
</P>
<P>
   Those new titles _ along with older digital books from Time
Warner _ will start becoming available next fall. The works will be
available for reading with Microsoft software and will also be
available to rivals including Gemstar's Rocket eBooks, SoftBook
Readers and NetLibrary's Peanut Press versions for Palm hand-held
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Time Warner executive said the company was also creating
another more unconventional publishing arm, iWrite, which will seek
manuscripts from any would-be author. The new company is similar in
nature to Xlibris, a Philadelphia-based Internet start-up that
recently sold a 49 percent stake to Random House. Xlibris also
solicits work from any writer but charges fees for editing and
review.
</P>
<P>
   IWrite will not charge editing fees, the executive said, and the
company will hire people to read the material, much like the
old-fashioned slush pile of unsolicited manuscripts that editors
have been receiving _ and reading sporadically _ for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at electronic publishing as a medium that can expand
an author's audience rather than cannibalize it,'' the executive
said. ``First of all, we're really hurting with younger readers.
Our audience is tending to move more and more to north of 45. We
really feel we have lost a huge chunk of that audience in the 18 to
34 range, and it seems to me that electronic books will really hit
hardest with the younger readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Microsoft's giveaway of Crichton novels will be
available only through one bookseller, Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, competitors like Gemstar appreciate that the
software giant has made the move. The company has struck a
partnership with the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia in
an effort to manufacture and sell more than half a million
electronic book devices this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renowned authors such as Michael Crichton will bring a great
deal of credibility to the reading community and will go along way
to usher in the age of electronic books,'' said Gemstar's chief
executive, Henry Yuen, who has been making the round of publishers'
suites in search of titles that can be offered digitally. ``I
expect that this type of endorsement will be followed by other
major publishers and authors.''

ARMY GENERAL WHO FACES SEX COMPLAINT LOSES POST
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story replaces DOCTORS-HEALTH on the NYT front page.
DOCTORS-HEALTH is now inside.) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army has rescinded the new appointment of Maj.
Gen. Larry G. Smith in the wake of accusations by the Army's
highest-ranking woman that he made an unwanted sexual advance
toward her in 1996, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's appointment as the Army's deputy inspector general, a
position in which he would have been responsible for investigating
accusations of wrongdoing against senior officers, has been delayed
since the officer, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, made her
accusations in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Army made no announcement withdrawing his name, but last
Friday the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, appointed
another two-star general to take over the position, which has been
filled temporarily by a brigadier general for nearly eight months.
</P>
<P>
   With the withdrawal of his appointment, Smith's military career,
which began in 1966 and included three tours in Vietnam, appears
all but over.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's decision to replace Smith, however, came before the
formal investigation of the general has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Army investigators told Army leaders that
they had substantiated Kennedy's accusation that Smith touched her
in an inappropriate way and tried to kiss her at the end of a
meeting in her office at the Pentagon, defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, who is said to have denied making a sexual advance,
has the right to challenge their findings, and Army officials have
indicated that he plans to do so. Smith has not publicly discussed
the investigation and did not respond to a request for comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials have said that the accusations, if proved, do not
rise to the level of criminal conduct punishable under the Uniform
Code of Military Justice. Even if he is ultimately exonerated, it
is not clear that Smith would have a position to move into,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials made the decision to find another officer to fill
the deputy inspector general's position months ago, the officials
said Monday. They said Army leaders realized that Smith's
appointment could not go forward given the publicity created by
Kennedy's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   One official insisted that the appointment of the officer, Maj.
Gen. Joseph Inge, was not directly related to the ongoing
investigation, emphasizing that the Army had not yet decided on
what punishment, if any, Smith faced.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, Inge has served as commander of the
Army's 9th Theater Support Command, based in Japan. Since the
appointment does not include a promotion in rank, it does not
require confirmation by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, made when Shinseki's office released a list of
new appointments, did not specify when Inge would start. But
officials said the officer who has temporarily filled the job while
the investigation moved forward, Brig. Gen. Daniel Doherty, planned
to retire soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job had to be filled eventually,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been an embarrassment for the Army, which has been
battered by sexual misconduct cases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the first woman in the Army to rise to the rank of
lieutenant general, did not file a complaint at the time she says
the incident took place. She raised her accusation only in
September. Her friends have said she was concerned about Smith's
appointment to a position responsible, among other things, for
investigating accusations of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, both officers were major generals. Smith, who rose
through the Army's cavalry and armored ranks, was serving as the
manager of the Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program,
which has provided training and equipment to elite Saudi forces
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was serving as the assistant deputy chief of staff for
intelligence. In 1997, she was given her third star and promoted to
deputy chief, responsible for coordinating intelligence reports for
Army commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's decision leaves Smith's status in the Army in an even
more perilous limbo than before. His appointment, made last August,
never took place. Since the investigation began, he has served
officially as a special assistant to the director of the Army
staff, attached to the Army's Materiel Command in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John Keane, who is
responsible for meting out punishment in cases like these, has
received the investigators' findings. If he accepts them, he is
likely to reprimand Smith and force him to retire.
</P>
<P>
   An Army spokesman, Col. Edwin Veiga, declined Monday to discuss
the status of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy plans to retire this summer. Her last day as deputy
chief of staff is June 2.

ISRAEL'S BUFFER STRIP IN SOUTH LEBANON COLLAPSING 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The center of Israel's buffer zone in southern
Lebanon collapsed Monday as Israeli-backed Lebanese militias
abandoned villages, command posts and arms to advancing Hezbollah
guerrillas, some barely a mile from Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television showed Hezbollah followers triumphantly
raising their Kalashnikov-emblazoned yellow flags atop heavily
fortified command posts that Israel had turned over to its militia
allies only days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That handover was part of an ongoing Israeli pullback leading up
to a full withdrawal by July 7, a deadline set by Prime Minister
Ehud Barak. For the last 22 years, Israeli troops have occupied an
11-mile deep zone inside Lebanon, fighting alongside the
2,500-member Israeli-equipped South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Israeli warplanes repeatedly bombed Hezbollah fighters
and followers moving into the border zone, killing as many as five
civilians and wounding dozens, according to Lebanese reports.
Fearing Hezbollah reprisals, the Israeli army ordered Israeli
frontier residents into bomb shelters, but hundreds chose instead
to leave their homes and drive far out of range of Katyusha
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Tanks and troops rushed from deep inside Israel to reinforce
outposts on the Israeli side of the border Monday night, with
pressure mounting on Barak to pull the remaining troops in Lebanon
back into Israel as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had hoped for an orderly, staged withdrawal, with U.N.
troops replacing the Israeli army in the southern border zone. But
with the United Nations still debating whether to expand and
redeploy its 4,500-member peacekeeping force in Lebanon, and
Hezbollah suddenly in control of the central section of the border
zone, such a plan is no longer possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not expect the withdrawal to be completely without
dangers or difficult moments,'' Barak said Monday night as he
called an emergency meeting of his security cabinet. ``There have
been such moments, and there will be more in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting continued late into the night, and there was no
immediate announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Lebanon, hundreds of Muslim villagers walked and
drove past abandoned Israeli army checkpoints, which were
apparently left without a fight, to occupy the border district.
</P>
<P>
   The South Lebanon Army began quickly disintegrating on its own
Monday, abandoning military posts and equipment throughout the
central swath of the border region.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of panicked militamen and family members fled into
Israel, which promised to provide at least temporary refuge to its
Lebanese allies. Many more surrendered to the Hezbollah forces,
which Monday seized six command posts and a dozen villages that had
long been under the control of Israel and the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis watching the televised images of the suddenly
transformed border zone, it was the beginning of the end of a
costly occupation that began with the invasion of Lebanon 25 years
ago, and was soon institutionalized with the creation of a border
``security zone'' patrolled by Israel and its militia partners. But
while opinion polls show that Israelis overwhelmingly support
Barak's planned withdrawal, those images _ and the prospect of
further fighting _ have proved deeply unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with army commanders on the Israeli side of the
border, Barak reiterated his pledge to pull all Israeli forces out
of southern Lebanon within ``a few weeks.'' His office denied
Israeli television reports that he had ordered the troops withdrawn
by the first of June, five weeks ahead of his original deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of Monday's collapse of at least two battalions of
the South Lebanon Army, the security cabinet was said to be trying
to speed up the withdrawal, while reinforcing Isreali military
installations immediately south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he could not promise border residents that they would
be out of danger soon. ``We have to realize that we are entering a
period in which there is a certain degree of uncertainty, and our
responsibility is likely to impel us to order them to remain in the
shelters a few days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All along the border, meanwhile, Israeli army trucks continued
to haul arms and other equipment out of Lebanon, while private
Israeli work crews erected new electrified fences. It was unclear
how many Israeli soldiers remained in Lebanese territory. Inside
Israel, army installations were reinforced Monday night by tanks
and troops redeployed from the south.
</P>
<P>
   In a message aimed at both Beirut and Damascus _ as well as at
an increasingly nervous Israeli public _ Barak warned Monday that
forces across the border ``should not test our resolve by daring to
fire at Israeli soldiers, and much less at northern border
communities'' during the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response will be painful, and not necessarily here in the
villages across from us: not Ramle, not Kozeh, not Alma Shaab and
Aita Shaab,'' he said, citing nearby Lebanese towns often used by
Hezbollah artillery units. ``It will be in completely different
places, and very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the South Lebanon Army's desperate scramble out of Israel's
shrinking security zone and the fear of rocket attacks on northern
communities have increased Israeli fears that the withdrawal could
set off a new round of intense cross-border warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday night, Hezbollah forces have secured control of
most of the former Israeli command posts in the central border
region.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli planes Monday bombed Israeli tanks, artillery and
armored personnel carriers that the South Lebanon Army had
abandoned at the posts, in order to keep them from falling into
Hezbollah hands, the Israeli military said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli opposition, calling for a special session of
Parliament on Tuesday to debate the withdrawal, Monday fiercely
criticized the border chaos as an indictment of Barak's plan to
withdraw from Lebanon even without securing a peace settlement with
Syria, Hezbollah's prime protector.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   ``We must not unilaterally withdraw without first establishing
quiet in southern Lebanon,'' said Ariel Sharon, the head of the
opposition Likud party, who led Israel's invasion of Lebanon a
quarter-century ago. ``That is the first thing that must be done.
Unfortunately, the prime minister can't stand the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's party responded in a tart statement that the prime
minister ``has no need for advice on Lebanon from Sharon, who was
disqualified from serving as defense minister in the wake of his
mishaps in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese withdrawal crisis completely overshadowed the
suspension of peace talks with the Palestinians as Palestinian
security forces kept firm control of continued demonstrations
Monday demanding the release of PLO prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the SLA troops who surrendered their positions Monday
belonged to the Shi'ite minority faction of the militia, which is
considered less resolutely opposed to Hezbollah than the Christian
and Druze troops still patrolling outposts to the east and west.
Despite the collapse of the SLA central front, Antoine Lahad, the
self-styled general who commands the militia force, was quoted as
saying Monday that his forces would fight on unless granted a
blanket amnesty by the Lebanese government.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ganguro (dark face) girls were out in force _
faces tanned the color of football pigskin, eyes ringed with stark
white panda makeup, and hair, as a bystander put it, ``dried, fried
and blown to the side.'' The yamanba were also well represented,
women fashioned after a Japanese folk figure whose name translates
roughly as ``monster mountain woman.'' Followers of the trend
toward ladylike dressing, take note.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by a violent thunderstorm whipping off the Hudson,
1,000 fashion compulsives hustled themselves to Chelsea last week
for Tokyo Street 2000 _ a roadshow of contemporary photography, art
and fashion meant to introduce New York to some of the less
publicized byways of Japanese design.
</P>
<P>
   The cognoscenti are familiar with Tokyo street style _ its loopy
blend of pop cultural references, label mania, cartoon iconography
and overall appetite for the cultural flotsam of the West. You can
barely avoid it in downtown Manhattan, at Japanese-stocked stores
like Air Market and Hotel Venus, and at clubs and bars around
Little Tokyo, as East Ninth Street is sometimes called.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, you can't escape it in the fashion press, where
imitation is always the sincerest form of self-promotion. Stephen
Meisel's May picture spread in Italian Vogue, for instance, showing
slacker models in scurvy rock T-shirts, could have appeared in any
issue of the mass-market Japanese girls' magazine Cutie. The
unabashed consumerism of Vogue's popular Index feature seems right
out of Cutie's sister book, Spring. And Lucky, the hip shopping
glossy introduced last week by Conde Nast, was ``very inspired'' by
Japanese magazines, with their pages of street shots and shoes,
said Kim France, Lucky's editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things James Truman and I bonded over from the
start was loving those magazines,'' France said, referring to Conde
Nast's editorial director. ``They're very user's manual. They're
very egalitarian. They're very proto-Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident, then, that Takarajimasha, which publishes
Cutie and Spring and sponsored Tokyo Street 2000, chose this moment
for the two-day trade extravaganza, in hopes of alerting New
Yorkers to the fact that there are actual designers behind the
styles that they've been . . . adapting. If the clothes the sponsor
brought along were a trifle cautious, that didn't stop the audience
from turning out in what amounts to the real thing: Harajuku style.
</P>
<P>
   Harajuku, a train terminal next to the upscale neighborhood of
Shibuya and a bosky shrine to the Meiji imperium, is Tokyo style's
grand promenade. On a given Saturday, the area and a nearby
shopping complex called Laforet are thronged with Tokyo's young,
disporting themselves in the regalia of a generation for whom pop
culture is mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   The Harajuku style takes an Osterizer approach to dressing,
randomly consuming historic design references the same hungry way a
DJ might sample music. The result is a scene in which neo-Goths
parade cheek by jowl with Superfly pimps, where Roy Orbison
look-alikes wear Hello Kitty, where Elvis can be spotted in a
Snoopy T-shirt, and where young women outfitted as naughty
schoolgirls accessorize themselves with theatrically bloodied
bandages and Kabuki wigs.
</P>
<P>
   For years, what most Westerners knew about Japanese fashion
derived mainly from runway reports on a handful of austere
deconstructionists. ``People only know, like, three designers _
Issey Miyaki, Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto,'' said Yuko Arakawa,
who produced Tokyo Street 2000. ``It's a little bit boring.'' It's
also barely a fraction of the overall story.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo street style, Arakawa said, is not really so much a
fashion as a gestalt. ``There's so much variety, it's almost
chaotic,'' added Robb Young, a fashion writer for aRude magazine.
``What's great about that mixing of styles is that it lacks
pretension. There's no coordinated or uncoordinated.'' What's
difficult for most Westerners to comprehend ``is that it's not a
manifestation of a life style,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the West you'd have preconceptions about people dressed in
punk or rockabilly or post-Gothic or teen idol clothes,'' Young
said. ``In Japan, you can't make those assumptions about the person
behind the costume.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, it all goes into the fashion blender. That doesn't
mean those who wear it are indifferent to the statement they're
making. ``There are not many other opportunities for people to
express themselves in what is, after all, this very unified, very
conformist state,'' Maiko Seki, a Tokyo fashion publicist, said as
Tokyo Street 2000 began. ``So clothing may be one of the ways for
people to present themselves as individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the individual presentations so much as the mass
effusion of Tokyo style that makes it irresistible. ``The way they
throw themselves into trends, and the attention to detail, is
unreal,'' said Laura Wills, whose Manhattan clothing shop,
Screaming Mimi's, operates a branch in Tokyo. Japan's urban young
are ``the most creative dressers in the world,'' Wills said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They process trends at the speed of light,'' she said. ``One
month it's metallic clothes, high gold shoes and anything glitter.
The next month everyone's wearing Joan Jett T-shirts.'' The Tokyo
craze of this particular instant, she noted, is Michael Jackson,
``especially anything from the white-glove era.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a white glove was spotted at the Metropolitan
Pavilion in Chelsea, where Tokyo Street 2000 took place, amid the
monster platform shoes, the shredded Tommy Hilfiger jogging shells,
and the Afros, dreadlocks and cornrows that are a homage to
Jamaican dance hall music and American rap by Japanese fans known
as pigeon heads. And while the ganguro style of wearing dark makeup
could easily be read as racist, the image also takes inspiration
from Japanese fairy tale figures and comments on the orangey dermal
effects of tanning beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all wonderfully absurd,'' said Kim Hastreiter, editor in
chief of Paper magazine, which was among the first American
magazines to embrace Harajuku style labels like Virus, Hysteric
Clamor, Hotel Venus and A Bathing Ape. ``The Japanese kids have
this nutty take on culture,'' she added. ``They think in this
cartoon kind of way.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its apparent influence, Japanese street style has so
far failed to penetrate the American retail market, largely because
of high labor costs and because its designers remain obscure. Once
a major producer of apparel for the United States market, Japan now
accounts for less than 1 percent of overall apparel imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now we've been able to live without exporting,''
explained John H. Miura, a fashion business consultant. ``We're our
own largest market, the No. 2 market in the world. But the
situation has been so tough in Japan that manufacturers are looking
outward. The problem is that Americans only know the Issey Miyakes
and Rei Kawakubos. There are a lot of designers making beautiful
clothes, and the quality is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the cost. ``It can be as much as 30 percent over American
prices,'' Miura conceded. Which is why Japan's contribution to
dressing the American colossus amounts, as an official in the
Commerce Department recently put it, to little more than a Hello
Kitty bag.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the mission of Tokyo Street 2000, whose runway show, set
against a backdrop of speedy videos with a voice-over intoning
nonsense phrases in fractured English, may not have broken design
ground, but it did succeed in surveying some popular Harajuku
trends: glitter stickers, appliqued knee-high stockings, Lurex,
ruched stand-away waists on skirts, ratted French twists, ribboned
fabric, hemlines suited to the convent and that fashion
imperishable, acid-dyed denim.
</P>
<P>
   What really mattered was the audience, which had teetered
through a torrential downpour to pose in its most outlandish
finery. ``What you've got to understand,'' Koji Yoshida, the
curator of the fair's art exhibition, said as a woman walked by
with a toy robot on a leash, ``is that, in the West, dressing is
seen as a necessity, whereas in Japan, it has another level. It's
primarily a game.''

DOCTORS IN ANTITRUST FIGHT BOYCOTTING MERCK PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of doctors across the country have been
boycotting drug products made by Merck &AMP; Co., one of the world's
largest drug manufacturers, in a bitter fight over the collective
bargaining rights of doctors, pharmacists and other health care
professionals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the Federation of Physicians and Dentists, a labor
union, called the boycott several weeks ago _ to punish Merck, they
said, for its position on legislation pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the boycott would not harm patients and could
eventually lead to improvements in the quality of care. But critics
said the boycott showed that some doctors had allowed political
considerations to outweigh the best interests of patients.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Seddon, executive director of the federation, said, ``We
broadcast a fax and sent letters to all our members, 8,500 members
in 25 states, telling them that we believe Merck's position was
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors demanded that Merck drop its opposition to a bill
that, by granting an antitrust waiver, would make it much easier
for physicians, pharmacists and other health care professionals to
band together and negotiate with health insurance plans and managed
care companies. Merck has a stake in the legislation because it has
a subsidiary that manages drug benefits for 52 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors got some results with their protest, but the boycott
continues because they want Merck to make a public retraction, by
running newspaper advertisements and sending letters to all members
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Merck refuses,'' the federation said on May 4 in a notice
to doctors across the country, ``remember this above all else:
Reward your friends and punish your enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither house of Congress has yet voted on the bill, although
the House could do so this week or shortly after the Memorial Day
recess.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Seddon said ``doctors can feel
comfortable boycotting a product as long as they know substitutes
are available.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlton A. Richie III, a family practitioner at Tempe
Primary Care Associates, in Arizona, said: ``In writing new
prescriptions, we boycotted every single Merck product. If someone
came in with a blood pressure problem and we had a choice of Merck,
Pfizer and Novartis products, we chose Pfizer or Novartis.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Richie said, in recent weeks he has avoided Merck's
Cozaar and prescribed Novartis' Diovan for patients with
hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Some Merck employees said the boycott had produced a noticeable
effect on sales. Gregory E. Reaves, a spokesman for Merck, refused
to discuss sales figures and said the company had not considered
them in deciding its position on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Merck's sales force have tried to mollify the
doctors, although health policy experts at the company say some
doctors are allowing political considerations to take precedence
over the interests of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Seddon, the executive director of the Federation of Physicians
and Dentists, said doctors from his group and from professional
societies had joined the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of doctors are just simply not prescribing Merck
products,'' Seddon said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   A Merck official said ``it's safe to say hundreds'' of doctors
have joined the boycott. ``It scared our sales force to death,''
this official said. ``I have received two dozen calls from the
sales force.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck tried to address the doctors' concerns by distancing
itself from a coalition that opposes the legislation. The coalition
includes Aetna U.S. Healthcare, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association, the Cigna Corp. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In
an advertisement opposing the bill, the coalition said, ``Doctor
cartels are bad medicine for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Teel Oliver, Merck's vice president for government relations,
wrote a letter to the federation this month stating that the
company, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., had no position on the
bill and had been ``inadvertently listed'' as a member of the
coalition. Merck-Medco Managed Care, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., the
Merck subsidiary that manages prescription drug benefits, was
indeed a member of the coalition, Oliver said, but is not currently
a member and is not lobbying on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was introduced by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., and is
tentatively scheduled for a vote on the House floor this week. The
measure has 220 co-sponsors, a majority of the House, but there is
no guarantee they will all vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would exempt health care professionals from major
provisions of the antitrust laws when they negotiate with health
maintenance organizations and insurers over fees and contract
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says the bill would ``allow health care professionals
to present a united front when negotiating with HMOs.'' As a
result, he says, the quality of care would improve, because doctors
would be better able to advocate on behalf of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bill is a top priority for the American Medical
Association. But the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice
Department adamantly oppose it. Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the
commission, said the bill ``would create a broad antitrust
exemption for price-fixing and boycotts by physicians, dentists,
pharmacists and other health care professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who are employees _ of hospitals, for example _ can
collectively negotiate with their employers to seek higher
compensation under existing law. Critics say Campbell's bill would
grant similar immunity from the antitrust laws to doctors who are
supposed to be competing with one another.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill became law, Pitofsky said, costs to consumers and
employers ``would go up substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office said the bill would increase
costs to private health plans, resulting in higher premiums,
deductibles and co-payments for patients and ``reductions in
coverage by employers.''

ARKANSAS LAW PANEL RECOMMENDS CLINTON BE DISBARRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme
Court recommended on Monday that President Clinton be disbarred
because of his ``serious misconduct'' in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   The court-appointed panel, the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee
on Professional Conduct, concluded that Clinton should receive the
most severe sanction _ the loss of his state license to practice
law _ for providing false testimony in 1998 about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony had been given in a lawsuit by Paula Jones that
had accused Clinton of sexual misconduct while he was governor of
Arkansas and she was a state employee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the committee rules, the disbarment recommendation will
now be considered by a Pulaski County circuit court judge in Little
Rock, who will oversee any disbarment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge decides to disbar Clinton, the president can appeal
the decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in an interview broadcast on Monday night that he
would vigorously defend himself, but that he would not participate
in disbarment proceedings in Arkansas. The president said he had
promised the American people after the impeachment trial ended that
he would not ``personally involve'' himself in such matters until
he left office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right,'' he said in an interview with NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I agreed even to appeal it is that my lawyers
looked at all the precedents and they said there's no way in the
world, if they just treat you like everybody else has been treated,
that this is even close to that kind of case,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the precedents contradict this decision and ultimately the
decision has to be made by a judge,'' he said. ``And so we're going
to give the judge a chance to do what we believe is right, and I
think that's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued earlier this month that his 20 years of public
service should persuade the panel to be lenient and not recommend
any sanction harsher than a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted again that he did not technically lie before a
federal judge in the Jones case. The president maintained that his
answers under oath denying a sexual relationship with Lewinsky were
technically accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton was the first president to be held in
contempt of court by a federal judge. The president could avoid the
disbarment proceedings if he voluntarily surrendered his Arkansas
law license, but his private lawyer, David E. Kendall, rejected
that option on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recommendation is wrong and clearly contradicted by
precedent,'' Kendall said. ``We will vigorously dispute it in a
court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision on Monday moves Clinton, who is only
licensed to practice law in Arkansas, one step closer to becoming
the first president to be disbarred while in office. Richard M.
Nixon was disbarred in July 1976 by the Appellate Division of the
New York state Supreme Court on charges of obstruction of justice
connected with the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's recommendation surprised some legal experts, who
said that it seemed harsh when compared to similar disciplinary
cases in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Said Judith Kilpatrick, who teaches professional responsible at
the University of Arkansas Law School, ``I'm rather surprised,
especially because this is a first offense and it did not involve
something like stealing from clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary committee imposes sanctions on as many as 100
lawyers a year. The panel usually recommends disbarment only in
cases where a lawyer has stolen money from a client.
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1998, the State Supreme Court withheld a license
from lawyer who had committed insurance fraud, saying ``there is
simply no place in the law for a man or woman who will not tell the
truth even when his interest is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not practiced law since the early 1980s, between his
first and second terms as governor of Arkansas. And although he has
said he does not intend to practice law upon leaving the White
House in January 2001, the president, a graduate of Yale Law
School, has vigorously defended himself against the state
disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what practical effect a disbarment would have on
Clinton's career after he leaves the White House. Friends of the
president have said they expected him to teach, write books and
work on public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman declined to comment, referring all
questions to Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   The disbarment committee has 14 members. Six panelists of the
committee heard the president's case on Friday. Five are lawyers
and the sixth is a retired schoolteacher. Eight of the committee's
panelists had recused themselves, most of them citing potential
conflicts of interest because said they had business or personal
relationships with the president.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Monday to the Arkansas Supreme Court's clerk,
James A. Neal, the executive director of the disciplinary panel,
wrote that disbarment proceedings should begin ``against attorney
William Jefferson Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the six members who voted had concluded ``that
certain of the attorney's conduct as demonstrated in the complaints
constituted serious misconduct in violation'' of two rules of the
Arkansas Model Rules of Professional Conduct, wrote Neal, whose
retirement from the panel was also announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee on Friday considered two complaints against the
president, one filed by the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a
conservative organization in Atlanta, and another by Judge Susan
Webber Wright, the federal judge who presided over the case in
which Jones accused Clinton of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   During a January 1998 deposition in that case, Clinton testified
that he had not engaged in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky. The
president argued that he told the truth during the Jones
deposition, but Wright disagreed. On April 12, 1999, Judge Wright
held the president in contempt of court, fined him $90,000 and
referred the matter to the Arkansas bar committee for possible
disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Wright did not suggest a specific penalty. But the Southeastern
Legal Foundation had sought Clinton's disbarment.

UNION WELCOMES GORE, DESPITE CHINA VIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore voiced perfunctory support
Monday for the China trade agreement, reading a statement in front
of a labor group that opposes the China bill and is rallying in
Washington against it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance before about 175 members of the United Food
and Commercial Workers was preceded by a videotape of his
acceptance speech last fall after winning the endorsement of the
AFL-CIO. He began his speech Monday by mentioning a few of the
issues on which they agreed, like raising the minimum wage,
instituting new standards for workplace safety and passing a
patient's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``On all these issues and on many many more, some of which I'm
going to discuss here today, we agree,'' Gore said. ``But in
candor, I do have to begin here by saying something about an issue
where we differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that one of your legislative priorities is to urge
members of Congress not to support permanent normal trade relations
with China,'' he went on, referring to the vote scheduled for
Wednesday. ``I respect your view. You know that I do not share that
view. I strongly support normal trade relations with China because
I believe it is right for America's economy and right for the cause
of reform in China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After another sentence or two, he eased back into the many
points of agreement between himself and labor, and the audience
appeared to be as forgiving of his pro-China position as they were
relieved that he did not make much of an issue of it. Still, the
food workers union, which represents numerous service workers, has
less at stake in the trade issue than the industrial unions have.
</P>
<P>
   The workers gave him a standing ovation when he pledged to ban
the use of permanent striker replacements and applauded him at
several other points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not naive,'' David Mertz, 32, a political worker for the
Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is affiliated
with the food workers, said after the speech. ``But on the vast
majority of issues, we'll stand with him and he'll stand with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor's endorsement of Gore and opposition to the China bill has
tied one hand behind Gore's back as he has stood with the Clinton
administration on urging passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the degree to which he has pressed for passage is
unclear. He did attend and speak at a White House pep rally on the
bill recently, but his comments were overshadowed by those of
former presidents and other notables. He has said that he has
personally lobbied some members of Congress, but he would not name
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have been quick to say Gore's support has been
tepid, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival, has
suggested that he has been more enthusiastic about the matter than
has Clinton's own vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, Al Gore has only paid lip service to his position'' on
permanent normal trade relations for China, Mindy Tucker, a
spokesman for Bush, said in a statement Monday. ``He may offer
tepid support for China PNTR in a room full of former secretaries
of state and ambassadors, but before union audiences, his support
disappears.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like George Becker, president of the United
Steelworkers of America, have said that Gore has been lobbying hard
for the measure and would suffer for that in November because labor
would not work hard for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be forgiving on this,'' Becker said
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest unions in the labor federation _ the
Teamsters and the United Auto Workers _ withheld their endorsements
of the vice president because of the China deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began his day with breakfast with Thabo Mbeki, president of
South Africa, and concluded his evening by attending a state dinner
at the White House for him.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore aides were circumspect about their discussions. Gore
has come under continuing protest from AIDS activists _ as recently
as last week _ for administration policy that had the effect of
blocking cheaper anti-AIDS drugs to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman said Monday only that Gore and Mbeki discussed
the matter of AIDS in Africa. An administration official said that
Mbeki discussed the matter with President Clinton but was uncertain
of Gore's involvement.

SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON TOUGHER AIR POLLUTION STANDARDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: Has trims) 
 
By BILL DAWSON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Monday to rule on
whether tougher national standards can take effect to reduce air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration adopted the new standards in 1997 for
ozone, smog's chief ingredient, and tiny airborne particles, often
called soot.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to a legal challenge from industry groups led by
the American Trucking Associations, a federal appeals court in the
District of Columbia last year halted implementation of the new
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the issue represents one of the hottest
environmental debates in recent years, and the news that the
Supreme Court would be its final arbiter immediately renewed
competing claims. Health advocates said the standards are needed to
protect the public, but businesses said they would damage the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the justices decide, their ruling won't affect
Houston's obligation to bring ozone levels below an older, less
stringent standard by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Older standards for ozone and airborne particles remain in
force.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has violated the old ozone standard for many years,
ranking last year as the city with the worst ozone record in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decreed that cities
like Houston, which violate the older smog standard, must comply
with its limit before moving toward complying with the new
standard.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association said the new pollution standards
``are essential to protecting the health of millions of Americans,
especially children, the elderly and those with lung and heart
disease, from exposure to unhealthy air pollution levels.''
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a leading critic of the
stricter standards, said letting them go into effect would ``be a
crushing federal mandate on U.S. businesses, with no scientifically
proven benefit to human health.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides deciding how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
regulates air pollution, the justices could set a far-reaching
precedent that determines the limits of many federal agencies'
administrative authority.
</P>
<P>
   Federal attorneys said the appeals court's ruling had ``opened
to potential constitutional attack ... numerous other federal
statutes containing similarly broad grants of authority to
administrative agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   By a 2-1 vote, a three-judge panel said the EPA's interpretation
of one section of the federal Clean Air Act involved ``an
unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.''
</P>
<P>
   The two judges called for the EPA to develop a
``constitutional'' interpretation of the act _ perhaps by modifying
the disputed ozone and particle standards. The Clinton
administration appealed the ruling, setting the stage for Monday's
Supreme Court action.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said it adopted the new standards on the basis of
scientific evidence, gathered in recent years, which indicated the
stricter limits are needed to protect public health.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone, a respiratory irritant, forms during reactions of other
air pollutants, from cars, industrial plants and many other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The extremely tiny particles covered by the new soot standard _
smaller than those regulated under the older standard _ come from
combustion and other sources.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even with the new standards on hold, Texas officials are getting
ready for their possible implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
held meetings in Houston and five other metropolitan areas to
solicit public comments on how it should go about designating
violation areas under the tougher ozone standard.

SECRETARY-GENERAL LAYS OUT CONDITIONS FOR PEACEKEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ISRAEL-LEBANON) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended to the
Security Council on Monday that the United Nations not increase the
size of its peacekeeping force in Lebanon until Israel withdraws
and Lebanon guarantees the safety of the U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Only then would the United Nations consider increasing its force
to nearly 8,000 from the current 4,500 troops, according to a plan
Annan sent to the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want us to be a punching bag in the middle with everybody
taking pot shots at us?'' Annan said to reporters after a Security
Council meeting Monday when he was questioned about the measured
recommendations in his report. ``Everybody would then blame the
U.N. for everything we are not responsible for,'' he said,
apparently stung by a spate of recent criticism about the
performance of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   As an interim measure, Annan recommended that the United
Nations, which has stationed peacekeepers in southern Lebanon since
1978, should augment the force only slightly _ to 5,600 troops _
strictly for the purposes of verifying the Israeli pullback and the
disarming of the Israel's Lebanese allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the responsibility of the government of Israel to ensure
that the de facto force, known as the South Lebanon Army, cease to
exist,'' the secretary-general's report says, calling the SLA
``part of Israel's presence in Lebanon.'' The United Nations will
not be involved in disarming it.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.N. plans, the secretary-general's envoy to the
region, Terje Roed Larsen, will return to the Mideast on Tuesday
after having met with U.N. officials and the Security Council on
Monday. Before verification flights can be made over the
Israeli-Lebanese border, he will have to get the approval of
Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Only then can cartographers flying along the frontiers try to
demarcate the boundaries of Israel, Lebanon and Syria, but only in
order to monitor them. Troops for the larger monitoring and
peacekeeping force are not likely to be recruited until the Israeli
withdrawal is complete.

   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush on Monday accused the Clinton
administration of taking sides in last year's Israeli election and
of trying to make Israel conform to American ``plans and
timetables'' for peace. The governor said his own support for
Israel was ``not conditional on the outcome of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush leveled his criticisms in a speech on the Middle East at
the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group. His appearance was part of
a sustained effort in recent days to address what many consider to
be his chief vulnerability as a presidential candidate: his command
of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was repeatedly interrupted by applause, said little on
the Middle East that he had not said before. Once again, he pledged
that as president he would ``begin the process of moving the U.S.
ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital,'' a
reference to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   His most pointed remarks concerned the administration's role in
Middle East peace talks over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent times Washington has tried to make Israel conform to
its own plans and timetables,'' he said, drawing applause, ``but
this is not the path to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A clear and bad example,'' he said, ``was the administration's
attempt to take sides in the most recent Israeli election. America
should not interfere in Israel's democratic process, and America
will not interfere in Israeli elections when I'm the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not elaborate. Aides said his comments about a
timetable referred to the nine days and nights of tortuous Wye
River negotiations on Maryland's Eastern Shore, which committed the
Israelis and Palestinians to actions they had promised in previous
agreements. The talks restored momentum to the peace process,
setting a detailed timetable for Israel's withdrawal from part of
the West Bank in three phases.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Republicans praised the agreement, others said
Israel was being unduly pressured.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the accusation of playing favorites in the
election, Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, called it
``irresponsible to make such reckless comments concerning such a
sensitive part of the world'' and said ``it really does raise a
question of his readiness to be a leader in international
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said, ``Al Gore's leadership credentials on facilitating
the Middle East peace process are impeccable, while Bush is
suffering from an antiquated analysis reminiscent of the Republican
approach of the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration maintained studied public
neutrality in last year's Israeli elections, it made little effort
to conceal its desire for Ehud Barak's victory over then-Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. James Carville, President Clinton's
former political adviser, served in a similar role for Barak. In
1996, Clinton all but openly endorsed Shimon Peres, the Labor Party
candidate, over Netanyahu because of the difference in the
candidates' views of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In appearances before Jewish groups, presidential candidates
frequently promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem
from Tel Aviv. The status of Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its
capital, is a central issue in ``final status'' peace negotiations
between Israelis and Palestinians, and the administration says
moving the embassy would pre-empt the delicate negotiations and
destroy Washington's ability to act as an honest broker in peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   In his failed presidential bid in 1988, Gore said he would
consider moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, but his aides now
say he sees the issue as something that should be worked out in
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was supposed to attend the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee conference Monday and meet with both Bush and Gore. But
over the weekend he canceled his visit to the United States because
of violence in the West Bank and South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``deeply disturbed'' by the reports of the
Palestinian police opening fire on Israeli soldiers last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly no way to make peace a reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that Iran's leaders should be put on notice that
``America will judge them'' by the treatment of 13 Jews imprisoned
in Iran on charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a year ago, Bush came under criticism for
silence on the West's air war in Kosovo. And more than a few
critics have questioned how capable he would be, as president, on
foreign policy issues. In the Republican primaries, his main
opponent, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, repeatedly said that he
himself would not need ``on-the-job training,'' a way of belittling
Bush's credentials to be commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has openly acknowledged that he is studying international
issues, telling reporters that he is reading ``Lenin's Tomb,'' a
book about the Soviet Union by David Remnick, and ``Balkan
Ghosts,'' an account of turmoil in the Balkans by Robert D. Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Bush has been raising his profile on
international affairs. Last week he took positions on pending
congressional disputes on financing for Kosovo peace-keeping and on
trade with China. He plans to speak further on national security at
a Washington news conference on Tuesday and to meet with the South
African president, Thabo Mbeki, in Austin, Texas, later this week.

   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush on Monday accused the Clinton

CLIPPERS SCRATCH TODD OFF WISH LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers moved a baby step closer to choosing
next season's head coach by officially crossing one name off the
list.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, interim coach Jim Todd, who directed a 4-33 finish
after Chris Ford was fired Feb. 3, was scratched as a candidate to
coach the team on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   The move is not expected to rock the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, the Clippers' vice president of basketball
operations, said Todd _ whose contract expires at the end of June _
could be retained as an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Todd was at his Staples Center office when the announcement was
made, but couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would like to be here, or somewhere, as an assistant next
season,'' Baylor said. ``Of course, a position on the staff would
be based on the wishes of the new head coach.'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers hope to finally cross (ital) that (endital) bridge
before the June 28 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking to various people about the head-coaching
vacancy,'' Baylor said. ``I'm not going to get into who is and who
isn't a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he did confirm there have been discussions with
grapevine favorite Mike Fratello. Fratello coached the Atlanta
Hawks for eight seasons before a six-year run with the Cleveland
Cavaliers ended last year. He currently pays the rent by working as
an NBA game analyst for TNT and a talking studio head for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers assistant coach Dennis Johnson also has had talks with
Baylor and team executive vice president Andy Roeser about the
head-coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he's a candidate,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   As for on-court personnel adjustments, the Clippers' predraft
screening continues today when UCLA freshman Jason Kapono and Duke
senior Chris Carrawell arrive for workouts at USC's Lyon Center.
</P>
<P>
   Other prospects expected in this week include Bruins sophomore
power forward Jerome Moiso, Kentucky center Jamal Magloire and
gifted shooting guard Jimmie ``Snap'' Hunter, who led Life College
in Georgia to the NAIA championship after transferring from
University of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   This week's visitors will be considered for the Clippers' second
and third picks (18 and 30, respectively) in the draft. Sunday,

 FED TRYING TO COOL HOT STOCKS  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chroncile 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the six occasions that the Federal Reserve
has raised interest rates since last June, the official explanation
has always been essentially the same: The fast-growing economy has
to be cooled down or inflation will make a deadly comeback.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers say the principal target of the rate rises is
the stock market _ that the Fed is trying to gradually drain
speculative excess out of the market to prevent a potentially
disastrous crash.
</P>
<P>
   Although price inflation has remained persistently mild at both
the retail and wholesale levels, most economists and other Fed
watchers accept the official Fed explanation at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Reaser, chief economist and senior market strategist with
the Bank of America Asset Management Group in St. Louis, notes that
unemployment has declined below 4 percent for the first time in 30
years, raising the potential for wage-driven inflation.
</P>
<P>
   She also points out that the gross domestic product lately has
been growing at a souped-up 5 percent annual rate, whereas 3
percent would be normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve is trying to achieve a balance in the
economy, so we are growing only as rapidly as we are capable of
doing,'' Reaser says. ``It is trying to rein in the growth of
spending to match our ability to produce goods and services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells
Capital Management in San Francisco, says: ``There are indications
that inflation is beginning to turn in the wrong direction,
although not dramatically. The hike in rates is designed to deal
with broadly based signs of inflation pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But a minority of Fed watchers say the current series of rate
increases _ amounting to a cumulative gain of 1.75 percentage
points _ primarily reflects worries about the no-holds-barred,
casino-style speculation that has lately characterized the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as December 1996, when the Dow Jones industrial
average was at little more than half its present level, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed concern about
``irrational exuberance'' in the market.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed wants to tame the bull market, its control of
interest rates is an effective tool. Rising rates hurt stocks,
because they crimp corporate profits and make fixed-income
investments relatively more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   But why should the Fed care whether stocks are up, down or
sideways?
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan himself has pointed to the so-called ``wealth effect''
of a booming stock market. People who have been enriched by paper
gains in their stock holdings are prompted to spend lavishly on
houses, luxury goods and everything else _ contributing to
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart J. Pillette of Pillette Investment Management in San
Francisco, thinks this is a dodge.
</P>
<P>
   He says that the Fed is overemphasizing a scant inflation threat
as a ``convenient excuse'' and that it doesn't state the real
reason because that might provoke a public uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Pillette figures the Fed is afraid that there is real danger of
a calamitous stock-market crash that could ``very well lead to a
severe recession.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains that ``speculation in the Internet stocks, which
started more than a year ago, was growing rampant. It was spreading
from Internet stocks to most technology stocks. If left
unchallenged, it could very well have led to a 1929-style blow
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than allow a crash, the Fed chose to parade out a series
of small rate increases designed to slowly ``take the helium out of
the balloon,'' Pillette observes.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the first five rate increases was held to a minimal 0.25
percentage points. The most recent, on Wednesday, was pegged at 0.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's balloon-pricking strategy _ if, indeed, that is its
strategy _ finally appears to be succeeding. The half-point rate
increase in particular has spread heavy gloom among investors,
driving down all the leading market averages.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 3.6 percent since
Wednesday and 4 percent since the first rate increase was announced
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The broader-based Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is down 4.5
percent from Wednesday. It has risen 2 percent since June 30, but
that is a far cry from the 20-plus and 30-plus annual percentage
gains it enjoyed through the latter half of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index _ home to most of the leading
technology stocks _ continues to fly, although not nearly as high
as it did. It peaked on March 10 _ between Fed rate hikes No. 4 and
No. 5 _ and has since lost 33 percent of its value. It is down 9.5
percent since Wednesday, but it still boasts a 25 percent gain
since June 30.

 MONEYBAG: WALL STREET'S DIM VIEW OF KMART  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How is it possible that Kmart Corp., with $36 billion in
annual revenues, has a market capitalization of less than $4
billion? Does this really represent all the outstanding shares, or
are there a lot of other shares held by company insiders?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: I can understand why you consider Kmart's market cap
surprisingly low. Nowadays, it's easy to find technology companies
with market caps of $4 billion or more and revenues of only a few
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the sub-$4 billion market cap for Kmart is, in fact, correct
_ it includes all the outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   There are several forces at work here.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often have low profit margins _ meaning profits as a
percentage of revenues. If you have looked at Kmart's financial
statistics, perhaps you noticed that the company had net income of
$403 million last year, which amounts to only a bit more than 1
percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kmart has a relatively low price-to-earnings ratio.
Its stock is selling for only about nine times last year's
earnings, which is less than half what investors are paying these
days for the average stock.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the main reason for the low price/earnings ratio is
that Kmart has reported disappointing earnings recently. Its
earnings in the first quarter of the current fiscal year were down
more than 50 percent from the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has lost half its value in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Lot of Taxes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: In 1977, I purchased a home and four lots in the Bay Area. My
house is situated on two of the lots, and I am in the process of
selling one of the vacant lots. Since the cost of each lot was not
separately identified when I purchased the property, how do I
figure, for tax purposes, the cost basis of the lot that is being
sold?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller suggests that
you search your records for a copy of the first property-tax bill
you received after buying the properties. It will show separate
assessed values for the land and your home.
</P>
<P>
   Take the ratio of the land value indicated on that bill to the
total value of the properties, and that will enable you to
calculate the assessed value, at that time, of each lot. If the
assessed value of the lot you are selling was, say, 15 percent of
the total assessed value of all the properties combined, then use
15 percent of your total purchase price as the cost basis.
</P>
<P>
   However, it may be that you no longer have a copy of that old
bill. In that case, call or visit the assessor's office in your
county, and see if they have the information in their archives.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, then Weller says you should use the oldest
bill you can find, either among your records or at the assessor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Faulty Stock Logic
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: 3Com Corp. stock recently was quoted at around $43 per share,
while the stock of Palm Inc. was around $25. 3Com owns most of
Palm, and its shareholders are slated to receive 1.5 Palm shares _
or $37.50 worth _ for each 3Com share they hold sometime in the
next few months. Doesn't that make 3Com a really good buy? For $43
you are getting $80.50 worth of stock.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: 3Com may indeed be a good buy, with or without the distribution
of Palm shares. But your logic is faulty. Once the Palm shares are
distributed, that action will be reflected in the value of 3Com's
shares, which almost certainly will drop in value.
</P>
<P>
   The question seems to be: Will they drop as low as $5.50 per
share _ the difference between 3Com's current $43 price and the
value of the promised Palm distribution, which has a current market
value of $37.50?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they will, maybe they won't. Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   But even if 3Com's price doesn't fall that sharply, you also
must reckon with the very real possibility that Palm's own price
will plummet.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly is precedent for that. On their first day of
trading in March, the company's shares changed hands for as much as
$165. They have been falling, with few interruptions, ever since.

 INVESTORS SNATCH UP REELING TECH STOCKS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a stunning rebound, the Nasdaq composite
index staged a late rally Monday to gain back nearly all its losses
after earlier plunging more than 200 points, or 6 percent, to a new
low for the year.
</P>
<P>
   By the closing bell, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 26.19 points
at 3,364.21 _ way off its intraday basement of 3,172.65 but still
nearly 34 percent below its March 10 high.
</P>
<P>
   The spurt of last-minute buying kept the Nasdaq above its April
14 low for 2000 of 3,321.29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre,'' said Richard Del Monte, who heads the Del
Monte Group investment firm in Danville, Calif. ``The market just
doesn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 84.30 points to 10,542.55,
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dropped 6.23 to 1,400.72.
</P>
<P>
   When Monday's sell-off was at its fiercest, many analysts were
all but kissing off technology stocks and were predicting that the
Nasdaq wouldn't touch bottom until tumbling as low as 2,900.
</P>
<P>
   But bargain hunters found the lows too tempting to resist and
waded in with buy orders for many of the same big-name tech stocks
that just hours before had been dismissed as too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other market watchers, Todd Gold, technical strategist
at Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York, was left scratching his head over the
Nasdaq's renewed lease on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we have such a significant rally in such a short
time?'' he asked. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the rally looked strong enough that investors
might be able to expect several days of advances before the market
again turns sour.
</P>
<P>
   While Gold expects the Nasdaq to return by year's end to the
lofty 5,000 level briefly touched in March, he believes the index
still will lose ground before recovering in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Gold handed much of the credit for Monday's rally to Cisco
Systems staying above the $50 level. Analysts had viewed this as a
key measure of the strength of one of the market's tech bellwethers
_ and were not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   After touching a low of $50, Cisco bounced back handily to close
$1.81 higher at $55.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly encouraging to see Cisco make this kind of
rebound,'' Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts predict that the market will remain volatile for
weeks to come as investors weigh the prospect for further interest
rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed boosted short-term rates by a half-percentage-point last
week in the latest effort to keep inflation at bay amid continued
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   A further quarter-point increase is expected when the Fed's
policy-making committee meets on June 28. Beyond that, it's
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real water-torture type of market,'' said Eugene
Peroni, research director at John Nuveen &AMP; Co. in Radner, Pa. ``You
get a rally followed by another sell-off.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees a Nasdaq low of 2,700 before the index makes a
convincing return to higher levels. ``Ultimately, though, techs
will continue to carry the day,'' Peroni said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Adams, managing director of First Security Van Kasper in
San Francisco, said he is advising clients to stand pat for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a time to sell,'' he said. ``But it's still too early
to commit your money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq is now near the same level as at the beginning of
last December.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. fell 88 cents to $64.19 after filing a brief
with the U.S. Justice Department elaborating on why it doesn't
think the company should be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   Other leading tech shares were mixed. Intel Corp. gained 50
cents to $118.38, while Sun Microsystems rose $2.63 to $79.88, and
Oracle Corp. slid $2.25 to $67.81.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gurkink, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle,
thinks investors could do worse than to snap up companies like
these now that they've come down so steeply in price.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want long-term earnings,'' he said, ``technology's
still where it's at.''

SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW ON TV SEX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday struck down as
unconstitutional a federal law designed to prevent children from
seeing sexually explicit images on cable, saying the statute
amounted to a ban on the free speech of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling allows cable operators to continue to send scrambled
signals from stations to non-subscribers. Parents who want to
prevent these signals, also known as ``signal bleed,'' can tell
their local cable operators to block the transmission. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In its 5-4 decision, the court said Congress went too far in
the 1996 Telecommunications Act and violated the constitutional
rights of cable operators by limiting how and when they could air
scrambled images on sexually graphic stations.
</P>
<P>
   The legal restrictions, though designed to protect children,
illegally prevented constitutionally protected images from being
transmitted to many adults, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The court indicated that government has less constitutional
authority to protect children from what is aired on cable than what
is broadcast on free television stations. The justices, who have
upheld foul-language restrictions on broadcast networks, were
unwilling to give lawmakers as much latitude on regulating sex on
cable largely because parents with a phone call to the system
operator can block programing on cable but not on free television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking enables the government to support parental authority
without affecting the First Amendment interests of speakers and
willing listeners _ listeners for whom, if the speech is unpopular
or indecent, the privacy of their own homes may be the optimal
place of receipt,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in the court's
majority opinion. ``Simply put, targeted blocking is less
restrictive than banning, and the government cannot ban speech if
targeted blocking is a feasible and effective means of furthering
its compelling interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, fearing that curious and impressionable youngsters
could watch sexually graphic _ though blurry _ scrambled images,
required programmers in 1996 to either block the pictures out
completely or show them only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., times when
children were unlikely to be watching.
</P>
<P>
   About 62 million U.S. households receive cable television, the
federal government reported. The Playboy channel is in 20 million
U.S. and Canadian homes, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Entertainment Group Inc., a media conglomerate that
provides sexually explicit cable programming and has scrambled its
images to non-subscribers, said the federal restriction in the
telecommunications law violated the company's First Amendment right
of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, in ruling for Playboy, said sexually explicit
cable images might harm children and offend most Americans but are
nevertheless constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution exists precisely so that opinions and
judgments, including esthetic and moral judgments about art and
literature, can be formed, tested and expressed,'' Kennedy wrote.
``What the Constitution says is that these judgments are for the
individual to make, not for the government to decree, even with the
mandate or approval of a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees
television, urged parents to be more diligent with regard to what
their children are watching on cable following the high court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should remember that current law specifically provides
that cable customers can contact their local cable companies and
request that channels they find objectionable be blocked from their
homes at no cost,'' FCC Chairman William Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Enterprises, which also successfully challenged the law
in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., has continued to
have scrambled messages on many cable systems, said company
spokesman Bill Farley. He said the scrambled image is not
intentional but rather a technological glitch between Playboy and
local cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chairman, Christie Hefner, hailed the court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it (the law) was an intrusion on individual choice by
the federal government,'' Hefner said. ``Our position has been
vindicated by today's ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the court expressed support for Congress'
effort to protect children from pornography. The justices said
lawmakers could still legitimately limit children's access to
sexually explicit images as long as the restrictions don't encroach
on the rights of adults to have access to the programing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the court said, Congress can _ and does _ impose a
valid restriction on operators by requiring them to block access to
their channels at the request of parents and other subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Kennedy's opinion in United States vs. Playboy
Entertainment Group were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer assailed the
court for failing to recognize what he called Congress' legitimate
method for achieving the compelling governmental interest of
protecting youngsters from sexually graphic images.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said the court's ruling ``threatens to leave Congress
without power to help the millions of parents who do not want to
expose their children to commercial pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   He derided as ineffective the requirement that operators tell
parents they can have the channels totally blocked. The
overwhelming majority of parents don't read the message from the
cable operators, which is usually contained with the monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Breyer's dissent were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.

 PRIVACY PROPOSAL RANKLES INTERNET INDUSTRY  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet industry groups lashed out Monday at
the Federal Trade Commission's recommendation that Congress make
laws establishing basic online privacy standards.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's recommendation to create the first law to govern
Internet privacy is a departure from the commission's past stance
that the industry could enforce its own privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem may be bigger than industry self-regulation itself
can deal with,'' Commissioner Mozelle Thompson said. He was quick
to point out that self-regulation initiatives such as the Truste
and BBBOnline privacy seal programs would still be an important
part of online privacy under the recommendation. The proposal,
released Monday, was approved Friday in a 3-to-2 vote by
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's report, which it will present to the Senate Commerce
Committee on Thursday, calls for a law requiring Web sites to give
Internet users a choice in what information is collected about
them, and let users have access to that information. Sites would
also have to keep data about consumers secure and post clear
privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's change in direction was prompted by a survey it
conducted earlier this year showing that only 40 percent of Web
sites abide by the basic practices of choice, access, security and
notice that the law would require.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has also investigated possible privacy violations by a
growing number of Web sites, including online advertising firm
DoubleClick and portal Yahoo. So far, the commission has not
concluded that either of those sites actually committed any privacy
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Two industry groups, the Information Technology Association of
America and the Online Privacy Alliance, called the legislation
unnecessary, and said the Internet industry is already doing a good
job protecting consumers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy policies are now ubiquitous online,'' said OPA adviser
Christine Varney, a former FTC commissioner. ``These policies
empower consumers to make informed choices about what personal
information to share.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's study did find that 100 percent of the Web's
most-popular sites post privacy policies. However, the FTC's
Thompson, who voted in favor of the recommendation, said that just
posting a policy does not mean that sites are adequately
safeguarding consumers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some real issues about the quality of what
they're providing in terms of privacy policies,'' Thompson said,
pointing out that many Web sites' policies do not address all
aspects of consumer privacy. And some sites do not abide by their
own policies, Thompson added.
</P>
<P>
   Among local Internet companies, opinions about the
recommendation were split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that self-regulation is the best way to go,'' said
Yahoo President Jeff Mallet. Co-founder Jerry Yang pointed out that
enforcing a privacy law would be difficult given the different ways
the Internet is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my financial data treated very differently from my
e-mail and my health records,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Netcentives, a San Francisco company that helps Web sites reward
their users with frequent-flier miles and other incentives, called
the FTC's decision reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a gap between the (privacy) notices companies
post and their behavior,'' said David McKay, vice president of
marketing at Netcentives subsidiary Post Communications.
</P>
<P>
   David Steer, a spokesman for the Truste privacy seal program,
praised the FTC's move, calling it an ``endorsement'' of Truste and
the concept of privacy seals. Web sites that belong to Truste will
likely be compliant with any laws Congress comes out with, Steer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet privacy advocates, who have long called for the
government to protect Internet users' privacy, had restrained
praise for the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy I Center, said the
proposal should have been more detailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're asking congress to provide what we would consider the
bare minimum of protection,'' Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the recommendation should have laid out what
compensation Internet users would get if their privacy rights are
violated, Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Thompson said the recommendation was purposely kept
vague because of the fast-changing nature of Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake for a legislative vehicle in this area to be
too detailed _ by its very nature it would become outdated,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican leaders believe regulation would be premature in
the young world of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quickest way to kill the Internet is to regulate it to
death,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. W.J. ``Billy''
Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee on trade
and consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of Democrats, led by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said yesterday
that they will introduce comprehensive privacy legislation to keep
companies from profiting from the sale of personal data gleaned
from unwitting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such legislation could get traction in Congress this
year appears doubtful. Lawmakers already have a full plate of
technology-related legislation awaiting action.

 NAPSTER NAMES CEO, SECURES NEW FINANCING  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster Inc. appointed a new chief executive and
received key financial backing Monday even as a political think
tank recommended tighter copyright laws to combat illegal swapping
of online music.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo, Calif., startup plans to expand its workforce and
office space now that it has closed a $15 million round of venture
funding led by noted San Francisco investment firm Hummer Winblad
Venture Partners, along with money from Angel Investors LP.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad partner Hank Barry, a onetime legal counsel for
major media companies like Disney Online and A&AMP;M Records, will
become Napster's interim CEO. He replaces Eileen Richardson, a
Boston area investor who became Napster's interim CEO when the
company started nine months ago. She only intended to stay long
enough to find a permanent boss.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barry, a former partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati
in Palo Alto, Calif., and Hummer Winblad partner John Hummer also
joined Napster's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Barry was unavailable for immediate comment. But in a news
release, he cited a poll released last week that showed more than
70 percent of college students already use Napster, and nearly 20
percent use it daily, even though the company has yet to release a
final version of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``With over 10 million registered users within its first nine
months, Napster's file-sharing application has become the most
rapidly adopted technology in the history of the Internet,'' Barry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's software allows music fans to easily share their MP3
music files through the Internet. According to online and software
ratings firm Media Metrix Inc., Napster was ``virtually
nonexistent'' in February, but by March had 2.5 million unique
users.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and
new artists, but the recording industry and two artists, Metallica
and Dr. Dre, sued Napster, claiming the program is nothing but a
tool for music piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Napster blocked more than 300,000 users
identified by Metallica as people who were offering illegal copies
of the heavy metal band's songs. More than 30,000 have applied for
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Metallica quietly delivered a new list of 332,293
Napster members that the band wants blocked. Napster spokesman Dan
Wool said the company has not made a decision on blocking members
on the newest Metallica hit list or another list from Dr. Dre
naming 239,612 Napster members.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster debate has also entered the political arena. The
moderate Democratic party think tank Progressive Policy Institute
issued a report Monday calling for Congress to tighten the federal
Digital Millennium Copyright Act to hold Napster and similar
technology companies more accountable for copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Napster is an innovative technology, but we should
use that technology in legal ways,'' said Robert Atkinson,
co-author of the report ``Napster and Online Piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that Congress change the DMCA to require
Internet-based services like Napster to obtain ``identifiable and
verifiable'' information about their users to help track down
copyright violators. Napster members can sign on anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the DMCA needs to have more specific
timetables for taking down copyright violators because it now gives
Napster and similar services ``no incentive to act in a timely
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that judges be allowed more flexibility to
grant injunctions. ``It may be impossible to write a law that
accounts for all future technological innovation, but a judge will
know a pirate's den when he or she sees it,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute will present the paper at a House Small-Business
Committee hearing scheduled for tomorrow to examine Internet music
technologies, but Atkinson admitted he does not expect Congress to
act anytime in the next several months.

HOUSE CONSIDERS BANNING INS USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Using secret evidence to send someone to jail may
be unconstitutional, except in immigration courts, where foreigners
or immigrants have been imprisoned for years on the basis of
classified hearsay, federal judges have found.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congress is considering a bill that could alter or abolish
the practice. The bill would restrict the use of evidence kept
secret from a defendant and his lawyers. Nearly 100 sponsors in the
House have backed the measure, the subject of a hearing scheduled
before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Secret evidence has been used to jail about 100 foreigners and
resident aliens in the last decade, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service says. The detainees are held on the basis of
evidence introduced by the government, evidence the accused cannot
see or challenge at immigration hearings. Court records show that
such evidence has included rumor and innuendo such as the
unsubstantiated accusations of an ex-wife or a former lover, or
hearsay from foreign intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
   One case involved Hany Kiareldeen, a Palestinian man married to
an American woman. He was freed from a New Jersey jail last year,
after a federal district judge ruled that ``the government's use of
secret evidence violates the due process'' that the Constitution
guarantees, even to resident aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The secret evidence accusing Kiareldeen of links to terrorists,
largely compiled and classified by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, was partly revealed on appeal and proved untrue. A
primary source of the accusations was Kiareldeen's ex-wife, who was
fighting him in a child custody battle, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional testimony suggests that a case based on secret
evidence occurs about once a month. The numbers are hard to
confirm, in part because of poor record-keeping by the immigration
courts, which often make no formal record of hearings, and in part
because of the secrecy surrounding the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The INS says 11 people are now being detained in the United
States because of secret evidence. Opponents of the process say the
number is higher.
</P>
<P>
   One of those detained is Mazen al-Naijar, a professor at the
University of South Florida. A Palestinian, he has been in jail for
three years. Neither he nor his lawyers have ever seen the evidence
against him, which has been used to accuse him of associating with
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Ali Yasin Mohammed Karim, an Iraqi Kurd who worked
with the Central Intelligence Agency against Saddam Hussein. He was
evacuated to California after one of the CIA's covert operations
collapsed in 1996 _ and then was arrested. He has been jailed for
nearly four years because of secret evidence against him, provided
by the CIA and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   That evidence was ``hearsay'' and ``nonsense,'' said R. James
Woolsey Jr., a former director of central intelligence, who
volunteered to defend Karim and had the security clearances needed
to see the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the evidence has been declassified, largely through
Woolsey's work, the judge has indicated she may release Karim this
week.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor who will
testify on Tuesday in favor of the bill, said ``secret evidence is
something we associate with totalitarian regimes, not with free
democratic nations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best test for truth is an adversarial process in which
both sides get tested by cross-examination,'' he said. ``Secret
evidence makes that impossible. We've seen innocent people locked
up for years on evidence which, once revealed, would not justify
their being locked up for a day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the last two years, the INS has been considering revising
its rules on the use of secret evidence, at the request of Attorney
General Janet Reno. But an immigration service official said the
agency opposed the proposed limits on secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make us choose either between requesting an agency to
declassify national security information, or going ahead and
letting a benefit be granted to an alien who is a danger to
national security,'' the immigration official said.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Martin, a former general counsel for the immigration
service, said that secret evidence should be used sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an argument for maintaining the use of secret
evidence in some cases,'' Martin said, citing, for example, a case
of a suspected terrorist entering the country illegally. But, he
added, ``whenever it's used, it makes for bad procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose a lot of protections you count on'' under the
Constitution, he said. ``If you don't know the evidence you're
confronting, you're not in a good position to defend against it.''

KNICKS AND PACERS IN THE CONSPIRACY SERIES  

</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The conspiracy theories were spilling out of the
Miami Heat locker room Sunday evening and seeping into the public
consciousness in places as far away as Indiana. But it does not
matter to Jeff Van Gundy if a fan in the farmland nodded in
agreement when Tim Hardaway accused the officials of cheating the
Heat in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not going to fret any more than usual if a Pacers
zealot in Muncie puts stock in Jamal Mashburn's assertion that the
Knicks had the three referees ``in their pocket'' and that the
big-market fix is in by a league sensitive to nervous ticks in the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   If a perception becomes reality in the wheat belt, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, does worry about any effect
the referee-bashing will have on the three officials who step onto
the floor of Conseco Fieldhouse Tuesday night for Game 1 of the
four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals against Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that by the constant belaboring of such foolish
points, somehow it will have a subconscious effect on both the
league office and the officials, and that it will affect the
upcoming series,'' Van Gundy said Monday during a conference call
nearly 24 hours after the Knicks eliminated the Heat, 83-82, in
Game 7. ``Last year, it went without any repercussions. I don't
know what it'll be like this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Pacers were the ones looking suspiciously at the
officials when their season was ended by the Knicks in the
conference finals. They were devastated when the official Jess
Kersey called Antonio Davis for a foul that resulted in a miracle
4-point play by Larry Johnson to win Game 3 of the series.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in here-we-go-again fashion, they bemoaned a call the
official Joe Crawford missed in a Knicks-Pacers game on April 10;
after the game, Crawford admitted that the crew blew the offensive
goaltending that Patrick Ewing committed to help Johnson's
3-pointer fall with 21.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the Pacers became semisympathizers
with the frustration emanating from Miami's main stars on Sunday:
the Heat players were incredulous over a no-call when Alonzo
Mourning rescued a loose ball turned jump ball in the final minute
and were irate at a mix-up by the referees on whether Latrell
Sprewell stepped out of bounds or called time out with 2.1 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand where Miami was coming from, but Miami had
their shot to win it,'' Reggie Miller said after the Pacers
practiced Monday in Indianapolis. ``If they make a couple of free
throws, we're talking about Miami. But I can see where they are
coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need no mysterious 4-point plays or no tip-ins or
nothing like that. Let the best team play. I've said that from Day
1. Come playoff time, as long as they let the best team win and
play, I'll handle that. If there is some funny business going on we
can't control, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something humorous about all this to Rod Thorn. Merely
the thought, as Van Gundy suggested, that the league would be
influenced by the Heat's pouting or that the National Basketball
Association's brain trust is somehow the Svengali over the outcome
to every game left Thorn, the league's vice president for
operations, chuckling at the absurdity of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the league ever overtly or tacitly suggested that the
referees favor a particular team or player, it would take about 24
hours to be in every newspaper in the country,'' said Thorn, who is
investigating the remarks made by the Heat to see if fines should
be levied. ``That doesn't happen. We couldn't care less who wins or
loses. It's not right to say there is a conspiracy, but that seems
to be the popular thing to do today.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy might believe this. But it was good politics to bring
up the officiating angle with a series coming up against an Indiana
team that went to the free-throw line 113 times during its
four-game regular-season split with the Knicks, while the Knicks
went only 52 times. Van Gundy is well aware that Miller's whipsaw
reactions to contact on the floor often land him at the free-throw
line. Maybe, with that in mind, it was not such a bad idea to wring
his hands over the bluster coming out of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we shoot more free throws, it's a league
conspiracy,'' Van Gundy said. ``When Miami shoots 21 free throws in
the first half of Game 6, that's hard driving to the basket. It's
not my fault they're a jump-shooting team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we were 8-9 with that same officiating group this
year. The year before, with those same three guys we had in Game 7,
we were 10-12. If we had them `in our pocket,' we had them in the
wrong pocket. I just find it unfortunate. I can understand Miami's
disappointment. But certainly, with Mashburn and Hardaway, I really
believe they should be just as disappointed in themselves.''

WHITE HOUSE AND AGENCY SPLIT ON INTERNET PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials Monday threw cold
water on a proposal by the Federal Trade Commission for legislation
to protect consumer privacy on the Internet. But the commission
chairman said failure to put new federal privacy-protection
standards in place would undermine consumer confidence and
significantly retard the development of commerce in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying between the administration and the chairman,
Robert Pitofsky, came as the agency gave its annual report to
Congress on online privacy and sought new authority to impose
privacy rules to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The report, approved by the commission on Friday, advises
Congress to continue to allow the industry to regulate itself but
to allow the commission to establish federal standards and to
intervene when industry organizations are unable to resolve a case.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said such an approach already works well in the
advertising and funeral businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers should not have to forfeit their privacy online in
exchange for the rich benefits of e-commerce,'' Pitofsky said. ``A
well-crafted approach, in fact, will benefit the growth of
e-commerce and provide important protections to consumers.
Legislation is now needed to ensure consumers' online privacy is
adequately protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is seeking to establish standards in four areas:
notification about the use of personal data; consumers' choices
about the use of such information; the right of individuals to
review data about them; and security measures to prevent
unauthorized disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   While legislation has been introduced by Democrats in both the
House and the Senate, there is no expectation that Congress will
act any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups and Republican lawmakers have strongly opposed
the agency's proposal, saying it would amount to a costly and
unwarranted intrusion on a nascent marketplace that has been making
progress on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of
the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection, said the industry had made ``extraordinary
progress'' in carrying out privacy rules. He said his primary
concern was heading off efforts by the states to create rules
piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to proceed cautiously,'' he said. ``Internet companies
understand that they need to protect the privacy of their customers
as a matter of good business practice, and that's why they are
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican lawmakers found themselves in an odd alliance
with officials from the White House and the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were decidedly lukewarm about the
commission's proposal. They said that the government should
continue to rely on the industry to police itself and that the
White House had a deeper interest in promoting privacy laws in
other areas, including health care and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said Monday that if the
industry could show that it was effectively policing itself,
``legislation would not be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not see such progress,'' he said, ``then we may
eventually need to consider whether legislation would provide
companies with the right incentives to have good policies and
participate in an effective self-regulatory program.''
</P>
<P>
   While the administration's view was that the Internet needs more
time to develop, the commission's report, based on the results of a
recent study of Web sites, suggested that the industry had already
made some progress but far from enough.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 88 percent of 335 randomly selected Web
sites had some kind of privacy disclosure, varying from a
perfunctory notice that says ``this is a secure order form'' to
something more detailed.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also found that only 20 percent of Web sites that
collect personal information met the existing government
guidelines. And only 8 percent of the most heavily visited Web
sites displayed a seal of approval from one of the programs
established by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because self-regulatory initiatives to date fall far short of
broad-based implementation of self-regulatory programs, the
commission has concluded that such efforts alone cannot ensure that
the online marketplace as a whole will follow the standards adopted
by industry leaders,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the shortcomings in protecting privacy, the
report concluded that many consumers appear leery about making
purchases on the Internet. The report cited studies estimating that
online companies had already suffered significantly from a common
perception among consumers that they should not buy items online
because the information they provide may be misused.
</P>
<P>
   One study cited in the agency's report found that consumer
privacy concerns resulted in as much as $2.8 billion in lost online
retail sales last year, while another suggested a potential loss of
as much as $18 billion by 2002, compared with a projected total of
$40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet commerce will not develop to the ultimate extent
because people just will continue to not have confidence that their
private information will be protected to the maximum,'' Pitofsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republicans on the commission disagreed with the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Republicans, Orson Swindle, issued a strongly worded
dissent that criticized the majority for not doing a precise
analysis that weighed the costs and benefits of any new
regulations. Swindle called the privacy report ``embarrassingly
flawed'' and said its recommendations ``would constitute a
troubling devolution of power from our elected officials to
unelected bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's other Republican, Thomas B. Leary, concurred in
part and dissented in part. Leary said that some legislation was
appropriate, but that the majority had asked too much and that a
law on appropriate notice should suffice. He also said the
majority's opinion was too narrow because any legislation should
apply to offline commerce as well as online commerce.

NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS GET INTERNATIONAL

<P>
   Not the 10 Most Wanted, but 10 women's tennis players competing
for the NCAA individual championships.
</P>
<P>
   These are the national championships, not a United Nations
summit. Still, players travel from faraway lands such as Turkey,
Slovakia, Czech Republic and Argentina to take advantage of one
thing the United States offers them: the ability to study and play
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have teams or sports in universities,'' said Virginia

   ``Either you play sports, or you study,'' said Argentine Cintia
Tortorella of Pepperdine.

<P>
   SEEDS: The singles bracket lists eight seeded players, then
lists the nine through 16 seeds alphabetically. So no one knows the
exact seeding of UCLA's Sara Walker or USC's Jewel Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   It has been done that way for as long as anyone can remember.
Tournament referee Jane Goodman said the method started because it
used to be too difficult to compare players across the country.

   THE END: Amanda Basica's college tennis career ended Friday. She
only discovered that Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Basica, a UCLA senior, was to play doubles with Walker, but
Walker defaulted with a back injury. Doubles teams can't be split

FUELED BY CONTEMPT, MILLER IS READY TO ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The player whose postseason career is tethered to
New York was asked Monday to clarify a comment he made. Yes, Reggie
Miller said on the eve of the Eastern Conference finals, he ``hates
but respects'' the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like 'em,'' he said. ``I respect 'em. What's
wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think they always think they're bigger and badder than
everyone. They really don't want to give no one else respect. And
we know they don't give us no respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why should I give respect or like someone that doesn't give
us respect?''
</P>
<P>
   A year older but no less villainous, Miller is back in search of
the big-game reputation he lost last June at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will turn 35 in August. Much like his coach, Larry Bird,
at the end of his Hall of Fame career, Miller has undergone the
same scrutiny from critics who believed his days as a legitimate
National Basketball Association star were over.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Bird, Miller has shut them up with huge shots and
gaudy numbers that belie his age.
</P>
<P>
   Through 10 postseason games, he is averaging 25 points, making
49 percent of his shots and almost 40 percent of his 3-pointers.
When the Pacers' season was a stake against the Milwaukee Bucks in
the first round, Miller dropped 41 points on the Bucks in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   He followed up that clutch showing with a 40-point effort
against the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 1 of the semifinal series, a
game in which Jalen Rose also scored 40. Miller has made 26
3-pointers since the regular season ended and 52 of 57 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the news media often used a popular
beer-commercial advertisement to convey his playoff prowess. The
last few seasons, it has almost became a tired cliche. But the more
he keeps shooting down youngsters such as Ray Allen and Allen
Iverson, the more apropos ``Miller Time'' again begins to sound.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had just finished practice at the Conseco Fieldhouse
Monday, the day before Game 1 of the sixth Knicks-Pacers playoff
installment in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   His ultracasual ensemble _ the tan fisherman's hat pulled down
to his black designer shades, an oversize plaid-collar shirt and
baggy shorts _ suggested he was waiting on the Miami Heat. But he
wanted the Knicks. Anything else seemed to sabotage the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I wanted to play New York,'' Miller said. ``Like I
said after Philly in Game 6, I think we need to exorcise some
demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have beaten New York, but it's never been in a conference
finals. Detroit had to get by Boston. Chicago had to get by
Detroit. So, there's always those teams you have to get by to move
on to the next level. And New York is that team for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has used more than his mouth and his deep 3-pointers to
express his desire lately. In Game 4 against the 76ers, he
responded to a second flagrant foul on 76ers center Matt Geiger
with a lunging, two-handed shove to Geiger's face. The league
construed Miller's reaction as a punch, and he was fined and
suspended for Game 5. Geiger received a two-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that his outburst cost the Pacers a game, Miller returned
in Game 6 to knock the 76ers out on their home floor. Taunting
venomous fans, throwing death stares at the 76ers bench, the player
who once wrote a book entitled ``I Love Being the Enemy'' had
succeeded in making another American city revile his every breath.
</P>
<P>
   No one dislikes Miller more than Manhattan, however.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1999, the two teams have met five times in the
playoffs. Twice the Knicks went through Indiana to make it to the
NBA finals. But if the Knicks have inflicted pain on Miller's
career, he has also extracted emotional hurt from the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The three most memorable moments are part of Madison Square
Garden lore. In 1994, he detonated for 25 of his 39 points in the
fourth quarter of Game 5, giving the Pacers a 3-2 series lead. The
Knicks, however, won in seven games
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1 of their 1995 semifinal meeting, he outdid himself.
With shocking suddenness, Miller scored 8 points with 16.4 seconds
left in the game, including two 3-pointers within 3.1 seconds of
each other to knot the score at 105 and wipe out a 6-point Knick
lead. The Pacers won the series in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   His last great Garden moment came in Game 4 of the 1998 Eastern
semifinals, when he let fly a 3-point bomb in front of a screaming
Spike Lee with 5.9 seconds left, a shot that sent the game into
overtime. The Pacers won the series in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the best would the first time we ever did beat them
in a series,'' Miller said, recalling the Pacers' 1995 triumph.
``But of course the worst is losing. You never like losing, but I
hate losing to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He has faced off against Allan Houston for the last three years,
losing the duel badly a year ago when the Pacers were stopped in
six games. Miller shot an atrocious 3 for 18 in the deciding game,
taking and missing only three shots in the final quarter. Houston
took him outside and inside, bringing about a changing of the guard
in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Bird was asked if he could ever feel the same contempt for the
Knicks that Miller feels.
</P>
<P>
   He looked deadpan into the assembled gathering and said, ``It's
hard for me to really be ticked off at a team that I have more
championship rings than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Miller, like Bird. &QL;

NEWS ANALYSIS: LIKE OTHERS, CHINA WILL TRY TO PROTECT ITS
INDUSTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Sun Guomin, a poor farmer in a village west of
here, represents an example of why American business executives and
government officials may be disappointed once China enters the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While American businesses have been dreaming of the vast
potential markets for their goods and services in China, the
government is unlikely to allow the West the kind of access those
dreams are made of. For if Beijing immediately did everything the
trade organization requires, Sun and millions like him could be
driven out of business.
</P>
<P>
   And with droves of laid-off workers already mounting sporadic
protests across the country, giving foreign competition a hand in
wiping out whole industries could be devastating for China's
governing Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, 68, is struggling to get by on his 6.5 acres in the village
of Nansong, west of Shanghai, where he lives in a mud house on a
dirt path with his wife, Chen Baonan.
</P>
<P>
   He has already stopped growing barley, once a major crop in this
part of the flat Yangtze River delta, because it does not pay. He
and his neighbors still grow rapeseed, the source of canola oil,
and the plant's brilliant yellow flowers carpet the delta with
color each spring.
</P>
<P>
   But the price the government pays for rapeseed has fallen so
low, Sun says, that he is better off pressing the seeds himself and
using the cooking oil at home. He would gladly lease his field to a
factory, but the government will not let him, citing a need to
preserve farmland. He and his wife have opened a small store in the
front of their house, where they make about 5 cents a day selling
cigarettes and beer.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the WTO threatens to make China's agricultural economics
even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Last year China imported record quantities of rapeseed and
soybeans, because foreign oil seed production is cheaper and the
quality often higher than that of domestically grown crops. But to
enter the trade group, China has agreed to lift quotas that it now
uses to restrict the import of edible oils. A surge in imports
would further dampen demand for seeds from people like Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The problem exists pretty much across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government
research institute in Beijing, recently estimated that prices for
Chinese grain and other agricultural products would continue to
exceed those of the global market for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to huge mechanized farms, the American cost of production
is often lower than that in China, where farming employs as many as
600 million people, fields are fragmented and transportation is
slow.
</P>
<P>
   And many other labor-intensive industries are in the same boat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the country's 100-plus automobile assembly plants face
extinction if imports surge as tariffs fall, and chemical plants
could be crippled by foreign competition. The Chinese government
wants to reform the economy, but it favors a cautious, go-slow
approach rather than risk widespread unrest that could undermine
its rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to think about stability,'' said Zhou Hanming,
a lawyer who advises the government about the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou says that the two to five years in which the organization
requires members to put most of its mandated measures into effect
is too short a time, and that China will do what it must to shelter
industries until they are ready to face global competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very hard on a large number of new laws and
regulations that will offer protection of national industries,
vulnerable industries, infant industries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou, one of dozens of experts Beijing has enlisted to prepare
the country to defend its industries, is studying ways to use
anti-dumping rules. Under China's trade deal with the United
States, Washington insisted that it be allowed to levy punitive
duties against imports that it deems to be sold below cost.
</P>
<P>
   Washington wanted the clause to protect the American textile
industry from cheap Chinese imports, but China has seized on the
provision to protect its own threatened industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to learn how to use the same weapon,'' Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
   The country will also use other means to give threatened
industries an edge, including preferential bank loans and tax
breaks. And Beijing may end longstanding tax breaks for foreign
companies that were intended to encourage investment.
</P>
<P>
   But China does hope to use its membership in the trade group as
a lever to move moribund state industries toward real reform.
</P>
<P>
   Take the pharmaceutical industry, which still relies largely on
copies, often illegal, of Western compounds. China will come under
pressure from the group to enforce the intellectual property rights
of foreign drug makers. To survive, Chinese pharmaceutical firms
will have to invest in research and development and begin producing
original drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure will help force us to depend on ourselves,'' said
Wang Li, general manager of the Shanghai Joy Biopharm Co., a
state-owned drug laboratory started five years ago to develop
commercially viable pharmaceuticals for the domestic industry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And China hopes that membership in the group will spur foreign
investment, which fell last year for the first time since investors
withdrew after the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at
Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational corporations have already begun signaling their
willingness to pump more money into China after it joins.
Nonetheless, protection is high on Beijing's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   China is not known for its strict adherence to trade agreements.
In 1995, Trade Minister Wu Yi signed a deal with the U.S. trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, that promised to protect
American intellectual property rights. But counterfeiting of
computer software and movies on compact disks is now more common
than ever. Street hawkers sell the latest Hollywood blockbusters in
most Chinese cities, and the police ignore the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has China proven a progressive member of another trade club.
As a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, it has
resisted moves to speed the liberalization of financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of China's market is more likely to mirror that of
Japan's. Tokyo agreed to open its tightly closed rice market
starting in 1995 with a so-called minimum access program. But
thanks to various protectionist measures, imports still account for
less than 7 percent of the rice consumed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   China may take its cue from other members of the trade group as
well. Despite pressure from the group, for example, the European
Union continues to protect its farmers from imported bananas and
hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   And even if China does follow the organization's rules, there is
plenty of room for interpretation. As a member, the country has
agreed to import 20 foreign-made films a year. But it can reduce
the competitive impact on its own film industry by picking films
from, say, other Asian countries instead of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the promise there are related mechanisms and measures
to restrict what is promised,'' one of China's trade negotiators
told Hua Sheng Monthly, a state-owned newspaper. For example, China
promised to let foreign insurance companies operate in 15 cities in
two years' time, up from the three cities to which they are now
limited. ``But `allow' does not necessarily mean that companies can
enter the market,'' the official was quoted as saying. ``They will
still need approval.''

EDITORIAL: ISRAEL'S VOLATILE BORDER  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 23:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israel's hopes for an orderly withdrawal from its security zone
in Southern Lebanon this summer were jolted Monday by the sudden
disintegration of large sections of the Southern Lebanon Army, a
pro-Israeli militia. With Syria's blessing, Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas quickly moved into the vacuum left by the militia's
collapse, seizing fortified positions laden with Israeli munitions
and occupying a slice of the zone reaching to the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's advance, which seems to have caught Israel
unprepared, has increased the danger to Israeli troops still in
Lebanon and to Israeli civilians across the border. Prime Minister
Ehud Barak must respond to these dangers in a way that allows the
Israeli withdrawal to proceed on schedule. He is now sensibly
considering plans for an earlier withdrawal date than the one now
set for July, to minimize the chance for further chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Syria, as the dominant military power in Lebanon,
must see to it that Hezbollah does not use its new positions to
launch rocket attacks on Israeli territory. Any such shellings
could bring Israeli reprisals that could spread beyond the
immediate border area and involve both Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promised during his election campaign last year to
withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon within a year of his taking
office. That deadline runs out in early July. Most Israelis oppose
maintaining the 22-year-old security zone. It has left Israeli
troops exposed to constant guerrilla attack without significantly
increasing Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   But carrying out the withdrawal became a lot harder after peace
talks between Israel and Syria broke down in March. Syria's
president, Hafez al-Assad, hoped to see the Lebanese border issue
resolved as part of a package deal that would also returned the
Golan Heights to Syria. With no such bargain in sight, Damascus
seems to feel little incentive to assure a smooth Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Arab world demanded that Israel withdraw from
Lebanon as provided under the terms of a United Nations resolution.
But now that Israel has begun doing so, the Syrian and Lebanese
governments are undermining a smooth transition. Syria ought to be
arranging for Lebanese Army units to move into areas vacated by
Israel and its militia allies. By instead permitting Hezbollah
guerrillas to move up to the Israeli border, Syria jeopardizes
Lebanon's chances for future peace and adds a dangerous new element
of instability to the Middle East.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE DAY THAT TIME STOOD STILL  

</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speed had no place Sunday in the fourth quarter of Game 7 of the
Knicks-Miami grudge match. You could call it timeless basketball if
you were serving time. The quarter lasted 48 minutes 56 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The last two minutes _ the only part of a Knicks-Heat playoff
game that requires your undivided attention _ needed 16:46 to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   What took so long? The quarter did not have an excessive number
of free throws _ 16 were attempted _ or fisticuffs. NBC's Ahmad
Rashad did not conduct Coors Light pouring clinics during timeouts
with his commercial bud, Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown did not commence until 1:33 remained on the clock.
A Tim Hardaway 3-pointer, putting Miami up, 82-81, prompted a
Knicks timeout. Two minutes of commercials followed. Another
timeout with 26.3 seconds left led to two more minutes of
commercials. A jump ball following a wild shot by Hardaway needed
32 seconds to set up. Having won the jump, Miami called time. More
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   All this resembled a baseball game, minus the dirt kicking,
meandering around home plate, wandering around the mound and
shaking off catchers' signs.
</P>
<P>
   A scramble after Clarence Weatherspoon's missed jumper with six
seconds left required 48 seconds of deliberation by the officials
before they determined that Latrell Sprewell (or another Knick) had
called a timeout. Another 90 seconds of spots ensued. A
recapitulation of the frantic sequence cost 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When Charlie Ward could not pass the ball in, he called time. So
NBC sneaked in a 30-second spot. NBC returned before the timeout
ended with 48 seconds of players' backs. Finally, the nearly
50-minute quarter ended with Ward's inbounds pass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The elasticized fourth quarter did not bother viewers much. The
game generated an 8.7 overnight Nielsen rating, up 16 percent from
the comparable game last year. So far, it is NBC's highest-rated
playoff game this postseason. The last half-hour produced an 11.8
rating.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Bill Walton and Steve Jones never acknowledged the
creeping pace of game time. Had he noted it, Walton would have
surely pronounced it ``horrible.'' And Walton, especially, offered
a characteristically provocative performance in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the struggling Knicks forward Marcus Camby, Walton
said, ``The effort is there, but never mistake activity for
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   When Knicks forward Kurt Thomas picked up a silly foul, then a
technical foul, Jones said his lack of control ``is his Waterloo.''
Walton, however, is too enamored of Thomas, often praising him as
if he were Charles Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   Walton rarely let up on his idea that Miami Coach Pat Riley
should not rest Alonzo Mourning at all. Riley subsequently rested
Mourning, who scored 14 points in the first quarter, plus Dan
Majerle and Jamal Mashburn, and all at once, early in the second.
When the Knicks tied the game at 29-29, after a 9-0 run, Walton
said: ``Riley only has himself to blame. He takes three guys out,
they lose the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jones raised the notion later in the game that Riley should
rest Mourning again, Walton loudly said, ``Don't give him any
ideas!''
</P>
<P>
   Walton railed when Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy sat Sprewell.
``You can't do that,'' he said. ``You're down 4 points in the
fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who exists to refute Walton's world view, said: ``You've
got 10 minutes to play. You know Miami will go on another
drought.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton said: ``I have never seen Latrell Sprewell need a rest.
Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones persisted, saying Van Gundy saw a need to refocus
Sprewell, who was in a scoring drought, rather than give him a
rest. Trumped, Walton did not reply.
</P>
<P>
   In close games, Walton has toned down his extreme analyses _
which often sound contemptuous _ and his verbal excesses. Still, he
is blunt about unintelligent play, and impatient when great players
foul up.
</P>
<P>
   When Mourning risked stealing a pass to Ewing, who dunked it to
put the Knicks up for good, 83-82, with 1:20 to go, Walton said:
``He's blocking every shot coming at him. Ewing hasn't had a go-to
move all day, and Alonzo Mourning makes an ill-advised decision to
come over his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton, Jones and Tom Hammond will call the Eastern Conference
finals between the Knicks and Indiana on NBC, while Bob Costas and
Doug Collins are describing the Portland-Los Angeles Lakers Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Marv Albert, who will replace Costas in NBC's top
play-by-play slot next season? His deal with the MSG Network, which
employs him to call Knicks games on WFAN Radio and be the host for
``MSG SportsDesk,'' keeps him from calling any Knicks games during
the week, so Dick Stockton will call the Knicks-Indiana games on
TNT Tuesday and Thursday night. Meanwhile, NBC would not put Albert
on the series, out of loyalty to Hammond. When his laryngitis
clears up, Albert will call some of the games on WFAN. Gus Johnson
is assigned to call Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   John Andariese, the Knicks' WFAN analyst, who was suspended by
MSG from Knicks radio games before the season ended, is offering
pregame, halftime and postgame analysis for NBA.com TV, the
league's network. It is peculiar that Andariese can work for the
league but is still barred from WFAN games due to a violation of
Madison Square Garden's ticket policy. &QL;

NEW RIVAL, EASIER DECISION, VOTERS SAY 
BY JANE GROSS  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a new candidate in the race for the U.S. Senate seat from
New York, the undecided voters being followed by The New York Times
now expect a traditional contest between Democrat and Republican
that will make their decisions simpler and more predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of them, Thomas Beck, a Long Island educator, declared
himself unequivocally committed to the newcomer, Rep. Rick A. Lazio
of Suffolk County, the young Republican who is sprinting to broaden
his name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the group was in watch-and-wait mode Monday after
Rudolph Giuliani's withdrawal and a weekend of hectic campaigning
by his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open,'' said Doug Taggart, an independent voter from
Westchester County and vice president of a financial services firm.
``The good thing is, it will now be an issue-centric campaign. And
there are clearer differences between the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Schwartz, a computer consultant from Staten Island and
another independent, also celebrated the more conventional choice.
``The advantage to this is it's less about personalities,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of these voters, who were culled from respondents to New
York Times/CBS News polls when only a sliver of the electorate was
undecided, were impressed by the war of words over the weekend,
when the Lazio camp criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton as a
carpetbagger and the Clinton camp suggested that her foe was a Newt
Gingrich clone.
</P>
<P>
   On the carpetbagger charge, all agreed with Bob Harrison, a
history teacher from Amsterdam, west of Albany, who said Clinton
had shed that albatross with months of dogged campaigning in every
corner of the state. ``She has shown she cares,'' said Harrison,
who generally votes Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison also spoke for the larger group when he dismissed the
notion that Lazio had walked in lock step with Gingrich, the former
speaker of the House. ``I don't think he's as conservative as
they're making him out to be,'' Harrison said of the new Senate
candidate. ``He was a young guy learning the ropes. Sticking close
to the people in charge is just on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck, a quick convert to Lazio, was most familiar with his
record and said the candidate was ``not locked into traditional
Republican ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeating Rep. Thomas J. Downey, a Democratic fixture on Long
Island, required coalition building, Beck said, and energetic
campaigning. And in the years since Lazio's upset victory over
Downey in 1992, years in which he has represented a diverse
congressional district, ``I've seen him grow as a politician; he's
not averse to looking at other people's ideas,'' Beck added.
</P>
<P>
   If the labels of ``carpetbagger'' and ``conservative'' do not
sway these voters, what will? The candidates' positions, they said,
especially on issues that speak to their concerns, in detail, with
price tags attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see some nitty-gritty,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Taggart said he wanted to learn more about Lazio's voting record
on gun control, which Taggart supports, and his stand on tax cuts,
which Taggart opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and his wife, Cathy, a nurse and also a Republican,
worry about the flagging upstate economy.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Temkin, a member of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers from Queens who runs the service department for
a telecommunications company, will be looking for concern for
``working people's issues, particularly labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, whose wife has cancer, cares most about medical
research and environmental perils.
</P>
<P>
   All of these voters say they assume that these issues are more
likely to be debated with Giuliani out of the picture. The mayor,
they said, had behaved as if he thought he could run on his
performance in New York City and dismiss campaigning. Lazio, by
contrast, will be scrambling to make his record known.
</P>
<P>
   Temkin is one of 11 undecided voters from around the state who
began sharing their thoughts on this extraordinary election in
January. Two dropped out of the project a few weeks back. One could
not be reached for comment for this article. Of the eight
remaining, seven say they are as up in the air as they had been,
although for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do they feel themselves between the rock and the hard
place of two candidates they despise, which is how most described
themselves four months ago. On the Democratic side, their antipathy
for the first lady has mellowed as a result of her campaign style.
On the Republican side, the voters now have to educate themselves
about an unfamiliar candidate, but one who they say seems likable.
</P>
<P>
   Temkin said he assumed that once undecided voters had a chance
to study Lazio's record and performance on the stump, they would
pretty quickly sort themselves out along party lines. ``I'll look,
but I'm not sure I'll bite,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Harrison seemed likely to make a quick
choice once she was better informed. ``I had to ask my husband,
`Where does he come from?''' she said of Lazio. ``But he sounds
good. It would be nice to have a strong Republican candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters like Taggart and Schwartz, and those who
switch parties often despite their enrollment, like Tom and Barbara
Smith of Saugerties, say they remain open-minded but certain that
Lazio must make a mark quickly or drift from contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to do some serious catching up,'' said
Smith, who works at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths, generally well informed, were behind the curve on
the recent flurry of events because of many overtime shifts. ``I
knew Giuliani was out but I didn't know who was in,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that Saugerties lacked the news coverage of cities
like New York or Albany, which had front-page stories about Lazio's
first campaign swing. The Times Herald-Record of Middletown did not
mention the new candidate until Page 11, after reports on a fishing
derby in Kingston, and the death of Barbara Cartland, the romance
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, a curious man, hunted until he found the article. Its
headline: ``Lazio Overcomes Obscurity With Whirlwind Tour.''

PUNITIVE STAGE OPENS IN SUIT BY ILL SMOKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A lawyer for the plaintiffs in the punitive damages
stage of a landmark case against cigarette makers stood before
jurors Monday and slapped himself on the wrist, the punishment he
said tobacco executives felt they deserved for decades of
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers want the country to believe ``they are good
boys and girls'' who have learned their lesson, said the lawyer,
Stanley Rosenblatt, in opening statements in what could be a
multibillion-dollar punitive judgment in Miami-Dade Circuit Court
against top cigarette manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they have changed, that does not free them from paying
for wrongful behavior for decades,'' said Rosenblatt, whose
clients, three sick smokers who represent 300,000 to 500,000
Florida smokers, are seeking a $100 billion judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Webb, a lawyer for the country's largest cigarette
maker, Philip Morris, told the jury in his opening statement that
he would offer ``significant and compelling evidence'' that
cigarette makers had changed, that they now recognized that
cigarettes as a ``dangerous product'' that should not be marketed
to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The jury that will now decide on punitive damages in the case
has already found that cigarettes are a potentially deadly and
addictive product and has already awarded $12.7 million in
compensatory damages to the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt said in his opening statement that the cigarette
makers had not really changed how they marketed their product. He
said the defendants, which include Philip Morris Inc., R.J.
Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson, the Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett
Group Inc., still ``target youths and children.''
</P>
<P>
   He said cigarette makers are still running full-page ads in
Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly, aimed at young people, and
in other magazines aimed at women.
</P>
<P>
   Most smokers are men, and if the industry really wants only to
maintain its business, why is it advertising in magazines mostly
read by others? Rosenblatt asked.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's assertions that it has changed is a public
relations ploy, he said. ``They're on the same page they've always
been on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Webb argued that tobacco companies have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has not stood still while you have been sitting as
jurors,'' he told the panel of six jurors and six alternates who
have been weighing evidence in various phases of the lawsuit for
almost 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for tobacco companies are expected to argue that, after
years of resisting scientific findings of the destructive nature of
tobacco use tobacco companies now accept that their product is
addictive and harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives have changed, Webb said, giving way to a new
breed like Michael Szymanczyk, president and chief executive of
Philip Morris, which manufacturers the country's best-selling
brand, Marlboro.
</P>
<P>
   Szymanczyk believes tobacco ``is a dangerous product,'' but also
``a completely legal product.'' He said the company spends millions
to discourage teen-agers from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   He asked jurors to consider that the industry has changed, and
reminded them that they do not have to award any punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Webb told the jury that the country's top five cigarette makers
are committed to $254 billion in settlements with all 50 states
over a 25-year period that ends in 2021.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenblatt said the states do not have to give that money to
smokers and that the industry has yet to pay ``10 cents'' to the
people damaged by their product.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's been on oxygen for eight years, has emphysema, and a
brain tumor, and doctors told us it was from smoking,'' said Bill
Herroin, a retiree who moved to Florida four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the courtroom with his wife, Frances Herroin. She sat
quietly in a wheelchair, hooked to a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Szymanczyk, in a deposition, said Philip Morris could not
survive a judgment even half as large as the $100 billion listed in
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be able to pay this money if it was due in 30
days, or in two years, for that matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenblatt said his clients would take payments on the
judgment, if it were to be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected efforts by
the cigarette makers to replace the presiding judge, Robert Kaye.
Kaye is a former smoker with a heart ailment.

AT HER DAY JOB, CLINTON IS THE HOSTESS OF A STATE DINNER
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-UNDECIDED, NY-GIULIANI-NRA, NY-GIULIANI, NY-LAZIO) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Officially, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Senate
candidate, took a night off Monday night. But she did not lounge on
the sofa at home in Chappaqua, N.Y., with a good book or soak her
tired feet in a White House tub.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton's first lady incarnation was dancing and dining
and toasting at a state dinner for President Thabo Mbeki of South
Africa and his wife, Zanele.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has reduced her first lady duties since
starting her New York Senate campaign, the White House social
office has remained up and running, providing Clinton with a series
of marquee social occasions to break up the monotony of the
campaign trail. Campaign food is a long way from the saffron
pistachio couscous, apricot ginger glazed lamb and cape
gooseberries that were served Monday night in a large tent on the
South Lawn to accommodate a larger-than-usual crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign staffers play down the importance of Clinton's
duties as first lady in her effort to replace Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring. It will be her stances on health care
and education and other issues of importance to New Yorkers, they
say, that will determine the election results, not which heads of
state she welcomes to the State Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
   But the dinners, which receive scant attention outside
Washington, do give Clinton the opportunity to reward loyalists in
her campaign with coveted invitations.
</P>
<P>
   In February, at a dinner for the king and queen of Spain,
Clinton invited her campaign scheduler, Evan Ryan, but there were
few obvious campaign backers among the diners.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, however, many New Yorkers, most of them
African-American, received embossed invitations. These included the
Rev. Floyd H. Flake, the former congressman and pastor of the Allen
AME Church in Queens, who had just endorsed Clinton, and William A.
Johnson Jr., the mayor of Rochester, who has campaigned at her
side.
</P>
<P>
   C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, attended,
as did David Dinkins, the former mayor, and New York Reps. Charles
B. Rangel, Gregory W. Meeks and Louise M. Slaughter. Other New
Yorkers in attendance included the director Spike Lee, state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Howard Rubin, chairman of the
computer science department at Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   Although state dinners rarely make the nightly news, they are
followed closely in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said some of Clinton's duties as first lady do help her
campaign, but they are the substantive issue-oriented duties, not
the social ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Co-hosting a dinner is just not that newsworthy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did emerge from Monday night's dinner with something
more tangible than the goodwill of some supporters. Her South
African counterpart gave her a 12-piece set of napkin rings in the
shape of African animals. There was a lion, an elephant, a leopard
and, perhaps most important for campaign strategy, a buffalo.

FOX NEWS SUES TO FORCE COMMENTATOR BACK TO CABLE PROGRAM  

</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Fox News Network, which previously criticized
James J. Cramer for plugging a stock he owned on TheStreet.com
cable television program, went to court Monday to try to force
Cramer to continue appearing on the program.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a unit of the News Corp., said it filed suit in New York
state court against TheStreet.com, an investor Internet site that
produces the program, and against Cramer, a hedge fund manager and
co-founder of TheStreet.com, who is a commentator for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks to force TheStreet.com to keep producing the
program, which it intends to halt after this coming weekend's
broadcast, and to force Cramer to appear on it.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Fox said TheStreet.com and Cramer had ``blatantly
disregarded their obligations to Fox News in a transparent attempt
to extricate themselves from business deals they no longer like.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit asks for injunctions requiring the program to continue,
and barring TheStreet.com from reaching an agreement with any other
network. It also seeks unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer, who has a separate contract with Fox, has not appeared
on the show since the taped April 14 program for broadcast the
following day. On that program, he recommended the stock of
TheStreet.com itself. More than a week later, a Fox spokesman was
quoted in The Daily News as criticizing Cramer. ``Despite offering
full disclosure of his ownership position, we do not approve of the
touting of stock for personal gain on the air,'' the spokesman was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Street.com cited that statement as being a new policy in
announcing last week that it would stop producing the program. It
later relented, and last week's show was taped, but Fox said
TheStreet.com had notified it that this weekend's program would be
the last.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's suit maintains that TheStreet.com has a legal obligation
to continue making the program until May 7, 2001, and that Cramer
is under contract to Fox to appear on the weekly broadcast at least
40 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for TheStreet.com declined to comment on the suit,
saying she had not seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Seiler, a lawyer for Cramer, said Monday night that
``through its prior actions, Fox News has repudiated the contract
with Cramer and he is available to appear on other programming.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``While we have not seen the specific allegations of
the complaint, we believe them to be totally without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Co. owns a 6.3 percent stake in TheStreet.com
and operates a nine-member joint newsroom with it that files
articles for the Web sites of both TheStreet.com and The New York
Times.

   DIAGEO IN TALKS FOR ALL BESTFOODS
</P>
<P>
   Diageo, which owns Pillsbury bakery goods and Haagen-Daz ice
cream, is negotiating to buy all or part of Bestfoods, the maker of
Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise, executives close to
the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo is holding trans-Atlantic negotiations with Bestfoods in

Active Software in a stock deal valued at $1.3 billion. Shares of
Vignette fell $8.9375, to $34.875, while OnDisplay rose 87.5 cents,
to $54.125. WebMethods fell $15, to $72, while Active Software
dropped 93.75 cents, to $32.0625, all on Nasdaq.

   MICROSOFT FILES UNEXPECTED BRIEF
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. filed an unexpected brief with a federal judge
that quoted from a 5-year-old government legal document in which
the Justice Department argued that breaking up Microsoft would be
``against the public interest.'' The document risks annoying the
judge, who did not ask for another filing from Microsoft when he
laid out the schedule for the remedy phase of the antitrust case.

DEVILS PLAY WITH PRECISION TO AVOID PLAYOFF ELIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Perhaps Coach Larry Robinson's angry outburst
will have a positive effect on the Devils for the remainder of
their playoff series with the Flyers. Monday night, the Devils
played with desperation and avoided elimination in the Eastern
Conference finals with a convincing 4-1 victory over the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils stayed focused from beginning to end in the physical
battle at First Union Center, building a three-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   From Martin Brodeur in goal to the last player on the fourth
line, all the Devils performed with inspiration after New Jersey
had lost three games in a row to trail in the four-of-seven-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-1 defeat on Saturday night inspired a dressing room
tirade from Robinson, who was incensed over the team's lack of
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, trailing the Flyers by three games to two in the
series, will meet Philadelphia in Game 6 on Wednesday night at
Continental Arena. If a seventh game is necessary it will be played
here on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' Jason Arnott, Bobby Holik, Petr Sykora and Patrik
Elias scored against Brian Boucher, who faced 30 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Valery Zelepukin scored the lone goal for the Flyers against
Brodeur, who faced 21 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils dominated play in the first period and took a big
lead when Arnott scored his fourth goal of the playoffs at 12
minutes 25 seconds, and Holik scored his third of the playoffs with
4:45 left before the first intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott's goal came during the Devils' first power play.
Positioned at the left circle, he one-timed a pass from Brian
Rafalski and beat Boucher to the short side.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Malakhov started the action that led to Holik's goal by
keeping the puck in Philadelphia's zone. After Jay Pandolfo touched
the puck, it went to Claude Lemieux, who shot it on net.
</P>
<P>
   After the puck was knocked loose in the crease, Holik was in
position to convert from close range on the left of Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils almost scored at about the seven-minute mark of the
game, but were unable to get to rebounds after shots by Malakhov
and Arnott. They took 14 shots in the first period while the Flyers
had only six against Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils went to work on offense, after killing a penalty to
Malakhov that carried over into the second period, and established
a three-goal lead on Sykora's sixth in the playoffs. Scott Stevens
started the play with a pass on the left flank to Elias, who found
Sykora alone near the right side of the crease for an easy goal at
1:47.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur and the Devils' defense went through some hectic moments
in the 12th minute of the period, when the Flyers had three chances
in the same sequence. Brodeur stopped one Flyer shot. One sailed
wide and the other went over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were successful killing a penalty to Steve Kelly in
the period, but faltered when Malakhov took his second penalty in
the game with 5:05 left in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Zelepukin scored his first in the playoffs 50 seconds into the
penalty when he deked Brodeur with a move from right to left.
Zelepukin's power-play goal was only the second the Devils had
allowed on 44 attempts by the opposition in the playoffs and the
first they had yielded in 11 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils regained the three-goal lead on Elias' fifth score of
the playoffs 54 seconds into the third period. He beat Boucher with
a backhander after a giveaway by the Flyers at their blue line.

EPA SEEKING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS TAINTED WITH TOXIC METAL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency is scouring the
country for fertilizer and animal feed made from imported raw
materials contaminated with cadmium, a toxic metal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials involved in the search said they were not sure how the
contamination occurred. The agency's enforcement officials are
considering two possibilities: that the cadmium was accidentally
included because of poor quality control in China or that somewhere
in the production process industrial wastes containing cadmium were
deliberately added to agricultural products bound for export.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination has raised concerns that workers might be
exposed to the cadmium while producing agricultural products and
that the poison might find its way into food for human or animal
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Agency toxicologists are examining both possibilities, officials
said, although workplace exposure is probably the greater risk.
Exposure can cause flulike symptoms, weakness and coughing and has
been linked to lung cancer and kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a fertilizer manufacturer in Washington State detected
high concentrations of cadmium during checks of its product that
are required by a new state law. The company alerted state
officials, and the contamination was traced to zinc sulfate
imported from China.
</P>
<P>
   The importer, the Ag-Chem Commission Co., in Cornelius, Ore.,
then identified two additional purchasers of contaminated zinc
sulfate, in California and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   According to internal EPA memorandums, regional directors for
the agency have been working with customs agents to notify other
importers and to test their shipments of zinc sulfate from China.
The documents were provided to The New York Times by the
Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization
in Washington that focuses on pesticides, fertilizers and other
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preliminary results of those inquiries reveals that as much as
1.3 million pounds entered the U.S. at 10 different ports since the
first contaminated shipment was detected in November of 1999,'' one
memorandum said. ``With customs information we have identified 14
importers that have received shipments of suspect zinc sulfate.''
</P>
<P>
   The importers are situated throughout the country, the
memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is working to check both the imported raw materials
and products made from them, a process that should be completed
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ag-Chem imported the raw material from China in February and
distributed hundreds of tons to companies in California, Washington
and Idaho, said the company's lawyer, Ted A. Troutman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 132 tons of the chemicals have been quarantined by
Ag-Chem at the Port of Seattle, Troutman said, and 44 tons at the
Port of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since we found out about the situation, we have been
trying to put pressure on China to take the stuff back,'' Troutman
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company was cooperating with the environmental
agency's effort to contain the imported substance and has asked the
State Department for assistance in urging China to take back the
material.
</P>
<P>
   Troutman said the material originated at two factories in the
Hunan province of China, China Hunan Changnin Songbai Chemical
Factory and the China Hunan Hengnan Fuli Chemical Factory.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time zinc sulfate contaminated with cadmium
has come from China.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Dagseth, an EPA official in Seattle, said that in 1998 an
importer in Mississippi detected cadmium in zinc sulfate that was
to be used in animal feed. The company has been unable to send the
material back to China.
</P>
<P>
   And zinc sulfate from China continues to arrive at ports on the
Pacific coast. Dagseth said that in addition to the Ag-Chem
containers being held, an importer from Minnesota has 40 tons of
zinc sulfate in quarantine.

 PRIVACY PROPOSAL RANKLES INTERNET INDUSTRY  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet industry groups lashed out Monday at
the Federal Trade Commission's recommendation that Congress make
laws establishing basic online privacy standards.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's recommendation to create the first law to govern
Internet privacy is a departure from the commission's past stance
that the industry could enforce its own privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem may be bigger than industry self-regulation itself
can deal with,'' Commissioner Mozelle Thompson said. He was quick
to point out that self-regulation initiatives such as the Truste
and BBBOnline privacy seal programs would still be an important
part of online privacy under the recommendation. The proposal,
released Monday, was approved Friday in a 3-to-2 vote by
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's report, which it will present to the Senate Commerce
Committee on Thursday, calls for a law requiring Web sites to give
Internet users a choice in what information is collected about
them, and let users have access to that information. Sites would
also have to keep data about consumers secure and post clear
privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's change in direction was prompted by a survey it
conducted earlier this year showing that only 40 percent of Web
sites abide by the basic practices of choice, access, security and
notice that the law would require.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has also investigated possible privacy violations by a
growing number of Web sites, including online advertising firm
DoubleClick and portal Yahoo. So far, the commission has not
concluded that either of those sites actually committed any privacy
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Two industry groups, the Information Technology Association of
America and the Online Privacy Alliance, called the legislation
unnecessary, and said the Internet industry is already doing a good
job protecting consumers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy policies are now ubiquitous online,'' said OPA adviser
Christine Varney, a former FTC commissioner. ``These policies
empower consumers to make informed choices about what personal
information to share.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's study did find that 100 percent of the Web's
most-popular sites post privacy policies. However, the FTC's
Thompson, who voted in favor of the recommendation, said that just
posting a policy does not mean that sites are adequately
safeguarding consumers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some real issues about the quality of what
they're providing in terms of privacy policies,'' Thompson said,
pointing out that many Web sites' policies do not address all
aspects of consumer privacy. And some sites do not abide by their
own policies, Thompson added.
</P>
<P>
   Among local Internet companies, opinions about the
recommendation were split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that self-regulation is the best way to go,'' said
Yahoo President Jeff Mallet. Co-founder Jerry Yang pointed out that
enforcing a privacy law would be difficult given the different ways
the Internet is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my financial data treated very differently from my
e-mail and my health records,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Netcentives, a San Francisco company that helps Web sites reward
their users with frequent-flier miles and other incentives, called
the FTC's decision reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a gap between the (privacy) notices companies
post and their behavior,'' said David McKay, vice president of
marketing at Netcentives subsidiary Post Communications.
</P>
<P>
   David Steer, a spokesman for the Truste privacy seal program,
praised the FTC's move, calling it an ``endorsement'' of Truste and
the concept of privacy seals. Web sites that belong to Truste will
likely be compliant with any laws Congress comes out with, Steer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet privacy advocates, who have long called for the
government to protect Internet users' privacy, had restrained
praise for the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy I Center, said the
proposal should have been more detailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're asking congress to provide what we would consider the
bare minimum of protection,'' Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the recommendation should have laid out what
compensation Internet users would get if their privacy rights are
violated, Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Thompson said the recommendation was purposely kept
vague because of the fast-changing nature of Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake for a legislative vehicle in this area to be
too detailed _ by its very nature it would become outdated,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican leaders believe regulation would be premature in
the young world of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quickest way to kill the Internet is to regulate it to
death,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. W.J. ``Billy''
Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee on trade
and consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of Democrats, led by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said Monday that
they will introduce comprehensive privacy legislation to keep
companies from profiting from the sale of personal data gleaned
from unwitting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such legislation could get traction in Congress this
year appears doubtful. Lawmakers already have a full plate of
technology-related legislation awaiting action.

LEADING VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM INVESTS IN NAPSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster, an Internet music site that has
incurred the wrath of the recording industry, announced new
financing and new leadership from a leading venture capital firm
Monday, signifying a stamp of approval for the start-up.
</P>
<P>
   The venture firm, Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, said it had
led a $15 million round of investment in Napster, which enables
Internet users to exchange music files kept on their own home and
office computers. The company, founded last September, had
previously raised only $2 million in capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad also said it has placed one of its partners, Hank
Barry, as the company's interim chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Napster in facing lawsuits from the Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents the major record labels,
and from several musicians who contend Napster facilitates music
piracy by allowing individuals to exchange copyrighted songs. Tens
of thousands of copyrighted songs are available through the site,
according to lawyers for the rap artist Dr. Dre and the heavy-metal
band Metallica.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's lawyers counter that the company should not be held
accountable if some members use the service to exchange copyrighted
music, asserting that it should not have to play the role of the
police and that the songs are not kept on its own computers. Barry,
a former copyright and entertainment lawyer, said he planned to
``vigorously pursue all pending litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the venture capital firm saw ``tremendous opportunity''
in Napster, given the popularity of the site, which says it has 10
million registered users. It is particularly popular among college
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``File-sharing is a phenomenon,'' he said, ``and we think
Napster is the leading file-sharing application company.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry said the key would be finding a business model that
``works for everybody,'' including consumers, musicians and the
recording industry. He did not specify what such a business model
might be, though several sites that compete with Napster have
talked of experimenting with advertising and subscription-based
models.
</P>
<P>
   The investment by Hummer Winblad suggests that file-sharing
technology is attracting new mainstream backing, regardless of the
position of the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad is also an investor in Liquid Audio, which is
working with recording companies to develop technologies for the
secure transfer of digital music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., previously received a $2
million round of financing from Angel Investors and from private
individuals. The company has 33 employees. Napster will use at
least some of the new money to expand its staff and move to new
offices, said Elizabeth Brooks, Napster's vice president for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The level of Hummer Winblad's investment is not unusual, though
it is atypical for a venture capital firm to install one of its own
partners as an interim chief. But Barry said he was suited for the
task given his background: he was a musician and record producer in
the 1970s, and he practiced entertainment, copyright and
technology-related law before joining Hummer Winblad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to use my background to build a bridge to all of the
constituencies that can benefit from Napster,'' said Barry, who
declined to give his age.
</P>
<P>
   Barry replaces Eileen Richardson, who came on as interim chief
executive last September. Richardson will remain as an adviser, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Fanning, the 19-year-old who developed the Napster
technology and founded the company, remains involved in ``coding
and engineering,'' Brooks said. &QL;

<P>
   ALCANTARA, Brazil _ In the satellite-launching business, as in
real estate, location is everything. Because of that simple fact,
the space port the Brazilian government has built here on the
eastern edge of the Amazon basin and is making available to foreign
companies and governments may soon become a valuable piece of
property.
</P>
<P>
   Situated 2 degrees south of the Equator, the Alcantara launching
center, built by the Brazilian military two decades ago, has become
the focal point of what is perhaps the most ambitious unmanned
space program in any developing country. But it is the boom in
telecommunications satellites that is likely to ensure it a
prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of 1998, we calculated there were going to be 800
satellites launched around the world between 2000 and 2004, and
that billions of dollars were going to be spent,'' Ronaldo
Sardenberg, Brazil's science and technology minister, said in an
interview in the capital, Brasilia. ``We decided that we wanted to
take advantage of those favorable circumstances and that Alcantara
could and should be an important player on the international
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Alcantara's proximity to the Equator, rockets
launched here can gain orbit faster and carry heavier payloads than
those launched elsewhere. This translates into substantial savings
for users and a longer useful life for the satellites. Brazilian
officials estimate, for instance, that a launching from Alcantara
can be as much as 30 percent more efficient than one from Cape
Canaveral, which is situated at 28 degrees north latitude.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the areas north and east of here are largely jungle
or ocean, meaning that in case of an accident, debris is unlikely
to fall on populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Alcantara, about 2,500 miles southeast of Miami, is
able to offer clients a choice of polar or equatorial orbits or any
trajectory in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world needs a greater availability of launch sites,'' Luiz
Gylvan Meira, director of the Brazilian Space Agency, said in an
interview, ``and while the niche that Alcantara finds will be
dictated by the market, it is a launch site that is both good and
cheap. It is good because of both its location and its
availability, and it will be cheap because the Brazilian government
has already put in the necessary infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian effort to turn Alcantara into a leading spaceport
got significant help in April, when the United States and Brazil
signed an accord that permits the launching of American satellites
on American launchers from the base here. In return, Brazil agreed
to a series of safeguards intended to prevent it from acquiring the
technology of its American clients or passing that information on
to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The site here, its privileged geographic position
notwithstanding, is not the only one seeking a share of any
satellite wealth. Many European nations use a site at Kourou in
French Guiana, 5 degrees north of the Equator. [On May 19, Guyana
signed a deal with a Texas company, Beal Aerospace Technologies, to
build a launching site there.)
</P>
<P>
   Various proposals have also been floated to build spaceports on
the east coast of Africa and the east coast of Australia; because
of the earth's rotation, a site permitting a launch eastward over
water is always preferred. In addition, there have been efforts to
launch satellites from a sea platform in international waters in
the Pacific, as well as from high-altitude aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But since United States companies account for about 80 percent
of the satellite market, April's agreement gives Brazil an
advantage over its competitors. There are 17 other launching sites
operating around the world, but only Brazil is now authorized to
launch both rockets and satellites of American manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   The Alcantara agreement, said Anthony Harrington, the United
States ambassador to Brazil, ``is symbolic both of the strength of
the U.S.-Brazil relationship and the level of trust that is
developing between the two governments.'' He predicted that several
American companies would soon begin operating here, adding, ``Cape
Canaveral has many advantages, but being right next to the Equator
is not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sardenberg, the Brazilian technology minister, said ``eight of
the top 15 aerospace firms in the United States'' have already
visited the site here, including, according to the visitors'
logbook at the space center, Lockheed Martin, Orbital Sciences,
Rockwell International and Boeing. He noted that both Cape
Canaveral and Kourou ``have their schedules full,'' adding, ``Our
objective is that this base be a profit center that can accommodate
many users at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Brazil signed a wide-ranging agreement with
Ukraine. It calls for a consortium also including Fiat Avio of
Italy to use Ukrainian-made Tsyklon-4 rockets, a liquid-fuel,
three-stage rocket based on the Soviet SS-9 ballistic missile, to
launch as many as 60 satellites here over five years, starting in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is space for everyone here,'' said Col. Jose Campos
Lobato, commander of the base, with about 400 military personnel
and 200 civilians. ``We have almost 250 square miles of land, so we
can easily install four additional launch pads here and still have
some room left over.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the base here began in 1983, with the first
satellite launching six years later, after nearly $300 million had
been spent on roads, electricity, a command center, an airport and
other infrastructure. Since then, 276 satellites or rockets have
been launched from Alcantara, including 36 by NASA, though the
great majority of these were suborbital rockets.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials have made it clear that their space
ambitions go far beyond offering a launch site for others' use.
They hope to supply some of the satellites and rockets that will be
sent up, and have maintained a wide-ranging research and
development effort with that aim.
</P>
<P>
   The center of that program is in Sao Jose dos Campos, nearly
2,000 miles south of here. The National Institute for Space
Research has its headquarters there, engaging in activities ranging
from weather forecasting to industrial testing, and on an adjoining
campus is the Center for Aerospace Technology, controlled by the
Brazilian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The importance that Brazil attaches to its space program can be
seen by looking at the institute's budget: as other government
agencies tighten their belts, it has received a 36 percent increase
this year. The government intends profits from future launchings to
go to research and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a country like this, with all the problems we have, you
cannot do science just for the sake of doing science,'' said Marcio
Nogueira Barbosa, the director of the space institute. ``You have
to show results.''
</P>
<P>
   The pride of the Brazilian space effort is the Cbers satellite,
which has been jointly developed with China in a $300 million
program. The first of these satellites, which carry three
high-resolution cameras to study environmental and agricultural
conditions, was launched from Taiyuan, a Chinese base, in October,
and a second is being assembled at the Brazilian institute's campus
in Sao Jose dos Campos, with launching tentatively scheduled in the
second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials said that at least two more satellites are
likely to be launched with the Chinese, in an effort to turn the
program into a money-making operation that can compete with NASA's
Landsat program. ``Since we are a big buyer of satellite images,''
Sardenberg said, ``it is only natural that we would also want to
supply high-definition photographs to a market that is so large and
constantly in search of images from different angles.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is also a member of the consortium building the
international space station, the only developing country to be
invited to join the 15-nation group. A Brazilian astronaut is being
trained in the United States for that mission, and Brazilian
companies have been awarded about $120 million in construction
contracts for the space vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The weak link in the country's space program has been its rocket
program, which aims at building a reliable launching vehicle that
is cheaper than American or European rockets. An initial attempt to
launch a four-stage, solid-fuel missile in 1997 failed, as did a
second attempt in December, which led to widespread criticism and
mockery in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials say they intend to go ahead with the rocket
program. ``These things happen, it goes with the territory,'' said
Meira, the space agency's director, ``and there is no indication
that our rocket has a fundamental structural flaw. It's just that
other aspects of our space effort have developed and advanced more
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the rocket and satellite programs began in the 1970s, when
Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship. At that time, the
government encouraged the founding of companies to manufacture jet
aircraft for military use and another to make tanks and armored
personnel carriers, both of which were also based in Sao Jose dos
Campos. These quickly found markets in Latin America, the Mideast
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there were uncertainties at first whether the
objectives of Brazil's space effort were scientific and commercial
or primarily military. Those concerns lingered after the military
handed over power to a democratic civilian government in 1985 and
saw many of its other pet projects, like a costly nuclear program,
mothballed.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1990, in the months before the Persian Gulf war,
Washington expressed concern about Brazil supplying satellite and
rocket technology to Iraq, a longtime buyer of Brazilian armored
vehicles. Gen. Hugo Piva, a former director of the Center for
Aerospace Technology, who was a strong advocate of a Brazilian
nuclear program, has acknowledged that he sought rocket parts on
the black market in an effort to accelerate the rocket program.
</P>
<P>
   But United States officials say that all such concerns have been
eliminated in recent years. Brazil, after refusing to do so during
the years of military rule, has signed a series of international
agreements, including ones on nonproliferation, that paved the way
for April's accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an evolutionary process in which they have moved in
the right direction,'' Harrington, the American envoy, said. ``We
don't have those concerns. On the other hand, the agreement is a
safeguards agreement, and it involves mutual assurances'' to
American companies likely to launch from here that ``there is no
risk of their technology being broadcast in an unauthorized
manner.''

RUDY WHO? GOP EMBRACES SUCCESSOR  

</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Republicans across the state began
chorusing Monday that Rep. Rick A. Lazio was turning out to be a
better Senate candidate than their first choice, Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who dropped out last week because of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As Lazio completed two days of flying around the state for
campaign appearances, his fledgling candidacy also received the
backing of the state Conservative Party Monday, a crucial
endorsement that could carry as many as 300,000 votes. No
Republican has won a statewide election without the Conservative
Party endorsement since 1974. Giuliani and Michael Long, the
chairman of the party, spent much of the last year in a standoff
over the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what enthusiasm can do,'' said James Cavanaugh, the
Westchester County Republican chairman who presided over a noisy
late-afternoon rally for Lazio here as people chanted ``Let's Go
Rick!'' and ``Way to Go, Lazio!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's energizing people in a way that the mayor didn't,''
Cavanaugh added. ``You know, people would call me up and they would
say, `I want to volunteer for the mayor. What can I do?' And I
often didn't know what to ask them to do, because the mayor wasn't
really getting out and doing things. People now say, `Well, what
can I do for Rick Lazio?' I've got stuff for them to do. He's made
it plain: `I want rallies. I want people out registering voters.
We're going to do phone banks.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was Lazio's final stop on the 48-hour campaign swing that
took him from Long Island to Buffalo to Rochester to Syracuse to
Binghamton to Elmira to Utica to Watertown to Albany and then to
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   At every stop, Lazio was cheerful, disciplined and nearly on
time as he repeated his stump speech about working in his father's
auto parts shop and growing up clamming in the waters off Long
Island _ a contrast to his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
moved to the state five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who announced his candidacy on Saturday, also said he
would be back again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you don't get sick of me, you're going to see me so
often,'' he told Republicans at a breakfast in Elmira this morning.
In Westchester County, he said, ``I hope you don't get sick of me,
I'm going to be back so often.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio traveled on a seven-seat jet with his wife and two young
daughters, Molly Ann, 7, and Kelsey, 6. In Elmira, the two girls
stood on a chair, took the microphone and said, ``Vote for my
Dad,'' during the hubbub after their father's speech. Republicans
who noticed them looked enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Gov. George E. Pataki and William D. Powers, the
state Republican Party chairman, presided over an airport rally of
100 whistling, cheering and clapping supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who 12 hours after he declared his candidacy can
get in front of the national media and lay out an agenda for New
York because he knows New York,'' Pataki said. In August, the
governor's endorsement of Giuliani was considerably more lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   In Elmira, Sidney S. Graubard, a Chemung County legislator, was
equally welcoming of Lazio. ``In fact, I preferred him all along,''
he said. ``He's got the personality. You can see that he's a clean
kind of candidate. Rudy's ignored too many people. He'd be invited
to things, and he'd never come up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so many Republicans were saying such similar things all
day that it brought up the question of why they had ever supported
Giuliani in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine got behind the mayor,'' said Suzanne Swanson, 56,
a Westchester County legislator, who was referring to the party
leaders in Albany. But then she added: ``I think what happened was
the mayor presented himself as a viable candidate with a war chest
to take on Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, the governor's chief political aide, said:
``Everybody's happy. We're all one big happy family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mucha also said that if reporters missed the oversize
personalities and melodrama of the old Hillary-Rudy race, that was
fine with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If reporters are bored by this campaign, then it means it's a
good campaign,'' she said.

SUPREME COURT DID THE
 RIGHT THING IN TV-SEX RUL
 ING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday made it theoretically easier
for kids to see sex on television.
</P>
<P>
   You should be glad.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that Congress vio lated free-speech rights when
it re quired cable TV systems to restrict sex-oriented networks to
the wee hours if they don't fully scramble the signal for
non-subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking: Yeah, yeah, the bleeding-heart
newspaper guy wants to protect First Amend ment rights at all
costs, no matter what the damage to society. And there is an
element of truth in that - the First Amendment keeps Mary Tyler
Moore from suing me, after all, when I say her TV movie stinks.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a bigger issue here than whether a channel-surfer
catches a glimpse of a topless woman on the Playboy Channel when
looking for The 700 Club. And it's a big one: parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Various groups have long argued that TV is too (take your pick:
violent, profane, obscene, etc.); that either the networks or the
govern ment have a responsibility to keep the airwaves safe for our
children. The same people will doubtless be outraged by the court's
decision, which is that same argument wrapped in different clothing
(or in this case, no clothing at all).
</P>
<P>
   These people are wrong. The respon sibility rests squarely with
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Being a parent is a tough job. I know. And the court's decision
makes that job a little tougher.
</P>
<P>
   But when the problem is TV, there is a nearly flawless solution.
It's called an off button, and parents should use it.
</P>
<P>
   And then explain why they did.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some kids will sneak and watch, anyway. Some kids will
sneak a beer, too, or take an uncomfortable puff on a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   I fully expect my daughter to one day try things I wish she
wouldn't. And when she makes what I hope are the right choices, I'd
like to be part of the reason.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes the job worth doing. &QL;

GIULIANI DOUBTS NRA ARCADE ON TIMES SQUARE WOULD SURVIVE  

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Monday he did not think a
theme restaurant and shoot'em-up arcade run by the National Rifle
Association could realistically survive in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the gun lobbying organization announced Friday that
they wanted to open up a restaurant and gift shop much like Planet
Hollywood and the ESPN Zone, except with firearms as the theme. The
restaurant's menu would feature wild game, as would the arcade, the
association said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers and gun control advocates have condemned
the NRA's proposal, saying it is an attempt by the association to
interest children in guns.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said there was no need for him to take a position on
the propriety of the restaurant because he believed it would never
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't think it is going to happen, I don't see how
that is really realistic, that they are going to open a store on
Times Square,'' Giuliani said. ``It is unrealistic in light of all
the resources that would be necessary and all of the plans that I
know for Times Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was more explicit at a reception honoring the Walt
Disney Co.'s efforts to revive Times Square. ``Now, everyone wants
to be in Times Square, even the NRA,'' the mayor said. ``Don't
worry, it won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president, said the
association would sue if the city tried to stop the restaurant. He
said the mayor was mistaken in his economic analysis in that
millions of sport shooters would visit the restaurant. He said that
despite the high rent, the venture would be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers don't scare me,'' LaPierre said. ``We can match
World Wrestling. We can match ESPN.'' He would not say when the NRA
planned to open the restaurant, but he did say he was negotiating
for space in or near the Times Square area.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani administration officials said that since the store had
no intention of selling guns, there was little legally that they
could do to stop it. City officials pointed out that zoning rules
obviously did not prohibit restaurants in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's aides said his remarks reflected his belief that
an NRA restaurant could not make enough money to survive in a
neighborhood where ground-floor rents top $7 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, recent Midtown Manhattan history is littered with
the tales of failed theme restaurants, like the Fashion Cafe and
the Motown Cafe. Many of the existing restaurants, like the
All-Star Cafe and Planet Hollywood, are struggling. Others were
announced but did not open, including the David Copperfield
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Sexton, the president of the Times Square Business
Improvement District, disagreed with the mayor's assessment of
restaurant economics. He said that space was available and that
arcade and theme restaurants had worked in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around,'' he said as he stood in Times Square and
gestured behind him to the ESPN Zone, the most successful theme
restaurant to open recently.
</P>
<P>
   But Sexton said he did not want the NRA to come to Times Square.
At a news conference with Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., Sexton
said he hoped that landlords in the neighborhood would not rent to
the association.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said that if the NRA did move into Times Square, he
would push the city or the state to revoke any tax breaks that the
property owners receive.
</P>
<P>
   Some gun control advocates said Monday that they agreed with the
mayor that it was unrealistic that the NRA would open a store.
Barbara Hohlt, chairwoman of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, said
the rifle association might just be trying to provoke city
residents. And Sexton said the association's announcement could be
more of a publicity stunt than a realistic suggestion.

AFTER RACE, MAYOR FINDS RENEWED JOY IN DAY JOB  

</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was boasting, once again, about New York City's
war on graffiti and street litter. He proclaimed _ somewhat
belatedly _ May as Pet Adoption Month. And by nightfall, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani was out on Gracie Mansion's front lawn, holding a
party for the city's theater community, complete with a performance
by a star of ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mistaking it Monday. Candidate Rudy is out. And
Mayor Rudy is back in, and so far is sticking with his promised
kinder, gentler style.
</P>
<P>
   For the retired Senate candidate, this all was somewhat of a
relief, as he let Rick A. Lazio, his apparent replacement, dash
madly across New York state. The mayor stayed on home turf Monday,
tending to the details of running his favorite city and looking for
yet more opportunities to use his new favorite word, ``love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is great. It is great. I love being the mayor,'' Giuliani
said at a morning news conference that attracted a dozen television
cameras, compared with the mosh pit of more than 40 when he
announced his exit from the Senate race on Friday. ``That is one of
the benefits, one of the bright sides, as I said on Friday, of all
that happened with health and everything. I love doing this job.
This is a great job, a very rewarding job, a terrific job, and I
found new reasons to love the city of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani deferred all questions about political matters. No
decision, he said, on what he would do with his millions in unspent
campaign money. No decision on whether he would attend the May 30
Republican convention in Buffalo, where he was until Friday set to
become the Senate nominee. No thoughts yet about his future when
his second term as mayor runs out in 18 months. And no word on if
he has hired a lawyer to represent him in his planned separation
from his wife, Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked how he felt about beginning his ``first
week as a real lame-duck mayor,'' Giuliani laughed and responded,
``I feel pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the mayor spent the day on classic municipal affairs. He
gave an early morning speech at the Grand Hyatt Hotel to corporate
leaders, surveying the progress the city has made in recent years
to reduce crime and clean up the streets and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   During the event, the mayor shared a table with his former
director of communications, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, who is now
the president of NYC &AMP; Co., the city's convention and visitors
bureau. It was the first public meeting of the two since Hanover
implied that the mayor and Lategano-Nicholas had a romantic
relationship when she worked for the mayor, a suggestion the two
denied.
</P>
<P>
   Back at City Hall, the mayor fondled two whimpering puppies as
he announced a stepped-up effort by the city's Center for Animal
Care and Control to find adoptive homes for strays.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last night, he was the host as several hundreds guests
attended the city's annual ``Salute to the Theater'' under a tent
on the Gracie Mansion lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor spoke about the progress in rebuilding Times Square,
including the soon-to-open Madame Tussaud's wax museum. ``Madame
Tussaud is soon to be there with, among other things, my wax
figure,'' he said, pausing and stiffly imitating his replica. ``It
looks better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, perhaps the top item on the mayor's city
government agenda will be ironing out a budget agreement with the
City Council. Formal negotiations will begin this week, with the
two sides split over competing tax cut proposals. Negotiations are
also under way with municipal labor unions representing almost all
city workers, whose contracts expire soon.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani indicated that it would most likely be about two weeks
before he decided, in detail, how he would follow up on his promise
on Friday to reach out to disaffected city residents, presumably
from predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods. He also has said
he intended to in some way express his condolences to the family of
Patrick Dorismond, the Haitian-American killed by a police officer
during a confrontation in March.
</P>
<P>
   There were other hints Monday that Giuliani was sustaining his
new image as a more sensitive, compassionate mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Before last night's party, he quietly left City Hall to visit a
sick teen-age girl at Ronald McDonald House of New York City, which
provides support for the families of children being treated for
cancer and other serious diseases. Her family had asked for a
signed photograph of the mayor; he decided to deliver that picture
in person.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his health, the mayor said Monday he may not
immediately announce when he had settled on a treatment for his
prostate cancer, waiting instead until the care might require him
to miss some work. Until Friday, the mayor had been under pressure
to make his treatment choices quickly, saying he wanted to decide
on the medical matters before indicating if he would stay in the
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to keep that decision to myself and then announce
it when I think it might have some impact on what I do as mayor,''
he said. ``In other words where I will have to take some time off,
or take a few days off, or a period of time off, as soon I know
that, everybody has a right to know that.''  &QL;

   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   KEYES FIRM ON ABORTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The abortion issue continues to present potential problems for
the Republican Party, with Alan Keyes, a presidential candidate,
considering leaving the party if it weakens its stance against
abortion. Connie Hair, Keyes' press secretary, says he will
possibly join the Constitution Party and seek its nomination if the
Republicans do not retain a strong anti-abortion position in their
platform or if Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed
Republican presidential nominee, picks a running mate who is not
anti-abortion. The Constitution Party is strongly anti-abortion.
Hair made her comments to USA Today over the weekend, then
elaborated on them Monday. Keyes has not been heard from much
lately. But Hair emphasized that while Keyes reserved the right to
abandon the Republican Party over the abortion issue, he was for
the moment still a candidate for the Republican nomination, had
delegates pledged to him and intended to attend the party
convention in Philadelphia. The Constitution Party already has a
presidential candidate, Howard Phillips, who said Monday, ``I am
prepared to discuss anything with Alan Keyes, including the
possibility of his becoming our candidate for president or vice
president, but my present intention is to continue as the
presidential nominee.'' &QL;

<P>
   THE GREENS
</P>
<P>
   NADER PRO-IMPEACHMENT
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, the probable Green Party candidate for president,
said Monday that if he had been in the Senate during the
impeachment trial of President Clinton, he would have voted to
convict. ``I thought that he crossed that boundary so seriously in
that scandal that the House was proper in impeaching him and the
Senate really should have convicted him,'' Nader said on Political
Points, the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. ``I think
law licenses have been taken away from lawyers for less egregious
offenses than what President Clinton committed as president of the
United States.'' While the remark might please some disaffected
Democrats and independent voters, it could also anger some of the
liberals Nader has been courting in states like California, where a
recent poll shows him pulling just under 10 percent of the vote. &QL;

   THE STATES UP FOR GRABS
</P>
<P>
   Smelling vulnerability in the Republican incumbent, four
Arkansas Democrats each hope to be selected in Tuesday's primary to
be the challenger in the state's traditionally Democratic Fourth
Congressional District. Rep. Jay Dickey has represented the
district, which is about a quarter black, since 1992, but polls
have shown he is faltering, particularly after a remark he made in
January suggesting that he could not help a group of black farmers
unless they contributed money. The leading Democrat in Tuesday's
primary, state Sen. Mike Ross, is the only one of the group that
outranked Dickey in a recent poll by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.
The poll showed Ross leading his nearest competitor, former state
Rep. Judy Smith, by 21 points.

<P>
   THE ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   NRA RE-ELECTS HESTON
</P>
<P>
   Charlton Heston was unanimously re-elected Monday to an
unprecedented third term as president of the National Rifle
Association, the nation's largest gun group. He pledged to do all
possible to defeat Vice President Al Gore, a gun control advocate,
in this fall's presidential contest, and hinted that he might run
again next year for a fourth term as the association's leader. The
re-election of Heston, perhaps the most nationally prominent rifle
association president ever, was the last big item of business at
the organization's 129th annual convention in Charlotte, N.C. The
group amended its bylaws to allow Heston, 75, to run again.
Traditionally, association officers are elected to one-year terms
and may serve only two consecutive terms.  &QL;

FAILED COUP LEAVES SPEAKER STILL STANDING, BUT WOUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A fierce debate erupted on the floor of the State
Assembly Monday, as Democrats in the majority engaged in a rare
public struggle over the future of their leader, Speaker Sheldon
Silver.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Silver and his allies beat back a coup attempt, as
was widely expected. But the leaders of the insurrection may have
accomplished something nearly as remarkable as toppling a sitting
speaker: wounding him politically.
</P>
<P>
   The coup attempt provided a remarkable display of defiance that
is nearly unheard of here in the Capitol, where the leaders of both
houses decide matters behind closed doors, with debate over
substantive issues rarely making it to the floor of the Assembly or
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The fight made for high political drama, with the 98 Democrats
who make up the majority in the Assembly turning on one another in
a clash that drew scores of people into the chamber's normally
empty gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, for his part, never emerged from his office to defend
himself on the floor, reinforcing the widespread image of him as
isolated and aloof.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown had been building since late last week when Michael
J. Bragman, an assemblyman from the Syracuse area, announced that
he would try to overthrow Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, in a
vote. Silver immediately stripped Bragman of his title as majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman took his fight to the chamber late on Monday afternoon
even after he had publicly acknowledged that his base of support
had dwindled in recent days as Silver rallied his own troops,
punished disloyal lawmakers and threatened retaliation against any
other legislator who crossed him.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor, Bragman accused Silver of hoarding power and
keeping lawmakers in the dark about crucial decisions. He said that
Silver had stifled debate on major issues, reduced rank-and-file
lawmakers to bit players and given powerful lobbyists too much say
in the day-to-day affairs of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that we have to change the way this house
conducts itself,'' Bragman said as a crowd of spectators sat
mesmerized by the events unfolding on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here has felt the frustration and dissatisfaction
with the current situation,'' he said. ``I know that better than
anyone else, because virtually everyone in the majority conference
has come to me, looked me in the eye, and expressed his or her
dissatisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Member after member is forced to go to the speaker
to ask for anything, from paper clips to chairmanships, from
parking passes to staff needs. And they have told me that they feel
that their requests are being kept in a favor bank. Either you do
what the speaker wants, or you don't get the things you need.''
</P>
<P>
   James F. Brennan, an assemblyman from Brooklyn, shared that
sentiment, calling Silver's leadership ``a virtual dictatorship.''
He added that there is ``a sense of anger and frustration and
bitterness about how the current administration conducts itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers loyal to Silver struck back, accusing Bragman and
his allies of severely weakening Democrats both in their dealing
with Republicans over legislation and in this fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won our battles through this speaker,'' said Richard L.
Brodsky, an assemblyman from Westchester. ``We have kept our
majority through this speaker.'' Then, jabbing his finger at
Bragman, who was sitting just a few feet from him, he said: ``If
there's to be healing and progress, this is not the vehicle and
this is not the man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Silver prevailed in an 85-to-63 vote that rejected a
motion to suspend the normal rules of the Assembly in order to
elect a new speaker. Silver received support from seven Nassau
County Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Bragman remained defiant, vowing to form an opposition bloc
that promises to shadow the speaker's every move and weaken his
authority. Bragman has the support of roughly 25 Democrats, who
joined him at a news conference earlier in the day to air their
grievances against Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far from over,'' Bragman said after the vote. ``This
is something that is not going to go away. My guess is that we are
more united than we were before.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments potentially open up a new front in his struggle
with Silver and raise questions about whether Silver can rule the
chamber as firmly as he now does. Silver needs a sizable majority
to control legislation in the Assembly, and Bragman poses a huge
threat to his ability to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden turn of events also raised a tantalizing prospect for
Gov. George Pataki and his Republican allies in the Legislature,
who have been trying to chip away at decades of Democratic control
in the Assembly, particularly since Pataki took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Bragman camp represents a potential ally for Republicans,
who during Pataki's first term tried to pressure individual
Democrats to break ranks with Silver and support the governor's
drive to enact tax cuts, toughen criminal penalties and reduce
government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's allies concede that the speaker is not all that open or
even friendly. But they contend that he runs a far more democratic
house than his critics charge. They say that all major decisions
are discussed in closed-door meetings, where the strategy for the
entire Democratic majority is hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that Silver never forces members to cast votes
that go against their consciences on issues like abortion or the
death penalty. More than that, they say, Silver has done an
excellent job of reaching consensus in an unwieldy and
ideologically diverse conference of 98 Democrats with strongly
competing interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman is one of the few members in the Assembly who is in the
position to mount a strong challenge to the speaker because of the
broad-based support he has developed with conservatives, moderates
and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has worked furiously to stop Bragman since he announced
his plans to topple the speaker on Wednesday. Silver also demoted
two high-ranking lawmakers who openly sided with Bragman, and he
called on powerful union leaders and party officials to discourage
any other Democrats in the Assembly from joining him. Silver also
made it clear that he would punish any member who defied him.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman referred to Silver's response during his comments on the
floor Monday, calling them heavy handed. He said many more
lawmakers would have joined his effort had they ``not feared
reprisals, as was evident in recent days.''

ANDREW CHOA, 76, FORMER BANK EXECUTIVE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Choa, an international banker and professional adviser,
died on May 17 in a hospital in Mount Vernon, Va. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   His family said he had had vascular disease for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Choa came to New York City from Hong Kong in 1945 with a
scholarship to attend Fordham University. He earned a bachelor's
degree there in 1949 and went to the Harvard Business School, where
he received an MBA in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Choa became a United States citizen in 1959 by a special act of
Congress in a bill introduced by John V. Lindsay, the former mayor
of New York who was then a Republican congressman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he became president of the First National City Bank's
overseas division, which handled nonbanking investments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 he became director of Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd. and
led its first initiative in global investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   He advised two Citicorp chairmen, George Moore and Walter
Wriston, in the early stages of the bank's expansion overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Choa joined Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive
recruiting firm, and established its Hong Kong office as the
managing director.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, he was chairman of the Harvard Business School
Alumni Association and president of the International Rotary Club.
</P>
<P>
   Choa retired in 1999 and returned to New York. He is survived by
his wife, France Berveiller Choa; two sons, Christopher and
Gregory, both of Manhattan; a daughter, Veronique Pittman of Great
Falls, Va.; and five grandchildren. &QL;

STATE REMAINS LIABLE FOR HALF OF YONKERS' INTEGRATION COSTS  

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ Rejecting an appeal by New York state, the U.S.
Supreme Court agreed Monday with Yonkers officials that the state
should continue paying half the cost of racially integrating the
city's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, let stand an appellate court's
ruling that the state must share with the city the costs of a
desegregation plan _ about $85 million a year _ that includes
magnet schools and voluntary busing in the city's 26,000-student
school district, the state's fourth largest.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reaffirms earlier court rulings that the state is
partly liable because it ``failed to take corrective measures'' to
desegregate the schools. As a result, New York State will no longer
contest fiscal obligations arising from the original case, which
dates to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the court's decision,'' said Juanita Scarlett, a
spokeswoman for the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Practically speaking, though, the decision is more symbolic than
substantive, since the state has been paying its share of
desegregation costs for the last few years _ albeit under protest.
A far more important and contentious issue is whether the state and
the city should pay as much as $1.1 billion more over eight years
to remedy damage from the ``vestiges of segregation'' _ intangible
effects like disparities in the test scores of white and minority
students.
</P>
<P>
   That issue, now in the hands of Judge Leonard B. Sand, is what
all the parties are gearing up for, possibly by late this summer,
as the next watershed in the tortuous 20-year battle to end racial
segregation here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another footnote,'' said Raymond P. Fitzpatrick
Jr., a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer who represents the City of Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has stirred deep and sometimes unruly passions,
began in 1980 when the federal government sued the city and the
Board of Education, accusing them of intentionally maintaining
racially segregated schools. The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People later joined the suit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Sand, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld
the suit; a year later, he ordered the city to desegregate the
school system by busing thousands of children across town and
creating dozens of magnet programs. He also ordered the city to
build subsidized housing in predominantly white sections.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a federal appellate court ordered the state to pay
some of the costs of court-ordered desegregation. In 1997, the
state challenged that ruling, but the Supreme Court declined to
hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on a separate but closely related track, Sand ordered
the state in 1997 to contribute $575 million over eight years
toward various remedies addressing the results _ rather than the
intent _ of the segregation. The remedies included new curricular
standards, and the recruitment and training of new teachers better
equipped to handle a diverse student body.
</P>
<P>
   And for one school year, 1998-99, the school system did adopt a
budget addressing what the court called the ``vestiges of
segregation,'' with the state footing much of the additional bill,
said Michael Sussman, a lawyer for the NAACP. But that decision is
now on appeal, and the result has plunged the state, the city and
the school board into more budgetary conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The state even tried to excuse itself from financial obligations
for the results of segregation, only to be rebuffed, again, by the

   ``What this does is reaffirm the basic underpinning of the
case,'' said Lawrence Thomas, a lawyer for the Yonkers Board of
Education. ``It makes it very clear that the state is firmly on the
hook for any remedy that's deployed in Yonkers, and that includes
both the earlier remedy, and the proposed remedy with regard to
vestiges.''

CARVER BANCORP ALLOWS 2 DISSIDENTS TO TAKE BOARD SEATS  

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carver Bancorp, the Harlem institution that is the
largest black-run bank in the country, announced Monday that it had
given up its struggle to keep two dissident shareholders off its
board.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the dissidents, who are the owners of the Boston Bank
of Commerce, have agreed to drop a lawsuit against Carver that was
to have gone to trial last week. Carver will pay close to half a
million dollars to help cover their legal costs and will hold an
election next March at which the insurgents can take control of the
bank if they receive enough votes from other shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The legal settlement is just the latest twist in the complex and
bitter fight over the future of the Harlem bank, which has been
trying to recover from financial problems. Carver lost money in its
last fiscal year, and has been classified by regulators as a
troubled institution; its stock price has plunged from $17.50 in
late 1997 to just under $8 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Only three months ago, Carver's executives swore that they could
not tolerate having the Boston Bank officials, Kevin Cohee and Teri
Williams, on the board. Deborah C. Wright, Carver's president, and
David R. Jones, its chairman, have repeatedly said that the Boston
bank is a competitor that has tried to take over Carver, and that
the presence of Cohee and Williams on the board would be
disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the reversal, Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for
Carver, said, ``Well, it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is by no means a truce. Robert Patrick Cooper,
general counsel for the Boston bank, immediately protested Carver's
decision to keep on its board Jones and David N. Dinkins, the
former mayor. The dissidents contend that the two men were defeated
by Cohee and Williams at an election held in February.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, Carver announced that Jones and Dinkins, who
were incumbents, had won by about 30,000 votes out of the 1.7
million cast. But last month, a Delaware judge invalidated about
86,000 votes cast for the incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   In dropping its lawsuit, Boston Bank of Commerce, which is
black-owned, has given up its fight to get Carver to revoke the
sale of $2.5 million of preferred stock to two Wall Street firms
allied with Wright. The deal, announced in January, gave Morgan
Stanley and Provender Capital control of about 8 percent of
Carver's common shares; Boston Bank owns 7.4 percent of Carver's
common.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1948, Carver survived for decades as one of the few
savings banks to serve minority neighborhoods, and its conservative
management kept it going even through the savings and loan crisis
of the 1980's. But the bank made few loans, angering customers as
well as regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, it expanded into auto loans and credit cards,
with bad results. A year ago, the board brought in Wright, the
former president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, to try to
turn the bank around.
</P>
<P>
   Cohee and his supporters have criticized Wright for her lack of
banking experience; she and her supporters have, in turn,
criticized the Boston bank as an interloper without the community
ties that Carver needs.

DIAGEO REPORTED IN TALKS TO BUY PART OF BESTFOODS  

</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON, May 22 _ Diageo PLC, which owns Pillsbury bakery goods
and Haagen-Daz ice cream, is negotiating to buy all or part of
Bestfoods, the maker of Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's
mayonnaise, executives close to the talks said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations come after an $18.4 billion cash offer for
Bestfoods from Unilever, the Dutch-British consumer products
conglomerate that recently bought Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade and
Slim-Fast. That unsolicited offer _ for $66 a share _ was rebuffed,
and Bestfoods has since been seeking another partner to stave off
Unilever's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo is holding trans-Atlantic negotiations with Bestfoods,
based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., in hopes of combining Bestfoods'
bakery business with its own bakery business and possibly spinning
off the newly combined unit into a company that that might be
controlled by Bestfoods' management, the executives said. While
several executives close to the talks called the negotiations
advanced, no agreement has been reached. The executives also
cautioned that the two companies could still abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Diageo rose 11 pence, to 557.75 pence, while Bestfoods
rose 25 cents, to $63.25.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how much Diageo would have to pay for the
Bestfoods bakery business, which provided $1.66 billion of
Bestfoods' $8.64 billion in sales in 1999. If Diageo proceeds with
the acquisition, the deal would put such household brands as
Pillsbury, Entenmann's, Thomas' English muffins and Friehofer's
breads under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo's other businesses include, among others, Burger King,
Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Tanqueray. It had annual sales of
$16.3 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever has continued to press the Bestfoods board to hold
talks, though those requests have been spurned. Unilever could
still decide to raise its bid, executives close to the company
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   And Bestfoods has set up several ``poison pill'' provisions and
other hurdles to protect it from hostile takeover attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in acquiring Bestfoods is being driven by the raft of
consolidation in the supermarket business, leaving companies that
have food manufacturing arms like Diageo with little leverage and
control over pricing their goods, forcing margins down.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, it was reported that Bestfoods was in talks with H.J.
Heinz. At the time, Bestfoods denied any conversations were in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   A Bestfoods spokesman said the company had no comment on talks
with Diageo. In rejecting the Unilever offer earlier this month,
Bestfoods indicated that the price was too low and added ``it is
not opportune to consider a sale of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, executives from Unilever and Bestfoods have been
busy making their cases to Wall Street analysts and investors.
Bestfoods has scoffed at Unilever's claim that it could trim $500
million in costs by combining the two companies. Bestfoods
executives put the potential savings at $1 billion, which some
analysts think is an argument for consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   The Unilever offer for Bestfoods, which is considered to have
one of the best-performing international food businesses,
particularly in Latin America, signaled the start of what could
turn out to be a wave of mergers in the food industry. Investors
have been impatient with the sector's slow growth and lackluster
returns, and some believe merging companies could produce cost
savings and speedier product innovation, as well as give the new
company more power in negotiations for retail shelf space than two
smaller companies would have on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco brands, which include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and
LifeSavers candy, are also on the block as Nabisco Group Holdings,
the holding company that owns 80.6 percent of Nabisco stock, seeks
a buyer. Possible contenders include Philip Morris, the tobacco and
packaged-food giant, which already owns Kraft Foods; and Groupe
Danone, the French foodmaker that bought Nabisco's European cookie
business in 1992.
