	Prosecutors Say Lewinsky Helpful  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors interviewed Monica Lewinsky  
for nearly two hours today and said the session was productive. ``I 
believe she would be a witness that would help them determine the 
truth,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R-Fla., said Ms. Lewinsky ``might be a very helpful witness to the 
Senate if called.'' Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Plato Cacheris, said 
his client ``was candid, forthright and extremely truthful'' and 
``added nothing to the record that is already sitting before the 
Senate right now.'' He urged the managers to tell their colleagues 
that it is unnecessary to call Ms. Lewinsky as a witness, so that 
her ``long nightmare'' could come to an end.

	Senators Urge End to Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators from both parties, agreeing that  
President Clinton will not be convicted, expressed hope today for 
an early end to the impeachment trial and said this week's vote on 
whether to question witnesses could be a turning point. Of 21 
senators, more than one-fifth of the Senate, appearing on today's 
news programs, there was much unanimity on key issues -- a motion to 
dismiss this week will fail, the vote on witnesses will be close 
and there is now nowhere near the 67 votes needed to remove Clinton 
from office.

	Welfare Hits 30-Year Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people on welfare has fallen to  
its lowest level in 30 years, President Clinton will announce 
tomorrow. Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on 
welfare at the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million 
in 1994. Clinton will also offer a package of programs aimed at 
helping more people get jobs and encouraging businesses to continue 
hiring them.

	Iraq Storms Out of Arab Conference  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Arab foreign ministers today refused Iraq's  
demands to strongly condemn U.N. sanctions and last month's 
U.S.-British airstrikes on the country, prompting Iraq to storm out 
of the session. A statement agreed on by the Arab ministers pledged 
to work for the lifting of the sanctions, but only expressed ``deep 
concern at the use of the military option against Iraq,'' instead 
of denouncing the attacks as ``aggression,'' as Baghdad wanted. 
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf walked out in anger 
saying he did not want to take part ``in this rotting mire.''

	Olympic Leaders Recommend Expulsions  
</P>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic leaders recommended the  
expulsions of six IOC members today in an unprecedented purge 
linked to the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the 
games. The embattled president of the International Olympic 
Committee said the action was aimed at ending ``the ugliest chapter 
in the history'' of the world's biggest sports event. IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch said those games would stay in Salt Lake and 
Sydney would keep the 2000 Summer Olympics.

	Gene Linked to Cigarette Addiction  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have identified another gene that  
might affect how vulnerable a person is to cigarette addiction. The 
finding may help researchers develop new ways to stop smoking. 
Having a certain form of the gene makes it easier to kick the 
habit, or perhaps to avoid getting hooked in the first place, two 
studies suggest. But that apparent influence is modest. It's at 
least the third gene to show evidence of an effect on smoking.

	Golden Globes To Be Awarded Tonight  
</P>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The  
Truman Show'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' are the leading 
contenders at tonight's 56th Golden Globes. ``Shakespeare'' and 
``Truman'' led the movie field with six nominations each, while 
``Ryan'' had six. ``Bulworth,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and 
Monsters'' and ``Little Voice'' had three nominations apiece. The 
Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood Foreign 
Press Association, are awarded for both film and television in a 
nationally televised ceremony.

	Duval Matches PGA Record With 59  
</P>
<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- David Duval matched the lowest round in  
PGA Tour history today by shooting a 13-under-par 59 to win the Bob 
Hope Desert Classic at 26-under. After making 11 birdies, Duval 
capped his day by ramming an 8-foot eagle putt into the center of 
the cup on No. 18. Steve Pate went to 25-under with a birdie on No. 
16, but parred the final two holes to come up one stroke short of 
Duval.

	Pacers Beat Bulls in Exhibition  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls got their first taste of life  
without Michael, Scottie and Dennis, losing to the Indiana Pacers 
79-71 today in the NBA's opening preseason game following the end 
of the lockout. Reggie Miller and Rik Smits scored 12 points each 
to lead the Pacers, who stayed together during the lockout so they 
could play together for a run at a championship.

	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- Koji Takasawa of Japan led the jumping  
and held on Sunday, despite a steady rain, to win the third World 
Cup-B nordic combined event in four days in this Olympic village.

<HEADLINE> Jet Test Kills Airplane Mechanic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three weeks before his retirement, a 71-year-old  
airplane mechanic died when he was crushed by the wing slat of a 
Boeing 727. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Gonzalez, a worker with an airplane maintenance company,  
was repairing the jet's wing Saturday at Miami International 
Airport when a crew began conducting tests on the same plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the other crew inspected the airplane owned by  
delivery company DHL to make sure no one was in the way. When they 
tested the wing slat, which lets pilots control the jet's speed, it 
crushed Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation, with help from the National Transportation  
Safety Board, was not yet complete. Preliminary findings indicated 
the death was accidental, said police Detective Brett Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez's son, Alfredo Gonzalez, said his father was looking  
forward to retirement and expected to be sworn in as a U.S. citizen 
within the next year.

<HEADLINE> Sellers' Execution Reignites Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Three months before he turns 30, Sean  
Sellers is slated to become the first American in four decades put 
to death for a crime committed when he was barely old enough to 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The former teen-age satanist's Feb. 4 execution date for the  
murders of his mother, his stepfather and a convenience store clerk 
has revitalized the debate over how young is too young to pay the 
ultimate price for taking a life. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue of executing juveniles has been controversial. It's  
controversial in the international forum, and the U.S. stands alone 
in insisting on these executions,'' said Richard Deiter, executive 
director of the National Death Penalty Information Center, an 
anti-capital punishment organization in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been 40 years since we crossed that line.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sellers was 16 years old when he killed. The last time anyone  
died for crimes committed at that age was April 10, 1959, when 
Maryland executed Leonard M. Shockley. Since the death penalty was 
reinstated in 1976, Deiter said, 12 people have been put to death 
for crimes committed at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, death rows now hold 16 offenders who murdered when  
they were 16 years old and 54 more who committed their crimes at 
age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Age will be an issue when Sellers goes before the Oklahoma  
Pardon and Parole Board for a clemency hearing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His supporters say he shouldn't die for crimes committed as a  
teen. They also point to a diagnosis of multiple personality 
disorder made after Sellers' conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Steve Presson, plans to base much of his argument  
on the multiple personality diagnosis but agrees ``the age issue is 
relevant here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We all look for why something happened, and a 16-year-old boy  
ravaged with multiple personality disorder who was a good student 
at school and inexplicably committed these crimes... Something went 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers, now a Christian involved in outreach ministries from  
his death row cell, once worshipped the occult. At his trial, the 
defense said Sellers was addicted to the game ``Dungeons &AMP; 
Dragons'' and it dictated his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Detective Ron Mitchell said a satanic bible, altar,  
writings and drawings were found in Sellers' bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 23 years since the Supreme Court restored capital  
punishment, the Oklahoma parole board has never recommended 
clemency. Any such recommendation in this case would have to be 
approved by Gov. Frank Keating, who supports the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Drew Edmondson's office will argue against  
clemency. He said Sellers' age vs. sentence had already been 
weighed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The age of the defendant is properly something the jury should  
take into account when deciding the death penalty,'' he said. ``The 
place for different treatment was at the trial. A good number of 
young people commit homicides that are not given the death 
penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curiously, another Oklahoma case helped shape the Supreme Court  
decisions that set 16 as the minimum age at which defendants can be 
condemned. William Wayne Thompson was 15 in January 1983 when he 
helped beat and shoot to death his allegedly abusive former 
brother-in-law, whose body was dumped into the Washita River in 
southwestern Oklahoma. Thompson was sentenced to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court overturned the sentence in 1988, declaring the  
execution of a 15-year-old unconstitutional. Justices concluded, 
``It would offend civilized standards of decency to execute a 
person who was less than 16 years old at the time of his or her 
offense.'' Thompson's sentence was commuted to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers was four months past his 16th birthday when he and a  
friend stopped at an Oklahoma City convenience store Sept. 8, 1985. 
Displaying a handgun taken from his friend's grandfather's house, 
Sellers told his companion, ``I want to see what it feels like to 
kill somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, 32-year-old clerk Robert Bower was raising a cup of  
coffee to his lips when he was shot once, then again. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months passed as police exhausted lead after lead in  
searching for Bower's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 5, 1986, Sellers killed again. This time, the targets  
were his mother, Vonda Bellofatto, 32, and stepfather, Paul 
Bellofatto, 43. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed only in his underwear, Sellers crept into their bedroom  
after midnight. He shot his stepfather in the head with 
Bellofatto's .44-caliber Magnum revolver, then shot his mother. As 
Mrs. Bellofatto rose slightly, he shot her again. 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, he staged discovering the bodies. When police  
arrived, Sellers was waiting with the friend who's been with him at 
the convenience store. The same morning, police got a call from a 
13-year-old who said she'd heard Sellers had stabbed the clerk in 
September. They initially dismissed the information because Bower 
had been shot. But as they drove the friend home, detectives 
mentioned the convenience store homicide and a possible link to 
Sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our shock,'' Mitchell said, the friend acknowledged he had  
been there and that Sellers had killed Bower. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmondson said the gap between the slayings likely went against  
Sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without doubt, they weighed against his age the fact that he  
committed multiple murders a distance apart in time,'' the district 
attorney said. ``So he had an opportunity to reflect on the murder 
of the store clerk for weeks before he murdered his mother and 
stepfather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers refused to talk to police after calling them to report  
his parents' murders. But in recent years, on a run by supporters, 
he has apologized for his crimes and written that he doesn't know 
what motivated him to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	One Website article was entitled ``My Confession.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I promptly made a copy of it and stuck it in our file,''  
Mitchell said. ``At least we have a confession in our file.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Up 40 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 40.1  
percent in 1998 from the previous year, the government announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported  
by Japan minus those imported, grew to $121.8 billion in 1998, the 
Ministry of Finance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United  
States also increased, rising 33.4 percent to $58.3 billion in 
1998, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The steady climb in the surplus reflects consumers' reluctance  
to spend amid Japan's worst recession in decades. That has cut 
demand for imports and made Japanese manufacturers increasingly 
reliant on sales overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been under heavy pressure from the U.S. and other  
trading partners to rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak 
economy and spurring demand for imports.

<HEADLINE> Small Crowd for Bulls Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ray Clay's familiar voice boomed across the  
United Center, but this time he changed the introduction. And with 
good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Chicago Bulls,'' he announced  
before the opening tip as thumping music greeted what remains of 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, as he had done so many times the last three years,  
Clay proclaims the team ``Your World Champion Chicago Bulls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But these were no world champions.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman were missing. A  
new coach, Tim Floyd, was in the seat once occupied by Phil 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA was playing basketball again, its scaled-down exhibition  
season beginning with the Bulls-Pacers game. And despite free 
tickets, as part of the NBA's initiative to win back fans, there 
were empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 18,000 free tickets were sent to season-ticket holders and  
another 3,000 to charities, but still the United Center was not 
full. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans were given T-shirts proclaiming the Bulls' six  
championships as they came through the gates. Some used them to get 
autographs. Players, well aware of the need to be fan-friendly, 
graciously signed. Pacers players were even signing Bulls shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	But how many fans, turned off by the lockout and jolted by the  
retirement of Jordan, will return when the tickets aren't free? 
</P>
<P>
	Center Bill Wennington, a holdover from the last three  
championship teams, went to the center of the floor with a 
microphone before the game and made a pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was dubbed the last dance,'' Wennington said. ``This  
year is a lot like a first dance. And like a first dance, our 
footwork and chemistry might not be there at first. But give us a 
little time and we'll get it together. All the players are happy to 
back playing basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Lippolis of Glen Ellyn, Ill., a regional sales manager and  
corporate ticket holder with Kraft Foods, which leases a skybox, 
said the real test of the Bulls' ability to draw fans won't come 
until next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get an 82-game schedule that's when it may be a  
little tough for customers to still want to come out and get 
excited about the Bulls,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted some lingering resentment, both in Chicago and  
across the NBA, as the we-miss-Michael period plays out the next 
couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to take a couple of years to get the fans  
back to where they had the same level of enthusiasm,'' he said. 
``And, now with Michael gone, it's probably going to lengthen that 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she headed toward the steps for the higher reaches of the  
third level, Mary Berry of Chicago and her 14-year-old grandson 
Curtis were about to see their first NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
	She had stood in line to get free tickets for a scrimmage  
Friday. This time she received her tickets from a friend, who in 
turn got them from her boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (Jordan and Pippen) had to go sooner or later,'' Berry  
said. ``If they were still here, we probably wouldn't have gotten a 
chance to see this game. The tickets are so high. We're just 
lucky.'' Upper level seats run in the $30 range. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty LaRue, a second-year guard for the Bulls, had a close-up  
reminder of the past. He dressed in what was once the most famous 
locker in basketball. The stylish clothes Jordan wore to every game 
had been replaced by LaRue's more casual attire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not by choice. It was by default,'' a grinning LaRue  
said, sitting in what was Jordan's chair. ``It's just where my 
stuff was hung. I'm just hoping something will rub off.''

<HEADLINE> After 70, What's Next for McGwire? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The pressure already is on Mark McGwire to top  
himself, now that even his own manager has raised the bar of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa predicted at a weekend  
luncheon that McGwire could hit 75 home runs next season. In 
private he maintained he was kidding, but he certainly seemed 
serious enough when he said it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-five, his number, times three, is 75. And I think  
that's what he's going to do this year,'' La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, La Russa wondered how many home runs baseball's  
premier slugger could have belted last season if only he hadn't 
also drawn a National League-record 162 walks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on whether they pitch to him,'' La Russa said.  
``If they give him enough at-bats, the sky is the limit with Mac. 
Are they going to give him enough at bats? I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's such a good hitter that he has a chance to do amazing  
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lofty prediction didn't bother McGwire.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love challenges,'' he said. ``I think we all know he was  
joking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, like La Russa, he proceeded to consider the possibilities.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I look back at last year and look at the numbers, 162  
walks and I hit 70 home runs, I mean, I amaze myself,'' McGwire 
said. ``I'm in awe that I did what I did. 
</P>
<P>
	``One hundred sixty-two walks is a lot of walks, that's not a  
lot of pitches to hit. Everybody thought getting to 60 or 61 would 
be a feat and I can only imagine the pressure to go 10 more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was the headline attraction at the team's ``Winter  
Warmup'' charity fundraising event for fans, signing about 250 
autographs for lucky raffle winners and attracting a huge crowd of 
onlookers throughout the two-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some stars who sign like robots, McGwire also took the  
time to chat with his admirers, especially the children. He said 
he's always been that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a second to look somebody in the eye and say `Thank  
you, and how's your day,' '' McGwire said. ``It goes a long ways. 
The kids were so cute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he hasn't changed since his record-smashing year  
but his life has. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I can't go anywhere without being recognized,'' he  
said. ``I thought it would be sort of easy living in Southern 
California and getting away with it, but it turns out no. It's been 
an interesting winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's had a lot of fun, too. A highlight of his time off was  
appearing on ``The Late Show With David Letterman,'' where he 
appeared more jittery than at any time during his record chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I was a little amped,'' McGwire said with a chuckle. ``I  
was nervous. You're out of your element, you know?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other highlights were visits with actors Robin Williams and Sean  
Pean, and an acting stint on an episode of ``Mad About You'' that 
airs Feb. 22. He's always been a big fan of the show and a bonus 
was a screen kiss with co-star Helen Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be persuaded to do it, because it wasn't my cup of  
tea,'' McGwire said. ``But I got to kiss Helen, so what the heck? I 
didn't mess up. That's all I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen teammates and former Cardinals players,  
including Hall of Famers Bob Gibson, Lou Brock and Red 
Schoendienst, signed autographs to raise money for the team's 
charity, Cardinal Care. The event is expect to top last year's 
total of $267,000.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Continue Historic Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices fell to a new all-time  
low as drivers cut back on their winter travel and a worldwide 
supply glut continued, an industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average weighted retail price for all grades was $1.0235 per  
gallon on Friday. That was .65 of a cent below the 
inflation-adjusted low of $1.03 which set the previous record two 
weeks ago, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gasoline market is in its winter doldrums because demand  
is off, as it always is this time of year, and low crude prices are 
holding down all petroleum product prices,'' analyst Trilby 
Lundberg said. ``There's no end in sight to the historically low 
prices that motorists are paying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She predicted prices will remain low in the coming weeks unless  
there is a substantial change in the supply and demand of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would take either healthier economies among countries in  
distress around the world -- which would bring crude oil prices back 
up -- or heavy spring driving, which would cut the oversupply of gas 
to really change the price at the pump,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices varied dramatically nationwide, with drivers in  
Tulsa, Okla., paying a low of 79 cents per gallon for self-serve 
regular while drivers in Honolulu shelled out more than $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Average prices at self-service stations were 96.26 cents per  
gallon for regular gasoline, $1.0726 for mid-grade and $1.1573 for 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.4212 for regular, $1.5128 for  
mid-grade and $1.5846 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Hits 30-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people on welfare has fallen to  
its lowest level in 30 years, President Clinton will announce 
Monday. But the new figures also show the dramatic declines of 
recent years are beginning to slow in certain states. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will also offer a package of programs aimed at  
helping more people get to jobs and encouraging businesses to 
continue hiring them. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at  
the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. 
But state officials and academics alike have long cautioned that, 
at some point, nearly all the people who can move off welfare with 
relative ease will have left. That will leave those with deeper 
problems like substance abuse, domestic violence and very little 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``With welfare reform, the more you succeed, the harder the job  
becomes,'' said Don Winstead, who heads Florida's welfare reform 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hopes to make that job easier. Administration officials  
said he will announce proposals included in the budget he will 
submit to Congress next month, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$1 billion to help 200,000 long-term welfare recipients in  
high-poverty areas move to work. It's the continuation of a 
two-year-old program with a new requirement that 20 percent be used 
for low-income fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	--$430 million to give 75,000 housing vouchers that help people  
on welfare move closer to a new job. 
</P>
<P>
	--$150 million in transportation money to help people get to  
jobs, often in suburbs not served by public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	--$530 million to extend the tax credit for businesses that hire  
people off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did in his State of the Union address, the president will  
also trumpet the falling welfare numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a national basis, the caseload drop has been remarkably  
steady,'' said Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	But the figures show the drops in some states may have begun to  
slow in the final quarter of fiscal year 1998. In at least eight 
states, most of which have seen incredible drops since 1993, the 
reductions slowed to a trickle in July, August and September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a difference between the first three quarters of the  
year and the last quarter of the year,'' said Michael Kharfen, a 
Department of Health and Human Services spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say they are preparing to serve welfare  
recipients with tougher problems, moving beyond the ``work first'' 
approach that helps recipients look for work and then pushes them 
to take any job they can find. Under work first, states don't try 
to solve every problem or get people the education they may need. 
They simply try to find them jobs, reasoning that work experience 
will help them move up the economic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	But that isn't enough for everyone, state officials say.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're past the situation where someone comes in who may need a  
little bit of confidence building, who may need a brush-up on 
skills and may need a new battery for the car -- all things we can 
do,'' said John Garlinger of the Kansas Department of Social and 
Rehabilitation Services. ``We are left with the hard-core people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas has cut its welfare rolls by 62 percent since 1993, but  
by the end of the last fiscal year, healthy quarterly drops of 8 to 
10 percent fell to just 1.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states seeing dropoffs include Arizona, Arkansas,  
Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and North Carolina. New Mexico, 
after nearly cutting its roles in half, actually saw a 40 percent 
increase during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Seasonal variations may explain some of it. In Massachusetts,  
the rolls always stay higher near September, when the state gives 
clothing vouchers for every child on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But other states say they have begun to ``bottom out.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that after that wave of families went off the rolls,  
the somewhat harder work would begin,'' said Joe Quinn, spokesman 
for the Arkansas Department of Human Services. In Arkansas, the 
rolls fell just 2.7 percent in the last quarter after drops of 
about 9 percent in previous quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kansas, officials are working with community mental health  
centers to aid people with substance abuse problems. They are 
screening for learning disabilities and training caseworkers to 
spot victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare reform for the National  
Conference of State Legislatures, said states are financially 
prepared to work with harder-to-serve people -- because of the money 
saved from fewer people getting checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, Clinton's adviser, isn't convinced the decrease has  
slowed, but says the president's proposals will help when it 
inevitably does. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people thought we'd hit that point a long time ago,''  
he said, ``and more of the people on welfare have responded more 
quickly than anyone anticipated.''

<HEADLINE> Key Dates for Popular Drug Prozac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A glance at key dates for Prozac:  
</P>
<P>
	1983 -- Eli Lilly and Co. submits an application to the Food and  
Drug Administration to sell Prozac for the treatment of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	1987 -- FDA approves application in December.  
</P>
<P>
	1988 -- Lilly begins U.S. sales.  
</P>
<P>
	1989 -- Prozac-user Joseph Wesbecher shoots 27 people, seven of  
them fatally, at a Louisville, Ky., printing plant before killing 
himself. A jury eventually would find the drug did not cause 
Wesbecher's rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	1990 -- Harvard researchers published a study showing some Prozac  
patients suffered suicidal thoughts. Subsequent attacks on the 
drug's safety by the Church of Scientology help prompt Lilly to 
make a standing offer to defend any doctor who prescribes the drug. 
Lilly also helps prosecutors battle the so-called ``Prozac 
defense'' in which dozens of criminal defendants attribute their 
misdeeds to the drug's effect on their thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	1992 -- Annual worldwide sales of Prozac top $1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	1995 -- Barr Laboratories, saying the Prozac patents are flawed,  
asks the Food and Drug Administration for permission to sell a 
generic version of Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	1996 -- Lilly files patent infringement lawsuit against Barr in  
U.S. District Court. A separate lawsuit against Geneva 
Pharmaceuitcals later is consolidated with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday -- Trial on the lawsuit set to begin. Pending are Lilly's  
patent infringement cases against three other generic drug 
companies, Zenith-Goldline, Teva and Reddy-Cheminor.

<HEADLINE> Canucks May Fire Coach Keenan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Mike Keenan, the gypsy coach  
who has won 506 games with five NHL teams, appears to be on the 
move again. 
</P>
<P>
	He was to meet with Vancouver Canucks general manager Brian  
Burke on Sunday, amid reports that Keenan would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke, who had been attending the All-Star festivities in Tampa,  
Fla., flew to Vancouver Saturday night to meet with Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan was expected to be replaced by Marc Crawford, who coached  
the Colorado Avalanche to the 1996 Stanley Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver Province newspaper and CKNW radio, without citing  
sources, reported that Keenan would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	After saying Saturday that he still was the Canucks coach,  
Keenan seemed resolved that the reports were true, telling CKNW 
later, ``I'm assuming it's a fait accompli.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan's dismissal would come a week after the Canucks traded  
all-tar holdout Pavel Bure to the Florida Panthers, and as the team 
reached the All-Star break with a 15-24-6 record, having won only 
twice in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan is five games short of coaching his 1,000th game, which  
puts him fifth among all NHL coaches. His 506 victories also are 
fifth on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke was said to be unhappy with his coach since becoming the  
Canucks' president and GM last June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, without citing sources, said Burke was displeased  
because the team's young players weren't developing properly; that 
players had complained about not working on special teams during 
practice, and he doesn't take advantage of his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	There also have been suggestions of friction within the team  
because Keenan scheduled a team practice on the eve of the All-Star 
break, but allowed Mark Messier, the Canucks captain, to skip the 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks hired Keenan to replace Tom Renney, a week after the  
club also dismissed president and general manager Pat Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan's role was eventually expanded to make trades last  
January, after which he began making wholesale changes to rebuild 
the Canucks. Over a two-month span, Keenan swung 10 trades, 
including a three-player deal that sent ex-Canucks captain Trevor 
Linden to the New York Islanders in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan won a Stanley Cup with the 1994 New York Rangers and took  
the Philadelphia Flyers and Chicago Blackhawks to the finals during 
his 15-year career. He also has coached at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford stepped down as the Avalanche's coach last spring after  
Colorado was knocked out of the first round of the Stanley Cup 
playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Colleges Expanding Overseas Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- With U.S. corporations briskly engaged in the  
global economy, can America's colleges and universities be far 
behind? 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Maryland runs a full-scale residential campus  
in Germany. Boston University has an expanding foothold in Paris. 
And New York University President Jay Oliva says his institution is 
striving to become ``the quintessential global university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time was when American students overseas spent a carefree year  
learning a language and absorbing culture at a foreign university, 
with a bit of fun travel on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	The Junior Year Abroad is still alive and well, but things have  
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more U.S. universities are offering their own programs  
and courses rather than just registering their students at foreign 
universities and giving them credit toward their U.S. degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Some American schools have set up their own satellite programs,  
with facilities for semester or yearlong stays at regular campuses, 
and some even offer full four-year programs leading to 
undergraduate degrees, plans that also are attracting foreign 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional and graduate programs overseas are on the rise,  
too, especially those offering MBA degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The new approach reflects the changing demands of American  
students who are concentrating on skills for the job market. 
Although enrollment in language study has fallen back home at U.S. 
schools, an increasing number of students are going abroad to study 
foreign languages, cultures and business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over 64,000 Americans enrolled in study abroad programs in  
Europe in the 1996-97 school year, compared to 47,000 a decade 
earlier, the Institute for International Education in New York 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	For students in Boston University's Paris program, school is a  
handful of basement rooms where they attend classes and check their 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The facilities look a lot like those on Commonwealth Avenue back  
in Boston -- except for the smoky cafe on the corner and the nearby 
Metro line that whooshes past the Eiffel Tower. 
</P>
<P>
	But the program doesn't leave much time for sipping cafe au  
lait, or even seeing the sights. After completing three courses in 
eight weeks, BU students set off on an internship, where some work 
40 to 50 hours a week in a totally French environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main objective for our students to come to France is  
professional, not just because French is a pretty language,'' said 
Gerald Honigsblum, director of the BU program. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of students at Boston University's Paris program has  
tripled over the last four years to about 60 students, largely 
because of the internship. 
</P>
<P>
	``What comes out is better French. We've demystified the  
acquisition of French,'' Honigsblum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintaining an independent overseas program is prestigious but  
expensive, and many U.S. universities end up sharing space, 
especially in expensive cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Spain, the International Institute houses programs run by top  
American schools, including New York University, Middlebury College 
and Vassar, in a 90-year-old building with a 75,000-volume library, 
cafeteria and garden in downtown Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, American college students still troop through Reid  
Hall, which houses about a dozen U.S. study programs in the heart 
of the Left Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Most American universities regard overseas programs as a  
supplement -- not a substitute -- to a U.S.-based degree program, but 
some have started full-fledged satellite programs abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Maryland is one of the few American  
institutions to have a complete residential campus in Europe, at 
Schwaebish Gmuend in southwestern Germany. Many of its students are 
non-American, who want an American education without going all the 
way to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kunan Arora, 20, chose the University of Maryland because he  
feels he's getting a more practical education than in Germany or 
his native India, where he says much of the learning is 
theoretical. 
</P>
<P>
	A business management major, Arora also says he likes the  
international atmosphere at Schwaebish Gmuend. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many cultures and countries represented here,''  
he said. ``To learn about them ... to understand their language 
will be really helpful to me later in the business world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studying at U.S.-affiliated programs abroad is also good value.  
</P>
<P>
	``The students get more for their money,'' said Elena Granger  
Carrasco, director of New York University's campus in Madrid. 
``They save money on room and board and have all the advantages of 
living and studying abroad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps nowhere is the hunger for American-style education  
greater than in the former Soviet bloc, where until the collapse of 
communism, exchange programs were severely restricted. Eastern 
European students had virtually no chance of receiving a U.S. 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	With this school year, the State University of New York opened a  
program in Prague, capital of the Czech Republic, offering a 
four-year degree in business or public administration. Of the 62 
students enrolled, 50 are Czechs and just two are Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our students spent a year in an American high school  
and they consider our program to be more competitive for their 
future,'' said Lenka Dvorakova, the Prague-based administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	But programs in Russia have trouble because of chronic political  
and economic uncertainty, as well as crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the financial crisis in Russia forced Stanford  
University to close its 5-year-old Moscow campus after the school 
was unable to convert dollars into rubles to pay its bills.

<HEADLINE> Fossil Hunter Relishes Lab Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Paleontologist John Hoganson delights in  
the dig, but North Dakota's long winters leave only a brief period 
for fossil excavations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the snow flies, we're pretty much shut down,'' Hoganson  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, that is.  
</P>
<P>
	Inside, the fossil hunter fills the harsh months with research  
and writing. He prepares exhibits and braces for incursions by 
aggressive fossil poachers. He also whiles away the winter months 
examining the last summer's finds. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are a very important part of our job here: to bring this  
information before the public,'' says Hoganson, who has worked for 
17 years for the North Dakota Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	While mining for fossils in western North Dakota's badlands  
smacks of high adventure, it's in the lab where Hoganson relishes 
the scientific dimension of his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like it all,'' Hoganson says. ``This area is very  
important from a scientific perspective because it has some rocks 
that are exposed that contain fossils that aren't found very many 
places anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the best finds in recent years have included the fairly  
complete fossilized remains of a young triceratops from 65 million 
years ago, giant crocodiles from 55 million years ago and a 
75-million-year-old marine lizard known as a mosasaur. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoganson says he only gets about two months of digging time a  
year. When chilly winds start to blow across the prairie, Hoganson 
retreats to work amid dusty old drawers and cabinets in North 
Dakota's Heritage Center. Inside his basement lab, prized finds are 
stretched out on tables. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Hoganson is still aglow over what he calls North  
Dakota's most important find so far: a mosasaur. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoganson says it's the first one of its kind found anywhere in  
the world. A plumber and an electrician uncovered it in 1995, in 
Cooperstown, N.D. Hoganson and his assistant, John Campbell, are 
still piecing it together. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding plunged Hoganson into one of the time-consuming  
tasks that occupies him during the winter months. He took 
measurements, cleaned the specimen, snapped photos and wrote 
articles for scientists and laymen. 
</P>
<P>
	He gathers the information in a state fossil database, which  
contains details on thousands of specimens unearthed in North 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just have a fossil and you don't have any of that  
information, the fossil becomes nothing more than a curiosity 
rather than an important scientific object,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoganson, who is 50, earned his doctorate at the University of  
North Dakota in geology with an emphasis on paleontology. He holds 
a master's in geology from the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the Heritage Center, Hoganson organizes exhibits and  
outreach groups throughout the state. The paleontologist turns 
teacher, hoping to spark the light of scientific inquiry in the 
minds of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really rewarding to see these kids' eyes really sparkle  
when you have the Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth that's found 20 miles 
from Bismarck, and that's in their hand,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long ago, a North Dakotan would have to travel to the  
Smithsonian Institute in Washington to see prehistoric fossils on 
display. Now, there are several exhibits throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota made a commitment to preserving its wealth of  
fossils in 1989, when the legislature passed a fossil protection 
law. Through a permit process, Hoganson helps regulate who digs for 
what on public land. Any fossil found on public land belongs to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	He has helped form agreements with federal agencies, such as the  
U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps 
of Engineers, so that the state will work with them on fossils 
found on federal land in North Dakota.

	But fossils found on private property belong to the landowner.  
That's problematic because of the market value of some fossils as 
hard times in agriculture continue, Hoganson says. Commercial 
contractors have been making deals with landowners to remove 
fossils from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't blame these people, but it's creating problems for  
us, I think, and we're losing those specimens from the state,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoganson says the state got lucky with the mosasaur, which was  
discovered on private land but donated to the state by the 
landowner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the awareness of our fossil resources has  
increased dramatically since this Bismarck-based program was 
initiated in 1989,'' he says. ``We think we've done quite a bit in 
the last ten years, and we hope to do a lot more in the next 10 
years.''

<HEADLINE> Harris, Redgrave Win Golden Globes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Gwyneth Paltrow of ``Shakespeare In  
Love'' and Michael Caine were honored Sunday for motion picture 
acting, and Michael J. Fox was a funny but poignant winner for TV 
comedy actor at the Golden Globes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Harris of ``The Truman Show'' and Lynn Redgrave of ``Gods and  
Monsters'' won motion picture supporting actor honors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes honorees lived up to the irreverence for which  
the show has become known, but Fox's acceptance speech added a 
touching note. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Spin City'' star, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's  
disease, thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up 
his brain. ``We're so lucky to do what we do ... and just take 
every day and enjoy it,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow played the upper-crust lady who becomes the lover and  
muse of William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which also 
won best screenplay. In ``Little Voice,'' Caine played a sleazy 
agent who tries to turn a meek woman with powerful musical gift for 
show tunes into a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said as he picked up his honor. ``My  
career must be slipping. This is the first time I've been available 
to pick up an award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``The Truman Show'' were the leading  
movie nominees, with six apiece. ``Saving Private Ryan'' followed 
with five. ``Bulworth,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' and 
``Little Voice'' had three nominations apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued  
by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show  
by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man, 
I just got through eating dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage he noted that ``The Truman Show'' came out in the  
summer, long before studios traditionally roll out their 
award-worthy product. ``I'm glad that people didn't forget about 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redgrave, who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging  
horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32 
years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been 
crying out for a friend ever since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the television categories, Dylan McDermott of ``The  
Practice'' and Keri Russel of ``Felicity'' were named best actor 
and actress, respectively in television dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenna Elfman won best actress in a TV musical or comedy series  
for ``Dharma and Greg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hanks, nominated for as best actor in ``Saving Private  
Ryan,'' picked up an early honor for his ``From the Earth to the 
Moon,'' which won best miniseries or movie made for TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelina Jolie won best actress in a miniseries or TV movie for  
``Gia,'' which also earned Faye Dunaway an award for supporting 
actress in a series, miniseries or TV movie. The latter category 
was a tie, with Camryn Manheim of ``The Practice'' picking up the 
other award. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Tucci of ``Winchell'' won best actor in a miniseries or  
TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
	In another tie, Don Cheadle of ``The Rat Pack'' and veteran  
actor Gregory Peck of ``Moby Dick'' shared the award for supporting 
actor in a series, miniseries or TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won one of these in 1947 and it was very encouraging, and  
it's very encouraging now,'' Peck deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood  
Foreign Press Association, are awarded for both film and television 
in a nationally televised ceremony in a hotel ballroom in what can 
be a much more colorful affair than the stuffy Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone, Christine Lahti was in the bathroom when she  
was announced as a winner for ``Chicago Hope.'' This year she 
showed up as a presenter with toilet paper stuck to a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes traditionally serve as predictors for the  
Academy Awards in March. In the last 16 years, 12 films that won 
best motion picture honors at the Golden Globes went on to take the 
same prize at the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards also provide a valuable promotional tool for studios.  
The morning after the ceremony, newspaper advertisements for films 
trumpet their Golden Globe hauls. 
</P>
<P>
	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was  
honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his ``outstanding 
contribution to the entertainment field.'' Nicholson has been 
nominated for 14 Globes and won five. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fourth straight year, NBC dedicated three hours of  
prime-time to the awards, reflecting how far the ceremony has come 
in prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards had once been buffeted by controversy over  
allegations of corrupt voting and long suffered credibility 
problems, with the lowlight being the 1981 event that awarded Pia 
Zadora a statue for the bomb ``Butterfly.'' Networks refused to 
show the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The association worked to regain respectability. In 1996, after  
a 14-year absence from network exposure, the program was back on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, NBC asked Golden Globe voters to sign waivers  
indicating they did not accept gifts or perks from Hollywood 
studios, the Washington Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Press Association President Helmut Voss said the waivers  
indicated ``during our journalistic activities, including 
out-of-town travel, that we did not accept any gifts other than 
those that are the customary promotional gifts of the studios.''

<HEADLINE> Management Blamed in Merger Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- The planned merger between  
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and British Aerospace collapsed when the 
companies couldn't agree on how to share top management jobs, the 
chief of the German firm was quoted as saying Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The breaking point wasn't economics. ... The snag was the  
leadership question. Where there are two top jobs, then one of them 
must go to us,'' DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) chief Manfred 
Bischoff said in an interview published by news magazine Der 
Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are no sellers-out of German interests. And for that reason  
we won't let ourselves be dominated by others,'' Bischoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-touted BAe-DASA merger collapsed last Tuesday when the  
British company announced it instead was acquiring General Electric 
Co.'s Marconi Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	The move forged a British company worth $27 billion that could  
rival U.S. defense giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be the third-largest defense and aerospace  
group in the world after U.S. companies Boeing Co. and Lockheed 
Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which must be approved by British authorities,  
appeared to scupper hopes of creating a three-way European defense 
company composed of BAe, DASA and France's Aerospatiale. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Bischoff said building a jointly run European  
defense company now had become ``extremely difficult,'' with BAe 
unlikely to accept a partner on an equal basis. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was possible other European firms now would seek  
tieups with U.S. defense companies such as Lockheed Martin, 
Raytheon Co. or Northrop Grumman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry insiders fear that, unless Europe's defense  
manufacturers pool their skills, finances and research, they will 
be acquired one by one by U.S. firms keen to expand into European 
markets.

<HEADLINE> NBC Explains False DiMaggio Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A technician in NBC's New York control room  
inadvertently sent an erroneous report on ``Dateline NBC'' that 
baseball legend Joe DiMaggio had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just hit the wrong button,'' network spokesman Cory Shields  
said Sunday. Shields would not identify the technician. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, sent out live to all the network's East Coast  
affiliates Sunday evening, was corrected about 20 minutes after it 
was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	It came on as a crawl, or words running at the bottom of the  
television screen, at about 7:30 p.m. EST: ``This is an NBC News 
Special Report. Baseball legend Joe DiMaggio has died at his 
Florida home. He was 84 years old and had.'' The message was then 
cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBC employee had typed the report and stored it in NBC's  
computer earlier in the day after reading a New York Daily News 
report that DiMaggio was in grave condition and using a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC ran another crawl about 20 minutes later, saying its  
previous report that DiMaggio had died was inaccurate. ``Mr. 
DiMaggio remains in stable condition at his Florida home,'' the 
report said, running over a taped Katie Couric interview with 
actress Gwyneth Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is trying to reach DiMaggio's family to apologize, Shields  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left with Dr. Earl Barron, DiMaggio's doctor,  
and with the Hall of Famer's friend and lawyer, Morris Engelberg, 
were not returned to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio spent 99 days in intensive care at Memorial Regional  
Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., after contracting lung cancer. He is 
too weak to undergo chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the erroneous NBC report was only sent out live on East  
Coast stations, some affiliates in the Midwest or West may have 
also picked up the report and ran it, Shields said.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC blamed a technician who accidentally pressed  
a wrong button for its airing Sunday of an erroneous report on 
``Dateline NBC'' that baseball great Joe DiMaggio had died. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was corrected about 20 minutes after it was

<HEADLINE> Report: DiMaggio in Grave Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio is in grave condition at his home,  
permanently bedridden and using a ventilator, the Daily News 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 84-year-old baseball great was released from the hospital  
Jan. 18 because there was nothing else the hospital could do for 
him, the newspaper said, quoting an unidentified source. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio spent 99 days in intensive care at Memorial Regional  
Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., after contracting lung cancer. He is 
too weak to undergo chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although DiMaggio reportedly walked out on his own when he left  
the hospital, the Daily News said he was taken home on a stretcher. 
He is receiving round-the-clock nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said at the time of DiMaggio's  
release he was looking forward to having DiMaggio throw out the 
first ball on opening day April 9 at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Morris Engelberg, a neighbor and longtime friend, visited  
DiMaggio on Sunday but did not return calls. Steinbrenner referred 
questions about DiMaggio to Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio entered the hospital Oct. 12 and had surgery two days  
later to remove a cancerous lung tumor. He then was stricken with 
pneumonia in his left lung and had fluid drained from his lung 
several times. He slipped into a coma last month and was given last 
rites. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's last public appearance was Sept. 27, when he was  
honored at Yankee Stadium and received replicas of nine 
championship rings that were stolen from his hotel room three 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had wanted him to throw out the ceremonial first  
pitch at the World Series, but by then he was in the hospital. He 
celebrated his 84th birthday in the hospital Nov. 25, surrounded by 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak in 1941 is still considered  
one of the greatest feats in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1955, four years after his  
retirement, and in 1969 was chosen as the greatest living baseball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio played in 11 All-Star games and 10 World Series in 13  
seasons with the Yankees. He batted .325 with 361 home runs, was a 
two-time batting champion and a three-time most valuable player.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutors Interview Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors brushed off Democratic fury  
and interviewed Monica Lewinsky on Sunday, a move that triggered 
fresh partisan convulsions in President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republican senators said they want a swift end to the case  
and two of them expressed hope for a conclusion this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be derelict in our duty ... if we didn't talk to  
her,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House 
managers presenting the case for Clinton's removal from office to 
the Senate. ``We've never even met her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three House prosecutors, Republicans Asa Hutchinson, Ed Bryant  
and McCollum, arrived midafternoon at Washington's stately 
Mayflower Hotel to interview the former White House intern whose 
affair with the president led to the Senate impeachment trial. Ms. 
Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, arrived earlier. Independent 
counsel Kenneth Starr's office also sent representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors also indicated they wanted to talk to  
presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky in her 
job search. Hutchison said he met with Jordan's lawyer ``laying the 
groundwork ... in the eventuality that he is called as witness. And 
hopefully, I'll be able to talk to Mr. Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House managers said they would ask substantive questions of  
Ms. Lewinsky about her relationship with Clinton. McCollum said he 
wanted to question her about ``her current state of mind on the 
grand jury testimony that she gave.'' In that testimony last 
summer, Ms. Lewinsky said Clinton never asked her to lie about 
their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine, Slade Gorton of  
Washington and Richard Shelby of Alabama sought a fast conclusion 
to the trial. Snowe even predicted, ``I think we will reach a 
conclusion by the end of this week'' with a ``chance to vote up or 
down on the articles of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton also said he hoped a solution could be found this week,  
said both parties should agree on a final vote and ``get to it ... 
promptly.'' Added Shelby: ``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote 
on it up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Mayflower Hotel where Ms. Lewinsky was housed, concierge  
John Dignan said the former White House intern has received about a 
dozen messages by phone and fax -- some with off-color comments but 
most offering support. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really doesn't want to see these things, so we've been  
throwing them away,'' he said, specifying that the hotel checked 
with Ms. Lewinsky before discarding the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he would go  
ahead with a plan to submit written questions to Clinton, even 
though White House lawyers -- who first suggested the questions -- 
now say the attorneys would respond rather than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the  
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott 
said in a statement. A response by Clinton attorneys ``is not a 
substitute for the president answering the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Reno, Nev., former President Bush said Saturday night that he  
was deeply concerned by ``what appears to be a lack of respect'' 
for the presidency by Clinton. But Clinton's predecessor said the 
case ``will soon pass away and once again our country will be 
respected and strong around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that shattered the Senate's bipartisan approach to the  
impeachment trial and caught senators from both parties off guard, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office obtained a court order 
to help the House schedule the interview with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr on Saturday obtained a court order for Ms. Lewinsky to  
submit to the interview, arguing that she had an obligation to 
cooperate under an agreement giving her limited immunity from 
prosecution. Starr told reporters outside his home Sunday that his 
office took ``the appropriate action'' and was ``not in any way 
participating other than responding to requests'' from House 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive Sunday, many of the key players had a  
say: 21 senators appeared on the Sunday talk shows, as did five of 
the 13 House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead House manager Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the interview, an  
often-used tactic in court trials to size up witnesses, was to 
learn ``the kind of witness she would make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the now-rancorous atmosphere, the surprise move by House  
Republicans gave Senate Democrats a new opening to denounce the 
perjury and obstruction of justice case presented by the 
prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers ``are swinging wildly for the fence for a home  
run'' to save a case ``in serious trouble,'' Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky interview was injected into the trial just as the  
Senate faced crucial decisions this week and just as a bipartisan 
agreement governing the first phase of the trial was about to run 
its course. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the chamber's respected expert on  
history and traditions, said he will move to dismiss the case. If 
that fails, senators would decide whether to call witnesses, 
initially for depositions. Most Republicans support testimony; most 
Democrats do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said they were intensifying work on means to  
end the trial and end the political gridlock that confronts the 
Senate: Republicans possess the votes needed to call witnesses, and 
Democrats hold enough votes to block the president's removal. It 
takes a two-thirds majority to oust the president but only a 
majority for other motions in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 
55-45 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Sunday talk-show circuit, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,  
suggested that witnesses ``could be limited to only the obstruction 
of justice charge,'' because that's where the major conflicts in 
testimony exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., acknowledging that Byrd's motion is  
unlikely to generate Republican support, proposed a ``motion to 
dismiss-plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That motion in essence would contain the facts that the  
president has dishonored the office, that he had an inappropriate 
relationship, that he misled the American public. It does allow us 
to dismiss based with sort of a censure resolution contained in 
that dismissal.'' 
</P>
<P>

Sunday; CBS's ``Face The Nation''; NBC's ``Meet The Press''; ABC's 
``This Week''; and CNN's ``Late Edition.''

throwing them away,'' he said, specifying that the hotel checked 
with Ms. Lewinsky before discarding the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he would go  
ahead with a plan to submit written questions to Clinton, even 
though White House lawyers -- who first suggested the questions -- 
now say the attorneys would respond rather than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the  
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott 
said in a statement. A response by Clinton attorneys ``is not a 
substitute for the president answering the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Reno, Nev., former President Bush said Saturday night that he  
was deeply concerned by ``what appears to be a lack of respect'' 
for the presidency by Clinton. But Clinton's predecessor said the 
case ``will soon pass away and once again our country will be 
respected and strong around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that shattered the Senate's bipartisan approach to the  
impeachment trial and caught senators from both parties off guard, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office obtained a court order 
to help the House schedule the interview with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr on Saturday obtained a court order for Ms. Lewinsky to  
submit to the interview, arguing that she had an obligation to 
cooperate under an agreement giving her limited immunity from 
prosecution. Starr told reporters outside his home Sunday that his 
office took ``the appropriate action'' and was ``not in any way 
participating other than responding to requests'' from House 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive Sunday, many of the key players had a  
say: 21 senators appeared on the Sunday talk shows, as did five of 
the 13 House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead House manager Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the interview, an  
often-used tactic in court trials to size up witnesses, was to 
learn ``the kind of witness she would make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the now-rancorous atmosphere, the surprise move by House  
Republicans gave Senate Democrats a new opening to denounce the 
perjury and obstruction of justice case presented by the 
prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers ``are swinging wildly for the fence for a home  
run'' to save a case ``in serious trouble,'' Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky interview was injected into the trial just as the  
Senate faced crucial decisions this week and just as a bipartisan 
agreement governing the first phase of the trial was about to run 
its course. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the chamber's respected expert on  
history and traditions, said he will move to dismiss the case. If 
that fails, senators would decide whether to call witnesses, 
initially for depositions. Most Republicans support testimony; most 
Democrats do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said they were intensifying work on means to  
end the trial and end the political gridlock that confronts the 
Senate: Republicans possess the votes needed to call witnesses, and 
Democrats hold enough votes to block the president's removal. It 
takes a two-thirds majority to oust the president but only a 
majority for other motions in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 
55-45 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Sunday talk-show circuit, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,  
suggested that witnesses ``could be limited to only the obstruction 
of justice charge,'' because that's where the major conflicts in 
testimony exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., acknowledging that Byrd's motion is  
unlikely to generate Republican support, proposed a ``motion to 
dismiss-plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That motion in essence would contain the facts that the  
president has dishonored the office, that he had an inappropriate 
relationship, that he misled the American public. It does allow us 
to dismiss based with sort of a censure resolution contained in 
that dismissal.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Push for Impeachment End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators from both parties, agreeing that  
President Clinton will not be convicted, expressed hope Sunday for 
an early end to the impeachment trial and said this week's vote on 
whether to question witnesses could be a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 21 senators, more than one-fifth of the Senate, appearing on  
the Sunday news programs, there was much unanimity on key issues -- 
a motion to dismiss this week will fail, the vote on witnesses will 
be close and there is now nowhere near the 67 votes needed to 
remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate votes against witnesses, said Sen. Larry Craig,  
R-Idaho, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, ``then we 
will rapidly move to up or down votes on the articles of 
impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial resumes Monday with Sen. Robert Byrd,  
D-W.Va., expected to offer a motion to dismiss. The White House 
lawyers and House prosecutors will each have an hour to speak on 
the issue, and senators might then try to stop the trial while they 
debate dismissal, either in an open or closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	Before voting on dismissal, the two sides would then have three  
hours each to argue the need to depose witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal vote was likely to break along party lines, with  
the Republicans, commanding a 55-45 majority, expected to defeat 
the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said the  
Senate came to a final vote on all 13 previous impeachment trials 
except those in which the defendant resigned before a vote. 
Short-circuiting the process, he said, ``is a very very dangerous 
proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were looking beyond the dismissal vote to the witness  
vote. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., on CNN, said that ``if enough 
Republicans would declare themselves against witnesses, I believe 
we could completely avoid the vote on dismissal'' and move directly 
to a final vote on conviction or acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said the ultimate outcome could be what  
he called ``the three no theory -- no on dismissal, which I hope 
passes, no on witnesses and no on conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the 11 Republicans on the news programs showed some  
reluctance to call witnesses, which Democrats warned could add 
months to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said  
she wasn't convinced of the need for witnesses and was concerned 
about turning the Senate into the ``Jerry Springer Show.'' Sen. 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., on ABC's ``This Week'' said he didn't think 
witnesses could add to the information already available. ``Let's 
move on, let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said on NBC that he personally had  
enough information without witnesses to go to a final vote, 
although he thought the House prosecutors should have a say in the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 House prosecutors, led by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., have  
campaigned aggressively for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate shouldn't tell us how to try our case,'' Hyde said  
on NBC. ``They can tell us a lot and they do, but when it comes to 
preparing our case, I view that as our responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators were already looking ahead to what happens after  
the formal trial ends with a dismissal or a presumed acquittal of 
the president. Breaux was promoting the idea of attaching censure 
language to the dismissal motion. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
on ``Fox News Sunday,'' spoke of her plans to introduce a separate 
resolution censuring the president for his affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' 
brought up the theory of some constitutionalists that the Senate 
could vote to convict Clinton of the perjury or obstruction charges 
without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both sides said that despite the uproar over the  
House's questioning Ms. Lewinsky, they believed they could keep the 
bipartisan spirit that has differentiated the Senate trial from the 
fractious House impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowe suggested the 100 senators meet in the Old Senate Chamber  
this week, as they did before the start of the trial, to seek a 
bipartisan approach to how the rest of the trial will unfold. ``I 
think we will reach a conclusion by the end of this week. I think 
we'll have a chance to vote up or down on the articles of 
impeachment.''

 *Lord Lewin    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former British defense chief Lord Lewin, who  
masterminded Britain's defeat of Argentina in the Falklands Islands 
war, has died Saturday of stomach cancer. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewin, who as military commander was a key member of former  
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Falklands War Cabinet, is widely 
regarded as persuading Thatcher to order the sinking of the 
Argentine cruiser Belgrano during the 1982 conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 600 Argentine sailors were killed, the majority of the  
1,000 killed during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewin, who had a distinguished record as a young officer in  
World War II, was the head of the Royal Navy from 1977 to 1979, and 
then Britain's overall military chief. 
</P>
<P>
	After retirement in 1982 following the Falklands victory, he was  
given the title of Lord. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born Terence Thornton Lewin in the south England coastal  
town of Dover.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Rev. John Osteen, founder of one of the  
city's largest and most diverse churches and a popular television 
pastor, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteen headed Lakewood Church, a congregation that boasts 15,000  
members who worship in a contemporary 8,200-seat sanctuary. His 
local and international broadcasts attracted thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteen dropped out of high school in his hometown of Fort Worth.  
In his biography, he said he began seriously thinking about God 
after leaving a nightclub in 1939. Six weeks later, he was 
preaching in Paris, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteen's television programs are seen in 100 countries. Around  
Houston, his church is best known for the thousands of cars that 
bear bumper stickers proclaiming Lakewood ``An Oasis of Love.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Comforts Tornado Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEEBE, Ark. (AP) -- The impeachment trial seemed worlds away as  
President Clinton walked the streets of Little Rock, comforting 
tornado victims and viewing the damage along the same route he used 
to jog when he was Arkansas' governor. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he got to the small town of Beebe on Sunday, the  
scandal caught up to him. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching Clinton from the back of a small crowd at the wrecked  
shell of the junior high school was none other than Paula Jones, 
whose sexual harassment suit against Clinton set in motion the 
events leading to his impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come to see him,'' said Jones, an Arkansan who now  
lives in California. She said that she had been staying with 
friends in the area when the tornadoes tore through it on Thursday. 
``I came to see what they're going to do about the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appeared unaware that she was in the crowd, and he  
ignored reporters who sought some reaction from him to the twist. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, Clinton seemed to draw as much emotionally from  
the storm victims as he gave. He clasped old friends in long hugs 
and reached into trucks to shake hands with National Guardsmen who 
had been called to duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for him, and it's good for them,'' said  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, also an Arkansan. ``You 
know who your friends are when you're standing with them in 
difficult times, and they're standing with you in difficult 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Harvest Foods, where the Clintons used to buy groceries,  
the roof was ripped off and the brick storefront was in pieces. 
Shrink-wrapped boxes sat on their pallets in the middle of what had 
been orderly aisles. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke in the open air, just in front of the check-out aisles,  
exhorting the residents from nearby neighborhoods to ``fix the 
roofs, replace the trees and keep the spirit of the place alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four Arkansas counties and one county in Tennessee were declared  
disaster areas after Thursday's storms, which killed seven people 
and injured 55. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that everyone who possibly can will rebuild,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving in Beebe, where winds up to 200 mph tore through Center  
Street, Clinton met with a family he has known since his first race 
for governor. The meeting was on the foundation of what had been 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
	A few stools, a bed frame and a bathtub remained, as did a  
couple of photographs Clinton had signed to them. In the back 
ground, metal from the roof of the junior high several hundred 
yards away was draped through the withered branches of a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just destruction,'' said Sherry Wooten, a neighbor whose  
red house had lost its windows and back porch. ``There's nothing 
left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was waiting just a short drive away, dressed in a white  
jacket, red shirt and blue jeans, and hanging back in the crowd 
with two children. She recently received an $850,000 payment from 
Clinton to settle her suit, which had been dismissed by a federal 
judge but was being considered for reinstatement by an appeals 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how much Mrs. Jones will be able to keep after  
paying the multiple lawyers who handled her case.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Goes Over Facts Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One year after her first fateful meeting with  
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's team, Monica Lewinsky was back in 
another ritzy hotel, once more going over her tale of lust in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Mayflower Hotel's $5,000-per-night Presidential Suite,  
the same room where President Clinton's mother Virginia Kelley 
stayed during his inaugural festivities, Ms. Lewinsky answered 
questions from three Congress members serving as prosecutors in the 
impeachment trial for almost two hours Sunday. One of her lawyers, 
Plato Cacheris, referred to it as another installment in Ms. 
Lewinsky's ``long nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three Republicans congressmen -- Reps. Asa Hutchinson of  
Arkansas, Bill McCollum of Florida and Ed Bryant of Tennessee -- 
emerged to praise the former White House intern's poise and 
intelligence. She's a ``very personable and impressive young 
woman,'' McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
	They had to be mindful of criticism of the way independent  
counsel Starr's prosecutors handled their first meeting at a luxury 
hotel in the surburbs with Ms. Lewinsky before she became a 
household name. Some of Starr's staff were at the meeting on 
Sunday, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Toricelli, D-N.J., criticized the House members for  
what he said was Ms. Lewinsky's 23rd interview in the case. ``This 
is the intimidation of a 24-year-old girl to try to get her to 
change her story. It is unseemly, it is unnecessary,'' he 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, who disappeared into the anonymity of Los Angeles  
after testifying before Starr's grand jury last August, returned to 
Washington reluctantly, under threat of losing the agreement that 
keeps her immune from prosecution. She apparently spent most of the 
day closeted in her room -- a regular one, not the suite -- out of 
sight of the reporters and gawkers who crowded the hotel's doors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning, Ms. Lewinsky caused a mild stir when she came  
down with her mother, Marcia Lewis, for breakfast in the hotel's 
chandelier-bedecked restaurant. She had two pancakes and orange 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
	In her familiar pearls and a black pantsuit, she chatted and  
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``She appeared to be in much better spirits,'' observed  
concierge John Dignan. 
</P>
<P>
	On a damp, sleepy Washington Sunday, two high school students  
from Rockland County, N.Y., hopped off their sightseeing bus to see 
what was up. They snapped photographs of the reporters and TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was willing to stand a while in the drizzle, hoping  
for a glimpse of Ms. Lewinsky, 17-year-old Avi Stern insisted he 
was unimpressed by the scandal. ``It's overrated -- the whole 
thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even at a hotel accustomed to serving presidents, foreign  
dignitaries and movie stars, Ms. Lewinsky's presence caused a 
hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest I've seen with all the cameras,'' said  
another concierge, Hirono Castagnola, who was on duty when Ms. 
Lewinsky struggled through a throng of reporters Saturday 
afternoon. ``So many people were around her, pushing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she pushed forward unsteadily, Ms. Lewinsky held her head  
down, her face partly covered by a black baseball cap with the logo 
for The Shooting Gallery, a New York business that helps finance 
independent films. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon the hotel staff was busy fielding calls from people who  
tried all sorts of ploys in vain efforts to get through to Ms. 
Lewinsky. ``I'm her grandmother, her manicurist, her hairstylist, 
any excuse to get to her,'' Castagnola said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen faxes arrived on Sunday, a few with off-color  
comments but most handwritten missives wishing Ms. Lewinsky well. 
``'We're praying for you,' 'It will all be over soon' -- that sort 
of thing,'' said concierge Dignan. 
</P>
<P>
	After checking with Ms. Lewinsky, the hotel threw them all away.  
One telegram for her was refused. ``She really doesn't want to see 
these things,'' Dignan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky likely chose the gilded, polished Mayflower because  
it was directly across Connecticut Avenue from her lawyers' 
offices. But it was a coup for the hotel, which served up coffee 
for reporters camped outside.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympics Head Likes IOC Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney's chief Olympics organizer said  
he welcomed the decision by the IOC to expel six members for their 
roles in the Salt Lake City bribes scandal and did not feel ``under 
an inquisition or a microscope'' because of allegations of 
Australian payments to get African votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Hollway, chief executive of the SOCOG, the local  
organizing committee, said eh was ``very relaxed'' that senior IOC 
officials Jacques Rogge and Francois Carrard would be sent to 
Australia within the next couple of months to question local 
officials and clear up any concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd set out three things we wanted (the IOC) to do,'' Hollway  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One was to deal with people who had behaved improperly. The  
second was to clean up and reform the bidding process and the third 
was to build some ongoing improved management and good governance 
into their work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've done all those three and I'm very pleased about that  
and I think that means they're almost out of the woods. As regards 
to Sydney, we are very relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC appeared to be ``very confident'' of Sydney and  
had not launched an investigation except as part of a broader look 
at bidding cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no sense we have of us being put under an inquisition  
or a microscope or feeling that there is any question of 
impropriety with the Sydney bid,'' Hollway said Monday (Sunday 
night EST). 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney's two-vote victory over Beijing in 1993 moved into the  
spotlight again Friday when Australian Olympic Committee president 
John Coates said he pledged $70,000 to two African Olympic 
officials the night before the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the money was not a bribe but part of on-going aid  
to African sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway acknowledged that the Salt Lake City scandal had made it  
increasingly difficult for SOCOG to raise outstanding marketing and 
sponsorship revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said none of SOCOG's sponsors had threatened to withdraw  
their financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reckon that when there was this bit of tarnish on the rings  
it might have made our task harder,'' he said. ``But with some 
shine being put back on the rings I think we're in a good position 
to go and argue credibly that the games in Sydney are something 
companies would want to be associated with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, senior Australian IOC member Kevan Gosper said that  
organizers of the Sydney Games were given a full endorsement to 
host the 2000 event. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my priority here and I am extremely pleased because  
there was considerable amount of uncertainty in the air these last 
days,'' Gosper told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio from 
Lausanne. ``It's taken the uncertainty away, particularly for the 
athletes and the organizers of Sydney, so I'm very happy about 
that.''

<HEADLINE> High Pressure Purifies Oyster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- In pursuit of a safer oyster, Ernie Voisin  
and his son Mike have discovered the automatically shucked oyster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Voisins, officers in their family-owned seafood business,  
were looking for a new way to kill a sometimes dangerous strain of 
bacterium in raw oysters without altering the taste and texture. 
</P>
<P>
	After reading food service magazines, they hit upon the process  
of purifying a product by using a high-strength water tank and 
pumps to place the food under uniform high pressure -- tens of 
thousands of pounds per square inch. 
</P>
<P>
	Aided by Dr. Marilyn B. Kilgen, head of the department of  
biological sciences at Nicholls State University, they tested the 
process on oysters at a Food and Drug Administration lab. They 
found that not only were the bacteria killed, but the pressure 
popped the shell partially open and loosened the oyster from the 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable,'' Mike Voisin said. ``It produced the  
most perfectly shucked oyster you've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the salty taste nor the texture of the oyster was  
affected, he said. And if the future he envisions comes true, the 
days of the humble oyster shucker, who sometimes damages the oyster 
as he hammers and pries at the rock-like shell, may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a great loss, says Voisin. While oyster shucking is  
considered something of an art in Louisiana -- contests are 
sometimes held to see who can shuck the most oysters the fastest -- 
it is not a high-paying job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anyone in America who wants to grow up to be an  
oyster shucker,'' Voisin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He foresees a day when oysters will be delivered to oyster bars  
and restaurants with their partially opened shells held together by 
plastic bands that the consumer, cook or waiter can easily remove 
before popping the oyster open with a fork or butter knife and 
sliding out the meat. 
</P>
<P>
	But pressurizing oysters is more than a labor-saving method.  
More important is the pressure's effect on Vibrio vulnificus 
bacteria. The bacteria thrive in warm Gulf waters and are often 
present in oysters, especially during summer. Harmless to most 
people, Vibrio vulnificus can be deadly to anyone with an illness 
that compromises the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of Vibrio-related deaths in recent years have resulted  
in federal rules requiring warning signs where raw oysters are 
consumed. Ralph Nader's Center for Science in the Public Interest 
called in 1997 for a federal requirement that all oysters be heat 
treated (a process commonly referred to as pasteurization although 
it is a lower-temperature process than true pasteurization) before 
being served raw. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat process is used by at least one Louisiana seafood  
processor with some success. However, it adds to costs and some 
connoisseurs complain that it alters taste and texture. 
</P>
<P>
	Prolonged chilling also kills Vibrio vulnificus, but some in the  
industry have complained about the cost of equipment. And, Voisin 
emphasized, keeping the oysters chilled for long periods only 
delays the delivery of the fresh product to market. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option is radiation, a process Voisin believes in but  
the FDA is yet to approve. And there is also a public perception 
problem. Some food safety advocates are wary of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost may be a stumbling block to pressurization. As Voisin put  
it, ``It's not complicated, but it's expensive.'' However, he 
believes the expense can be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	His company is awaiting a patent on a pressure machine, he has  
contacted potential builders, and it doesn't need FDA approval, he 
said. He estimates his cost for a relatively small device to 
process 300 pounds (roughly 750 oysters) at a time at close to 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Voisin envisions lease arrangements for seafood companies that  
cannot afford such a large capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
	And the savings in labor at the shucking end may very well  
offset the equipment costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He may face some skepticism in the restaurant business, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``My first reaction is -- ugh,'' said Anthony Uglesich, whose  
little seafood restaurant just outside the New Orleans central 
business district does standing-room only business at lunchtime. 
One element of a freshly shucked oyster's taste is the fluid held 
in the shell, he said. Processing the oyster ahead of time, 
especially in a manner that leaves the shell partially open, means 
the fluid is lost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Uglesich added, he would have to try a pre-shucked  
oyster before making a judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	He may get his chance soon. Voisin said plans are under way to  
build and install the oyster pressurizing device at the family 
business, Motivatit Seafood Inc. in Houma, by spring. He hopes to 
show it off this summer when members of the Interstate Shellfish 
Sanitation Conference, comprised of industry and state and federal 
regulatory officials, visit in June. If all goes according to plan, 
the first pressure-treated oysters could hit the market by late 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if he likes them, Uglesich said he would be in no hurry  
to lay off his oyster shucker. He said he has never had a complaint 
of an illness from his non-processed oysters. Vibrio vulnificus is 
not a problem for healthy people and, Uglesich said, oyster-borne 
bacteria are rarely a problem if you are careful about where you 
get your oysters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here a long time,'' he said. ``We haven't had any  
problems.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was returning to his native  
Arkansas today for a firsthand look at devastation caused by last 
week's killer tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage from the storms Thursday and Friday led to a federal  
disaster declaration for five counties in Arkansas and one in 
Tennessee. Seven people in Arkansas and one in Tennessee died while 
thousands of homes and businesses were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned a walking tour of parts of Little Rock, Ark.,  
with James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management 
Administration and an Arkansas native, Gov. Mike Huckabee, Mayor 
James Dailey and members of the state's congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also was to speak to Little Rock citizens from the  
parking lot of a local grocery damaged by the storms and then 
travel to Beebe, Ark., one of the hardest hit parts of the state. 
Winds there were gauged at 200 mph during the tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	People in the five counties -- Independence, Pulaski, St.  
Francis, Saline and White -- designated by Clinton as disaster areas 
are eligible for grants to pay for temporary living expenses and

<HEADLINE> Prozac Patent Fight Goes to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co. alleges that two  
competitors have infringed upon its patent rights for the popular 
antidepressant Prozac and is taking them to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr Laboratories and Geneva Pharmaceuticals say, however, that  
the patents are faulty and they should be allowed to manufacture a 
cheaper, generic version of the drug, which can cost up to $60 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake in the trial, which begins today, are U.S. sales for  
the world's favorite antidepressant -- an estimated $2.5 billion 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants Barr and Geneva are bucking long odds in trying to  
convince U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker to throw out two 
Lilly patents on Prozac so they can introduce their own versions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretrial rulings this month in the case have favored  
Indianapolis-based Lilly, and some industry observers said it had a 
clear advantage heading into the trial, expected to last about two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still there to be tried,'' responded Carol Cox, a  
spokeswoman for Pomona, N.Y.-based Barr. ``While it might be more 
difficult to prove (our case), it's not unprovable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Broomfield, Colo.-based Geneva, a division  
of the Swiss drug giant Novartis AG, declined to comment on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Gruntal &AMP; Co. stock analyst David Saks, who  
recommends buying both Lilly and Barr, said the trial puts Lilly 
and its lucrative Prozac franchise clearly at risk. ``Anytime you 
go into war, the outcome is uncertain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are Lilly's patent on fluoxetine, the active ingredient  
in Prozac, which expires in February 2001, and a second patent on 
how Prozac works, due to expire in December 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr and Geneva claim that Lilly fraudulently withheld data or  
gave misleading information on its two patents. They also challenge 
whether Lilly provided enough information on the 2003 patent. 
</P>
<P>
	If the defendants can prove the difficult fraud claim, generic  
competition could enter the U.S. market as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the case, including witness lists, has remained under  
seal, and all the parties were reluctant to discuss specifics 
during the days leading up to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr and Geneva this month waived their rights for a jury to  
hear part of the case, so Barker will decide it all. She will 
likely issue her rulings weeks after the trial ends, and appeals 
could drag on for months or years. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome will be felt by not only the litigants, but also the  
millions of Americans who pay for Prozac to treat depression, 
bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other ills. Children and 
even pets down it to make their lives cheerier. A new indication 
for Prozac to treat a type of premenstrual syndrome is pending 
before regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Prozac has brought in more than $15 billion for Lilly since the  
drug's launch in 1987. It carried Lilly through the turbulent early 
1990s, a time marked by the turnovers of two chief executives, a $1 
billion cost-cutting program, and the first quarterly loss ever in 
four decades as a publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as its patents hold, Prozac will bring in at least $3  
billion a year for Lilly for years to come, stock analysts predict. 
Lilly last month struck a deal for an enhanced version of Prozac 
that promises a more effective treatment, possibly without some of 
Prozac's troubling side effects such as sexual dysfunction. It's 
under patent until 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Barker tosses out the patents under challenge in her  
court, Barr, Geneva and other generic drug companies will roll out 
cheaper versions and start carving up the key U.S. market for the 
drug before Lilly can introduce the new ``super'' Prozac, which is 
still in clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales projections published last month by S.M. Scala of SG Cowen  
Securities Corp. show that without generic competition, annual 
Prozac sales will reach $3.45 billion by 2002. With competition, 
they fall off to $2.04 billion, dragging down Lilly's annual 
earnings per share by 70 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, generic competition has eroded Prozac sales overseas,  
causing a drop of more than 14 percent from a high of $627.4 
million in 1995 to $538.1 million in 1997. Lilly is expected to 
announce year-end figures for 1998 on Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutors Interview Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors brushed off Democratic fury  
and interviewed Monica Lewinsky informally Sunday -- a sudden turn 
in President Clinton's impeachment trial that triggered new 
partisan convulsions and led to a barrage of efforts to end the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be derelict in our duty ... if we didn't talk to  
her,'' said Rep. William McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House 
managers presenting the case for Clinton's removal from office to 
the Senate. ``We've never even met her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three House prosecutors, Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., Ed  
Bryant, R-Tenn., and McCollum arrived in midafternoon at 
Washington's stately Mayflower Hotel. Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato 
Cacheris, came earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said earlier that he met with the lawyer for  
presidential friend Vernon Jordan, ``laying the groundwork ... in 
the eventuality that he is called as witness. And hopefully, I'll 
be able to talk to Mr. Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House managers said they wanted to ask substantive questions  
of Ms. Lewinsky about her relationship with Clinton. McCollum said 
he wanted to question her about ``her current state of mind on the 
grand jury testimony that she gave.'' In that testimony, the former 
intern said Clinton never asked her to lie about their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republican senators expressed skepticism about calling any  
witnesses, an issue that is likely to be put to the Senate this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want the Senate to become a spectacle, a scene,''  
said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, adding he would support only 
witnesses who ``can add a lot.'' Sens. Slade Gorton of Washington 
and Olympia Snowe of Maine expressed similar misgivings. Snowe 
commented she does not want the trial ``to turn into the Jerry 
Springer show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Mayflower Hotel where Ms. Lewinsky was housed, concierge  
John Dignan said the former White House intern has received about a 
dozen messages by phone and fax -- some with off-color comments but 
most offering support. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really doesn't want to see these things, so we've been  
throwing them away,'' he said, specifying that the hotel checked 
with Ms. Lewinsky before discarding the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he would go  
ahead with a plan to submit written questions to Clinton, even 
though White House lawyers -- who first suggested the questions -- 
now say the attorneys would respond rather than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the  
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott 
said in a statement. A response by Clinton attorneys ``is not a 
substitute for the president answering the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Reno, Nev., former President Bush said Saturday night  
that he was ``deeply concerned'' by ``what appears to be a lack of 
respect'' for the presidency by Clinton. But Clinton's predecessor 
said the case ``will soon pass away and once again our country will 
be respected and strong around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that shattered the Senate's bipartisan approach to the  
impeachment trial and caught senators from both parties off guard, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office obtained a court order 
to help the House schedule the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr on Saturday obtained a court order for Ms. Lewinsky to  
submit to the interview, arguing that she had an obligation to 
cooperate under an agreement giving her limited immunity from 
prosecution. Starr told reporters outside his home Sunday that his 
office took ``the appropriate action'' and was ``not in any way 
participating other than responding to requests'' from House 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive Sunday, many of the key players had a  
say: 21 senators appeared on the Sunday talk shows, as did five of 
the 13 House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead House manager Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the interview, an  
often-used tactic in court trials to size up witnesses, was to 
learn ``the kind of witness she would make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the now-rancorous atmosphere, the surprise move by House  
Republicans gave Senate Democrats a new opening to denounce the 
perjury and obstruction of justice case presented by the 
prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers ``are swinging wildly for the fence for a home  
run'' to save a case ``in serious trouble,'' Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., said. On Saturday, Senate Democratic Leader Tom 
Daschle called the Republican tactic ``raw partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky interview was injected into the trial just as the  
Senate faced crucial decisions this week and just as a bipartisan 
agreement governing the first phase of the trial was about to run 
its course. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the chamber's respected expert on  
history and traditions, said he will move to dismiss the case. If 
that fails, senators would decide whether to call witnesses, 
initially for depositions. Most Republicans support testimony; most 
Democrats do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said they were intensifying work on means to  
end the trial and end the political gridlock that confronts the 
Senate: Republicans possess the votes needed to call witnesses, and 
Democrats hold enough votes to block the president's removal. It 
takes a two-thirds majority to oust the president but only a 
majority for other motions in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 
55-45 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Sunday talk-show circuit, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,  
suggested that witnesses ``could be limited to only the obstruction 
of justice charge,'' because that's where the major conflicts in 
testimony exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., acknowledging that Byrd's motion is  
unlikely to generate Republican support, proposed a ``motion to 
dismiss-plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That motion in essence would contain the facts that the  
president has dishonored the office, that he had an inappropriate 
relationship, that he misled the American public. It does allow us 
to dismiss based with sort of a censure resolution contained in 
that dismissal.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest Workers To Vote on Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- About 18,000 ground workers at Northwest  
Airlines are to vote on a tentative four-year contract agreement 
that would provide an immediate raise of 4 percent and a 3.5 
percent lump sum retroactive payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Saturday by Northwest and the International  
Association of Machinists also would provide pay increases every 14 
months of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent as well as a 50 
percent increase in pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would cover ticket agents, reservations, clerks,  
baggage handlers, other ramp equipment operators and plant 
protection employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A timetable for the vote by rank-and-file union members was  
still being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote will be the second by IAM members since contract talks  
began in the fall of 1996. The first proposed contract was soundly 
rejected on July 29, even though union leaders had recommended 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Foster, president of IAM District 143, said clauses in the  
earlier proposal that led to rejection have been addressed to the 
satisfaction of negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that our membership will take a hard look at  
the issues before them ... and make the right decision,'' Foster 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	When the earlier pact was rejected, the IAM also represented  
mechanics and cleaners. Those union workers voted Nov. 20 to leave 
the IAM and cast their lot with Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal 
Association. The election is being challenged by the IAM and 
Northwest, with a National Mediation Board decision expected by 
Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	While only sketchy details of the new proposal were released,  
Foster said the agreement includes a 50 percent pension increase 
and concessions for part-time workers, including 80 percent 
coverage for medical and dental benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay increase remains the same as the proposal that was  
rejected in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that proposal was rejected, Northwest was hit by a 15-day  
pilots' strike and the airline was out of service for several 
additional days after a settlement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Still ahead for Northwest are negotiations with the 10,000  
mechanics and about 10,000 flight attendants. The carrier's other 
smaller unions are now under new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants are scheduled to resume mediated talks with  
Northwest on Feb. 1, and the airline said it would resume 
negotiations with mechanics once challenge of union representation 
is settled.

<HEADLINE> Harris, Redgrave Win Golden Globes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Ed Harris of ``The Truman Show''  
and Lynn Redgrave of ``Gods and Monsters'' won motion picture 
supporting actor honors and Michael J. Fox was a funny but poignant 
winner for best television comedy actor at Sunday's 56th Golden 
Globes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, the ``Spin City'' star who has been diagnosed with  
Parkinson's disease, thanked his doctors, including one he said had 
looked inside his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show  
by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man, 
I just got through eating dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage he noted that ``The Truman Show'' came out in the  
summer, long before studios traditionally roll out their 
award-worthy product. ``I'm glad that people didn't forget about 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redgrave, who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging  
horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32 
years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been 
crying out for a friend ever since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenna Elfman won best actress in a TV musical comedy series for  
``Dharma and Greg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The Truman Show'' and ``Saving  
Private Ryan'' were the leading contenders for the program. 
``Shakespeare'' and ``Truman'' led the movie field with six 
nominations each, while ``Ryan'' had five. ``Bulworth,'' 
``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' and ``Little Voice'' had three 
nominations apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Films receiving two nominations were ``Central Station,'' ``The  
Horse Whisperer,'' ``The Mask of Zorro,'' ``The Mighty,'' 
``Mulan,'' ``Patch Adams,'' ``Primary Colors,'' ``The Prince of 
Egypt,'' ``Still Crazy'' and ``There's Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood  
Foreign Press Association, are awarded for both film and television 
in a nationally televised ceremony in a hotel ballroom in what can 
be a much more colorful affair than the stuffy Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone, Christine Lahti was in the bathroom when she  
was announced as a winner for ``Chicago Hope.'' This year she 
showed up as a presenter with toilet paper stuck to a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes traditionally serve as predictors for the  
Academy Awards in March. In the last 16 years, 12 films that won 
best motion picture honors at the Golden Globes went on to take the 
same prize at the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards also provide a valuable promotional tool for studios.  
The morning after the ceremony, newspaper advertisements for films 
trumpet their Golden Globe hauls. 
</P>
<P>
	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was  
honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his ``outstanding 
contribution to the entertainment field.'' Nicholson has been 
nominated for 14 Globes and won five. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fourth straight year, NBC dedicated three hours of  
prime-time to the awards, reflecting how far the ceremony has come 
in prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards had once been buffeted by controversy over  
allegations of corrupt voting and long suffered credibility 
problems, with the lowlight being the 1981 event that awarded Pia 
Zadora a statue for the bomb ``Butterfly.'' Networks refused to 
show the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The association worked to regain respectability. In 1996, after  
a 14-year absence from network exposure, the program was back on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, NBC asked Golden Globe voters to sign waivers  
indicating they did not accept gifts or perks from Hollywood 
studios, the Washington Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Press Association President Helmut Voss said the waivers  
indicated ``during our journalistic activities, including 
out-of-town travel, that we did not accept any gifts other than 
those that are the customary promotional gifts of the studios.''

<HEADLINE> Spielberg, Caine Win Golden Globes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- ``Saving Private Ryan'' won best  
dramatic film and Steven Spielberg was honored for directing the 
brutally realistic World War II combat story, while ``Shakespeare 
in Love,'' ``The Truman Show'' and ``Elizabeth'' won major awards 
at Sunday's 56th Golden Globes. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg, whose film is a major contender for an Oscar,  
extended his thanks to ``all the veterans that are out there that 
saved Western Civilization and stopped the Holocaust in 1945.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare In Love'' won best comedy or musical film and  
picked up awards for star Gwyneth Paltrow -- best actress in a 
comedy -- and for screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Carrey won best dramatic actor for ``The Truman Show,'' in  
which he played a man who realizes his whole life has been a TV 
show. His co-star, Ed Harris, was named best film supporting actor. 
``Truman'' also won for best score. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shocker,'' Carrey said about winning a non-comedy  
award. ``I mean if you look back at some of my earlier dramatic 
work in films like 'Earth Girls Are Easy' and 'Once Bitten' I might 
have seen this coming, but I really wasn't expecting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cate Blanchette of ``Elizabeth'' won best dramatic actress for  
her role as the title character. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Caine of ``Little Voice'' was best actor in a musical or  
comedy motion picture, and Lynn Redgrave of ``Gods and Monsters'' 
won the movie supporting actress trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood Foreign Press Association voted ABC's ``The  
Practice'' as best television drama series, and Fox's ``Ally 
McBeal'' won as best television comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spin City'' star Michael J. Fox, who has been diagnosed with  
Parkinson's disease, was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy 
actor. He thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up 
his brain. ``We're so lucky to do what we do ... and just take 
every day and enjoy it,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow played the upper-crust lady who becomes the lover and  
muse of William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love.'' In ``Little 
Voice,'' Caine played a sleazy agent who tries to turn a meek woman 
with powerful musical gift for show tunes into a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said. ``My career must be slipping.  
This is the first time I've been available to pick up an award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's ``Central Station'' captured the foreign language film  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``The Truman Show'' were the leading  
movie nominees, with six apiece. ``Saving Private Ryan'' followed 
with five. ``Bulworth,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' and 
``Little Voice'' had three nominations apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued  
by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show  
by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man, 
I just got through eating dinner.'' 
</P>

horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32 
years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been 
crying out for a friend ever since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the television categories, Dylan McDermott of ``The  
Practice'' and Keri Russel of ``Felicity'' were named best actor 
and actress, respectively in television dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenna Elfman won best actress in a TV musical or comedy series  
for ``Dharma and Greg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hanks, nominated for best actor in ``Saving Private Ryan,''  
picked up an early honor for his ``From the Earth to the Moon,'' 
which won best miniseries or movie made for TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood  
Foreign Press Association, are awarded for film and television in 
what can be a more colorful affair than the stuffy Academy Awards.

honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his ``outstanding 
contribution to the entertainment field.'' Nicholson has been 
nominated for 14 Globes and won five. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I like about this particular award is that it doesn't  
come from our peer groups,'' Nicholson said. ``Hollywood Foreign 
Press (Association) is kind of a loose group of guys and gals. You 
almost feel like you could go out and have fun with them -- probably 
because they don't have as much to lose as we do.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 'Varsity Blues' Stays on Top / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Varsity Blues,'' the high school tale of  
football, sex and beer in a Texas town, continued to draw young 
moviegoers to retain the No. 1 spot at the weekend box office, 
estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, starring James Van Der Beek of TV's ``Dawson's  
Creek,'' grossed an estimated $10.6 million over the weekend. That 
far outpaced the $2.1 million in ticket sales for ``Gloria'' -- the 
only new film in wide release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gloria'' stars Sharon Stone in the remake of John Cassavetes'  
1980 story of a mob mistress who flees with a young boy after 
hitmen kill his family. It took in a meager average of $1,375 per 
location, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patch Adams,'' which had dipped in recent weeks, jumped back  
to second place with $8.1 million, followed by the legal drama ``A 
Civil Action'' with $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II epic ``The Thin Red Line'' dropped to No. 4  
with $5.8 million while ``Stepmom'' climbed to No. 5 with $5.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``At First Sight'' fell one spot to No. 6 in its second week  
with $4.9 million and ``You've Got Mail'' held on to seventh place 
with $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Prince of Egypt'' shared its No. 8 slot with ``Shakespeare  
in Love'' at $3.6 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	The critically praised ``A Simple Plan'' rounded out the top 10  
with $3.4 million on just 660 screens for a per-screen average of 
$5,152 -- the second-highest average in the top 10. ``Shakespeare in 
Love'' had the highest at $5,496. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were expected Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Varsity Blues,'' $10.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Patch Adams,'' $8.1 million.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Coach Reeves Rattles Some Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons arrived for their first Super  
Bowl on Sunday with video cameras in hands but some bruised 
feelings about coach Dan Reeves' pecking order for departing the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, in a show of respect for the team's older players, asked  
that Pro Bowlers and 10-year veterans be allowed to leave the 
chartered Delta jet first when it arrived about 20 minutes late at 
Miami International Airport after a rousing sendoff in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach is smart,'' said 35-year-old safety Eugene Robinson, who  
qualified for early departure in both categories. ``He let us get 
off first to show leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But receiver Terance Mathis, a Pro Bowl alternate and nine-year  
veteran, said it wasn't the appropriate time to give some players 
special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came this far as a team,'' he said. ``We should be treated  
as a team. No one is better than anyone else. The Super Bowl isn't 
about Pro Bowlers and 10-year vets. It's about 53 guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys getting off the plane first knew it was wrong. A  
lot of guys that were not getting off the plane first knew it was 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson brushed off the possibility that some players were  
upset, noting that Reeves and his coaching staff also waited to 
depart the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all right,'' Robinson said. ``They'll get over it. It's  
only a de-planing. That's water under the bridge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference held before Mathis spoke, Reeves did not  
discuss his plans for leaving the plane. He did apologize for 
stirring up bitter feelings when he spoke last week on the 
longstanding feud with Denver coach Mike Shanahan and quarterback 
John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't accomplish anything talking about it,'' Reeves  
said. ``I should be smart enough after 18 years in this business as 
a head coach that when people ask you a question, they're going to 
make more of it than you thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons seemed in good spirits when they left the plane,  
which was adorned on the inside with streamers, balloons and 
letters from schoolchildren. Many of the players gave the media a 
taste of their own scrutiny, carrying videocameras to record the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	The first person to emerge when the door opened was a flight  
attendant, holding a cluster of red-and-black balloons. Another 
Delta employee, wearing a Falcons T-shirt, performed the ``Dirty 
Bird,'' the team's arm-flapping touchdown dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessie Tuggle gave a thumbs-up to the media, cordoned off behind  
orange-and-white barriers. Jamal Anderson held his right index 
finger in the air while his left hand grasped a camera. Morten 
Andersen waved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to stand there and enjoy the moment,'' said Andersen,  
playing in the Super Bowl for the first time in a 17-year career. 
``This is all new to me, so I just wanted to enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, hardly looking like a man who underwent heart bypass  
surgery six weeks ago, lugged two pieces of luggage down the 
stairs. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been raining earlier in the day in south Florida, but the  
sun broke through the clouds and the temperature approached 80 
degrees when the Falcons touched down. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great feeling,'' offensive tackle Bob Whitfield said.  
``You've got the warm weather and a beautiful city. We want to have 
a little fun the next two days, then it will be time to get to 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On their way to the Atlanta airport, the team buses and a couple  
of limousines rode through Centennial Olympic Park, where an 
estimated 10,000 people -- including Mayor Bill Campbell and Lt. 
Gov. Mark Taylor -- gave them a ``Dirty Bird'' sendoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to see the city so excited,'' tight end O.J.  
Santiago said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl DeMaria of Roswell, Ga., drove 30 miles with his wife, two  
girls and dog to the downtown Atlanta park ``just so the kids could 
be part of the Super Bowl hoopla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, whose family has been season-ticket holders since the  
franchise was founded in 1966, admitted that he never thought he 
would see the Falcons in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son asked me that last year and it broke my heart to say to  
him that I didn't think they were ever going to make it,'' Taylor 
said. ``But I'm proud to be proved wrong.''

<HEADLINE>  Pope Celebrates Mass in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A million faithful packed a dusty Mexico City  
racetrack Sunday to hear a call to arms from Pope John Paul II -- a 
summons to take to the streets and confront the challenge of 
Protestant evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
	The papal Mass was a powerful display of the aging pontiff's  
spell over this predominantly Roman Catholic nation. ``Mexico, 
always faithful!'' chanted the crowd, intent on showing the pope 
that their affection hasn't diminished since his first trip here in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers estimated the crowd at 1 million, and thousands more  
listened from outside the packed racetrack grounds. Parishioners 
perched on sagging tree branches, stood on friends' shoulders or 
clambered onto loudspeaker stands to view the spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of makeshift cardboard periscopes poked above the  
crowd so that those toward the back of the track, nearly a mile 
from the altar, could catch a glimpse of the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul urged his audience to ignore the seductions of what he  
called ``fallacious and novel ideologies'' and to spread the word 
of the church -- a central theme of his visit, in which he has 
called upon his followers to aggressively combat significant 
inroads made by Protestantism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't fail to respond to the Master who calls. Follow him to  
become, like the apostles, fishers of men,'' the pontiff declared. 
``Make Christ's word reach those who still do not know him. Have 
the courage to bear witness to the gospel on the streets and in the 
town squares, in the valleys and mountains of this nation!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few in the crowd complained about the cold, the overflowing  
portable toilets or the mounds of trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worth it. To see the pope, anything is worth the  
sacrifice,'' said Miguel Duran, a 19-year-old student who peered 
into a periscope fashioned from a box of crackers and a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest event in the pope's five-day trip to Mexico,  
which has a special relationship with the pontiff rooted in a 
shared veneration for the country's patron saint, the Virgin of 
Guadalupe. An image of the virgin hung above the altar. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people arrived days before the Mass, and hundreds of  
thousands shivered in temperatures that plunged to 23 degrees 
overnight. The pilgrims were asked to stand at 5:30 a.m. to make 
room for the growing crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	As the sun rose, many kept warm by dancing, jumping in place and  
enthusiastically clapping to music played over loudspeakers. Still, 
hundreds of people were treated for hypothermia and other ailments, 
health workers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amparo Anzures, a 75-year-old pilgrim from Puebla state, said  
the cold didn't bother her. ``For the love of God, we didn't feel 
it because he is our blanket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding familiar themes, John Paul demanded respect for the  
human rights of Indians, ethnic minorities and the poor. He 
reiterated the church's ban on abortion and its emphasis on respect 
for the family. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul began his fourth visit to Mexico on Friday. On  
Saturday, he announced a new strategy for the church in the 
Americas: Catholics must struggle against the excesses of 
capitalism and the church must try harder to reach the rich and 
powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	At each step of his visit, masses of emotional believers have  
cheered the 78-year-old pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, John Paul celebrated Mass at Mexico's holiest site,  
the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and met with President 
Ernesto Zedillo. On Monday, he holds a ``meeting of the 
generations'' at the Azteca soccer stadium, and he meets Tuesday 
with President Clinton in St. Louis.

of the church -- a central theme of his visit, in which he has 
called upon his followers to aggressively combat significant 
inroads made by Protestantism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't fail to respond to the Master who calls. Follow him to  
become, like the apostles, fishers of men,'' the pontiff declared. 
``Make Christ's word reach those who still do not know him. Have 
the courage to bear witness to the gospel on the streets and in the 
town squares, in the valleys and mountains of this nation!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few in the crowd complained about the cold, the overflowing  
portable toilets or the mounds of trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worth it. To see the pope, anything is worth the  
sacrifice,'' said Miguel Duran, a 19-year-old student who peered 
into a periscope fashioned from a box of crackers and a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest event in the pope's five-day trip to Mexico,  
which has a special relationship with the pontiff rooted in a 
shared veneration for the country's patron saint, the Virgin of 
Guadalupe. An image of the virgin hung above the altar. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people arrived days before the Mass, and hundreds of  
thousands shivered in temperatures that plunged to 23 degrees 
overnight. The pilgrims were asked to stand at 5:30 a.m. to make 
room for the growing crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	As the sun rose, many kept warm by dancing, jumping in place and  
enthusiastically clapping to music played over loudspeakers. Still, 
hundreds of people were treated for hypothermia and other ailments, 
health workers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amparo Anzures, a 75-year-old pilgrim from Puebla state, said  
the cold didn't bother her. ``For the love of God, we didn't feel 
it because he is our blanket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding familiar themes, John Paul demanded respect for the  
human rights of Indians, ethnic minorities and the poor. He 
reiterated the church's ban on abortion and its emphasis on respect 
for the family. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul began his fourth visit to Mexico on Friday. On  
Saturday, he announced a new strategy for the church in the 
Americas: Catholics must struggle against the excesses of 
capitalism and the church must try harder to reach the rich and 
powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	At each step of his visit, masses of emotional believers have  
cheered the 78-year-old pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, John Paul celebrated Mass at Mexico's holiest site,  
the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and met with President 
Ernesto Zedillo. On Monday, he holds a ``meeting of the 
generations'' at the Azteca soccer stadium, and he meets Tuesday 
with President Clinton in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposing Welfare Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With welfare rolling to a 30-year low,  
President Clinton is proposing a package of welfare-to-work 
proposals meant to continue that decline. 
</P>
<P>
	But new numbers being released today show the job may be getting  
tougher, at least in a handful of states where the dramatic 
declines of recent years have begun to slow. 
</P>
<P>
	In his upcoming budget, the president will ask Congress to  
extend, and in some cases expand, programs aimed at encouraging 
businesses to hire people off welfare and helping people get to 
those jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will ask for $1 billion to continue a program aimed at  
long-term welfare recipients and low-income fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an increasingly important group of people.  
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at  
the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But state officials and academics alike long have cautioned  
that, at some point, nearly all the people who can move off welfare 
with relative ease will have left. That will leave those with 
deeper problems like substance abuse, domestic violence and very 
little education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're past the situation where someone comes in who may need a  
little bit of confidence building, who may need a brush-up on 
skills and may need a new battery for the car -- all things we can 
do,'' said John Garlinger of the Kansas Department of Social and 
Rehabilitation Services. ``We are left with the hard-core people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas has cut its welfare rolls by 62 percent since 1993. But  
by the end of the last fiscal year, healthy quarterly drops of 8 
percent to 10 percent fell to just 1.7 percent, according to 
figures being released today. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, at least eight states, most of which have seen  
incredible drops since 1993, saw reductions slow to a trickle in 
July, August and September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a difference between the first three quarters of the  
year and the last quarter of the year,'' said Michael Kharfen, a 
Department of Health and Human Services spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say they are preparing to serve welfare  
recipients with tougher problems, moving beyond the ``work first'' 
approach that helps recipients look for work and then pushes them 
to take any job they can find. 
</P>
<P>
	Under work first, states do not try to solve every problem or  
get people the education they may need. They simply try to find 
them jobs, reasoning that work experience will help them move up 
the economic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	But that is not enough for everyone, state officials say.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that after that wave of families went off the rolls,  
the somewhat harder work would begin,'' said Joe Quinn, spokesman 
for the Arkansas Department of Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arkansas, the rolls fell just 2.7 percent in the last quarter  
of fiscal year 1998 after drops of about 9 percent in previous 
quarters, according to figures being released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states seeing dropoffs include Arizona, Connecticut,  
Florida, Massachusetts and North Carolina. New Mexico, after nearly 
cutting its roles in half, actually saw a 40 percent increase 
during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Seasonal variations may explain some of it. In Massachusetts,  
the rolls always stay higher near September, when the state gives 
clothing vouchers for every child on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Reed, Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser, is not  
convinced the decrease has slowed, but says the president's 
proposals will help when it inevitably does. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people thought we'd hit that point a long time ago,''  
he said, ``and more of the people on welfare have responded more 
quickly than anyone anticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to keep it going, Clinton's budget request will include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$1 billion to help 200,000 long-term welfare recipients in  
high-poverty areas move to work. 
</P>
<P>
	--$430 million to give 75,000 housing vouchers that help people  
on welfare move closer to a new job. 
</P>
<P>
	--$150 million in transportation money to help people get to  
jobs, often in suburbs not served by public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	--$530 million to extend the tax credit for businesses that hire  
people off welfare.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Now Haunting Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A computer store removes price  
tags in Brazilian currency and writes them in dollars. General 
Motors Corp. hikes prices and hastily lowers them when the 
government threatens retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ghost of inflation is back to haunt South America's biggest  
economy, days after the government abruptly devalued the real on 
Jan. 12 to stem a hemorrhaging of foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, Brazilians hope this doesn't mean a return to the old  
days of prices that increased 30 times in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation used to make my family's life so complicated: we  
didn't know where we stood from one day to the next,'' said civil 
servant Silvia Santana, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency, left to float freely, has already lost 30 percent  
of its value against the dollar in the last two weeks, prompting 
manufacturers and retailers to try to protect profits with price 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	GM announced last week it was raising prices 12.8 percent and  
Ford Motor Co. said it would do so by 11 percent. Fiat and 
Volkswagen soon followed, also blaming the weak real and cost of 
imported parts. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't the only ones.  
</P>
<P>
	A hotel in the capital Brasilia raised rates by 30 percent. Some  
computer stores in Sao Paulo illegally marked up prices in dollars 
or indexed them to the exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation has plagued the nation for decades. But soaring prices  
were brought to earth when President Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
introduced the Real Plan in 1994 and pegged the real to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	During Cardoso's first term, inflation plummeted from 2,700  
percent a year in 1993 to just 2 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, weeks into Cardoso's second term, Brazil has scrapped  
its inflation-busting plan, battered by global market turbulence 
and investor flight. The six-month drain of some $45 billion in 
foreign reserves proved too severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried about the latest round of inflation, Rio taxi driver  
Fernando Alves de Abreu, 38, remembers when gasoline prices used to 
rise almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very, very difficult, although people just got on with  
it,'' he said. ``This time, if crazy inflation returns they'll take 
to the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Brazilians are already taking a stand against price hikes.  
</P>
<P>
	New car buyers in Belo Horizonte, capital of the central Minas  
Gerais state, are going to court to challenge 30 percent increases 
in monthly payments, which are pegged to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	After tourists at the inflationary hotel in Brasilia denounced  
the hikes, the hotel faces legal action for breaking a consumer 
code that forbids raising prices without justification. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever wants to take advantage of this moment will be  
castigated,'' Communications Minister Pimenta da Veiga warned last 
week, attacking GM and Ford. ``First by public opinion, and then by 
the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of last week, GM hastily decided to lower its 12.8  
percent price rise to 5.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, inflation has yet to hit most Brazilians, but it will  
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We advise families to keep a close eye on prices at the  
supermarket -- their shopping bills are likely to increase up to 10 
percent this year,'' said Marcos Silvestre, director of Brazil's 
Personal Finance Advisory Center, in an interview with CBN radio. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear if the inflation is a one-time adjustment to the  
currency devaluation, or will take hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really in the dark but I believe the government won't  
allow inflation,'' said Anderson Souza, 42, manager of a gift shop 
in Rio. ``It knows how to handle it better now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan agrees. ``Inflation will not come  
back,'' he pledged in Sunday's O Globo newspaper. ``It will be 
controlled by monetary and fiscal policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``During the inflationary era the consumer was obliged to buy  
because he thought the next day or month the price would be 
higher,'' Malan said. ``That's not true now. The consumer has had 
four years to learn he doesn't need to accept every price rise.''

<HEADLINE> Christian Affiliations Seek Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Nine Christian denominations voted Sunday to  
move toward a broad affiliation of churches -- a rare victory in a 
four-decade campaign to unite 20 million Protestants, despite their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do it. We must do it, and we did it,'' said a euphoric  
Vivian Robinson, president of the Consultation on Church Union. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may be too soon to celebrate. Presiding Episcopal Bishop  
Frank T. Griswold noted that the Episcopalians' approval of the 
document depends on the group's success in hashing out leadership 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't resolve this question we might have to go our  
separate ways,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	It was almost 40 years ago that group's Presbyterian and  
Episcopalian founders, citing Jesus' call for ``one faith, one 
baptism, one God,'' called for a Protestant superchurch. When the 
plan was derailed by denominational loyalties and disagreements, 
the group opted for a proposal for church affiliation without 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The new document asks participating churches to declare publicly  
in the year 2002 that they are Churches Uniting in Christ. These 
churches would agree to share one baptism and to recognize one 
another as ``authentic expressions of the one church of Jesus 
Christ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They would also fully accept one another's ministers as  
``instruments of God's grace'' by the year 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	The churches would regularly celebrate Eucharist together and  
join forces to fight racism. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the delegates walked into meetings humming ``Kum Ba  
Ya'' and ``We Shall Overcome,'' tensions persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	The most troubling issue, says the Rev. David W.A. Taylor,  
former general secretary of the union and a Presbyterian minister, 
is one of power and control. ``(It) is the respective place of 
bishops in the life of the church and the whole community of the 
baptized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Episcopalians believe in a succession of bishops dating back  
to the early church as a mark of continuity and unity. In the past, 
the union has asked the Presbyterians, who do not have bishops, to 
add a similar office of oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presbyterians, who favor decentralization and less  
structure, rejected the idea. They have proposed instead 
recognizing a corporate oversight body made up of clergy and lay 
elders. 
</P>
<P>
	The second draft of the document deleted references to bishops,  
a move that upset Griswold. So the delegates approved an amendment 
calling for meetings of church representatives to clarify what it 
means to recognize one another's ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also includes the Christian Church (Disciples of  
Christ), the International Council of Community Churches, the 
United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church, the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion 
Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The last three are black denominations. While some black  
religious leaders have no interest in merging with white churches, 
the Rev. Cyrus Keller, Sr., an African American Episcopal minister, 
believes black churches can have a dramatic impact on the union's 
theology and ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we become recognized as a player on the field there will  
be a difference in the whole approach to being Christian and 
witnessing,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote ended the first formal negotiating session of the  
Consultation on Church Union in more than ten years. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Protestant groups have been involved in other  
negotiations for mutual recognition. Last year, for example, after 
32 years of talks, Presbyterians, Lutherans, and members of the 
United Church of Christ and Reformed Church of America, ratified an 
agreement making shared observance of Communion and exchange of 
pastors possible in the future.

<HEADLINE> Parties Grow Apart in Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two sides in the Senate impeachment trial  
of President Clinton are marching in opposite, and perhaps 
irreconcilable, directions. Gone is the feel-good bipartisanship 
that marked the beginning of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are working hard to bolster an unraveling case  
by keeping up pressure to call Monica Lewinsky and other witnesses, 
perhaps even trying to force the president to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge's surprise order on Saturday to compel Ms.  
Lewinsky to be interviewed by House managers or Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr further hardened positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's defenders, sensing events may be moving their  
way, are attempting to bring matters to a close and are denouncing 
House GOP tactics in rising tones. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, many senators of both parties -- impaneled as judge  
and jury -- seem interested in finding a way out, realizing the 
two-thirds margin to impeach isn't there. Even the option of a 
possible censure reemerged Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakdown of bipartisanship hardly comes as a surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	It was only achieved initially -- with a 100-0 vote on ground  
rules Jan. 8 -- by postponing decisions on the inevitable difficult 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But now the day of reckoning is close, with the Senate moving  
toward twin showdown votes as early as Monday -- one a motion by 
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the charges and end the 
case; and another on a move by House managers to depose witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	While conviction requires two-thirds, or 67 votes, the motions  
require only a simple majority, or 51 votes. Republicans hold a 
55-45 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	These votes are ``likely to fall largely along party lines,''  
conceded John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, simple arithmetic suggests the outcome: the motion to  
dismiss will be rejected and the motion to begin the process of 
hearing witnesses will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	But the votes will be telling about the eventual outcome, if the  
trial moves to a final up or down verdict. Unless there are major 
swings in sentiment, the votes will likely show what many in the 
political process have claimed all along: Clinton won't be removed 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans will carry the witnesses, Democrats will carry the  
verdict,'' said Steven Wayne, a political scientist at Georgetown 
University. ``Partisan sentiment has solidified and public opinion 
has solidified. What we'll have is a trial when you already know 
the outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Party lines began to harden dramatically on Friday when Byrd,  
one of the Senate's most respected and independent voices, 
announced his motion to dismiss the charges and end the impeachment 
trial, saying the needed two-thirds for conviction ``are not there 
and ... are not likely to develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That served to unify Democrats.  
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come to bring this matter to a close,'' Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	Partisan fever grew to near the boiling point Saturday after  
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled -- on a request by 
Starr on House prosecutors' behalf -- that Ms. Lewinsky had to 
submit to an interview with Starr or the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	White House defenders cried foul and both sides sniped at each  
other in the form of written questions to the two legal teams, read 
by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	It made much more difficult the task of finding any middle  
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., raised the subject of a possible  
censure motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no constitutional barrier to the Senate's passing a  
censure motion,'' said White House counsel Charles Ruff, adding 
that Clinton had ``said he's prepared to accept'' such a rebuke.	   Still, there hasn't been much talk among Republicans for such an 
exit route. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is leading ``where it was always destined to go: to an  
acquittal of Clinton,'' said University of Virginia Larry Sabato. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he detected a GOP shift in strategy over the past few  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key in the end is whether a majority of the Senate joins a  
majority of the House. That's why the party lines are hardening 
now. Republicans know they have no chance of achieving 67 votes and 
their goal now is a much more limited one: to make sure their side 
doesn't collapse.''

<HEADLINE> Plants Send Out Chemical Signals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIFTON, Ga. (AP) -- Like a microscopic 911 call, plants can  
summon an insect rescue squad when they are attacked by pests. In 
fact, researchers say, the signal is specific enough to tell the 
helpful bugs exactly what to expect when they arrive on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have known for years that plants could send out  
distress calls to wasps and other insect bodyguards, but Department 
of Agriculture researchers say they are just beginning to 
understand how sophisticated the messages can be. They hope to find 
out more about the signals and eventually use them to develop 
chemical-free pest control systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll always use pesticides,'' said USDA entomologist Joe  
Lewis, a veteran biological control researcher. ``But they should 
be the backup. Now we're using them as the first line of defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using beneficial insects to help control pests will save farmers  
money and be better for the environment, Lewis added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our growers are going to have to find a better way, doing what  
nature did before pesticides,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During three years of research at the University of Georgia's  
Coastal Plain Experiment Station in Tifton, entomologist Consuelo 
De Moraes showed that cotton, corn and tobacco plants send out one 
signal when they're being attacked by corn ear worms and another 
when they're being attacked by tobacco bud worms. 
</P>
<P>
	The two caterpillars attack numerous crops and cost U.S. farmers  
about $6 billion a year in lost crops and pesticide expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants summon a black, half-inch parasitic wasp, known as  
cardiochiles nigriceps, that is a natural enemy of the 
caterpillars. The wasp, a species common on Southern farms, lays an 
egg in the caterpillar. The egg then becomes a larvae which 
consumes the caterpillar. It crawls into the ground, wraps itself 
in a cocoon and emerges as a new wasp. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that somebody proved that plants  
produce a different response to different caterpillars,'' said De 
Moraes, one of a group of USDA scientists working at the Tifton 
experiment station. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis called De Moraes' work a ``benchmark.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Her work went another step,'' said Lewis, who has been  
studying biological pest controls for at least 20 years. ``Not only 
are they sending out a cue, they are saying, `Here's where it is 
and here's what it is.''' The plants also sweeten the deal by 
producing nectar to feed the wasps, giving them an incentive to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the signal, the wasps can't always find the deceptive  
caterpillars, who usually move to a new location after eating and 
discard their feces to minimize their scent. 
</P>
<P>
	De Moraes was doing routine work in 1996 as a graduate student  
when she noticed wasps congregating on plants that were being 
attacked, but not on plants that were free of the caterpillars. 
Through a series of tests, she proved that the wasps were 
responding to chemical signals emitted by the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	She then analyzed the chemical compounds using gas  
chromatography and found they were different for each type of 
caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how evolutionary forces shape the system,'' said  
De Moraes, a native of Brazil who earned her doctorate at the 
University of Georgia and published her results in the journal 
Nature last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Karban, an entomologist at the University of  
California-Davis, said De Moraes' work shows how specific the 
plants' distress signals can be. Karban studies the physical 
responses of plants to pest attacks. He's shown that some develop a 
tougher skin, some become less tasty and some produce chemicals 
that are harmful to the pests. 
</P>
<P>
	``In nature, there are natural ways to keep the pests in  
check,'' he said. ``Their work helps us understand how it happens. 
It can be a real advance in terms of taking advantage or 
manipulating those responses to our benefit.''

<HEADLINE> Four Escape From Louisiana Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANGOLA, La. (AP) -- Four convicted murderers escaped Sunday  
afternoon after tying up another inmate and a worker at the state 
prison. One of the inmates died after shooting himself in the head 
upon arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrel Crider and Roy McFall were captured shortly after the  
break, while Donald Wooley and Jerry Davis were arrested without 
incident in the woods about five hours later, said Cathy Jett, a 
spokeswoman for the Louisiana State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
	McFall shot himself upon arrest and died hours later in a New  
Orleans hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he would rather die than go back to prison,'' Ms. Jett  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jett did not know how he got a gun.  
</P>
<P>
	Each of the men was serving life sentences for murder, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The men who were tied up during the escape were not harmed, she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Bears Go With Coach Choice No. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- It took one of the NFL's oldest  
franchises two tries, a public relations disaster and a really red 
face to figure out the right way to hire a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing Dave McGinnis' hiring before offering him the job?  
Wrong way. Getting second-choice Dick Jauron? Right way. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears introduced Jauron as their new coach Sunday,  
one day after McGinnis withdrew his name and flew back to Phoenix, 
still upset the Bears had announced his hiring before he'd been 
offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how good it feels to stand here in front of  
you,'' said Jauron, defensive coordinator at Jacksonville the past 
four seasons. ``To stand here as the head coach of the Chicago 
Bears gives me a great feeling inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Michael McCaskey was feeling equally warm and  
fuzzy about putting the last two days behind him. Talks with 
McGinnis, a former Chicago assistant, broke down over the Bears' 
overeagerness to name him coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite McCaskey's attempts to smooth things over Friday and  
Saturday morning, McGinnis decided he was better off keeping his 
job as Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	So McCaskey got back on the telephone. He called Jauron's former  
bosses -- Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin and Seattle coach Mike 
Holmgren -- and both said Jauron was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, who worked with Jauron when  
they were assistants under Holmgren in Green Bay, even called from 
Mexico to put in a good word. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to them about Dick's credentials and readiness to  
be a head coach, they couldn't have been more enthusiastic,'' said 
McCaskey, who looked visibly relieved. ``It's the right time and 
he's the right guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears didn't disclose terms of Jauron's contract, other than  
to say it was ``multi-year.'' He replaces Dave Wannstedt, who was 
fired almost four weeks ago. His hiring also closes out an active 
offseason in which nine NFL teams -- including the expansion 
Cleveland Browns -- had openings. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Bears' disaster with McGinnis, Jauron said he didn't  
think twice about taking the job. A candidate for the Indianapolis 
job last season, Jauron was disappointed when the Bears chose 
McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
	So when McCaskey called Saturday afternoon, it didn't take long  
for Jauron to say yes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any control over that situation. It was between  
Dave and the organization,'' Jauron said. ``The only thing I wanted 
to know was where it stood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for being the second choice, Jauron has no problem with that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Two years from now, if I've done well, they'll say I'm a good  
coach,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron knows he's not stepping into an easy job. The Bears have  
had back-to-back 4-12 seasons, and haven't made the playoffs since 
1994. They haven't sent a player to the Pro Bowl since the 1994 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	And fans have just about had it with the once-proud team.  
Soldier Field was rarely filled, with 26,000 people opting to sit 
home for the Dec. 20 game against the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you get a chance to take over a lot of teams  
that are doing well,'' Jauron said. ``It isn't going to be easy, 
but it's going to be a great challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron, 48, was drafted by the Detroit Lions out of Yale. As a  
rookie, he started at strong safety against the Bears and 
intercepted three passes, returning one for a touchdown. His 167 
interception return yards are still a record for a Bears opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Lions waived him in 1978, he was picked up by the  
Cincinnati Bengals and stayed with them until suffering a knee 
injury in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his coaching career in 1985 with the Buffalo Bills, and  
moved to Green Bay the next season. He stayed in Green Bay for nine 
years until Coughlin made him the expansion Jaguars' defensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly seems well-spoken and intelligent, and he's got  
good ideas about where we're going,'' said defensive tackle Jim 
Flanigan. ``(McGinnis' hiring) was definitely a weird situation and 
unfortunately, the organization had to go through that. I think in 
the long run, this will probably be better for us. 
</P>
<P>
	''Let's move on.''

<HEADLINE> Key Dates in Olympic Bribe Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key events in the Olympic bribery scandal:  
</P>
<P>
	June 16, 1995: Salt Lake City wins bid to hold the 2002 Winter  
Olympics, receiving 54 of the 89 votes cast within the 
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nov. 24, 1998: Salt Lake TV station KTVX reports that the Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee paid for a ``scholarship'' for Sonia 
Essomba, daughter of the late IOC member Rene Essomba of Cameroon, 
to attend American University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Nov. 25: SLOC chairman Bob Garff, responding to the reports  
about tuition assistance to IOC relatives, described the program as 
a ``humanitarian effort'' but denies it was a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 8: SLOC President Frank Joklik reveals that 13 individuals  
received a total of $393,871 in financial aid or scholarships from 
the committee. Six were relatives of IOC members. The program began 
in 1991 after Salt Lake City lost the 1998 Olympic bid to Nagano, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 10: IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch opens an internal  
investigation of SLOC's payments to IOC relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 12: Top IOC member Marc Hodler alleges that corruption and  
vote-buying has determined the locations of the Olympics in 
Atlanta, Nagano, Salt Lake City, and Sydney. He estimates that 5 to 
7 percent of IOC members have solicited bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 13: Samaranch says there was ``no possibility'' that Salt  
Lake City would be stripped of the 2002 games, regardless of the 
internal probe's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 14: Intermountain Health Care details the free medical  
services it provided to three Africans connected to the IOC. The 
nearly $28,000 in health care included hepatitis treatment, plastic 
surgery, and knee joint replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 16: A spokesman for Salt Lake Mayor Deedee Corradini, who  
was on the SLOC bid committee, says the city hired the son of an 
IOC member as an intern, later identified as the son of IOC member 
David Sikhulumi Sibandze of Swaziland. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 17: Japanese media report that Nagano bid committee spent  
on average $22,000 per member on each of 62 visiting IOC members -- 
in violation of strict IOC spending limits. All accounting records 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 21: Samaranch says IOC members will be banned from further  
travel to Olympic bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 22: Former Sen. George Mitchell is named to head a  
five-member investigating commission for the U.S. Olympic Committee 
to look into bribery and corruption allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 23: The Justice Department and FBI formally open an  
investigation into whether bribery, fraud or public corruption laws 
may have been broken by the SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 7, 1999: The Associated Press reports that IOC member  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo earned $60,000 profit on 
a land deal arranged through a member of the Salt Lake bid 
committee. Major sponsor US West says it will withhold a $5 million 
payment to SLOC until it can answer questions about the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 8: Joklik and senior vice president David Johnson resign.  
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 11: IOC's investigating committee sends letter to 13  
members implicated in the scandal, demanding explanations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 14: Samaranch says nine IOC members face possible expulsion  
for ``serious'' offenses in the Salt Lake scandal and four others 
face minor charges. He also says it was the IOC's hope the games 
stay in Salt Lake City, and that he plans to stay in office until 
his term expires in 2001. USOC official Alfredo La Mont, the head 
of international relations, resigns amid allegations he worked with 
SLOC to secure information about Latin American IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 15: Samaranch announces a special IOC meeting on March  
17-18 to deal with possible discipline of its members. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 16: Sponsor US West gives a $5 million check to the SLOC --  
a payment the sponsor had previously said it was withholding until 
it received assurances that the scandal would not interfere with 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 19: Pirjo Haeggman of Finland resigns, the first IOC member  
to quit in the scandal. Her ex-husband reportedly worked briefly 
for the Salt Lake bid committee and for 20 months in an Ontario 
government job initiated by the Toronto committee bidding for the 
1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 20: USOC marketing director says two companies that were  
close to final agreement on Salt Lake City sponsorships had ``asked 
that the announcement of sponsorship be withheld until the results 
of the investigation are behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 22: Samaranch accepts the resignation of a second IOC  
member, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya, whose son reportedly 
received tuition to attend an English language center at Brigham 
Young and a community college, plus $700 a month for expenses from 
Salt Lake bidders. It is also disclosed that in 1993, on the night 
before Sydney won the 2000 Games by two votes over Beijing, the 
head of the Australian Olympic Committee offered two IOC members 
$70,000 in inducements to vote for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 23: The IOC begins meeting in Lausanne to consider actions  
against its members in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 24: IOC recommends the expulsion of six members for  
violating their Olympic oath in the scandal. A third member, 
Sibandze, resigns. Three others remain under investigation and a 
fourth was warned about his actions by the ruling executive board. 
Samaranch says the Salt Lake City and Sydney games would not be 
moved, although officials would be sent to Australia to investigate 
the situation there.

<HEADLINE> Gene May Aid in Anti-Smoking Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have identified another gene that might affect how  
vulnerable a person is to cigarette addiction. The finding may help 
researchers develop new ways to stop smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a certain form of the gene makes it easier to kick the  
habit, or perhaps to avoid getting hooked in the first place, two 
studies suggest. But that apparent influence is modest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just one small piece of the puzzle'' of what  
influences smoking behavior, said psychologist Caryn Lerman, an 
author of one of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerman is director of cancer genetics at the Lombardi Cancer  
Center of Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. Her 
work and a follow-up study by Dr. Dean Hamer of the National Cancer 
Institute and colleagues appear in this month's issue of the 
journal Health Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	It's at least the third gene to show evidence of an effect on  
smoking. Scientists hope that by understanding such biological 
influences, they can tailor treatments to particular smokers and 
get hints for finding better therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ernest P. Noble, a psychiatry professor at the University of  
California, Los Angeles, who studies the genetics of smoking, said 
the evidence that the gene influences smoking isn't very strong, 
though he added: I believe it is a real effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ken Kidd, a Yale University geneticist who has studied the  
genetic marker used by the researchers, criticized the design of 
the studies and analysis of the results. ``I do not accept their 
conclusions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicotine causes a surge of a substance called dopamine between  
certain brain cells. That feels good to the brain, so it encourages 
addiction. Brain cells use squirts of dopamine to communicate, and 
the gene in the new research tells brain cells how to make a 
structure called a transporter that mops the chemical up. 
</P>
<P>
	Why would one version of this gene discourage nicotine  
addiction? 
</P>
<P>
	Lerman and colleagues theorize that it leads to a less efficient  
dopamine transporter, which leaves more dopamine between the brain 
cells. That might reduce a person's desire to pump up dopamine 
levels by using nicotine, they suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamer's team found that people with the apparently protective  
version of the gene scored lower than other people on 
novelty-seeking, a personality trait that includes impulsiveness 
and an interest in experiencing new sensations. Novelty-seeking 
might promote cigarette addiction, so scoring lower on this trait 
might also be protective, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerman and colleagues studied 289 smokers and 233 people  
considered nonsmokers because they had smoked fewer than 100 
cigarettes in their lifetimes. The apparently protective version of 
the transporter gene appeared in 56 percent of nonsmokers vs. just 
47 percent of smokers. That suggests it helped people avoid getting 
hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokers with that version reported longer periods of abstaining  
in the past, compared to other smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamer's group found no sign that the gene affects whether a  
person gets hooked, but results suggested it can help smokers quit. 
The study compared the frequency of the gene version in smokers, 
former smokers and people who'd never smoked significantly, with a 
total of 1,107 participants.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Vote Began With a Slave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In early 1854, at the opening of a saga that  
would one day lead to a vote to save a president, a newspaper 
typesetter named Edmund Ross joined a mob and helped free a 
fugitive slave. 
</P>
<P>
	For Ross it was the beginning of a chain of events that would  
lead to a seat in the United States Senate, a decisive voice in the 
impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson and the searing condemnation of 
millions of his fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	But all of that was 14 years in the future when Ross left the  
printing shop of the newspaper he worked for in Milwaukee and 
joined rioters battering down a jail door. The mob freed Joshua 
Glover, captured under the Fugitive Slave Act. 
</P>
<P>
	There is renewed interest in Ross this year as President Clinton  
is on trial in the Senate after his impeachment by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest was originally stirred in 1956 when Sen. John F.  
Kennedy, in ``Profiles in Courage,'' singled out Ross for a vote 
which not only allowed Johnson to stay in office but maintained the 
presidency as a constitutional equal with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding the fate of a president was beyond imagining for a  
Milwaukee typesetter in 1854. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue that dominated debate that year was the newly passed  
Kansas-Nebraska Act. It polarized slave and free states by 
overturning earlier compromises that kept slavery confined to the 
South. Local voters could now decide if Kansas and Nebraska would 
enter the Union as free or slave states. 
</P>
<P>
	Inevitably, that set off a race between abolition and  
pro-slavery settlers who flocked to the territories to sway the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In May of 1856, Edmund Ross joined the race.  
</P>
<P>
	Ross, 28, led a small train of ox-drawn wagons and settlers out  
of Milwaukee on a three-month trek across the plains to a place so 
inflamed by civil strife it was called ``Bloody Kansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kansas, the Ohio-born Ross became a leader of the free-state  
movement and an anti-slavery publisher. He joined the Republican 
party and was a member of the convention that wrote the 
constitution that eventually brought Kansas into the Union as a 
free state. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Civil War broke out Ross left his newspaper office and  
recruited an infantry company. At war's end, Maj. Edmund Ross, who 
had two horses shot out from under him in just one day of battle, 
returned to newspapering. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a gunshot changed his life.  
</P>
<P>
	In July 1866, Sen. James H. Lane, R-Kan., also a Republican,  
committed suicide. The state's governor sought someone with 
``backbone'' to replace him and turned to Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	The new senator had no liking for Andrew Johnson's policies. He  
arrived in Washington as the impeachment fight broke out in 
earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds majority, or 36 votes, was needed to convict and  
force Democrat Johnson from the White House. Unlike others, Ross 
told no one how he would vote. His vote became crucial. 
</P>
<P>
	When the chief justice began the roll call on the first article  
of impeachment on May 16, 1868, the silence was so intense that 
senators on the floor could hear the tinkling of a woman's earring 
in the public gallery overhead. Ross called the silence 
``deathlike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross voted ``not guilty'' three times, once on the 16th, twice  
more after a ten-day recess. All three tallies were 35-19 for 
conviction -- one vote short of the two-thirds vote needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction was volcanic.  
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately the rope with which Judas Iscariot hanged  
himself is lost, but Jim Lane's pistol is at your service,'' read 
one telegram from Kansas. He was vilified across the north, 
threatened, hanged in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This storm of passion will soon pass away (though) none but  
God can ever know the struggle it has cost me,'' Ross wrote his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross was denied reelection in 1872. He was again defeated when  
he switched parties and ran for governor as a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was one more act.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 1880s, after an exploratory trip, Ross moved his family  
to New Mexico territory where he ran a newspaper, wrote articles, 
opened a job printing shop and, after studying law, opened a law 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Grover Cleveland, the first Democrat since Johnson to occupy the  
White House, named Ross governor of the New Mexico territory. His 
return to public service lasted four years, ending when Republicans 
reclaimed the presidency four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	By then it was time to justify the past.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1896 Ross published a book, ``The Impeachment and Trial of  
Andrew Johnson.'' It accuses violently partisan Republicans of 
trying to force Johnson's ouster to make Congress the dominant 
force in American government. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Ross not only wrote the book, he set the type himself.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pete Rose Jr. Gives It Another Try </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Another spring training is at hand, another  
chance for Pete Rose Jr. to think this could be the year it finally 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of baseball's hit king is 29 now and coming off one of  
his most discouraging seasons, one that started in the Cincinnati 
Reds' farm system and ended on a college field in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of taking that last step to the big leagues, he wound up  
in a free fall to the bottom of pro ball, landing on an independent 
league team. And now he's hoping to bounce back up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good experience,'' he said in a recent interview.  
``Not that I've ever taken anything for granted, but I was at the 
bottom of the barrel. Now I'm going to a big league camp with a 
Triple-A contract and a chance to make the big leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Los Angeles Dodgers offered him a Triple-A contract and  
invited him to spring training, Rose didn't hesitate. His dream of 
sticking in the major leagues was as strong as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them, 'You want me to sign it in blood?' I hope they  
give me a look,'' Rose said. ``I think it's a good chance to make 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stocky infielder with his father's name and looks has been  
trying to make it since 1989, when the Baltimore Orioles drafted 
him in the 13th round. He spent his first six years at the lowest 
levels of pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Things started to happen when the Cincinnati Reds -- his dad's  
team -- signed him on Dec. 13, 1996. He had his best season at 
Double-A in 1997, hitting .308 with 25 homers and 98 RBIs in 112 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 1 that year, with his famous father sitting in the  
front row, Rose Jr. made his major league debut at first base for 
the Reds and got a single. He had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	But not for long. He didn't start again and went 2-for-14  
overall with nine strikeouts and a pair of walks. Then he got into 
a contract dispute with the Reds and wasn't invited to spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened last year at Triple-A Indianapolis and hit .277 with  
three homers, but got passed over by younger prospects and wasn't 
playing much. When the Reds gave him the choice of taking a 
demotion to Double-A or free agency, he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Things kept going downhill. He latched on with Pittsburgh's  
Triple-A club in Nashville, but hit only .208 and was released a 
month later. He ended up with the New Jersey Jackals, playing on a 
cramped college field. 
</P>
<P>
	While there, he declined interviews -- ``I didn't talk to anybody  
because I was not there to talk, I was there to play baseball and 
let my playing do my talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went on the tough road trips to hardscrabble fields in  
obscure places. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you feel like you're back in rookie ball, back on the  
buses,'' he said. ``But, hey, you've got to do what you've got to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he heard the cynics say he should just quit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking to myself, 'I'm 29, not 39,''' Rose said.  
``There's no reason to think about it. People say, 'Are you ready 
to retire?' No. The way I take care of myself, I've got at least 
another 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, he dedicated himself to the weight room, the  
place where he added the muscle that led to his breakthrough season 
in the minors two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in probably my best shape ever,'' he said. ``I weigh 240,  
but I'm leaner than I've ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's gotten used to the idea of playing for the Dodgers instead  
of rooting against them. When his father was piling up those 4,256 
hits, the Dodgers were one of the Reds' biggest rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny,'' he said. ``All those years I used to hate the  
Dodgers, being from Cincinnati and being a Red and with dad. And 
now, I woke up one morning and I liked Dodger blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mainly, he likes having another chance.

<HEADLINE> IOC Mulls Action on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- With the future of the Olympics at  
stake, IOC leaders met Sunday to decide whether members should be 
expelled in connection with the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, intent on restoring its credibility, planned a news  
conference at which IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is to 
announce proposed expulsions of members and reforms of the Olympic 
site-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's executive board met for more than three hours  
Sunday morning for a final review of the report and to make 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president and executive board member  
from the United States, said the meetings will be vital for the 
future of the world's largest sports event. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hope is the athletes of the world understand we're very  
serious about making sure the games continue,'' she said as she 
left her hotel for IOC headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sydney will host the (2000) games, Salt Lake will host the  
(2002) games. Anyone who violates their oath of office can't be a 
part of the Olympic movement. The end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A six-man IOC investigative panel concluded its report Sunday  
morning into the cash payments, scholarships and other favors tied 
to Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which met for 15 hours Saturday and reconvened early  
Sunday, reported its findings to the IOC executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials said the executive board began its own meeting to  
consider the evidence and make final recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen members were cited for accepting inducements --  
reportedly totaling close to $800,000 -- from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 13 members -- Finland's Pirjo Haeggman and Libya's  
Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi -- resigned this week. Samaranch said 
another seven could face expulsion orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said six members appeared before the inquiry commission  
in person Saturday to defend themselves. They were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who didn't appear will be judged on written replies  
submitted earlier to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations of the board will be put to a special  
meeting of the general assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	If members found guilty of corruption refuse to resign, their  
case will go to the assembly, where a two-thirds vote is required 
for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the implicated members have said they will fight  
rather than be ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, who has been accused  
of accepting at least $70,000 of cash inducements, has defiantly 
proclaimed his innocence and vowed he'll never resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Santander, the IOC member from Chile who was among the  
six delegates questioned Saturday, said he did nothing wrong and 
indicated he had no plans to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain that I didn't act incorrectly at any moment,''  
Santander said in Lausanne on Sunday. ``Whatever happens today, I 
will stay in a calm and secure position in the belief that truth 
will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santander was implicated after Tom Welch, the former Salt Lake  
bid and organizing committee chief, said he donated $10,000 to 
Santander's campaign for mayor of Santigo, Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudanese IOC member Gen. Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel-Gadir  
expressed confidence he would be cleared. He was among those who 
had replied to the accusations in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders were also seeking to control the damage from the  
latest revelations in the unfolding crisis -- that Australian 
officials used financial inducements to help Sydney win the right 
to stage the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper said Saturday  
he saw nothing ``sinister'' in the $70,000 inducements offered by 
Australia's Olympics chief to two African IOC members the night 
before Sydney won the vote for the 2000 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney beat Beijing 45-43 in the secret balloting in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the IOC would discuss the Australian payments on  
Sunday and could order a full-scale investigation of Sydney's bid. 
He said he would propose that the board reaffirm that the games 
will go ahead in Sydney and Salt Lake.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Decline Hurts Tiny Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAFT, Calif. (AP) -- At Howard Supply Co., dog food is selling  
better than the gaskets, couplers and well fittings that for 
decades helped keep crude flowing from the giant Midway-Sunset oil 
field nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the store opened in 1944, Howard Supply has survived in  
this tiny central California town by selling heavy-duty hardware 
unique to the oil patch. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a historic slide in crude prices, oil producers large  
and small are shutting down wells and laying off employees. At 
Howard Supply, sales are down 80 percent, forcing store manager 
Hope Binkley to move the oil gear to a back room and experiment 
with new products, like pet food and veterinary supplies that might 
appeal to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to find something,'' said Binkley, who has worked for  
oil-dependent businesses since 1976. ``I've seen a lot of ups and 
downs, and this is by far the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price sag that has helped fuel the nation's long economic  
boom has turned into a big bust in Taft and other towns across 
America that depend on oil. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, large companies including Atlantic Richfield  
Co., Occidental Petroleum, Texaco Inc. and Conoco Inc. have 
announced plans to lay off thousands of employees and curtail 
drilling and exploration worldwide. Smaller drilling, marketing and 
service companies are doing likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Baker Hughes Inc. said the number of oil and gas rigs  
operating in the United States has fallen to its lowest level since 
it began tracking rig counts in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn also has prompted mergers of big players. Exxon  
Corp. plans to acquire Mobil Corp. while Amoco Corp. has teamed up 
with British Petroleum Co. PLC. There have been rumors of a union 
between Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch-Shell. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kern County, California's biggest oil producing region, about  
1,000 of an estimated 12,000 oil workers have been laid off or will 
be in coming months, said Hal Bopp, deputy director in the 
Bakersfield office of the state Division of Oil and Gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices are at their lowest levels since the Depression.  
Light sweet crude traded at $12.28 per barrel on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange on Friday, but the price for the heavy crude 
pumped from most wells in Kern County is even lower, around $7 a 
barrel, $1 or more per barrel less than it costs to get it out of 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going broke,'' said James Hall, president of Drilling &AMP;  
Production Co., a small company that operates about 30 wells. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Hall imposed a 20 percent pay cut on himself and his  
10 employees to avoid layoffs. Even with the cuts, he's not sure he 
can survive another year at current price levels. Most of his 
employees are looking for new jobs outside the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman Darin Holden, 33, advised Hall this week that he would  
be gone by summer, when his wife is due to deliver the couple's 
third child. After the pay cut, Mrs. Holden went back to work, but 
even with the added income, they've exhausted their savings to pay 
their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Other employees tell similar stories.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just to make everyday expenses you raid your retirement  
account, you raid the college funds you set up for your kids,'' 
said Mike Pilatti, 42, a father of three. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions are especially tough for small, independent producers  
such as Drilling &AMP; Production that operate ``stripper'' wells, 
those that produce less than 10 barrels a day. Independents depend 
exclusively on crude prices for their profit margins. Big oil 
producers such as Chevron or Texaco can build profit into the 
retail sale of gasoline and other petroleum products. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Drilling &AMP; Production's 30 wells, about half are in  
operation, each yielding one to five barrels a day. On a recent 
afternoon, Holden was trying to figure out whether it was worth the 
cost of repairs needed to bring six more into production. With the 
producing wells already in the red at $7 a barrel, there seemed to 
be little point in spending thousands of dollars to bring more 
money losers on line. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, such stripper wells yield about 1.2 million barrels  
a day, about 20 percent of U.S. production and roughly the equal to 
the amount imported from Saudi Arabia. Should stripper operators go 
out of business, the nation's dependence on foreign oil will rise 
and a skilled work force will be lost, independent operators say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you lose workers, they're not coming back,'' said Les  
Clark, vice president of the Independent Oil Producers' Agency, a 
marketer that represents about 40 California independents. 
``They'll get solid jobs and stay away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holden counts himself among those not likely to return. When  
recession hit the industry in 1986, he was the first let go from 
Drilling &AMP; Production's payroll. He stayed in the industry that 
time, working another job at nearly half his previous pay until 
being rehired in 1992. The personal price of that downturn included 
the breakup of his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was bankrupt and divorced all in the same week. I'm not  
going to relive that,'' said Holden, who later remarried. ``It'll 
be hard to leave here. I like the industry, but you have to look to 
the future, and right now I don't see any future.''

<HEADLINE> 40 Witnesses at Johnson Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forty witnesses provided the Perry Mason  
moments at President Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial in 1868. 
Congressmen, a postmaster, military officers, journalists -- even 
the Senate's keeper of stationery -- took the stand for and against 
his removal. 
</P>
<P>
	They recounted the wild day the Secretary of War was booted from  
his post, the action that led to Johnson's impeachment. They gave 
colorful reports of the president's speeches across the nation. 
Sometimes their testimony prompted chuckles from the Senate jurors, 
breaking the tension of the country's first presidential 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike President Clinton's trial, the question then was not  
whether to have witnesses, but who would be allowed to take the 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, 24 witnesses appeared for the prosecution and 15 for  
the defense. One more, President Johnson's secretary, William 
Moore, was called by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``The witnesses weren't of any great importance,'' said Hans  
Trefousse, a historian who has written extensively on the Johnson 
impeachment. ``The question was not about the facts, but whether 
his actions were impeachable or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the contrary, said another historian, Michael Les Benedict.  
He insists the testimony was crucial. It exposed frays in the House 
prosecutors' case and helped sway seven Republican senators to 
break party ranks and vote for Johnson's acquittal, he said. That 
was just enough to acquit Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the trial looked to be a simple case of Johnson  
defying the Office of Tenure Act, which made it illegal for the 
president to fire cabinet officers without the Senate's consent, 
Benedict said. Angered by Johnson's views on Reconstruction, House 
Republicans went after Johnson when he fired Secretary of War Edwin 
Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the case started, I think everybody thought they had  
Johnson dead to rights,'' Benedict said. ``He appeared to have 
defied the plain words of a law. As the testimony was being 
offered, I think most of the senators were very surprised at how 
weak the House's case was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors argued that Johnson violated the act,  
obstructed legislation aimed at reuniting the nation after the 
Civil War and tried to bring Congress into ridicule in his 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers retorted that the Tenure of Office Act  
was unconstitutional. Anyway, they said, it didn't apply to Johnson 
because President Lincoln had appointed the war secretary, not 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also argued that Johnson's decision to replace  
Stanton with Adjutant Gen. Lorenzo Thomas was simply the 
president's way to nudge the courts into deciding whether the 
Tenure of Office Act was constitutional. He was just trying to 
force a court test, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first witnesses was J.W. Jones, keeper of the Senate  
stationery. As his testimony began, it became clear that the trial 
was going to bog down quickly in irrelevant minutia. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones testified how he tracked down Thomas at a masquerade ball  
to serve him notice that the president had named him acting 
secretary of war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was he masked?'' House prosecutor Rep. Ben Butler asked Jones.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was,'' Jones replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``How did you know it was him?'' Butler inquired.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw his shoulder straps and I asked him to unmask,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And so it went, witness after witness.  
</P>
<P>
	Much testimony focused on the events of Feb. 22, 1868, the day  
Thomas strode over to the War Department to oust Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stated that I came in to demand the office,'' Thomas  
testified. ``He refused to give it to me and ordered me to my room 
as adjutant general. I refused to obey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Stanton told Thomas: ``You may stand there; stand as long as  
you please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then Stanton poured the two equal amounts of whiskey.  
``Now,'' Stanton told Thomas, ``this at least is neutral ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a third of the witnesses were journalists or shorthand  
takers, who were questioned in detail about their skills and 
whether the president really uttered the words published in 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen pages of the trial transcript are devoted to  
parsing newspaper accounts of a speech Johnson made in St. Louis. 
In the speech, Johnson said his opponents compare themselves to 
``the Savior of men'' and everyone who disagrees with them a 
``Judas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure he did not speak `Judas' four times?'' the House  
prosecutor asked Henry Zider, a newspaper reporter from St. Louis 
in the race toward trivia.

<HEADLINE> Firm Faces Medicare Fraud Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The owner of a health care agency  
who pleaded guilty to Medicare fraud charges has been sentenced to 
six years in prison and ordered to repay $12.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Dominguez, a 56-year-old Cuban immigrant, was one of 34 at  
Amitan health care agency who were indicted on charges they billed 
the federal government for more than $14 million of unnecessary and 
unperformed treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominguez told U.S. District Judge William P. Dimitrouleas that  
he was ``repentful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Amitan created false medical records that were  
signed by nurses and doctors, and had subcontractors that kept 
pools of patients who didn't qualify for home health care yet 
submitted bills for their treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three defendants have pleaded guilty so far. Dominguez's  
partner in Amitan, Rene Corvo, is expected to go on trial in early 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	In an even larger case of Medicare fraud, Dominguez and eight  
others have pleaded guilty to a $45 million Medicare fraud scheme 
at the St. Johns Home Health Agency. They are awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Pope Criticizes Some U.S. Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrives on American soil  
this week with a skeptical view of American policies and the way 
Americans live. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes the U.S. government is too cavalier about dropping  
bombs on adversaries and resorts too often to economic embargoes. 
Americans in general, the pontiff thinks, spend their money too 
frivolously and are too indifferent about the plight of the world's 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this is expected to dampen the enthusiasm that will  
greet John Paul when he arrives in St. Louis from Mexico for a 
30-hour visit Tuesday, which starts with a 45-minute meeting with 
President Clinton in a hangar at the airport. No one knows whether 
the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky will be a topic. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official, speaking privately, said Clinton is  
expected to defend his policies towards Cuba, Iraq, the Middle East 
peace process and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	According to estimates, upwards of 600,000 may turn out, weather  
permitting. It will be the sixth time John Paul will have set foot 
on American territory in two decades as pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, John Paul assailed U.S.-British air strikes against  
Iraq as ``aggression.'' And in his annual speech to diplomats Jan. 
11, the pope said the bombing campaign showed ``once more that war 
does not solve problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It complicates them, and leaves the civilian population to  
bear the tragic consequences,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tad Szulc, who has written a biography of John Paul, said, ``He  
gets upset every time we bomb somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Drew Christiansen, a senior fellow at the Woodstock  
Theological Center in Washington, said: ``The Holy Father has been 
very clear in his condemnation of use of force and in his 
conviction that issues must be resolved diplomatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope believes that military forces should be limited to  
rescue operations 99.9 per cent of the time, Christiansen said. One 
occasion when the Vatican appeared to acquiesce in the use of force 
was in Bosnia in 1995, when Bosnian Serb positions were the target 
of U.S.-led air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen said the ``nonviolent action'' used by East  
Europeans against their communist rulers was, in the pope's view, 
the model of how to deal with totalitarian regimes. While welcoming 
the demise of communism, the pope believes that ``savage 
capitalism'' exploits workers and is no less an evil. 
</P>
<P>
	He decries Third World countries' debt burden and advocates debt  
relief. He opposes economic sanctions against Iraq and other 
countries because, he believes, they don't work and add to the 
suffering of society's poorest members. 
</P>
<P>
	He laments the failure of the United States and the West in  
general to spare Rwanda from the ethnic violence that claimed more 
than 500,000 lives in 1994. Clinton has acknowledged he was remiss 
in not doing more. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Middle East, Vatican spokesmen reject Israel's claim to  
an undivided Jerusalem, and the United States says the fate of the 
city should be decided in negotiations between Israelis and 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences, the pope can hardly be described as  
anti-American. One U.S. official, declining to be quoted by name, 
said, ``We don't agree all of the time. We agree much of the 
time.'' A key area of agreement, he says, is the need for increased 
democracy and protection of human rights in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	During the pope's groundbreaking visit to Cuba a year ago, his  
critiques of the U.S. embargo against Cuba were brief and 
infrequent. In contrast, he repeatedly stressed the need for 
freedom and a rebirth of moral and spiritual values on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenes of the pope traveling around Cuba may have softened  
American attitudes, making possible subsequent administration steps 
to remove obstacles to private humanitarian relief efforts for 
needy Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen recalls papal criticism during previous U.S. visits  
of the ``sin of indifference'' among economic elites and of the 
``materialism, consumerism and superdevelopment'' of American 
society. The pope also has been critical of the widespread use of 
abortion and capital punishment in the United States, intervening 
on several occasions to try to stop executions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine  
America, believes international topics could dominate the papal 
agenda in the meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees the United States as the most prosperous country in  
the world, having a moral responsibility, not just as a matter of 
charity but of justice,'' Reese said.

<HEADLINE> Gugliotta Calls Suns a Good Fit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Tom Gugliotta joined the Suns on Sunday,  
resisting down any temptation to badmouth the team he left, the 
Minnesota Timberwolves, saying only that Phoenix ``is the right 
place for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think to a certain degree we were moving in the right  
direction in Minnesota,'' Gugliotta said. ``I won't say anything 
negative about there because I made good friends. I had good 
teammates. But I felt for the rest of my career, this would be a 
more positive situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10, 29-year-old forward signed a six-year, $58.5  
million contract with the Suns, turning down a seven-year, $86 
million offer to stay with the Timberwolves or perhaps sign with 
Minnesota and be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fortunate that I put myself in a situation where I  
didn't have to make the contract the most important thing,'' he 
said. ``That left a lot of options open for me for what I really 
wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix deal includes a clause that allows him out of the  
deal after five years, when he would be eligible for a much bigger 
contract as a 10-year player. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta will wear his No. 24, even though that number was  
slated to be retired by the Suns this year because it had been worn 
by Tom Chambers. Chambers said he gave his permission to let 
Gugliotta wear the number, and Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said that 
from now on, names would be retired, not numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo disputed the perception that Gugliotta was Phoenix's  
consolation prize after Antonio McDyess decided to go to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time and place before all the rules came down that  
the goal was to have McDyess and Tom, and Tom was the No. 1 guy,'' 
Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to compare the point guard of the team he left, Stephan  
Marbury, and the one on his new team, Jason Kidd, Gugliotta 
wouldn't take the bait and criticize his former teammate. But he 
did praise his new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``They contrast a little bit, but to play with a guy with  
Jason's ability and size and quickness, his ability to defend and 
create fastbreak opportunities, it's going to be a lot of fun,'' 
Gugliotta said. ``They're both very talented players and I'm 
looking forward to playing with Jason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta said he's looking forward to the up-tempo Suns' style.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a lot of fun playing with guys who at  
every position know the game,'' he said. ``They're that unselfish. 
That's one thing I noticed playing against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was never any competition for shots. Things just flowed.  
Guys just went out and played and they looked like they were having 
a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Gugliotta, the Suns have two major pieces  
of unfinished business, re-signing Clifford Robinson and Rex 
Chapman. That was expected to happen on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta averaged better than 20 points the last two seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to come out here and try to continue my career in  
the direction it's been going the last couple of years, playing at 
an all-star level and trying to help make this team very 
successful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	What does Gugliotta bring?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to be listed at any position. I'm a basketball  
player,'' he said. ``I can handle the ball. I can pass. I can 
shoot. I think I can help the team in a lot of different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta is the last of the big-name free agents to commit to a  
team. He was in Phoenix last Thursday night and met with Colangelo, 
coach Danny Ainge and general manager Bryan Colangelo until about 3 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he and agent Richard Howell left for Atlanta, where Howell  
lives, promising a decision by 6 p.m. Saturday. The Suns were 
optimistic they'd get Gugliotta but waited anxiously until the word 
finally came. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a little hectic. My voice is about to give out  
because I've literally slept about three hours in the past three 
days,'' Gugliotta said. ``But you know it's worth it. It was a 
decision that affected the better part of my career. I wanted to 
make the right decision, and I know that I did.''

<HEADLINE> Bull Escapes at Rodeo in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A bull escaped from his pen at the  
rodeo and tore through the concourse, bumping into several people 
and knocking over a beer stand before he was roped by cowboys on 
horseback. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified 66-year-old woman was hospitalized when a piece  
of wood left a gash in her head. She was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The bull named Dillinger, a one-ton hornless bull, climbed over  
a 6-foot-high wall at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum and then ran. 
</P>
<P>
	``It knocked me over and every which way,'' said 21-year-old  
vendor Trent Hackney, who hid behind the beer stand when he saw the 
bull coming and people scurrying for safety. ``I didn't know the 
bull was going to hit the stand, and it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His pants were drenched in beer.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal Gay, who has provided livestock to the Southwestern  
Exposition and Livestock Show and Rodeo for 25 years, said the bull 
was pretty gentle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't want to hurt anybody,'' Gay said. ``The bull was  
just as shaken as many of the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Dillinger ``would have been a fighting bull, it would have  
been a lot worse than it was,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bourque Still an All-Star at 38 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Ray Bourque's game has gone to his head.  
</P>
<P>
	It isn't that he's arrogant about his selection to the NHL  
All-Star Game for a record 12th time, it's just that the Boston 
Bruins' defenseman considers himself more of a thinking hockey 
player these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always played the game with my head, and knowing the  
position and knowing what I had to do to be good,'' said Bourque, a 
starting defenseman for the North America team in Sunday's game at 
the Ice Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bourque admits he's lost a step or two at 38, he has  
compensated for it in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I'd like to have the quickness that I had five,  
six, seven years ago,'' said Bourque, who started playing in the 
NHL with the Bruins in 1979. ``That will never come back. Other 
than that, my game is pretty much where it was. It's that quickness 
that you lose with age. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't have to be as quick to be effective if you know  
how to play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, Bourque hasn't lost his passion to play. It's  
something the Bruins' captain brings to the rink -- and into the 
locker room -- every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, I really have fun. I love being around younger  
guys. You play this game, you walk into that room, you feel like a 
kid. And it's a kid's game in a lot of ways. You've got to have the 
energy, you've got to have the enthusiasm. If you don't, you're not 
going to be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bourque has certainly been that. He won the rookie of the year  
award in 1980 and won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman 
five times. His selection to this year's All-Star Game marked his 
17th appearance. Only Gordie Howe (23) and Wayne Gretzky (18) have 
more appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe and Gretzky accomplished something Bourque is still trying  
to do -- win a Stanley Cup. Bourque led his Boston teams to the 
finals in 1988 and 1990, and lost both times to Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	Bourque relates to what John Elway went through -- the Denver  
quarterback didn't win a Super Bowl until his fifth try. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very happy for him,'' he said. ``I could feel for the  
guy -- four Super Bowls without winning ... and finally getting it 
done. That would be the perfect situation for me, whenever it 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things that goes into building a championship  
team that's really out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Bourque will give the Bruins his best shot for  
at least two more years. He recently extended his contract another 
year through the 1999-2000 season. After that, he said, he'll see 
how he feels about hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Few are betting Bourque will quit even then.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I feel my age is some mornings when you wake up,  
you're stiffer than other days,'' he said. ``I think those kids 
have to look at me and say, wow, this guy is crazy or nuts. ... I 
have fun. I think they see that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get silly at times, so they don't really look at me (like an  
old man) still trying to play the game. I'm sure they feel I'm one 
of them. And I certainly feel I'm one of them.''

<HEADLINE> Protestants Move Toward Affiliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- While Pope John Paul II brings together  
millions of Roman Catholics throughout the Americas, Protestants 
are building a bridge of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine Christian denominations voted Sunday to move toward a broad  
affiliation of churches -- a rare victory in the Consultation on 
Church Union's four-decade campaign to unite 20 million 
Protestants, despite their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	It was almost 40 years ago that the group's Presbyterian and  
Episcopalian founders, citing Jesus' call for ``one faith, one 
baptism, one God,'' proposed a Protestant superchurch. When the 
plan was derailed by denominational loyalties and disagreements, 
the group opted for a proposal for church affiliation without 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The new document asks participating churches to declare publicly  
in the year 2002 that they are Churches Uniting in Christ. These 
churches would agree to share one baptism and to recognize one 
another as ``authentic expressions of the one church of Jesus 
Christ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They would also fully accept one another's ministers as  
``instruments of God's grace'' by the year 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	The churches would regularly celebrate Eucharist together and  
join forces to fight racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do it. We must do it, and we did it,'' said Vivian  
Robinson, president of the Consultation on Church Union, after the 
victory vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may be too soon to celebrate. Presiding Episcopal Bishop  
Frank T. Griswold noted that the Episcopalians' approval of the 
document depends on the group's success in hashing out a leadership 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't resolve this question we might have to go our  
separate ways,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute, said the Rev. David W.A. Taylor, former general  
secretary of the union and a Presbyterian minister, centers on 
``the respective place of bishops in the life of the church and the 
whole community of the baptized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Episcopalians believe in a succession of bishops dating back  
to the early church as a mark of continuity and unity. In the past, 
the union has asked the Presbyterians, who do not have bishops, to 
add a similar office of oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presbyterians, who favor decentralization and less  
structure, rejected the idea. They have proposed instead 
recognizing a corporate oversight body made up of clergy and lay 
elders. 
</P>
<P>
	The second draft of the document deleted references to bishops,  
a move that upset Griswold. So the delegates approved an amendment 
calling for meetings of church representatives to clarify what it 
means to recognize one another's ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also includes the Christian Church (Disciples of  
Christ), the International Council of Community Churches, the 
United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church, the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion 
Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The last three are black denominations. While some black  
religious leaders have no interest in merging with white churches, 
the Rev. Cyrus Keller Sr., an African American Episcopal minister, 
believes black churches can have a dramatic impact on the union's 
theology and ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we become recognized as a player on the field there will  
be a difference in the whole approach to being Christian and 
witnessing,'' Keller said.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Gets 3rd All-Star MVP Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky couldn't say if he'd played in  
his last All-Star game. When you're two days away from your 38th 
birthday and still play as well as he does, you don't rush 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's career goals, assists and points leader was a surprise  
starter Sunday and walked away with his third MVP award after 
scoring one goal and assisting on two others in North America's 8-6 
victory over the World on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky acknowledged that during the game, he had thoughts about  
it possibly being his last All-Star appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I felt the same way last year in Vancouver,'' he said. ``I  
thought about it (Sunday), but I don't have a definitive answer 
until the year's over. I don't want to want to put any thought in 
to it. I love to play too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was a late addition to the lineup in place of  
Philadelphia's Eric Lindros, the projected starter after Detroit's 
Steve Yzerman withdrew because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The move didn't disappoint an Ice Palace crowd of 19,758, which  
gave the New York Rangers star the biggest ovation during pregame 
introductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The year is 99, and it could be his last year,'' Lindros said,  
explaining why he deferred to No. 99 and declined to speculate 
about Gretzky's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he played tonight,'' Lindros said, ``he's playing  
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third MVP award ties Gretzky with Mario Lemieux for the most  
in All-Star history. He also won the honor in 1983 when he scored a 
record four goals and in 1989 when, like this time, he had one goal 
and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
	He extended his record for All-Star goals with a wrist shot from  
the right circle that went through the legs of World goaltender 
Arturs Irbe less than two minutes into the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	He assisted on Mark Recchi's first-period goal and set up Rob  
Blake late in the second period for a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides a crystal trophy, Gretzky also won a car for being the  
star of stars. He estimates that he's been given 16 or 17 cars 
during his career, but the latest is the first one he plans to 
keep. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 21 years of professional hockey, 20 in the NHL, I just  
feel like this is the one thing I want to keep,'' Gretzky said. ``I 
want to have it, and I want to remember it. I don't want to forget 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star appearance was a record 18th straight for Gretzky,  
who also holds the career All-Star mark for points (25). He trails 
only Gordie Howe (23) for most All-Star appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his love for this game, and hockey in general, is as  
strong as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The excitement that I still have is the same today as it was  
in 1980 when I played my first game in Detroit. The difference now 
is when I look over and see No. 9, it's Paul Kariya. When I looked 
over and saw No. 9 earlier, it was Gordie Howe,'' Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I still have the same amount of respect for a guy like  
Paul Kariya, who is a wonderful player. I've gone from being this 
young guy looking up to old guys to this older guy looking up to 
younger guys.''

	Lewinsky Talks to House Prosecutors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors interviewed Monica Lewinsky  
for almost two hours today even as three Republican senators said 
they wanted a swift end to President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
The House team said Ms. Lewinsky's testimony would help the Senate 
``determine the truth'' although her lawyer, Plato Cacheris, said 
she ``added nothing to the record that is already sitting before 
the Senate right now.'' Former Clinton political adviser Dick 
Morris was also interviewed by House impeachment investigators. He 
said he was asked about his conversations with Clinton as the 
Lewinsky scandal was breaking a year ago.

30 years. Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on 
welfare at the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million 
in 1994. Clinton will also announce a proposal that would give $430 
million for 75,000 housing vouchers that help people on welfare 
move closer to a new job and $150 million in transportation money 
to help people get to jobs, often in suburbs not served by public

of the session. A statement agreed on by the Arab ministers pledged 
to work for the lifting of the sanctions, but only expressed ``deep 
concern at the use of the military option against Iraq,'' instead 
of denouncing the attacks as ``aggression,'' as Baghdad wanted.

NBC employee had typed the report and stored it in NBC's computer

DiMaggio was in grave condition and using a ventilator. Many news

<HEADLINE> Clinton Views Ark. Tornado Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Acting like the governor he used to be,  
President Clinton went home to Arkansas on Sunday to inspect the 
damage a barrage of tornadoes wreaked on houses and trees in his 
old stomping grounds. ``This is a tragedy we all take personally,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president walked streets of Quapaw Quarter that he jogged  
when he lived 12 years in the Governor's Mansion nearby. This time, 
rather than well-manicured yards and well-kept houses, his eyes 
fell on smashed rooftops draped in blue tarpaulin, houses that 
seemed folded in half, an uprooted tree lounging across a crushed 
Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	``For all the tornadoes Arkansas has, and the ones that have hit  
around Little Rock, we never had one just basically come down Main 
Street,'' Clinton said. ``We had all these wonderful old trees. 
It's difficult to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton was upbeat as he spoke to residents who took time  
from their attempts to patch splintered houses and crept through 
rubble to greet him. He chatted amicably with a group outside a 
house where an American flag had been strapped with duct tape onto 
a tree's leafless branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Before heading back to Washington at nightfall, Clinton visited  
Beebe, Ark., which bore the brunt of devastating tornadoes that 
swept the state Thursday night, killed seven people and injured 55. 
Officials have not determined how many twisters there were, but 
reports of sightings came from 38 locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton met in Beebe with a family whose house was nothing but a  
foundation amid piles of cement and wood. In the distance, the 
school sat split in two. ``It's just destruction. There's nothing 
left,'' said Sherry Wooten, whose neighbor's house was entirely 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pledged that he personally would see to it that Beebe's  
school is rebuilt, and expressed confidence the town would survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a lot of pain on the faces I saw up the road there,''  
Clinton said. ``But I also saw a lot of determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far back in the crowd from where Clinton spoke from a flat-bed  
truck was Paula Jones, who told reporters she had been visiting 
friends in the area when the storm struck. It was a deposition in 
her sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton that set off a chain 
of events leading to Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come to see him,'' said Mrs. Jones, who was wearing a  
white jacket, red shirt and blue jeans. ``I came to see what 
they're going to do about the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you think about Paula Jones being here?'' a reporter  
shouted at Clinton. The president did not respond to the question, 
but turned in apparent amazement to aides and asked, ``What did he 
say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday, it seemed that here, far from Washington's impeachment  
furor, Clinton drew as much emotionally from the storm victims as 
he gave. He clasped old friends in long hugs and placed his hand 
sympathetically on the shoulder of a man who stopped clearing 
debris from his yard to shake the president's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	In a neighborhood not far from the mansion, Dominique Simmons  
called to the president to ``hang in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will,'' the president called back.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for him, and it's good for them,'' said  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, also an Arkansan. ``You 
know who your friends are when you're standing with them in 
difficult times, and they're standing with you in difficult 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susie May, a 25-year resident of Quapaw Quarter who once was  
part of a baby-sitting circle with Clinton's wife and daughter, 
talked at length with the president about his problem back in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were talking about the recent political difficulties. We're  
optimistic the truth will prevail,'' May said. She admitted she did 
most of the talking about prevailing. ``I said it, and he was 
listening to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president then went to the mostly-black area near the state  
fairgrounds, where dozens of homes were reduced to piles of wood. 
</P>
<P>
	A short distance away, the home of Little Rock Nine benefactor  
Daisy Bates lay in ruins. The house is where the nine black 
students who integrated Little Rock's Central High School in 1957 
gathered each day before going to class together. It has been 
declared a national historic site. Mrs. Bates is in a Little Rock 
nursing home and was not in the house at the time of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the entire state has been declared a disaster area,  
and he announced federal assistance for five counties. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Governor's Mansion, Clinton saw chunks of several trees  
already sawn to be hauled away, along with what was left of the 
treehouse where Chelsea Clinton played as a child. The president 
noted that the mansion was intact, but ``it's had a little radical 
surgery in the back yard.'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Mayberry To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Lee Mayberry will undergo  
surgery on his right ankle and miss 3-8 weeks for the Vancouver 
Grizzlies, the team said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayberry is scheduled for arthroscopic surgery Thursday to  
repair damage from wear and tear throughout his career. He has not 
practiced since last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayberry, entering his seventh NBA season, was expected to  
challenge Mike Bibby -- last June's No. 2 overall pick -- for the 
starting job at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies have only one other point guard, Bobby Hurley, on  
their roster. Hurley, however, was not invited to camp and the 
Grizzlies are expected to move him prior to the start of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Felipe Lopez, a natural shooting guard selected 24th overall by  
San Antonio last June and then dealt to the Grizzlies on draft day, 
has been working out as a point guard in camp.

<HEADLINE> Federal Mogul Mulls LucasVarity Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Federal Mogul Corp. is set to make a $6 billion  
bid for British motor components group LucasVarity PLC, according 
to reports in British newspapers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bid succeeds, the Michigan-based Federal Mogul would  
become one of the largest independent motor components groups in 
the world, with annual sales of nearly $12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Sunday Times and the Sunday Telegraph reported the  
possible deal, with the Telegraph saying an agreement could be 
reached within the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports follow the Jan. 6 confirmation by LucasVarity that  
it is talking to industry peers about alliances. At that time, 
media speculation centered on Ohio-based TRW Inc. and 
Connecticut-based Tenneco Inc., both industrial companies with big 
automotive businesses. Potential European suitors included Valeo SA 
and Siemens AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Federal Mogul or LucasVarity could be reached for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Panel Expels 6 Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Acting swiftly and forcefully to  
try to save its credibility, the IOC ousted six members Sunday in 
an unprecedented housecleaning stemming from the biggest corruption 
scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	With the future of the organization, its president and the games  
themselves under threat, the International Olympic Committee said 
it was determined to bring to an end ``the ugliest chapter'' in its 
105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch apologized to the  
world for the Salt Lake City scandal but vowed to stay in office 
and restore the prestige of the Olympics. He and other Olympic 
leaders took pains to reassure international corporate sponsors 
that the games would regain their luster. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning, not the end of our work,'' Samranch  
said. ``I am certain that the Olympic movement will emerge from the 
crisis stronger than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a third member resigned in the scandal, Samaranch said three  
other members remained under investigation, while a fourth was 
warned about his actions by the ruling executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members violated their Olympic oath and betrayed the  
confidence put in them by the Olympic family,'' Samaranch said. 
``These actions were inappropriate and against the policy of our 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he had ``temporarily excluded'' the six members,  
with a final vote due in March. The head of the investigation, IOC 
vice president Dick Pound, said the six were essentially expelled 
and could only ask to be reinstated by the remaining 106 IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	A special inquiry found eight IOC members had pocketed more than  
$440,000 in cash and excessive gifts and services. One, Jean-Claude 
Ganga of the Republic of Congo, received more than $216,000, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came at the end of two-day emergency meeting to deal  
with a spiraling crisis that started with allegations of 
vote-buying in Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	While the scandal broke little over a month ago, the IOC acted  
quickly, in part to placate international corporations that pay 
millions of dollars in Olympic sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake, Olympic organizers said they were pleased by the  
``speed and efficiency'' of the IOC's investigation but also 
conceded they made some mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened. Some of these actions should not have  
taken place,'' Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee, said. ``Some of those actions were below the standards 
expected by this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said his panel should  
have a closer watch on Salt Lake organizers but would not allow 
corruption to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look back and ask, `Should we have been better detectives?  
Should we have done a better job at oversight of Salt Lake City?''' 
Hybl said. ``The answer is yes, you can always do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you in the future we're going to do better. The  
presence of the USOC should be to ensure that these types of 
practices don't go on with the bidding cities. We need to make sure 
it is a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Australia, where the 2000 Games will be staged,  
organizing committee chief Sandy Hollway said the IOC took the 
right actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``As regards to Sydney, we are very relaxed,'' he said. Hollway  
said the IOC appeared to be ``very confident'' of Sydney and had 
not launched an investigation except as part of a broader look at 
bidding cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC would broaden its investigation to other  
bids stretching from the games of 1996 to 2006. But he stressed 
that Salt Lake would keep the Winter Games and Sydney would remain 
host of the 2000 Summer Games -- despite the scandal that now 
encompasses both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would send two top officials to Sydney within three  
weeks to investigate the situation there. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC board also recommended a radical change in the selection  
process for the 2006 Winter Games. Under the proposal, visits to 
bid cities by IOC members will be banned and the host will be 
selected this June by a 15-person body rather than the full 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure for future Olympic selections will be decided  
after the 2006 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch offered a personal apology for the recent scandals but  
reiterated he has no intention of heeding the increasing calls for 
his resignation. He said he would ask for a vote of confidence at a 
special IOC general assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the vote on the sanctions was unanimous and all  
of the six had done ``great harm to the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are resolute in our determination to root out the  
improprieties and to ensure that this never happens again,'' he 
said at a packed press conference televised live around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch called the action ``an opportunity to put our house in  
order and enact the necessary measures to keep it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his panel was not accusing any members of bribery,  
corruption or criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the members were guilty of a ``serious and irreparable  
breach of the IOC oath of membership'' and of bringing the 
organization into ``disrepute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In each case (the offense) was conscious and knowing,'' Pound  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal involved cash payments, scholarships, medical  
treatment and other favors granted to IOC members and their 
families by Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Those members recommended for expulsion were Ganga, Agustin  
Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Lamine 
Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio Santander of 
Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Still under investigation were Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the  
Ivory Coast; Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of 
Russia, Carrard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands was issued a  
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sibandze of Swaziland resigned Sunday, the third member to  
quit in the Salt Lake scandal in six days. Finland's Pirjo Haeggman 
and Libya's Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi resigned last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch urged the six to quit.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do not wait to be expelled by the session,'' he said. ``Put an  
end to the ugliest chapter in the history of the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``These members have done great harm to the Olympic ideal. Now  
their greatest service to the Olympic movement is simply to accept 
their fate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo said he would fight to stay in the job he has held since  
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to resign for one very simple reason,'' Arroyo  
said. ``For to resigning would be to admit I have done something 
wrong, and I have not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's report listed a total of $440,710 in payments, gifts and  
services to eight IOC members. The report did not include the 
payments made to the three members who resigned, one who died and 
two of those still are investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Ganga, who led the African boycott of the 1976  
Olympics in Montreal, received the highest total -- $216,010. The 
figure includes $70,010 in direct payments, $17,000 in medical 
expenses, at least $115,000 in travel expenses for him and his 
family, and $14,000 in gifts and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga has defiantly proclaimed his innocence and vowed he'll  
never resign. Other members have also vowed to fight their ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC would form an ethics commission, mainly  
of independent officials, to monitor the way its members do 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the members implicated in the Salt Lake case, eight were from  
Africa, two from South America, one from Asia and three from 
Europe. Of the six facing expulsion, four are Africans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are most in need are also those who are fragile,  
most open to offers which sometimes verge on the provocative,'' 
said IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a judge on the World 
Court and a member of the inquiry commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound went out of his way to try to reassure the main financial  
backers of the Olympics -- sponsors and television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged the scandals have made them ``concerned and  
anxious'' but promised the IOC would continue to take decisive 
action to protect the integrity of the games 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is one of five bodies investigating the Salt Lake  
scandals. Other inquiries -- some potentially more damaging -- are 
being carried out by the Salt Lake ethics committee, the Justice 
Department and FBI, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Utah 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 2006 Games, the selection of the city will be made by a  
panel consisting of eight IOC members, three athletes, one winter 
sports representative, one national Olympic official, the IOC's 
longest-serving member and the chairman of the 2006 evaluation 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	No members of the executive board, the single most powerful  
panel in the IOC, will be part of the selection group. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel would be headed by Samaranch but the IOC president  
would have no vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will be used as a trial for future votes.  
</P>
<P>
	The decision to expand the inquiry followed allegations and  
disclosures of misconduct from other bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest came from Sydney, where Australian officials used  
financial inducements to help Sydney win the right to stage the 
2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympics chief John Coates offered $70,000 in  
inducements to two African IOC members the night before Sydney 
defeated Beijing by two votes in the 1993 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the offer was not a bribe but part of an assistance  
program for African athletes.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Sign Dennis Scott for $1M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Free agent Dennis Scott agreed Sunday to a $1  
million contract with the New York Knicks, who waived guard 
Lawrence Moten three days after signing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 30, averaged 11 points and three rebounds last season  
with Dallas and Phoenix. The 6-foot-8 swingman, an eight-year 
veteran, is fifth on the NBA's career list in 3-points with 1,106 
and holds the single-season record of 267. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to be able to obtain a player of Dennis'  
caliber,'' general manager Ernie Grunfeld said. ``he has been one 
of the league's most reliable scorers and an excellent threat from 
3-point range. He will add to our overall depth, especially as an 
outside shooter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott signed under the million-dollar exception, which allows  
teams over the salary can to sign an additional player. 
</P>
<P>
	Moten split last season between Washington and the CBA.

	Lewinsky Talks at Impeachment Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as three Republican senators said they  
wanted a swift end to President Clinton's impeachment trial, House 
prosecutors interviewed Monica Lewinsky for almost two hours 
Sunday. The House team said Ms. Lewinsky's testimony would help the 
Senate ``determine the truth'' although her lawyer, Plato Cacheris, 
said she ``added nothing to the record that is already sitting 
before the Senate right now.'' Former Clinton political adviser 
Dick Morris was also interviewed by House impeachment 
investigators. He said he was asked about his conversations with 
Clinton as the Lewinsky scandal was breaking a year ago.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will announce Monday that  
the number of people on welfare has fallen to its lowest level in 
30 years. Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on 
welfare at the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million 
in 1994. Clinton will also announce a proposal that would give $430 
million for 75,000 housing vouchers that help people on welfare 
move closer to a new job and $150 million in transportation money 
to help people get to jobs, often in suburbs not served by public

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- U.S. energy giant Enron did nothing to  
stop a brutal campaign in India to crush dissent by a government 
determined to push through its multimillion-dollar power deal, 
according to a Human Rights Watch report. Enron Power Development 
Corp.'s $2.4 billion power project in the western Indian state of

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Arab foreign ministers Sunday refused Iraq's  
demands to strongly condemn U.N. sanctions and last month's 
U.S.-British airstrikes on the country, prompting Iraq to storm out 
of the session. A statement agreed on by the Arab ministers pledged 
to work for the lifting of the sanctions, but only expressed ``deep 
concern at the use of the military option against Iraq,'' instead 
of denouncing the attacks as ``aggression,'' as Baghdad wanted. 
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf walked out in anger

<HEADLINE> Black Panthers Push Community Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Thirty years ago, David Hilliard walked  
the streets of West Oakland with a black leather jacket on his back 
and an M-1 carbine in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, the former Black Panther chief of staff makes the  
trip as a candidate for City Council -- no gun in his grip, less 
hair on his head, but the same rallying cry: 
</P>
<P>
	Power to the people.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of trying to really restructure and to  
rebuild another movement,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard is part of a political flashback of sorts. His campaign  
is being managed by Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale and was 
inspired by the comeback of another '70s icon, 
governor-turned-mayor Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hilliard says the old Black Panther goals of better housing  
and schools are still relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to resurrect our dreams,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	For Hilliard, the dream began as a young man growing up in  
down-at-the-heels neighborhoods in West Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where we started,'' he says while leading a bus tour  
through streets lined with shabby Victorians. 
</P>
<P>
	Stop No. 12 on the Black Panther Legacy Tour is the street  
corner where Bobby Hutton was fatally shot by police in April 1968 
after a protracted gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Stop No. 11 is the church where the Black Panthers began serving  
free breakfasts to poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising his voice above the engine's rumble, Hilliard says both  
sites are key to understanding ``probably the most misunderstood 
organization in the history of the civil rights movement. You know 
about our imagery and about the guns ... but you don't know about 
the (community) programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Panther Party was founded in 1966 by Seale and Huey  
Newton, who met as students at Oakland's Merritt Junior College and 
were working at a city anti-poverty center. 
</P>
<P>
	Seale, joining Hilliard at the microphone for the bus tour,  
remembers hatching the party's founding manifesto, the Ten Point 
Program, late one night. Seale pecked out the program at a 
typewriter while Newton burrowed through law books for the court 
ruling the party would later use as the legal basis for shadowing 
Oakland police. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-poverty center, now home to the Ebony Lady Salon,  
overlooks another party landmark, an intersection where the 
Panthers demanded a signal light to help schoolchildren cross -- and 
instigated armed traffic patrols to speed up city response. 
</P>
<P>
	For Seale and Hilliard, the tour provides bittersweet  
remembrances of things past. 
</P>
<P>
	Seale recalls cooking up pots of chili for the young  
revolutionaries. ``I was not only the chairman of the Black Panther 
Party -- I was the cook of the Black Panther Party,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	He confesses with a grin that the Panthers, who paid the rent by  
selling Mao Tse-Tung's Little Red Book at a sizable mark-up, sold 
thousands of copies ``before we actually read the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stop right along here,'' Seale orders the bus driver halfway  
down one block when he recognizes the site of a long-ago 
confrontation with police. Pulled over by a cruiser, Newton refused 
to surrender his gun on grounds he had a constitutional right to 
carry an unconcealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cop is getting ready to pull his gun and Huey says, 'If  
you pull it out, I'll blow your brains out,''' Seale says, his 
raspy voice holding listeners spellbound. ``The people are coming 
out on the steps. Some little old lady comes out and says, `Don't 
y'all shoot the police.' I said, `Ma'am, we ain't gonna shoot him 
as long as he don't draw his gun.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That incident ended peacefully. But bloodier confrontations took  
the lives of police and Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily Stoper, a 30-year Oakland resident and political science  
professor at California State University-Hayward, remembers the 
early days as ``scary parading with guns.'' But she later worked 
with Panthers on ``very moderate kinds of coalition politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard says community service was always on the Panther  
agenda, with the breakfast programs growing to encompass clothing, 
medical care and testing for sickle cell anemia. He describes the 
guns as a violent reaction to violent times. 
</P>
<P>
	``When America grew up, so did the Panthers,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	The Black Panther Party collapsed in the late 1970s, brought  
down by deaths, defections and infighting. Newton was shot to death 
in 1989 by a young drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stop No. 15 is the sidewalk where Newton fell, marked by the  
stylized outline of a fallen body and the faded word ``pig'' -- a 
slogan blaming police for Newton's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Huey Newton was not murdered by the pigs,'' Hilliard says  
bluntly. ``Huey Newton was killed by a drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to understand, he was a sick man. He had a disease and  
that disease is called drug addiction,'' says Hilliard, who has 
fought his own addictions. Now a trim 56, Hilliard says he hasn't 
touched booze for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced for council, Hilliard said the Panthers laid  
the foundation for a liberal like Brown to win in Oakland and 
joked, ``Jerry is talking like a Panther these days.'' Brown says 
it's too early to endorse anyone for the 2000 City Council 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hilliard has at least one political veteran on his side with  
Seale, who ran for Oakland mayor in 1973 and has worked for former 
Panther Bobby Rush, a congressman running for Chicago mayor this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoper thinks the political climate may be right for revisiting  
some of the racial and social issues first raised in the angry 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Race seems to go on and off the political agenda in this  
country,'' she says. ``When it's off, people forget about it and 
they don't discuss issues and there isn't much effective dialogue 
so you get a kind of buildup of misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may come on the agenda for a while now. In some ways  
there'll be more irritation, but there'll also be more 
understanding.''

<HEADLINE> Privacy Groups To Boycott Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Privacy groups are urging a boycott of all  
products from Intel Corp. in a dispute over new technology that 
allows consumers to be identified as they move across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups planned to announce the boycott today, effective  
until the company agrees to disable the new technology in its 
upcoming line of Pentium III computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not even the tamest privacy advocate has failed to condemn  
it,'' said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Inc. of Green 
Brook, N.J., which lobbies on a range of high-tech issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest chipmaker with $26.2 billion in sales  
last year, announced last week that its new chip, to be sold within 
months, will by default transmit its unique serial number 
internally and across the Internet to help verify the identity of 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the feature offers a boon for electonic  
commerce, allowing companies and shoppers to feel more secure in 
the transmission of data. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can turn the feature off, but it turns itself back on  
each time the computer is restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said its technology is needed to encourage trust in  
Internet sales and also can be used to avoid piracy by preventing a 
single copy of a software program from being installed on several 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	But privacy advocates are worried: ``It allows a massive profile  
to be efficiently collected and sold,'' Catlett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Junkbusters organized the boycott with the Washington-based  
Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said late Sunday that the company  
has been in talks about its technology for several weeks with 
Junkbusters, and had meetings planned this week with both privacy 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulloy said it would be ``difficult to tell'' the potential  
impact of any boycott of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to making about 85 percent of the world's computer  
processors, Intel also manufactures memory chips plus hardware for 
computer networks, communications and graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Catlett called the Pentium III chips that already have been  
produced ``toxic hardware.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They should destroy them,'' Catlett said.  
</P>
<P>
	As part of their boycott, organizers intend to unveil a parody  
of the company's ubiquitous ``Intel Inside'' logo. Theirs features 
the same familiar swirl but with the words, ``Big Brother Inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., urged Intel on Friday to  
reconsider its plans, ``to better balance both commercial and 
privacy objectives.'' Markey is the senior Democrat on the House 
consumer protection subcommittee and active in Internet privacy 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's announcement comes at an awkward time for the Clinton  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, undersecretary of state for commerce, was to begin  
negotiations today in Europe -- the same day as the boycott 
announcement -- over a tough new privacy law enacted by the 
15-nation European Union last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron must assure Europeans that the United States has adequate  
privacy protections or risk a prohibition against businesses in 
those 15 countries from disclosing personal information about 
citizens there to U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't have come at a worse time,'' Catlett said. ``This  
new feature from Intel is really throwing kerosene on the fire of 
the trans-Atlantic privacy negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron warned last week that such a ban would carry ``a very  
adverse impact on the operation of the economies on both sides of 
the Atlantic and could be a very serious blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Electronic Privacy Information Center said it will meet  
later this week with the Federal Trade Commission to discuss 
Intel's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has criticized the online industry for its failure to  
protect privacy rights. Last year, the agency successfully pressed 
for a new law that prohibits Web sites from collecting personal 
information from children without parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the FTC also is suing Intel for alleged  
antitrust violations. The trial is set to begin March 9.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam War Deserter Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- A Marine who fled to Canada during  
the Vietnam War pleaded guilty to the three-decade-old desertion 
and was given a bad-conduct discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren R. MacDonald, 48, admitted to a charge of unauthorized  
absence on Friday during a special court-martial at this San Diego 
County base. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to six months in jail, although the time was  
reduced to the 23 days he spent in the base brig since his arrest 
last month, said Maj. Colby Vokey, his defense attorney. His rank 
was reduced from private first class to private. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald, who was born in Minnesota and held both U.S. and  
Canadian citizenship, joined the Marine Corps in 1967, less than a 
month after his 17th birthday. He fled boot camp for Canada in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald, who owns a mobile welding firm near Nanaimo, British  
Columbia, was arrested in Phoenix by U.S. Customs Service agents 
during an airport layover as he and his wife headed to Mexico for a 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald agreed to plead guilty under a pretrial agreement.  
``He said he is ready to put closure to this and get back to his 
life in Canada with his wife and family and business,'' Vokey said.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg, Caine Win Golden Globes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Steven Spielberg was named best  
director for the brutally realistic World War II drama ``Saving 
Private Ryan,'' and ``Shakespeare in Love'' won honors as best 
comedy film, best screenplay and best actress for Gwyneth Paltrow 
at Sunday's 56th Golden Globes. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow and Michael Caine of ``Little Voice'' were honored as  
best actors in musical or comedy motion pictures, and Ed Harris of 
``The Truman Show'' and Lynn Redgrave of ``Gods and Monsters'' were 
named best motion picture supporting actors. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg, whose film is a major contender for an Oscar,  
extended his thanks to ``all the veterans that are out there that 
saved Western Civilization and stopped the Holocaust in 1945.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood Foreign Press Association voted ABC's ``The  
Practice'' as best television drama series, and Fox's ``Ally 
McBeal'' won as best television comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spin City'' star Michael J. Fox, who has been diagnosed with  
Parkinson's disease, was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy 
actor. He thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up 
his brain. ``We're so lucky to do what we do ... and just take 
every day and enjoy it,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow played the upper-crust lady who becomes the lover and  
muse of William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love.'' In ``Little 
Voice,'' Caine played a sleazy agent who tries to turn a meek woman 
with powerful musical gift for show tunes into a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said. ``My career must be slipping.  
This is the first time I've been available to pick up an award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's ``Central Station'' captured the foreign language film  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``The Truman Show'' were the leading  
movie nominees, with six apiece. ``Saving Private Ryan'' followed 
with five. ``Bulworth,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' and 
``Little Voice'' had three nominations apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued  
by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show  
by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man, 
I just got through eating dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage he noted that ``The Truman Show'' came out in the  
summer, long before studios traditionally roll out their 
award-worthy product. ``I'm glad that people didn't forget about 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redgrave, who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging  
horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32 
years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been 
crying out for a friend ever since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the television categories, Dylan McDermott of ``The  
Practice'' and Keri Russel of ``Felicity'' were named best actor 
and actress, respectively in television dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenna Elfman won best actress in a TV musical or comedy series  
for ``Dharma and Greg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hanks, nominated for best actor in ``Saving Private Ryan,''  
picked up an early honor for his ``From the Earth to the Moon,'' 
which won best miniseries or movie made for TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood  
Foreign Press Association, are awarded for film and television in 
what can be a more colorful affair than the stuffy Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Christine Lahti was in the bathroom when she was  
announced as a winner for ``Chicago Hope.'' This year she showed up 
as a presenter with toilet paper stuck to a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes traditionally serve as predictors for the  
Academy Awards in March. In the last 16 years, 12 films that won 
best motion picture honors at the Golden Globes went on to take the 
same prize at the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was  
honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his ``outstanding 
contribution to the entertainment field.'' Nicholson has been 
nominated for 14 Globes and won five. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I like about this particular award is that it doesn't  
come from our peer groups,'' Nicholson said. ``Hollywood Foreign 
Press (Association) is kind of a loose group of guys and gals. You 
almost feel like you could go out and have fun with them -- probably 
because they don't have as much to lose as we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The awards had once been buffeted by allegations of corrupt  
voting and long suffered credibility problems, with the lowlight 
being the 1981 event that awarded Pia Zadora a statue for the bomb 
``Butterfly. The association worked to regain respectability, and 
after a 14-year absence from network exposure the program was back 
on the air in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, NBC asked Golden Globe voters to sign waivers  
indicating they did not accept gifts or perks from Hollywood 
studios, the Washington Post reported Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Kill 30 in Angola Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Gunmen ambushed two vehicles, killing 30  
people and wounding several others in northeastern Angola, a news 
report said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred Saturday in Lunda Sul province, 500 miles  
east of the capital Luanda, the private Radio Eclesia reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers were among those killed, and survivors blamed  
the attack on the UNITA rebel group, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	UNITA, or the National Union for the Total Independence of  
Angola, has been engaged in heavy battles against the government's 
army since a two-decade civil war resumed last month after four 
years of frail peace. 
</P>
<P>
	UNITA Secretary General Paulo Lukamba Gato, speaking by  
satellite phone from a central highland stronghold, denied any 
knowledge of the attack.

<HEADLINE> GE Affiliate To Buy Into Japan Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The finance arm of General Electric Co. has reached  
an agreement to take over key operations of a failed Japanese 
bank's leasing subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	GE Capital Corp. plans to buy the leasing business of Japan  
Leasing Corp., a unit of the nationalized Long-Term Credit Bank of 
Japan Ltd., Japan Leasing spokesman Kunikazu Minobe said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	GE will also buy a subsidiary of the company, Japan Leasing Auto  
Corp., Minobe said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company did not release the purchasing price, local  
media reported that GE will pay between $6 billion and $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marks the latest move by Stamford, Conn.-based company  
to expand its presence in Japan's deregulated financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Last February, GE agreed to set up a life insurance venture in  
Japan with partner Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co. In 1996, it 
bought 80 percent of a Japanese automobile leasing subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Leasing declared bankruptcy in September with debts of  
more than $17 billion. It was Japan's biggest corporate failure 
since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Its parent, the Long-Term Credit Bank, was nationalized a month  
later.

<HEADLINE> Americans Will Miss Health Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By the year 2000, America was supposed to be  
on the run -- or at least a brisk walk -- into healthful physical 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Americans are not going to meet the physical activity objectives  
of the federal government's Healthy People 2000 plan. We are on 
track to be our same, generally inactive, selves. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the exercise version of the Year 2000 problem -- except, in  
this case, it's the people, not the computers, who won't work. 
Officials are making plans instead for the year 2010, hoping this 
will show an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, it hasn't turned out,'' Surgeon General Dr. David  
Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are not sure how far short they have fallen. The  
government has done little to gather up-to-date data. Getting 
better data is among the Year 2010 hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of indications that, when it comes to physical  
activity, we have a lot of work to do,'' Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest review of the 13 Healthy People objectives for  
physical activity and fitness shows success in only one objective, 
availability of workplace fitness programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worksite wellness has met the target,'' said Christine G.  
Spain, director of research, planning and special projects for the 
President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, which tracks 
the physical activity segments of Healthy People 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy People set varying targets, depending on the size of the  
company workforce. For instance, the government wanted 80 percent 
of employers of 750 and more workers to have such programs; 83 
percent had done so as of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other objectives are showing progress, Spain said. Among  
these are overall physical activity. The objective was to have at 
least 30 percent of Americans doing light to moderate activity at 
least 30 minutes a day, at least 5 days a week. As of 1991, 24 
percent of 18- to 74-year-olds were doing that, which is up 2 
percentage points from 1984-85 baseline figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Various other surveys have shown that 35 to 40 percent of  
Americans get no exercise, according to Harold W. Kohl, director of 
research at Baylor Sports Medicine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, overweight is increasing, instead of falling  
to 20 percent of adults, as the government had hoped. The numbers 
for 1994 showed 35 percent overweight. A study in the journal 
Science in May 1998 found that 54 percent of Americans were heavier 
than is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts offer varied reasons for the shortfalls. ``For adults,  
it's the age-old excuses -- no time, too many other things to do, 
people would have done more if they had a buddy or someone 
encouraging them,'' Spain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts also have varied ideas on how to improve things.  
``We have to get increased messages out there, telling people to 
get up and do something, because something is better than 
nothing,'' Spain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Physicians could do better at meeting their targets for  
encouraging exercise, she said. Schools could reverse their trends 
toward fewer physical education classes and teachers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Communities could do more to make their streets safe to walk,  
and open more facilities for exercise, Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	And activity advocates could do more to encourage public  
interest, said Steve Blair, director of research at the Cooper 
Institute for Aerobics Research, Dallas. ``We've never had an 
organization and initiated a large-scale national campaign to 
address these goals,'' he said. ``Why should we be surprised?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would take cooperation from researchers, professional groups,  
the government and the private sector to make a dent, said Blair, 
whose research has found that moderate activity can reduce overall 
death rates. But similar partnerships have made progress against 
such conditions as high cholesterol and high blood pressure, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair has been leading such an effort, as the first president of  
the National Coalition for Promoting Physical Activity. The 
alliance of seven professional groups includes the American Heart 
Association, the American Cancer Society and the American College 
of Sports Medicine. It's lining up philanthropic funding and hopes 
to bring Americans in line with Year 2010 objectives, once they are 
finalized, Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those objectives should be ready for release in January of 2000,  
but they probably won't be much different from the Year 2000 
benchmarks that Americans generally are not meeting now, Spain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that might change, however, is the minimal amount of  
exercise. The Year 2000 objectives had called for a minimum of 30 
minutes done at one time. Since then, the consensus among the 
experts has changed to let the daily activity be broken into three 
10-minute blocks, Blair said.

	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Instead of going to bank machines for  
money, more and more Canadians are using desktop computers and 
color copiers to make instant cash.

	Easy access to the technology is being blamed for a huge jump in  
the production of counterfeit currency.

	OTTAWA (AP) -- Some of the first words that Lyle Vanclief read  
after being sworn in as federal agriculture minister in June 1997 
proved to be prophetic ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a high probability of reduced farm incomes over the  
next couple of years and pressure being put on to upgrade safety 
net funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That warning is buried among 500 pages of reports and briefing  
memos compiled by Agriculture Department officials to bring their 
new boss up to speed on issues left unresolved by his predecessor, 
Ralph Goodale, before the 1997 general election. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the minister's briefing book was obtained by The  
Canadian Press through the Access to Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecasters at Agriculture Canada also expect farm income to  
drop 20 per cent in 1998, to about $2.7 billion, from the $3.2 
billion the country's approximately 276,000 farmers made in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 17 months after Vanclief jumped from the back benches to  
cabinet, a potential $1.5-billion, short-term aid package is a 
month away from being completed.

 *Canadians Flock to Cuba Seeking Better Value for Dollar    	
</P>
<P>
	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- If anyone is smiling about the  
feeble Canadian dollar, strangely it might be the citizens of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Most haven't heard of a loonie and many probably couldn't  
explain the rigors of a harsh Canadian winter. But plenty are 
learning the fiscal benefits of having weather-worn Canadians 
descend on their Caribbean island for a blast of tropical heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba is quickly becoming one of the most popular destinations  
for Canadians tired of seeing their loonie devalued by almost half 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question there's phenomenal growth in the  
destination of Cuba,'' said Bob Sime, vice-president at Maritime 
Marlin Travel in Halifax.

 *Drilling Poses Threat to Marine Wonderland: Scientists    	
</P>
<P>
	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Permitting oil and gas companies to  
explore a marine wonderland off the coast of Nova Scotia could kill 
fish stocks and disrupt a unique ecosystem, says a government study 
of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are to be presented today to a panel examining  
whether to extend a 10-year drilling moratorium on Georges Bank 
that expires Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The report summarizes a decade of scientific study of the bank,  
a continental shelf straddling Nova Scotia's southern tip and the 
Gulf of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifting the drilling ban would open the door to oil and gas  
companies eager to explore the region. Experts believe it may 
contain up to 10 trillion cubic meters of natural gas -- potentially 
2 1/2 times the size of Nova Scotia's Sable gas fields. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
 *Size of budget surplus debatable, but spending seems assured    	
</P>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- As federal officials crunch the final numbers for  
the coming budget, almost everyone seems to agree on a couple of 
things: Finance Minister Paul Martin will spend a little, cut taxes 
a bit and set aside a fair chunk of change for a rainy day. 
</P>
<P>
	What's harder to figure out is just how big a surplus he will  
have to spend on these things. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Department officials have been trying to downplay  
expectations that the surplus will top $10 billion when the budget 
is read in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest department figures suggest the surplus will be  
considerably less, something around $7 billion to $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 *In short    	
</P>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Ontario teachers ended Canada's biggest ever  
school strike in 1997 just as their public support was peaking, 
taxpayer-funded polls suggest. A strong majority opposed the strike 
when it began but by the end, more than 50 per cent backed what the 
teachers called a ``political protest,'' according to the 
government-commissioned polls. The unions ended the strike 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- If you have family or friends in  
Alberta you haven't called for a while, you may want to get out 
your little black book. The northern half of the province, 
including the provincial capital of Edmonton, launches a new area 
code today -- 780. The central city of Red Deer and areas south, 
including Calgary, will retain the 403 area code.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Increases Pest Inspections / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Pete Monaruz recalls with frustration the three  
long months last summer when a tiny, tireless bully invaded his 
Wal-Mart store in Douglas near the Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of red import fire ants -- not native to Arizona -- bred  
underneath the store's garden center. The store had to close for a 
day while the problem was eradicated. Monaruz says it is lucky the 
pests did not spread into the rural community. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it gets into the plants that we give to the customers and  
then it gets into their yards, that can multiply there,'' Monaruz 
said. ``I'm always glad to get rid of any pests like that, anything 
that would be destructive. I don't want to go through that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither does the state. While Monaruz's was one of three  
isolated cases reported in Arizona in 1998, a recent fire ant 
infestation in southern California is putting Arizona officials on 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
	The aggressive ant, already the bane of farmers across the  
South, New Mexico and southern California, potentially could wreak 
havoc in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surrounded on three sides, including Mexico, by this  
plant pest,'' said Arizona Department of Agriculture spokesman 
Lloyd Brown. ``We need to do whatever it takes to makes sure it 
doesn't get established in Arizona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jane Hull last week pledged $200,000 in state emergency  
funds toward increased commercial inspections at two ports of entry 
along the California border and Phoenix and Tucson nursery 
inspection stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona is one of 37 states considered by the federal government  
to be free of red imported fire ants. California was added to the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture's list of infested states in 
November, when officials determined that Los Angeles and Orange 
counties are infested, threatening more than 800 nurseries and 
landscape operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the state wants to detect all commercial trucks transporting  
the aggressive ants before they enter Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	John Loghry, manager of Yuma County's citrus pest control  
district, said he fears that if the ants are imported into the 
agricultural region in southern Arizona they will kill livestock, 
blind calves and ruin the produce, citrus and wheat crops that make 
up Arizona's $43 million export industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Loghry also said the ants can eat through wiring on expensive  
farm machinery and build huge mounds in crop fields that are nearly 
impossible to get rid of without expert help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't consider it an agricultural problem. I consider it a  
people problem,'' he said. ``There's no doubt that this ant issue 
will be a serious problem. It lowers your standard of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fire ants aggressively tend to swarm on any object that disturbs  
them. Their sting creates large welts that can last for days. Some 
people are even allergic to the ants and can die from the sting. 
</P>
<P>
	They have infested about 240 million acres in the South, from  
Florida to Texas. Texas alone spends more than $300 million a year 
controlling fire ants. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Arizona's nursery and golf course industries, which  
import about 40 percent of their sod and plants from California, 
hope fire ants never arrive here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'd be terrible because basically you'd have them everywhere.  
They'd be in the irrigation system and the electrical system,'' 
said Tom Patrick, president of the Golf Industry Association of 
Arizona. ``It would be devastating.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Panel Likes IOC Purge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee failed  
to do its job policing Salt Lake bidders in what became the biggest 
scandal in the history of the games, the head of the USOC said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee president Bill Hybl said the panel had taken steps to  
make sure a recurrence of the bribery case that led to the 
unprecedented ouster of six IOC members would never happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look back and ask, `Should we have been better detectives?  
Should we have done a better job at oversight of Salt Lake City?' 
The answer is yes, you can always do a better job,'' he said. ``But 
I can assure you in the future we're going to do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presence of the USOC should be to insure that these types  
of practices don't go on with the bidding cities. We need to make 
sure it is a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference hours after the International Olympic  
Committee announced its actions, Hybl said he getting rid of the 
members who received more than $440,000 in cash, travel and other 
gifts from Salt Lake was a ``good start,'' but warned that more 
will have to be done to restore credibility to the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we will say there is more to be done,'' he said. ``We  
don't think this will be gone tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the six expulsions, a third member resigned in  
the scandal. Three others remained under investigation, while a 
fourth was warned about his actions by the ruling executive board, 
said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup, Hybl said, indicates ``that the International  
Olympic Committee is taking this very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was satisfied that the IOC and Samaranch ``have done  
a very good job in moving the process forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hybl said the moves are only the first of several steps that  
the IOC will take. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will certainly take substantial change to restore  
confidence and credibility'' to the Olympics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC board also recommended a radical change in the selection  
process for the 2006 Winter Games. Under the proposal, visits to 
bid cities by IOC members will be banned and the host will be 
selected by a 15-person body rather than the full assembly March 
17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC would form an ethics commission and  
continue the corruption investigation in other cities, going back 
to the bids for the 1996 Games won by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they go to their March meeting they will be addressing a  
whole series of issues. A series of issues that can make the 
Olympic Movement stronger'' Hybl said, applauding a proposal that 
more athletes participate in the decision-making process in the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that USOC requires athletes to make up at least 20  
percent of all committees and other panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been really helpful,'' he said, by giving the USOC  
the perspective of the athlete on everything form training to diet 
to transportation needs.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Unveil Victim Aid Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department will distribute more  
than $305 million to state programs that help crime victims rebuild 
their lives, Vice President Al Gore will announce Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will be used to cover such crime-related expenses as  
medical treatment, counseling, funeral costs and lost wages, 
according to a member of Gore's staff who discussed the 
announcement Sunday on condition of not being identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, funds will go to nearly 3,000 victim services  
agencies to help crime victims through crises intervention, 
criminal justice advocacy, counseling, and emergency shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will make the announcement while in California, which will  
get more than $43 million in the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking the money out of the hands of criminals and  
giving it to the victims and those who help victims recover from 
the devastating effects of crime,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Operated by the Justice Department, the Crime Victims Fund  
collects fines gathered by U.S. Attorneys office, federal courts 
and prisons paid by federal criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the funds collected come from large criminal fines  
levied against corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is to be distributed to the states by the end of  
February.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Leaders Urge Expulsion of 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Six IOC members were ousted Sunday  
in an unprecedented purge stemming from the biggest corruption 
scandal in the history of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The embattled president of the International Olympic Committee  
said the action was taken to end ``the ugliest chapter'' ever for 
the world's biggest sports event, which in the last two decades has 
also become a billion-dollar business. 
</P>
<P>
	As a third member resigned in the Salt Lake City scandal, IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said three other members remained 
under investigation, while a fourth was warned about his actions by 
the ruling executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members violated their Olympic oath and betrayed the  
confidence put in them by the Olympic family,'' Samaranch said. 
``These actions were inappropriate and against the policy of our 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he had ``temporarily excluded'' the six members,  
with a final vote due in March. The head of the investigation, IOC 
vice president Dick Pound, said the six were essentially expelled 
and could only ask to be reinstated by the remaining 106 IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	A special inquiry found eight IOC members had pocketed more than  
$440,000 in cash and excessive gifts and services. One, Jean-Claude 
Ganga of the Republic of Congo, received more than $216,000, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came at the end of two-day emergency meeting to deal  
with a spiraling crisis that started with allegations of 
vote-buying in Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	While the scandal broke little over a month ago, the IOC acted  
quickly, in part to placate international corporations that pay 
millions of dollars in Olympic sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake, Olympic organizers said they were pleased by the  
``speed and efficiency'' of the IOC's investigation but also 
conceded they made some mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened. Some of these actions should not have  
taken place,'' Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee, said. ``Some of those actions were below the standards 
expected by this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said his panel should  
have a closer watch on Salt Lake organizers but would not allow 
corruption to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look back and ask, `Should we have been better detectives?  
Should we have done a better job at oversight of Salt Lake City?''' 
Hybl said. ``The answer is yes, you can always do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you in the future we're going to do better. The  
presence of the USOC should be to ensure that these types of 
practices don't go on with the bidding cities. We need to make sure 
it is a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC would broaden its investigation to other  
bids stretching from the games of 1996 to 2006. But he stressed 
that Salt Lake would keep the Winter Games and Sydney would remain 
host of the 2000 Summer Games -- despite the scandal that now 
encompasses both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would send two top officials to Sydney within three  
weeks to investigate the situation there. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC board also recommended a radical change in the selection  
process for the 2006 Winter Games. Under the proposal, visits to 
bid cities by IOC members will be banned and the host will be 
selected by a 15-person body rather than the full assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure for future Olympic selections will be decided  
after the 2006 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch offered a personal apology for the recent scandals but  
reiterated he has no intention of heeding the increasing calls for 
his resignation. He said he would ask for a vote of confidence at a 
special IOC general assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the vote on the sanctions was unanimous and all  
of the six had done ``great harm to the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are resolute in our determination to root out the  
improprieties and to ensure that this never happens again,'' he 
said at a packed press conference televised live around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch called the action ``an opportunity to put our house in  
order and enact the necessary measures to keep it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning, not the end of our work,'' he said. ``I  
am certain that the Olympic movement will emerge from the crisis 
stronger than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his panel was not accusing any members of bribery,  
corruption or criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the members were guilty of a ``serious and irreparable  
breach of the IOC oath of membership'' and of bringing the 
organization into ``disrepute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In each case (the offense) was conscious and knowing,'' Pound  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal involved cash payments, scholarships, medical  
treatment and other favors granted to IOC members and their 
families by Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Those members recommended for expulsion were Ganga, Agustin  
Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Lamine 
Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio Santander of 
Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Still under investigation were Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the  
Ivory Coast; Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of 
Russia, Carrard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands was issued a  
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sibandze of Swaziland resigned Sunday, the third member to  
quit in the Salt Lake scandal in six days. Finland's Pirjo Haeggman 
and Libya's Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi resigned last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch urged the six to quit.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do not wait to be expelled by the session,'' he said. ``Put an  
end to the ugliest chapter in the history of the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``These members have done great harm to the Olympic ideal. Now  
their greatest service to the Olympic movement is simply to accept 
their fate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's report listed a total of $440,710 in payments, gifts and  
services to eight IOC members. The report did not include the 
payments made to the three members who resigned, one who died and 
two of those still are investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Ganga received the highest total -- $216,010. The  
figure includes $70,010 in direct payments, $17,000 in medical 
expenses, at least $115,000 in travel expenses for him and his 
family, and $14,000 in gifts and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga has defiantly proclaimed his innocence and vowed he'll  
never resign. Other members have also vowed to fight their ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC would form an ethics commission, mainly  
of independent officials, to monitor the way its members do 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the members implicated in the Salt Lake case, eight were from  
Africa, two from South America, one from Asia and three from 
Europe. Of the six facing expulsion, four are Africans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are most in need are also those who are fragile,  
most open to offers which sometimes verge on the provocative,'' 
said IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a judge on the World 
Court and a member of the inquiry commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound went out of his way to try to reassure the main financial  
backers of the Olympics -- sponsors and television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged the scandals have made them ``concerned and  
anxious'' but promised the IOC would continue to take decisive 
action to protect the integrity of the games 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is one of five bodies investigating the Salt Lake  
scandals. Other inquiries -- some potentially more damaging -- are 
being carried out by the Salt Lake ethics committee, the Justice 
Department and FBI, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Utah 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 2006 Games, the selection of the city will be made by a  
panel consisting of eight IOC members, three athletes, one winter 
sports representative, one national Olympic official, the IOC's 
longest-serving member and the chairman of the 2006 evaluation 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	No members of the executive board, the single most powerful  
panel in the IOC, will be part of the selection group. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel would be headed by Samaranch but the IOC president  
would have no vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will be used as a trial for future votes.  
</P>
<P>
	The decision to expand the inquiry followed allegations and  
disclosures of misconduct from other bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest came from Sydney, where Australian officials used  
financial inducements to help Sydney win the right to stage the 
2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympics chief John Coates offered $70,000 in  
inducements to two African IOC members the night before Sydney 
defeated Beijing by two votes in the 1993 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the offer was not a bribe but part of an assistance  
program for African athletes.

<HEADLINE> Slovenian Kosir Wins Ski Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- Jure Kosir of Slovenia won a men's  
slalom Sunday, and Hermann Maier lost the lead in the overall World 
Cup standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Third after the opening run and trailing by nearly a  
half-second, Kosir produced a flawless second run, covering the icy 
Ganslern course in 49.11 seconds, for a combined time of 1:36.40, 
.04 seconds ahead of Didier Plaschy of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Kosir's second slalom victory of the season, the third of  
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Going out in the opening run and unable to earn World Cup points  
from either the slalom or the combined, Maier dropped from first to 
third in the overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwegians Lasse Kjus and Kjetil Andre Aamodt now are 1-2.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a good weekend for me, falling in the sprint  
downhill then going out today,'' said Maier, the double Olympic 
gold medalist and World Cup super-G and slalom champion. ``I was 
satisfied with the classic downhill, but that wasn't enough to 
retain my lead in the overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough but it's not over. I plan to give Kjus a fight.  
We'll see how motivated Lasse Kjus is after the worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World Championships begin Jan. 31 at Vail, Colo.  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, fourth in Saturday's full downhill, second in the combined  
and 24th in the slalom, took the lead with 1089 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, TV station ORF reported that Kjus, the 1996 overall  
World Cup champion, had been tested following Friday's sprint 
downhill, and suggested that medication he was taking for a lung 
infection could affect test results. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first I've heard about it,'' Kjus said. ``I have been  
tested four times this season and have never failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sad and irritated about these rumors.''  
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt climbed to second, only 35 points behind Kjus, after a  
win in the combined and a ninth place in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier was one point behind Aamodt, the 1994 overall champion.  
</P>
<P>
	Lacking rhythm and control, Maier missed a gate halfway down the  
first run, after skidding on his inner ski and veering off course. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Giorgio Rocca was third, .07 seconds behind, for his  
first career World Cup podium finish. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Pierrick Bourgeat, the leader after the first run, had  
a disastrous second run and dropped to eighth.

<HEADLINE> John Starks Returns to Golden State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- John Starks is returning to the team that  
gave him his first chance in the NBA, and he said he wouldn't 
tolerate losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing is not something I handle well,'' Starks said at a news  
conference Sunday. ``I'm a bad loser. It eats at me and I'm not one 
to keep it inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starks, who came to the Golden State Warriors from the New York  
Knicks along with Terry Cummings and Chris Mills for Latrell 
Sprewell Thursday, was first signed as a free agent by the Warriors 
out of Oklahoma State in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Starks, who wasn't drafted that season, played in 36 games and  
averaged about four points before going to the CBA for a year and 
to the Knicks, where he played for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first year was an adjustment period for me,'' Starks  
said. ``I had to make the cut. It gave me some excitement as to 
what lie ahead for me. It gave me some incentive to work hard and 
get back to that level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starks will be asked to assume a leadership role, as well as to  
fill the shooting guard position for the Warriors, who won 19 games 
last season and missed the playoffs for the third straight season. 
Starks played in 93 playoff games and owns the career record for 
most 3-pointers (175) in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're used to winning, you want to come into a situation  
geared to winning,'' said Starks, an all-star in 1994. ``We have a 
good core of players here ... My job is to perform and help this 
team win.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Sign Clarence Weatherspoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat bolstered their bench by signing  
Clarence Weatherspoon to a three-year contract, and they could be 
in the market for another free-agent forward: Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The mercurial former Chicago Bulls star recently expressed an  
interest in playing for Miami or Orlando. Heat coach Pat Riley said 
he hasn't pursued Rodman but didn't rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking about it,'' Riley said Sunday. ``I don't know if  
he's messing around, if he's serious or whatever. It wouldn't be my 
decision. I'll put it to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting notion. I'll have to think long and hard  
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman is expected to be in Miami this week for the Super Bowl,  
and Riley said the Heat might talk to him. The Heat could offer 
Rodman only $1 million, but only the Bulls are in a position to 
offer him much more than $1.75 million, and he's unlikely to 
re-sign with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon will back up P.J. Brown at power forward and Jamal  
Mashburn at small forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a post-up presence, a solid player ...'' Riley said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Heat used their $1.75 million salary-cap exception on  
Weatherspoon, and his three-year deal totaled just under $5.8 
million. The agreement came after the Heat were unable to acquire 
Weatherspoon for guard Brent Barry in a deal with the Golden State 
Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry instead signed with the Bulls.  
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon has averaged 15 points per game in six NBA seasons,  
mostly with Philadelphia. However, his average has dropped steadily 
in the past five years, from 18.4 points per game in 1993-94 to 9.3 
in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Bull Escapes Rodeo in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A bull escaped from his pen at the  
rodeo and tore through the concourse, bumping into several people 
and knocking over a beer stand before he was roped by cowboys on 
horseback. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified 66-year-old woman was hospitalized when a piece  
of wood left a gash in her head. She was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The bull named Dillinger, a one-ton hornless bull, climbed over  
a 6-foot-high wall at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum Saturday night 
and then ran. 
</P>
<P>
	``It knocked me over and every which way,'' said 21-year-old  
vendor Trent Hackney, who hid behind the beer stand when he saw the 
bull coming and people scurrying for safety. ``I didn't know the 
bull was going to hit the stand, and it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His pants were drenched in beer.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal Gay, who has provided livestock to the Southwestern  
Exposition and Livestock Show and Rodeo for 25 years, said the bull 
was pretty gentle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't want to hurt anybody,'' Gay said. ``The bull was  
just as shaken as many of the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Dillinger ``would have been a fighting bull, it would have  
been a lot worse than it was,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> In NBA, Power Balance Shifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *An AP Sports Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	After four days of the NBA being open for business and a bevy of  
signings and trades, the early returns are in. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners look to be the New York Knicks, Houston Rockets,  
Detroit Pistons, Denver Nuggets, Sacramento Kings and New Jersey 
Nets. The losers are the Chicago Bulls, Charlotte Hornets, Miami 
Heat, Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The balance of power has shifted in the East with the breakup of  
the Bulls and the many changes to Chicago's former pursuers. In the 
West, Houston could replace the Los Angeles Lakers as the most 
likely team to unseat Utah atop the pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at who made out, who didn't and why:  
</P>
<P>
 *WINNERS: 
</P>
<P>
	 *New York Knicks:* The braintrust of Dave Checketts and Ernie  
Grunfeld came to the realization that a player of Latrell 
Sprewell's caliber very rarely comes onto the trade market. They 
took a public relations hit for bringing aboard a questionable 
character after saying they wouldn't, but now they arguably have 
the best two-guard in the Eastern Conference. Other offseason moves 
brought in Marcus Camby, Dennis Scott and Kurt Thomas, and suddenly 
the Knicks no longer are the same old group of graybeards that went 
out in the second round of the playoffs for four straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Houston Rockets:* The Rockets nearly knocked the Jazz out of  
the playoffs a year ago when Clyde Drexler was playing his final 
season. If they had Scottie Pippen instead, the result might have 
been different. They will remain old, vulnerable to injury and not 
very deep, but the front-line nucleus of Pippen, Charles Barkley 
and Hakeem Olajuwon will be formidable come playoff time. If they 
can sign free agent Kevin Johnson, they would be the favorites in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Detroit Pistons:* They didn't come out of the free agent frenzy  
with a point guard, a center or a dead-eye shooter, but still 
improved measurably by signing Clippers power forward Loy Vaught 
and trading for Atlanta free agent forward Christian Laettner. If 
Laettner is healthy in time for the playoff push, Grant Hill will 
have two scorers to dish off to when he's double-teamed driving to 
the basket. The new guys also will open things up for Jerry 
Stackhouse, who re-signed with Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Denver Nuggets:* Won the battle for the hearts and minds of all  
those people surrounding Antonio McDyess, thereby getting him to 
leave Phoenix and return to the team he spent his first two seasons 
with. McDyess joins rookie Raef LaFrentz and the recovered Eric 
Williams on the front line, with newly acquired Nick Van Exel and 
Bryant Stith in the backcourt. Even with the shortened season, the 
Nuggets are a cinch to surpass last season's victory total of 11. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Sacramento Kings:* Went from being Mitch Richmond and four  
nobodies to being Chris Webber, Vlade Divac and three nobodies -- at 
least for now. Corliss Williamson elected to stay for only 
$500,000, and rookies Jason Williams and Predrag Stojakovic won't 
be unknowns for long. If Webber stays aboard and this team starts 
clicking in April, nobody will want them as a first-round opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	 *New Jersey Nets:* Showed Jayson Williams their appreciation by  
rewarding him with a $100 million contract, and solved their 
biggest defensive problem from last year -- the lack of a 
shot-blocker -- by acquiring Jim McIlvaine from Seattle. Should be 
able to lock up Keith Van Horn and Kerry Kittles with long-term 
extensions, and will be perhaps the deepest team in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 *LOSERS 
</P>
<P>
	 *Chicago Bulls:* Have decided to blow off this season and  
rebuild next summer with loads of salary cap room and draft picks, 
which in the long run could work out well. But did it have to come 
to this? So many years of bad blood between the front office and 
the team ultimately led to the demise of the decade's greatest 
dynasty, the retirement of arguably the greatest player ever and 
the disillusionment of one of the greatest coaching minds ever. 
Other teams, after withstanding years of arrogance from this 
franchise, will want to exact some revenge this season and beat the 
Bulls badly -- even if Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown, Ron Harper and Bill 
Wennington are the only familiar faces. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Charlotte Hornets:* Last season, they couldn't decide whether  
they wanted to keep Vlade Divac or Matt Geiger. They ended up 
losing both, and now they're stuck with one of the game's great 
malcontents, Derrick Coleman, in the pivot. Also will be without 
Glen Rice for the first two months of the season, which should 
ensure that the Hornets miss the playoffs for the first time since 
1996. Rice's wrist injury begs the questions: Why did he wait until 
now for surgery? Wouldn't it have been better to take care of it 
during the lockout? 
</P>
<P>
	 *Miami Heat:* Failed to acquire the one player they most wanted  
and needed, Latrell Sprewell, lost their other shooting guard, 
Voshon Lenard, for 10 weeks, then failed to work out a 
sign-and-trade deal for Brent Barry, who cost them the services of 
Isaac Austin last season. Added Clarence Weatherspoon, but failed 
to add any other significant help to a front line that can't 
measure up to Indiana's. Size is such a problem that Pat Riley is 
considering signing Dennis Rodman, setting up an epic clash of 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Golden State Warriors:* Got back three decent players for  
Sprewell, but all three are reserves. That's not much for a player 
who was first team All-NBA a couple years before his attack on P.J. 
Carlesimo. Golden State also lost out on Brent Barry, who actually 
wanted to play there, and will get nothing in return for 
Weatherspoon and Jim Jackson, the two players acquired in the trade 
with Philadelphia for Joe Smith, the former overall No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Los Angeles Clippers:* Nobody wants their free agent money, and  
they lost the chance to put the No. 1 overall pick, Michael 
Olowokandi, through his first NBA training camp. He's playing in 
Europe until Feb. 15. Also will be without two of their best big 
men from last season, Austin and Vaught, but at least they'll be 
better than the Bulls.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutors Say Lewinsky Helpful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a critical juncture in President Clinton's  
impeachment trial, House prosecutors interviewed Monica Lewinsky 
for almost two hours on Sunday and asserted her testimony would 
help the Senate ``determine the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts from the former intern by Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky also disclosed new information to prosecutors --  
that Mrs. Currie made calls from the White House to Ms. Lewinsky 
prior to going to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment later in the day to pick 
up the subpoenaed presents, another source said. The calls 
apparently were not logged. 
</P>
<P>
	The former intern and Currie disagree over which of them  
initiated the pickup and, before Sunday, House prosecutors only had 
a record of a one-minute cellular call from Mrs. Currie to Ms. 
Lewinsky to substantiate Ms. Lewinsky's account. Presidential 
lawyers have suggested that the one-minute call was too short a 
time to have arranged the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview triggered partisan convulsions even before it was  
held and by Sunday morning, even three Republican senators said 
they wanted a swift end to the case. Two of them expressed hope for 
a conclusion this week. 
</P>
<P>
	When the interview ended, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris,  
said she ``added nothing to the record that is already sitting 
before the Senate right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet all three House managers who participated in the interview  
called the session productive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe she would be a witness that would help them  
determine the truth, and that's what we are all endeavoring to do 
during this process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., said Ms. Lewinsky ``might be a very helpful 
witness to the Senate if called.'' Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., 
characterized the former White House intern as ``impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cacheris said his client ``was candid, forthright and extremely  
truthful'' but he insisted that anything she would tell the Senate 
would cover familiar ground. He urged the managers to tell their 
colleagues that it is unnecessary to call Ms. Lewinsky as a 
witness, so that her ``long nightmare'' could end. 
</P>
<P>
	The three congressmen were especially interested in presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan's effort to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky and in 
Oval Office secretary Betty Currie's retrieval of Clinton's gifts 
to Ms. Lewinsky, said the source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the job search and the gift retrieval were  
undertaken to thwart lawyers for Paula Jones, who wanted Ms. 
Lewinsky to testify in the Jones civil lawsuit and also subpoenaed 
the presidential gifts. The White House denies any connection 
between the Jones case, on the one hand, and the job hunt and the 
gift transfer on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues involve some of the most contested evidence before  
the Senate. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mrs. Currie initiated the 
transfer of the presents, and the House prosecutors concluded that 
Clinton put her up to it. Mrs. Currie has testified that Ms. 
Lewinsky initiated the transfer, although she said she had a fuzzy 
memory about some details of telephone conversations she had with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In another key conflict, Ms. Lewinsky testified on one occasion  
that when she asked Clinton what to do with the gifts, he asked her 
to ``Let me think about it.'' On some nine other occasions, she 
couldn't recall any reaction from the president to her question. 
</P>
<P>
	On the job search, the House team insisted that the effort by  
Jordan became intense within a week after Ms. Lewinsky appeared on 
the Jones witness list. Jordan has denied there was any connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team was able to question Ms. Lewinsky directly, while  
lawyers working for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr watched, said 
Hutchinson spokesman Christopher Battle. A source with knowledge of 
the interview said Ms. Lewinsky did not become emotional and that 
the entire session was conducted in a professional manner. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors were set to meet Monday, the deadline for  
submitting a witness list to the Senate. Senators will debate 
whether to call witnesses before taking two votes: first on a 
motion to dismiss the case and then on the decision to take 
depositions of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine, Slade Gorton of  
Washington and Richard Shelby of Alabama sought a fast conclusion 
to the trial. Snowe even predicted, ``I think we will reach a 
conclusion by the end of this week'' with a ``chance to vote up or 
down on the articles of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said both parties should agree on a final vote and ``get  
to it ... promptly.'' Added Shelby: ``Let's close this thing out. 
Let's vote on it up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors also indicated they wanted to talk to  
presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky in her 
job search. Hutchinson said he met with Jordan's lawyer ``laying 
the groundwork ... in the eventuality that he is called as witness. 
And hopefully, I'll be able to talk to Mr. Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, former Clinton political adviser Dick Morris was  
interviewed by House impeachment investigators. He said he was 
asked about his conversations with Clinton as the Lewinsky scandal 
was breaking a year ago. House managers, in presenting their case 
to the Senate, said Clinton's state of mind was important when he 
asked Morris for a poll on Americans' opinion of his conduct with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he would go  
ahead with a plan to submit written questions to Clinton, even 
though White House lawyers -- who first suggested the questions -- 
now say the attorneys would respond rather than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the  
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott 
said in a statement. A response by Clinton attorneys ``is not a 
substitute for the president answering the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that shattered the Senate's bipartisan approach to the  
impeachment trial and caught senators from both parties off guard, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office obtained a court order 
to help the House schedule the interview with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr told reporters outside his home Sunday that his office  
took ``the appropriate action'' and was ``not in any way 
participating other than responding to requests'' from House 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive Sunday, many of the key players had a  
say: 21 senators appeared on the Sunday talk shows, as did five of 
the 13 House prosecutors. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Goes Over Facts Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One year after her first fateful meeting with  
Kenneth Starr's team, Monica Lewinsky was back in another ritzy 
hotel, once more going over her tale of lust in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, who disappeared into the anonymity of Los Angeles  
after testifying before Starr's grand jury last August, was called 
back to Washington at a key point in the Senate impeachment trial 
of President Clinton. Her words could help senators decide whether 
they need to hear from the former intern or other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mayflower hotel security staff buzzing about, a contingent  
of plainclothes Capitol Police inspected the hotel meeting room 
before Ms. Lewinsky sat down with the three House members serving 
as prosecutors, members of Starr's team and her own lawyers. Hotel 
staff set up refreshments -- coffee, tea, soda and a cookie 
assortment ranging from simple sugar to white chocolate chip with 
macadamia nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Republicans congressmen -- Reps. Asa Hutchison of  
Arkansas, Bill McCollum of Florida and Ed Bryant of Tennessee -- had 
to be mindful of criticism of the way Starr's prosecutors handled 
their first meeting with Ms. Lewinsky at a suburban hotel, before 
she became a household name. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not about to put her through the wringer so to speak,  
we are wanting to be very sympathetic to her,'' McCollum said 
earlier Sunday. They had to get a court ruling to force her to 
answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Toricelli, D-N.J., criticized the House members for  
what he said was Ms. Lewinsky's 23rd interview in the case. ``This 
is the intimidation of a 24-year-old girl to try to get her to 
change her story. It is unseemly, it is unnecessary,'' he 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters staked out three hotel exits all day and occasionally  
peered down a side alley, but Ms. Lewinsky mostly stayed out of 
sight. She caused a mild stir when she came down with her mother, 
Marcia Lewis, for breakfast in the hotel's chandelier-bedecked 
restaurant. She had two pancakes and orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
	In her familiar pearls and a black pantsuit, she chatted and  
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``She appeared to be in much better spirits,'' observed  
concierge John Dignan. 
</P>
<P>
	On a damp, sleepy Washington Sunday, two high school students  
from Rockland County, N.Y., hopped off their sightseeing bus to see 
what was up. They snapped photographs of the reporters and TV 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was willing to stand a while in the drizzle, hoping  
for a glimpse of Ms. Lewinsky, 17-year-old Avi Stern insisted he 
was unimpressed by the scandal. ``It's overrated -- the whole 
thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even at a hotel accustomed to serving presidents, foreign  
dignitaries and movie stars, Ms. Lewinsky's presence caused a 
hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest I've seen with all the cameras,'' said  
another concierge, Hirono Castagnola, who was on duty when Ms. 
Lewinsky struggled through a throng of reporters Saturday 
afternoon. ``So many people were around her, pushing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she pushed forward unsteadily, Ms. Lewinsky held her head  
down, her face partly covered by a black baseball cap with the logo 
for The Shooting Gallery, a New York business that helps finance 
independent films. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon the hotel staff was busy fielding calls from people who  
tried all sorts of ploys in vain efforts to get through to Ms. 
Lewinsky. ``I'm her grandmother, her manicurist, her hairstylist, 
any excuse to get to her,'' Castagnola said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen faxes arrived on Sunday, a few with off-color  
comments but most handwritten missives wishing Ms. Lewinsky well. 
``'We're praying for you,' 'It will all be over soon' -- that sort 
of thing,'' said concierge Dignan. 
</P>
<P>
	After checking with Ms. Lewinsky, the hotel threw them all away.  
One telegram for her was refused. ``She really doesn't want to see 
these things,'' Dignan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky likely chose the gilded, polished Mayflower because  
it was directly across Connecticut Avenue from her lawyers' 
offices. But it was a coup for the hotel, which served up coffee 
for reporters camped outside.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutors Say Lewinsky Helpful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a critical juncture in President Clinton's  
impeachment trial, House prosecutors interviewed Monica Lewinsky 
for almost two hours on Sunday and asserted her testimony would 
help the Senate ``determine the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts from the former intern by Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky also disclosed new information to prosecutors --  
that Mrs. Currie made calls from the White House to Ms. Lewinsky 
prior to going to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment later in the day to pick 
up the subpoenaed presents, another source said. The calls 
apparently were not logged. 
</P>
<P>
	The former intern and Currie disagree over which of them  
initiated the pickup and, before Sunday, House prosecutors only had 
a record of a one-minute cellular call from Mrs. Currie to Ms. 
Lewinsky to substantiate Ms. Lewinsky's account. Presidential 
lawyers have suggested that the one-minute call was too short a 
time to have arranged the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview triggered partisan convulsions even before it was  
held and by Sunday morning, even three Republican senators said 
they wanted a swift end to the case. Two of them expressed hope for 
a conclusion this week. 
</P>
<P>
	When the interview ended, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris,  
said she ``added nothing to the record that is already sitting 
before the Senate right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet all three House managers who participated in the interview  
called the session productive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe she would be a witness that would help them  
determine the truth, and that's what we are all endeavoring to do 
during this process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., said Ms. Lewinsky ``might be a very helpful 
witness to the Senate if called.'' Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., 
characterized the former White House intern as ``impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cacheris said his client ``was candid, forthright and extremely  
truthful'' but he insisted that anything she would tell the Senate 
would cover familiar ground. He urged the managers to tell their 
colleagues that it is unnecessary to call Ms. Lewinsky as a 
witness, so that her ``long nightmare'' could end. 
</P>
<P>
	The three congressmen were especially interested in presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan's effort to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky and in 
Oval Office secretary Betty Currie's retrieval of Clinton's gifts 
to Ms. Lewinsky, said the source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the job search and the gift retrieval were  
undertaken to thwart lawyers for Paula Jones, who wanted Ms. 
Lewinsky to testify in the Jones civil lawsuit and also subpoenaed 
the presidential gifts. The White House denies any connection 
between the Jones case, on the one hand, and the job hunt and the 
gift transfer on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues involve some of the most contested evidence before  
the Senate. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mrs. Currie initiated the 
transfer of the presents, and the House prosecutors concluded that 
Clinton put her up to it. Mrs. Currie has testified that Ms. 
Lewinsky initiated the transfer, although she said she had a fuzzy 
memory about some details of telephone conversations she had with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In another key conflict, Ms. Lewinsky testified on one occasion  
that when she asked Clinton what to do with the gifts, he asked her 
to ``Let me think about it.'' On some nine other occasions, she 
couldn't recall any reaction from the president to her question. 
</P>
<P>
	On the job search, the House team insisted that the effort by  
Jordan became intense within a week after Ms. Lewinsky appeared on 
the Jones witness list. Jordan has denied there was any connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team was able to question Ms. Lewinsky directly, while  
lawyers working for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr watched, said 
Hutchinson spokesman Christopher Battle. A source with knowledge of 
the interview said Ms. Lewinsky did not become emotional and that 
the entire session was conducted in a professional manner. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors were set to meet Monday, the deadline for  
submitting a witness list to the Senate. Senators will debate 
whether to call witnesses before taking two votes: first on a 
motion to dismiss the case and then on the decision to take 
depositions of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine, Slade Gorton of  
Washington and Richard Shelby of Alabama sought a fast conclusion 
to the trial. Snowe even predicted, ``I think we will reach a 
conclusion by the end of this week'' with a ``chance to vote up or 
down on the articles of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said both parties should agree on a final vote and ``get  
to it ... promptly.'' Added Shelby: ``Let's close this thing out. 
Let's vote on it up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors also indicated they wanted to talk to  
presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky in her 
job search. Hutchinson said he met with Jordan's lawyer ``laying 
the groundwork ... in the eventuality that he is called as witness. 
And hopefully, I'll be able to talk to Mr. Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, former Clinton political adviser Dick Morris was  
interviewed by House impeachment investigators. He said he was 
asked about his conversations with Clinton as the Lewinsky scandal 
was breaking a year ago. House managers, in presenting their case 
to the Senate, said Clinton's state of mind was important when he 
asked Morris for a poll on Americans' opinion of his conduct with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he would go  
ahead with a plan to submit written questions to Clinton, even 
though White House lawyers -- who first suggested the questions -- 
now say the attorneys would respond rather than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the  
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott 
said in a statement. A response by Clinton attorneys ``is not a 
substitute for the president answering the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that shattered the Senate's bipartisan approach to the  
impeachment trial and caught senators from both parties off guard, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office obtained a court order 
to help the House schedule the interview with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr told reporters outside his home Sunday that his office  
took ``the appropriate action'' and was ``not in any way 
participating other than responding to requests'' from House 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive Sunday, many of the key players had a  
say: 21 senators appeared on the Sunday talk shows, as did five of 
the 13 House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Neighbors Resist Another Woodstock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAUGERTIES, N.Y. (AP) -- Woodstock '94 hit here like a tie-dyed  
tidal wave, bringing some 350,000 revelers grooving in Aquarian 
bliss and moshing in mud pits. 
</P>
<P>
	When the wave receded, the 25th anniversary concert left this  
little Hudson Valley town with a pot of money, a pile of garbage 
and -- for some -- lingering resentment. 
</P>
<P>
	That resentment is emerging now that promoters are trying to  
follow through with a multiday 30th anniversary ``Woodstock '99'' 
festival here in July. Some don't want the hassle of hosting a 
city-sized crowd again. And they don't want another giant muddy 
mess left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents have threatened to sue.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the town board and concert promoters have hit snags  
in negotiations over money. That has left it unclear as of this 
weekend whether Saugerties would even host the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a possibility that it's going elsewhere,'' said Ilene  
Marder, a spokeswoman for the promoters. 
</P>
<P>
	Saugerties Town Supervisor James Griffis said support for the  
concert runs about 50-50 locally. The concert-driven economic boom 
in August '94 and the town's $832,000 cut of proceeds from the 
three-day show was great -- it helped build a new town hall. Many 
here welcome a repeat bonanza with open arms. But not all think 
it's worth the hassle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were people living in that area that didn't like 250,000  
people wandering around the neighborhood,'' said William Mayer, an 
owner of two local McDonald's. Mayer, president of the Saugerties 
Business Association, has given qualified support to Woodstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most vocal opponents is First Baptist Church Pastor  
Thaddeus Dragula, who said the last concert trampled on the 
constitutional rights of the townspeople. He said his flock could 
not go to church that Sunday without presenting a pass at a 
``checkpoint Charlie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One woman had to postpone her husband's funeral until after the  
concert, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragula's group, the Saugerties Alliance, maintains an Internet  
Web site featuring a horror-show gallery of pictures of Woodstock 
'94: revelers writhing in mud, sprawled out in stupors and walking 
around naked. Dragula said some of the bands didn't help matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them, their message was loud and clear,'' he said.  
``One of the groups held up a marijuana joint, a doobie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marder is quick to point out that even the state described the  
crowd as ``peaceful and convivial'' in a post-concert report. She 
said some 900 people have signed pro-Woodstock '99 petitions and 
claims opponents are little more than a vocal minority. 
</P>
<P>
	``I strongly believe the majority of the residents of the Town  
of Saugerties are in favor of another Woodstock,'' Marder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragula disputes that contention, and said his group would have  
no choice but to sue if the town grants a mass gathering permit. 
</P>
<P>
	But even that's up in the air as the town board is at  
loggerheads with promoters headed by Michael Lang, who was behind 
the first two Woodstock shows. 
</P>
<P>
	A sticking point is the town's demand that promoters place  
$150,000 in escrow for expected expenses. Promoters have balked, 
but Griffis said Friday that the majority of the board could agree 
to take less money upfront -- $25,000 -- to get talks moving again. 
</P>
<P>
	The olive branch comes as promoters held out the possibility of  
holding the concert at the abandoned Griffiss Air Force base in 
Rome, N.Y. Officials in that central New York city have been 
receptive to the idea of hosting the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Shifting locations, after all, is a Woodstock tradition.  
Promoters of the original concert in 1969 tried to bring it to 
several locales, before finally getting permission to have the Who, 
Jimi Hendrix and dozens of other artists perform in Bethel, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang moved the site north in 1994 to Saugerties, with the likes  
of Green Day and Aerosmith. This year, no acts have been announced 
yet.

<HEADLINE> McDermott Happy for Late Stardom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At age 37, ``The Practice'' star Dylan McDermott  
doesn't regret waiting a few years to find major fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I had all that money and fame in my 20s, I might  
have turned to drugs and alcohol and wound up blowing everything I 
had,'' McDermott says in Sunday's Daily News. ``Instead, I had the 
slow, steady process. Many of the movies I made did not do well. 
Some movies I had to go away and make didn't even come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott, whose quality film credits include ``Steel  
Magnolias'' and ``In the Line of Fire,'' also appeared in less 
noteworthy pictures including ``Hamburger Hill,'' ```Til There Was 
You,'' ``Destiny Turns on the Radio'' and ``Where Sleeping Dogs 
Lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott grew up in New York, where his father owned the West  
Fourth Street Saloon in Greenwich Village and the would-be actor 
got to meet a lot of artistic characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put it this way, I wouldn't recommend my childhood for anyone,  
but it was great for being an actor,'' said McDermott, whose Emmy 
Award-winning TV series earned him a recent Golden Globe 
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Canoeist in First Amendment Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- Timothy Boomer made a bigger splash than  
he bargained for after a tumble from a canoe landed him in a fight 
over whether foul language is legally protected free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheriff's deputy says he heard Boomer explode in a  
three-minute barrage of profanity after the mishap on the Rifle 
River last summer, loud enough to be heard a quarter-mile away. 
What's more, he says, a woman and her two young children were 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	So the officer ticketed Boomer under an 1897 Michigan law that  
prohibits cursing in front of women and children. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer, 24, insists his words have been exaggerated. But defense  
attorney William Street, who took the case on behalf of the 
American Civil Liberties Union, says that even if Boomer was 
boorish, he was within his First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer's trial is scheduled for Thursday, but Street on Monday  
will ask a judge to throw out the charge and declare the law 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an understandable desire for more civility in our  
society. But do we want to give police the power to enforce it?'' 
Street asked. ``Heaven forbid, we have sex police. Are we now going 
to have language police?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Arenac County Prosecutor Richard Vollbach says the  
case involves no lofty constitutional issues. Instead, he says, it 
is a simple matter of disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think this poor, hardworking guy fell in the river and  
just said `Oh, damn' and the Nazis came and arrested him,'' 
Vollbach said. ``He's doing what he can to come across as a martyr, 
but that is not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the case goes to trial and Boomer is convicted, he could get  
up to 90 days in jail and a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rifle River winds through rural Ogemaw and Arenac counties,  
about 130 miles north of Detroit, before emptying into Lake Huron. 
It's a slow-moving, tree-lined waterway popular with canoeists. 
</P>
<P>
	People living along the river have complained about cursing and  
other rowdy behavior by boaters, said Ben Welmers, editor of the 
weekly Arenac County Independent. The newspaper reported last 
spring that police were beefing up patrols along the river. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been canoeing on that river a lot,'' said Jessica  
Davidson, a bakery cook in the county seat of Standish. ``There's 
no reason for all the screaming and lewdness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer, who lives in the Detroit suburb of Roseville and works  
for a company that makes automobile assembly lines, went canoeing 
with his fiancee and four other couples in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree Boomer fell into the water. What happened next  
is in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went on a three-minute profanity tirade in front of a  
2-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy,'' Vollbach said. ``The mother 
literally covered the ears of her daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer declined in a telephone interview to repeat his words,  
but he insisted everything was in a joking spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way it was three minutes,'' he said. ``It was with  
a group of friends, just having a good time. There was no anger, 
hostility, of any kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kary L. Moss, executive director of the ACLU in Michigan, said  
the law that bans cursing unconstitutionally singles out women for 
special treatment and ``is based upon outmoded stereotypes about 
women's sensitive nature and need for protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Additionally, the law is ... a classic violation of the First  
Amendment,'' Ms. Moss said in a statement. ``It openly declares the 
use of language as a crime, penalizing the mere utterance of 
words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Street said the law was rarely enforced because prosecutors know  
it's unconstitutional. Judges elsewhere have reached that 
conclusion, but the cases were not taken to appellate courts whose 
rulings would apply statewide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never asked for any of this,'' Boomer said. ``But I decided  
to fight this law because ... I just believe it's a violation of 
freedom of speech.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos Coach Tired of Feud Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Only three hours after his team's arrival at the  
Super Bowl, Mike Shanahan issued a warning to the media: Enough 
already with the questions about Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	Any more queries about the Falcons coach will be met with icy  
stares and testy retorts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first of six scheduled sessions with the media this week,  
the Denver Broncos coach grew increasingly angry when he was asked 
on three occasions about that relationship. Shanahan, formerly the 
Broncos' offensive coordinator under Reeves, was fired by Reeves in 
January 1992 for alleged insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves and Shanahan rehashed the issues separately last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, Reeves apologized for stirring up bitter  
feelings about the longstanding feud with Shanahan and Broncos 
quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the apology, Shanahan said, ``I'm glad it's over.  
The emphasis should be on the players on our team, and as far as 
I'm concerned it's over with, and we can get ready to play the 
Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Shanahan was asked if Reeves' comment a week ago caught  
him off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I'm not going to have a response this  
week,'' he said. ``It's over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to elaborate on his comment last Thursday that he believed  
his relationship with Reeves was irreparably damaged, Shanahan 
snapped, ``Well, let me make this clear, maybe I didn't make this 
clear. What I'm talking about right now is about the Denver 
Broncos, or if you want to talk about the Atlanta Falcons. We're 
not going to get into my past relationship with Dan. We addressed 
that last week, and now we move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the Broncos were a happy bunch after their arrival at  
Fort Lauderdale International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	But of the half dozen players who addressed the media at an  
interview session Sunday night, not one was heard to say the 
obligatory greeting, ``We're happy to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most, they expected to be here.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is why we worked so hard since last April,'' cornerback  
Ray Crockett said. ``We got here last year and won it, and that 
made us even hungrier to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos are making their sixth Super Bowl appearance, but  
the first as defending champions. Their team charter, with a 
Broncos logo and ``1998 AFC Champions'' emblazoned on the sides, 
arrived in warm, sunny weather, unlike the cool, rainy conditions 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no interviews and only a few Broncos fans were on  
hand for the arrival at a remote area of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos immediately boarded four buses and were escorted  
from the tarmac by Broward County sheriff's vehicles to their 
hotel, where more fans had already staked out the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' first four Super Bowl trips -- after the 1977, 1986,  
1987 and 1989 seasons -- ended in losses, by increasingly large 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of those games, the Broncos were overmatched, and in  
those appearances during the '80s, Elway represented virtually 
their entire offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``John needed to pass for 500 yards in order for him to win  
those (last three) games against the Giants, Redskins and 49ers,'' 
Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``In essence, all the Broncos 
had on offense was John Elway, and he had to play way above even 
his own standards in order for the Broncos to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in their fifth trip, last year at San Diego, the Broncos  
brought a different package. Terrell Davis was a force at running 
back, preventing opponents from loading up against their star 
passer. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis ran for 157 yards and three touchdowns, earning MVP  
honors, as the Broncos beat the favored Green Bay Packers 31-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Elway and Davis return to the Super Bowl in what likely  
will be the final game of Elway's brilliant 16-year career, a 
career that has seen him record more victories than any starting 
quarterback in NFL history (148) and join Dan Marino as the only 
50,000-yard passers in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 38-year-old Elway fading from the scene, Davis has  
taken center stage. He rushed for 2,008 yards this season -- only 
the fourth back in NFL history to reach the 2,000-yard plateau -- 
and was the league's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love for John to win the MVP if this is his last  
game, throwing for 400 yards or whatever,'' Sharpe said. ``But our 
bread and butter is Terrell.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplane Attacks Iraqi Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. warplane patrolling Iraq's northern  
``no-fly'' zone Sunday attacked an Iraqi surface-to-air missile 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. F-15E launched a precision-guided missile on the Iraqi  
installation after aircraft in the area reported they were 
illuminated by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile system, said Air 
Force Lt. Col. Dennis Linn at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	A pilot whose plane is illuminated, or ``painted'' by radar,  
assumes he is about to be fired upon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said the AGM-130 missile ``suppressed'' the Iraqi  
site and there was no damage to American and British planes 
enforcing the no-fly zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Linn did not immediately know if the planes returned safely to  
the NATO base in Incirlik, Turkey.

	The incident occurred at 10:45 a.m. Iraqi time, or 6 a.m. EST.  
</P>
<P>
	There were no incidents Sunday in the southern no-fly zone.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, American warplanes, threatened by Iraqi MiGs and  
anti-aircraft ground fire, dropped laser-guided bombs on two 
surface-to-air missile sites in southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has demanded that the United States and Britain end what  
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein calls their ``illegal'' patrols in 
the restricted zones set up over northern and southern Iraq to 
protect Iraqi Kurds and Shiite Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said the bans will be fully enforced  
because they are central to the U.S. strategy for containing Iraq's 
military and protecting minority Kurds and Shiite Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Utah Olympic Leaders Promise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake's Olympic bidders were done in  
by a desire to please, according to the IOC official whose report 
on Sunday detailed $440,710 spent by the bid on eight IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half the total -- $216,000 -- went to one member,  
Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo. The figure includes 
$70,010 in direct payments, $17,000 in medical expenses, at least 
$115,000 in travel expenses for him and his family, and $14,000 in 
gifts and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which did not include bid committee payments to the  
three members who resigned, one who died and two still under 
investigation, was issued at the end of a soul-wrenching weekend at 
IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members who were the recipients of the Salt Lake bid  
committee's largesse were ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the action was  
taken to end ``the ugliest chapter'' ever for the world's biggest 
sports event, which in the last two decades has also become a 
billion-dollar business. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who led the investigation into  
the payments, said Salt Lake's bid committee simply showed ``a 
willingness to please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing we saw amounted to a quid pro quo, the purchase and  
sale of a vote,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members were not accused of bribery or criminal conduct, but  
actions that broke the IOC oath and brought disrepute to the IOC, 
Pound said. Samaranch apologized to the citizens of Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	In the city at the center of the Olympics' biggest scandal, Salt  
Lake Olympic organizers called Samaranch's apology ``brave'' and in 
turn apologized to the residents of Utah for some overzealous bid 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened. Some of these actions should not have  
taken place,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff praised the ``speed and efficiency'' with which IOC  
investigated the matter, decided to investigate other cities' bids 
and came up with reforms for the way bid cities are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does validate what we have said all along: that these  
problems didn't start here but we hope they end here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff and Frank Joklik, the president of SLOC who has resigned  
but remains on the job while his successor is sought, declined to 
talk about details of the report issued in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	And they refused to talk about matters still under investigation  
by SLOC's outside ethics panel, the Justice Department and the U.S. 
Olympic Committee. Utah's attorney general also plans an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik did say, however, that SLOC is ``not aware of any  
criminal conduct having been involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said the ethics panel's report would be completed before  
Feb. 11, and he promised to take ``decisive action'' against anyone 
found to have acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot change the past but we can have an enormous impact  
on the future,'' Garff said. ``All of our efforts are dedicated to 
creating a new and better Olympic era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee will reevaluate its ethics policies;  
find new chief executive and chief operating officers; solidify 
sponsor support and restore public confidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior vice president David Johnson was forced to resign Jan. 8,  
the same day former bid and organizing president Tom Welch was 
stripped of his pension and consulting contract. Two others, senior 
vice president of marketing and legal affairs Kelly Flint and 
licensing director Rod Hamson were placed on paid leave while the 
investigations are underway. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado Springs, Colo., United States Olympic Committee  
president William Hybl praised the decision to oust the six IOC 
members and said his committee could have done a better job 
overseeing the Salt Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look back and ask, `Should we have been better detectives?  
Should we have done a better job at oversight of Salt Lake City?' 
The answer is yes, you can always do a better job,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you in the future we're going to do better,'' he  
said. ``The presence of the USOC should be to ensure that these 
types of practices don't go on with the bidding cities. We need to 
make sure it is a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One section of the IOC report seemed to indicate Joklik had  
progressed from defending the bid committee's payments via its 
national Olympic committees program to saying on Jan. 8 that he 
knew nothing about the lavish spending. He was the volunteer 
chairman of the Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC report notes that when the commission met Dec. 11 with  
Joklik, Johnson and Flint, ``They defended the program and took the 
position that the payments were not connected with the bid and that 
there was no quid pro quo pertaining to them, i.e., no promise of 
support for the bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The evident connection with the bidding process and the date  
profile of the payments were, however, inescapable,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NOC program was established in late 1991 or early 1992 after  
Salt Lake lost its bid for the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not clear exactly to what degree the existence of the  
program was known by the bid committee as a whole, although we are 
advised by SLOC that it appears as a line item in the audited 
financial statements of the bid committee,'' the report said.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Clinton is a ``glorious'' man  
victimized by a ``vast and sinister'' conspiracy, Nobel literature 
laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote in a magazine article 
published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 71-year-old Colombian author asked in Cambio magazine if it  
was fair that Clinton ``must squander his historic destiny just 
because he couldn't find a safe place to make love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The novelist, who first met Clinton in 1995 at a dinner on  
Martha's Vineyard, said the president had dealt with the scandal 
with dignity, and was justified if he didn't tell the whole truth 
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The president of Honduras replacing  
five ministers Sunday in a Cabinet shake-up he said would 
strengthen efforts to rebuild after Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the Cabinet had been criticized for their  
efforts at responding to the hurricane, which raged through the 
country in October and November, killing more than 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	President Carlos Flores Facusse said more changes are possible  
in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Flores named Enrique Flores Valeriano to replace Delmer Urbizo  
Panting at the Interior Ministry, Plutarco Castellanos to replace 
Marco Antonio Rosa at Public Health, Rose Miranda to replace Victor 
Andres Artiles in Labor, Guillermo Alvarado Downing to replace 
Pedro Sevilla y Gomez in Agriculture, and Xiomara Gomez to replace 
Elvin Ernesto Santos in the Environmental Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Flores replaced Foreign Minister J. Fernando  
Martinez with Roberto Flores Bermudez, a former ambassador to the 
United States and Britain.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The price of Honduran coffee, the  
country's leading export, has tumbled as a result of the Brazilian 
economic crisis, the national coffee growers association has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency, the real, has fallen in value by about  
30 percent recently, making the country's coffee prices more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of a 100-pound bag has fallen to $107 from $125 as a  
result of the Brazilian devaluation, Fernando Montes, president of 
the Honduran Coffee Institute said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling coffee prices are aggravating economic problems caused  
by Hurricane Mitch which raged through Honduras in October and 
November, devastating the Central American nation's agricultural 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee exports earn Honduras, one of the hemisphere's poorest  
countries, more than $400 million a year. For every dollar that 
coffee prices fall, Honduras loses $2.4 million, Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honduras is the world's 10th largest producer of coffee.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopes Lewinsky Can Provide Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats point out that Monica Lewinsky has  
spoken under oath 22 times to the grand jury, to prosecutors, and 
the FBI and say she has said all she has to say about her affair 
with President Clinton. Republican prosecutors suggest she still 
holds some hidden key to the president's guilt or innocence in the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors came to their informal meeting with Ms.  
Lewinsky Sunday looking for something new on several subjects where 
her testimony and that of the president is at odds. 
</P>
<P>
	With any new information, they'd be ready for the next stage,  
proposing to the Senate that she be deposed and eventually appear 
before the senators as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	The clashes in her statements and the president's:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Ms. Lewinsky said that Clinton's secretary Betty Currie  
initiated the retrieval of gifts that Clinton had given her, an 
argument prosecutors have used to bolster their case that Clinton 
obstructed justice by trying to hide the gifts. Currie at one point 
said it was Lewinsky who suggested the return of the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ms. Lewinsky said Clinton was noncommittal when she talked to  
him about returning subpoenaed gifts. Clinton testified that he had 
told her that if she was asked for the gifts she should turn them 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The White House defense team repeatedly cited her testimony  
that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job 
for my silence.'' Prosecutors have pointed out that Ms. Lewinsky 
also said it was assumed by the president that she would lie in her 
testimony in the Paula Jones case to cover up the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	-- She testified that she had discussed aspects of her affair  
with the president with presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who was 
helping her find a job. Jordan testified that they did not discuss 
the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the 13 House prosecutors,  
said Sunday that he wanted to ask Lewinsky about reported 
statements by the president that she stalked him and he never 
touched her. ``I want to ask the young lady how she felt about 
those statements being made about her, how she felt about what was 
coming out in the press when people thought maybe she's a little 
unstable, she's a little overweight, she comes from a broken 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., another prosecutor, added that they  
wanted to question her ``relative to her current state-of-mind on 
the grand jury testimony that she gave. We want to know whether or 
not there's anything in particular that we don't know that she 
might tell us that is different in any way.''

<HEADLINE> Monica Talks to Impeachment Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid the oriental carpets, polished wood and  
crystal of the Mayflower Hotel's fanciest suite -- the Presidential 
-- Monica Lewinsky told her story once again, this time to a covey 
of congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
	With dozens of reporters and gawkers camped outside the downtown  
hotel's entrances Sunday, Ms. Lewinsky kept mostly out of sight. It 
was reminiscent of her days hiding inside the family's Watergate 
apartment as the news media lusted after details of her affair with 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	She had disappeared for months into the anonymity of her  
sprawling hometown, Los Angeles, only to be called back for an 
interview that could be pivotal to the course of Clinton's Senate 
trial. One source familiar with the meeting described Ms. 
Lewinsky's demeanor as calm and professional. 
</P>
<P>
	The three House Republicans who met with her for one hour, 45  
minutes were full of praise. She was poised and intelligent, a 
``very personable and impressive young woman,'' said Rep. Bill 
McCollum of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, one of her lawyers, Plato Chacheris, referred to her  
entire scandal experience as a ``long nightmare'' that he hoped 
would end soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting came just over a year after Ms. Lewinsky's first  
encounter with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors, who 
questioned late into the night in another ritzy hotel, this one in 
the Washington suburbs. Ms. Lewinsky has said she felt threatened, 
and it was months before she signed an agreement to cooperate with 
Starr in exchange for immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the interview, also attended by some of Starr's team,  
took place in the same Presidential Suite where Clinton's mother, 
Virginia Kelley, stayed during his 1993 inaugural ceremonies. It 
boasts special security monitors, two bedrooms and three bathrooms 
and normally rents for $5,000 per night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky looked cheery during a brief appearance in the  
hotel lobby earlier Sunday, when she came down for breakfast with 
her mother, Marcia Lewis, in the hotel's chandelier-bedecked 
restaurant. In her familiar pearls and a black pantsuit, she 
chatted and smiled. She ate two pancakes and orange juice, hotel 
staff said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a sharp contrast from her harried arrival Saturday  
afternoon, when hotel security men helped her push her through a 
throng of reporters and cameras, her head down and face hidden 
beneath a black baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the TV cameras were kept outside in the drizzling  
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Consuelo Cuadros, who lives in a condo three blocks away, waited  
at the hotel in hopes of seeing the three House members -- McCollum, 
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, D-Ark., and Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. -- to tell 
them, ``You're doing an excellent job. God bless you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was willing to stand a while in the drizzle, hoping  
for a glimpse of Ms. Lewinsky, 17-year-old Avi Stern of Rockland 
County, N.Y., insisted he was unimpressed by the scandal. ``It's 
overrated -- the whole thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even at a hotel accustomed to serving presidents, foreign  
dignitaries and movie stars, Ms. Lewinsky's presence caused a 
hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel staff fielded calls from people who tried all sorts of  
ploys in vain efforts to get through to Ms. Lewinsky. ```I'm her 
grandmother,' 'her manicurist,' 'her hairstylist,' any excuse to 
get to her,'' concierge Hirono Castagnola said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen faxes arrived for her, a few with off-color  
comments but mostly handwritten missives wishing Ms. Lewinsky well. 
``'We're praying for you,' 'It will all be over soon' -- that sort 
of thing,'' said concierge John Dignan. 
</P>
<P>
	After checking with Ms. Lewinsky, the hotel threw them all away.  
One telegram for her was refused. ``She really doesn't want to see 
these things,'' Dignan said.

<HEADLINE> 'Coasterphobic' Cure Sought at Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos NY108-109    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The terrified scream of a roller coaster rider may  
be rooted in deeper fears, according to two psychologists trying to 
cure the phenomena they dub ``coasterphobia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning this week, Drs. Brian Newmark and Michael Otto will  
try to help frightened would-be roller coaster riders at the 
Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loss of control seems to be the big issue with most of these  
folks,'' said Newmark, a clinical psychologist in Wayland, Mass. 
``No one has really considered the psychological problems of 
coasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The psychologists have developed some guidelines to help staff  
members at the park's two biggest thrill machines -- ``Dueling 
Dragons'' and ``The Hulk Coaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful patrons will be escorted to a ``calming zone,'' a room  
comfortably appointed with couches and plants, where they'll do 
breathing and relaxation exercises and watch a videotape of the 
roller coaster in action. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get a few tools about how not to tense up,'' said Otto,  
director of the Cognitive-Behavior Therapy Program at Massachusetts 
General Hospital and an associate professor of psychology at 
Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	He says watching the videotape and performing exercises that  
induce dizziness will let nervous riders have a ``pre-rehearsal,'' 
hopefully making the real thing more bearable. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ride, anyone who feels too woozy to return to the  
hubbub of the park can take advantage of a second calming zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The park, which is operated by Universal Studios, doesn't  
officially open until this summer. So to test the system about 15 
``coasterphobics'' have been recruited to join Newmark and Otto at 
the park this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychologists said one of the criteria for selection to the  
coasterphobic group was the ability to see how a ride on a roller 
coaster could be ``potentially fun,'' Newmark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will get the attention of specially trained park  
staffers as they steel themselves to ride the roller coasters, and 
be paired with coaster enthusiasts who will coach them through the 
ride, Otto said. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be a daunting trip. Universal brags that the two  
coasters ``will transport roller coaster aficionados to terrifying 
new levels'' as they make 60 mph dives and zoom through ``compound 
inversions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the group will be Brian Kurth, a 32-year-old product  
manager at a Chicago telecommunications firm who hasn't been on a 
roller coaster since he was a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth wants to have fun on the ride. But he has deeper goals,  
too, and hopes that overcoming his terror of a coaster ride will 
help him get over his fear of flying. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a larger level, I have the desire to get over some  
irrational fears of things you really don't have control over,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth's thoughts are shared by fellow coasterphobics, some of  
whom ``saw this as one piece of concrete evidence of them not being 
able to take risks,'' Newmark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They saw this as an opening of the bigger picture.''  
</P>
<P>
	The roller coaster counseling also could smooth out some family  
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Newmark, one coasterphobic told him that ``his  
family calls him the cluck-cluck.''

<HEADLINE> Battle Looms in Congress Over Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite assurances of bipartisanship, a fierce  
struggle is brewing between Democrats and Republicans over the 
GOP's proposal for a 10 percent income tax cut that would swallow a 
chunk of the budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest battle may be on how we have a tax cut,'' said  
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Still smarting from losses in the 1998 elections, Republicans  
are determined to push through a significant cut -- relief for 
married couples and eliminating inheritance taxes are also atop 
their list -- so they're not viewed by voters as a party obsessed 
with impeaching President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pledge to you,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas,  
told a conservative audience last week, ``this year the House 
leadership will fight tooth and nail to provide real tax relief to 
American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are just as adamant that the surplus -- now estimated  
by the White House at $4.4 trillion in the next 15 years -- should 
be used mainly to keep Social Security and Medicare from insolvency 
as the huge baby boom generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union speech, Clinton made those programs  
the top priority for the surplus and outlined other spending plans 
but made no mention of broad tax relief. His coming budget proposal 
does contain a variety of modest tax credits for child care, 
disabled workers and other targeted needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if agreement is reached with Republicans on Social Security  
and Medicare, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said a 10 percent 
across-the-board income tax cut is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited an analysis by the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice  
showing that the GOP proposal translates into an average tax cut of 
$99 for people earning below $38,000, but $20,697 for people making 
more than $301,000. That same analysis estimated the overall cost 
of the cut at more than $1 trillion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a growing disparity between the very rich and  
everybody else,'' said Gephardt, D-Mo. ``If there's going to be tax 
relief -- and we think there should be -- it should go to the people 
who desperately need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota said in the GOP's  
weekly radio address Saturday that federal, state and local taxes 
now consume 40 percent of a typical family's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're working nearly three hours of each eight-hour work day  
just to pay off your tax bill,'' Grams told his audience. ``The 
across-the-board tax cut is fair, because we're not pitting one 
group of taxpayers against the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is noteworthy that the Senate GOP has taken the lead in  
promoting a tax relief agenda. Last year, the House pushed through 
a five-year, $80 billion package of tax cuts, but it never reached 
a vote in the Senate amid veto threats from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Many conservative Republicans were furious that Senate GOP  
leaders would not take a stand last fall on taxes. The party has 
vowed not to repeat the omission in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to push ahead on major tax relief,'' said Senate  
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del. ``The 
across-the-board cut is the top priority, but we think the surplus 
is big enough to do a number of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost among those other things is the so-called ``marriage  
penalty,'' which causes an estimated 21 million two-earner couples 
to pay more taxes than they would if they had remained single. Of 
those, 56 percent have incomes below $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, is proposing to double the  
standard income tax deduction for joint returns, which in effect 
would eliminate the penalty and give a greater tax benefit to other 
married couples who now pay less than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should not have to choose between love and money,''  
Hutchison said. ``In a country that values families, this must 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third tax-cut priority for the GOP is elimination of estate or  
inheritance taxes, also a top issue for such Republican 
constituencies as small business operators and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must cut death taxes,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.,  
``so that families don't have to sell their businesses and farms 
when Mom and Dad die.''

<HEADLINE> McDermott Happy for Late Stardom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At age 37, ``The Practice'' star Dylan McDermott  
doesn't regret waiting a few years to find major fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I had all that money and fame in my 20s, I might  
have turned to drugs and alcohol and wound up blowing everything I 
had,'' McDermott says in Sunday's Daily News. ``Instead, I had the 
slow, steady process. Many of the movies I made did not do well. 
Some movies I had to go away and make didn't even come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott, whose quality film credits include ``Steel  
Magnolias'' and ``In the Line of Fire,'' also appeared in less 
noteworthy pictures including ``Hamburger Hill,'' ```Til There Was 
You,'' ``Destiny Turns on the Radio'' and ``Where Sleeping Dogs 
Lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott grew up in New York, where his father owned the West  
Fourth Street Saloon in Greenwich Village and the would-be actor 
got to meet a lot of artistic characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put it this way, I wouldn't recommend my childhood for anyone,  
but it was great for being an actor,'' said McDermott, whose Emmy 
Award-winning TV series earned him a recent Golden Globe 
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Fertilizer Found To Damage Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A 7,000-square-mile dead zone in the Gulf  
of Mexico caused by the runoff of fertilizer is getting worse and 
the only solution may be to change farming practices throughout the 
Corn Belt, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Every spring and summer, nitrogen from agricultural fertilizer  
washes down the Mississippi River and into the northern Gulf of 
Mexico. The nutrient-rich waters trigger a bloom of algae which 
strips the water of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers attending the national meeting of the American  
Association for the Advancement of Science this weekend said that 
by midsummer, an area of the Gulf extending from Louisiana to Texas 
becomes so oxygen-deprived that most fish and shrimp escape to 
healthier waters, leaving behind a vast ``dead zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy N. Rabalais of Louisiana State University said the average  
size of the dead zone has doubled in size since 1992 and is now 
persisting from May until October in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrimp, menhaden and other valuable species have not been  
affected because these animals simply flee the bad water, said 
Rabalais, but bottom-dwellers, such as worms, starfish and some 
single-celled animals are killed. At the same time, some microbes 
that prefer low-oxygen waters explode, forming a white, cotton-like 
mass that floats on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what the long-term effects of this will be on  
the ecology of the Gulf,'' said Rabalais. ``The hypoxia (lack of 
oxygen) has decimated a number of organisms living in the 
sediments'' and such a change is bound to affect the ecology of the 
Gulf, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mississippi River drains about 40 percent of the United  
States and carries more than a million tons of nitrogen, much of it 
washed from the agricultural fields in the Midwestern farm belt, 
said Otto Doering, a professor at Purdue University. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the nitrogen dumped into the Gulf comes from natural  
sources and from cities and industry, but ``agriculture uses 6.5 
million metric tons of nitrogen a year and is clearly a major 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doering said farmers could reduce nitrogen runoff by 20 percent  
by changing farm management practices. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the goal could be reached if farmers stopped fertilizing  
in the fall and if major wetlands were restored along the 
Mississippi River watershed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetlands retain the nitrogen and the chemical then tends to  
disappear into the atmosphere, he said. The wetlands also would 
increase wildlife habitat and improve water quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Using less fertilizer would reduce crop yield and a 20 percent  
reduction is about the limit before there would serious economic 
consequences for farmers and the nation, according to a scientific 
assessment by Doering and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beyond 20 percent, there is a serious disruption in terms of  
high food prices, an increasing drop in exports and a loss of 
farmland,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doering said it may take regulation or a tax on nitrogen  
fertilizer to force changes in farming practices. Just how this 
will be done, he said, has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farm groups may need to be compensated,'' he said. ``We don't  
know how this would affect the individual farmers.''

<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Gets Day in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- First he said he did nothing wrong. Then he  
admitted mistakes and asked for mercy. Now he's on trial, accused 
of crimes several steps removed from the rumors of an extramarital 
affair that first jeopardized his job and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Henry Lyons says the biggest difference between himself  
-- the prominent leader of a large black church organization, the 
National Baptist Convention USA -- and President Clinton is that 
ordinary Americans already have forgiven Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of amazing to see especially African-Americans bless  
him so much and so willing to stone me,'' Lyons told a Nashville, 
Tenn., television station last week. ``But I hope to overcome even 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were scheduled to begin in Florida on Monday  
in Lyons' racketeering and grand theft trial. If convicted, he 
could be sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The case started in the summer of 1997 when Lyons' wife was  
charged with setting fire to a $700,000 waterfront home he owned 
with another woman. The news prompted prosecutors to follow the 
trail of the minister's money, and they found records of expensive 
homes, diamond jewelry and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors pointed to a secret bank account and accused him of  
stealing the money used to finance his lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-owner of the waterfront house was Lyons' co-defendant in  
the trial, Bernice Edwards, the convention's former public 
relations director. She is charged with racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are accused of duping companies seeking to do business  
with the convention's members. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand theft charge against Lyons involves more than $200,000  
entrusted to him by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to 
help rebuild Southern black churches burned by arson fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony is expected to last about a month and revolve around  
financial details of deals between Lyons and white businessmen 
hoping to secure a segment of the black consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
	After his state trial, Lyons is scheduled to stand trial this  
spring on 54 federal charges of bank fraud, wire fraud, extortion 
and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases center in large part on Lyons' and Edwards' dealings  
with the world's second-largest funeral company, The Loewen Group, 
based in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The company wanted to crack the black community, where people  
traditionally seek out independent black funeral directors. Lyons' 
claims that the convention had more than 8.5 million black members 
was a hoax, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was to deliver black Baptists and the convention would  
receive 33 percent of sales through commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, prosecutors say, just $187,600 of Loewen's money went  
to market cemetery plots, while more than $1.6 million went to 
Lyons, his friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the fire that started the investigation, Lyons' wife,  
Deborah, denied ever believing her husband had cheated on her, 
blaming her actions on problems with alcohol. She was sentenced to 
five years' probation on an arson charge. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Lyons denied the accusations for months before  
publicly apologizing for unnamed transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sinned,'' he said. ``And I have displayed human  
weaknesses and frailties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons has survived several attempts to oust him as president of  
the National Baptist Convention USA, although three ministers now 
are challenging his attempt to win another five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want America, African-Americans and all Americans to know  
that Henry Lyons is not guilty of all these crimes,'' Lyons said 
last week, ``and I just need my day in court.''

<HEADLINE> Canucks Fire Coach Mike Keenan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Mike Keenan, the NHL's gypsy  
coach, is through in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing Keenan had lost the heart to coach, and calling the last  
month ``an unmitigated disaster,'' Vancouver Canucks president and 
general manager Brian Burke felt he had no choice but to fire 
Keenan and replace him with Marc Crawford, who led the Colorado 
Avalanche to the 1996 Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two days of speculation over Keenan's status ended Sunday  
evening when Burke announced he had dismissed Keenan and signed 
Crawford to a 3 1/2-year deal. Monetary terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become clear to me that as the season progressed, a  
change was needed,'' Burke said. ``We had a better start (to the 
season) than most people predicted that we would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble, as far as Burke saw it, began just prior to the  
Christmas break after the Canucks beat the Calgary Flames on 
consecutive nights. Since then, the Canucks (15-24-6) have gone 
into a tailspin, having won only twice in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have issues with the way our hockey club has been coached,''  
Burke said. ``What accelerated my thinking on this change was the 
way Mike has coached since Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``His heart just did not appear to be in coaching our hockey  
club. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said he didn't know the reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``But it was apparent to me that Mike was indifferent at times  
behind the bench,'' he said. ``And this is a hockey club that must 
play with desperation. There is no room for indifference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said his decision to make the change also was accelerated  
when Mike Milbury removed himself as coach of the New York 
Islanders last week. Fearing losing Crawford to another team, Burke 
decided to make the move as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The two met in Tampa, Fla. during this past weekend's All-Star  
Game festivities and reached a deal by Saturday night. After flying 
in the next morning to Vancouver, Burke informed Keenan of the news 
during a face-to-face meeting at GM Place in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Burke, Keenan was calm in his reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mike's comments were that he knows this is a tough business,  
filled with tough decisions and he wishes the hockey club and me 
all the best,'' Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan was unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Keenan, who's stay in Vancouver ended after 14 months, was five  
games short of coaching his 1,000th game, which puts him fifth 
among NHL coaches. His 506 victories also are fifth on the career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal came a week after the Canucks traded star holdout  
Pavel Bure to the Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, 37, becomes the 15th coach in Canucks history, and  
fifth in four years. He has contractual obligations to the 
Avalanche, meaning the Canucks must negotiate a compensation deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche would get a minimum $200,000 and a second-round  
draft pick. If the Canucks make the playoffs, the Avalanche get a 
first-round pick and receive $200,000 for each playoff round the 
Canucks win. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, with his wife, Helen, and two children on hand, said  
he felt comfortable working with Burke from their initial meeting. 
And he was excited to be back coaching, after spending the last 
four months working as a hockey commentator for CBC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Liking the mix of youth and veteran leadership, Crawford  
compared the Canucks with the Quebec Nordiques team he took over in 
his rookie coaching season in 1994-'95. A year later, that club -- 
following a move to Denver -- won the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to believe in this business that you can come in and  
make a difference,'' Crawford said. ``I believe that I can make a 
difference in helping this team get to where it wants to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to forging the relationships immediately with  
the players and look forward to develop and continue the growth of 
this club as we take our steps into the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke is familiar with Crawford, who played his six career NHL  
seasons with the Canucks. As well, Burke -- then the Canucks 
assistant GM -- appointed Crawford to be a player-assistant coach 
for the team's farmclub in Fredericton, New Brunswick, during the 
1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had great success with young players, and that's a key  
for us as we go forward,'' Burke said. ``He's had success as coach 
at every level and will continue to have success here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canucks forward Markus Naslund said from the All-Star Game that  
he felt for Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time someone gets fired, it's tough,'' he said. ``I think  
he's done a good job for us, and now we got a new coach and we can 
see what Marc is like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks hired Keenan to replace Tom Renney, a week after the  
club also dismissed president and general manager Pat Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan's role was expanded to make trades last January, after  
which he began making wholesale changes to rebuild the Canucks. 
During a two-month span, Keenan swung 10 trades, including a 
three-player deal that sent captain Trevor Linden to the New York 
Islanders in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan won a Stanley Cup with the New York Rangers in 1994, and  
took the Philadelphia Flyers and Chicago Blackhawks to the finals 
during his 15-year career. He also coached in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford resigned as the Avalanche's coach last spring after  
Colorado lost in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Now 
he gets to start anew in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot of good things about him,'' Naslund said.  
``It will be interesting.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Leaders Urge Expulsion of 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic leaders recommended the  
expulsions of six IOC members Sunday in an unprecedented response 
to the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other members remained under investigation, and a fourth  
was warned about his actions by the ruling executive board, IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch announced the action at the end of two-day emergency  
meeting to deal with a spiraling crisis that started with 
allegations of bribery in Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the vote on the sanctions was unanimous and all of the  
six had been asked to resign because they had done ``great harm to 
the Olympic movement,'' Samranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said a third IOC member already had resigned in the  
scandal, although none of the members were immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Samranch said that the 2000 Summer Games would remain in Sydney  
and the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake, despite the scandal that 
now encompasses both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC would form an ethics commission and  
continue the corruption investigation in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	And, while he said he had no plans to resign, he said he would  
ask for a vote of confidence on his leadership at a special IOC 
assembly March 17-18, called to consider the executive board 
recommendations. Until then, the six members will be suspended, 
Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, IOC vice president and the head of the Salt Lake  
inquiry, said the investigation and its recommendations dealt 
solely with Olympic rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not accusing any member of corruption or bribery, or  
suggesting that there was criminal conduct,'' Pound said. ``These 
members are guilty of breaking the oath they took and bringing the 
reputation of the IOC into disrepute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard later identified the third  
member to resign as David Sibandze of Swaziland. 
</P>
<P>
	He said those members recommended for expulsion were Agustin  
Arroyo of Ecuador, Jean-Claude Ganga of Republic of Congo, Zein El 
Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles 
Mukora of Kenya and Sergio Santander of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Still under investigation were Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the  
Ivory Coast; Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of 
Russia, Carrard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands had been  
issued a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who resigned last week were Pirjo Haeggman of Finland  
and Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also had been expected to announce changes in the  
Olympic host city selection process. But it limited action for the 
time being to the choice for the 2006 Winter Games, to be made in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said visits by members to the six bid cities would be  
banned and leaders of the bid cities would be prohibited from 
visiting the committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of the city will be made by an ``election  
committee'' consisting of eight IOC members, three athletes, one 
winter sports representative, one national Olympic official, the 
IOC's longest-serving member and the chairman of the 2006 
evaluation commission. 
</P>
<P>
	No members of the executive board, the single most powerful  
panel in the IOC, will be part of the selection group, Carrard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the panel would be headed by Samaranch but that the IOC  
president would have no vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will be used as a trial for future votes, Carrard  
said. For 2008 and beyond, he said, the procedure will be decided 
after the 2006 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	A six-man IOC investigative panel concluded its report Sunday  
morning into the cash payments, scholarships and other favors tied 
to Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which met for 15 hours Saturday and reconvened early  
Sunday, reported its findings to the IOC executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials said the executive board began its own meeting to  
consider the evidence and make final recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The members were cited for accepting inducements -- reportedly  
totaling close to $800,000 in cash and benefits -- from Salt Lake 
boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were reports of lavish gifts, free medical care and  
other improper exchanges between the members and the Salt Lake 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said six members appeared before the inquiry commission  
in person Saturday to defend themselves. They were not identified. 
Members who didn't appear were judged on written replies submitted 
earlier to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga of the Republic of Congo, who has been accused of  
accepting at least $70,000 of cash inducements, has defiantly 
proclaimed his innocence and vowed he'll never resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Santander, the IOC member from Chile who was among the  
six delegates questioned Saturday, said he did nothing wrong and 
indicated he had no plans to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain that I didn't act incorrectly at any moment,''  
Santander said in Lausanne on Sunday, hours before the report was 
released. ``Whatever happens today, I will stay in a calm and 
secure position in the belief that truth will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santander was implicated after Tom Welch, the former Salt Lake  
bid and organizing committee chief, said he donated $10,000 to 
Santander's campaign for mayor of a suburb of Santiago, Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders were also seeking to control the damage from the  
latest revelations in the unfolding crisis -- that Australian 
officials used financial inducements to help Sydney win the right 
to stage the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper said Saturday  
he saw nothing ``sinister'' in the $70,000 inducements offered by 
Australia's Olympics chief to two African IOC members the night 
before Sydney won the vote for the 2000 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney beat Beijing 45-43 in the secret balloting in 1993.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutors Say Lewinsky Helpful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a critical juncture in President Clinton's  
impeachment trial, House prosecutors interviewed Monica Lewinsky 
for almost two hours on Sunday and asserted her testimony would 
help the Senate ``determine the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House team focused on issues at the heart of obstruction of  
justice allegations against Clinton, according to a source familiar 
with the interview -- the job search for Ms. Lewinsky and retrieval 
of presidential gifts from the former intern by Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky told the prosecutors Sunday that Mrs. Currie made  
calls from the White House to Ms. Lewinsky prior to going to Ms. 
Lewinsky's apartment later in the day to pick up the subpoenaed 
presents, another source said. The calls apparently were not 
logged. 
</P>
<P>
	The former intern and Currie disagree over which of them  
initiated the pickup and, before Sunday, House prosecutors had only 
referred to a one-minute cellular call from Mrs. Currie to Ms. 
Lewinsky to substantiate Ms. Lewinsky's account. Presidential 
lawyers have suggested that the one-minute call was too short a 
time to have arranged the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview triggered partisan convulsions even before it was  
held and by Sunday morning, even three Republican senators said 
they wanted a swift end to the case. Two of them expressed hope for 
a conclusion this week. 
</P>
<P>
	When the interview ended, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris,  
said she ``added nothing to the record that is already sitting 
before the Senate right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet all three House managers who participated in the interview  
called the session productive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe she would be a witness that would help them  
determine the truth, and that's what we are all endeavoring to do 
during this process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., said Ms. Lewinsky ``might be a very helpful 
witness to the Senate if called.'' Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., 
characterized the former White House intern as ``impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cacheris said his client ``was candid, forthright and extremely  
truthful'' but he insisted that anything she would tell the Senate 
would cover familiar ground. He urged the managers to tell their 
colleagues that it is unnecessary to call Ms. Lewinsky as a 
witness, so that her ``long nightmare'' could end. 
</P>
<P>
	The three congressmen were especially interested in presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan's effort to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky and in 
Oval Office secretary Betty Currie's retrieval of Clinton's gifts 
to Ms. Lewinsky, said the source, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the job search and the gift retrieval were  
undertaken to thwart lawyers for Paula Jones, who wanted Ms. 
Lewinsky to testify in the Jones civil lawsuit and also subpoenaed 
the presidential gifts. The White House denies any connection 
between the Jones case, on the one hand, and the job hunt and the 
gift transfer on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues involve some of the most contested evidence before  
the Senate. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mrs. Currie initiated the 
transfer of the presents, and the House prosecutors concluded that 
Clinton put her up to it. Mrs. Currie has testified that Ms. 
Lewinsky initiated the transfer, although she said she had a fuzzy 
memory about some details of telephone conversations she had with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In another key conflict, Ms. Lewinsky testified on one occasion  
that when she asked Clinton what to do with the gifts, he asked her 
to ``Let me think about it.'' On some nine other occasions, she 
couldn't recall any reaction from the president to her question. 
</P>
<P>
	On the job search, the House team insisted that the effort by  
Jordan became intense within a week after Ms. Lewinsky appeared on 
the Jones witness list. Jordan has denied there was any connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team was able to question Ms. Lewinsky directly, while  
lawyers working for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr watched, said 
Hutchinson spokesman Christopher Battle. A source with knowledge of 
the interview said Ms. Lewinsky did not become emotional and that 
the entire session was conducted in a professional manner. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors were set to meet Monday, the deadline for  
submitting a witness list to the Senate. Senators will debate 
whether to call witnesses before taking two votes: first on a 
motion to dismiss the case and then on the decision to take 
depositions of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine, Slade Gorton of  
Washington and Richard Shelby of Alabama sought a fast conclusion 
to the trial. Snowe even predicted, ``I think we will reach a 
conclusion by the end of this week'' with a ``chance to vote up or 
down on the articles of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said both parties should agree on a final vote and ``get  
to it ... promptly.'' Added Shelby: ``Let's close this thing out. 
Let's vote on it up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors also indicated they wanted to talk to  
presidential friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky in her 
job search. Hutchinson said he met with Jordan's lawyer ``laying 
the groundwork ... in the eventuality that he is called as witness. 
And hopefully, I'll be able to talk to Mr. Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, former Clinton political adviser Dick Morris was  
interviewed by House impeachment investigators. He said he was 
asked about his conversations with Clinton as the Lewinsky scandal 
was breaking a year ago. House managers, in presenting their case 
to the Senate, said Clinton's state of mind was important when he 
asked Morris for a poll on Americans' opinion of his conduct with 
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he would go  
ahead with a plan to submit written questions to Clinton, even 
though White House lawyers -- who first suggested the questions -- 
now say the attorneys would respond rather than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the  
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott 
said in a statement. A response by Clinton attorneys ``is not a 
substitute for the president answering the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that shattered the Senate's bipartisan approach to the  
impeachment trial and caught senators from both parties off guard, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office obtained a court order 
to help the House schedule the interview with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr told reporters outside his home Sunday that his office  
took ``the appropriate action'' and was ``not in any way 
participating other than responding to requests'' from House 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive Sunday, many of the key players had a  
say: 21 senators appeared on the Sunday talk shows, as did five of 
the 13 House prosecutors.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a critical juncture in President Clinton's

for almost two hours on Sunday and asserted her testimony would

	U.S. Warplanes Attack Iraqi Sites  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes patrolling Iraq's northern  
``no-fly'' zone today attacked Iraqi surface-to-air missile sites 
in separate incidents. In the first, a U.S. jet fired on an Iraqi 
installation after the pilot reported being ``painted'' by Iraqi 
radar. A pilot whose plane is illuminated, or ``painted'' by radar, 
assumes he is about to be fired upon. The Pentagon said the missile 
``suppressed'' the Iraqi site. Later, a Marines jet and two Air 
Force fighters fired on anti-aircraft stations. Yesterday, American 
jets, encountered by Iraqi MiGs, bombed surface-to-air missile 
sites in southern Iraq.

	Yeltsin Likely To Stay in Hospital  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin will remain in the  
hospital for at least another week while he undergoes treatment for 
a stomach ulcer, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Yeltsin was 
admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital with a bleeding stomach 
ulcer Jan. 17. His doctor said at the time he expected treatment of 
the ulcer to last for two or three weeks. It is the fifth time the 
67-year-old president has been hospitalized since his re-election 
in 1996.

	Talk Shows Belabor Clinton Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The party lines are sharply drawn on whether  
to dismiss the charges in President Clinton's impeachment trial. On 
today's talk shows, Republicans are arguing for continuing the 
trial, but Democrats are backing Sen. Robert Byrd's motion to 
dismiss. On Fox, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Byrd hurt his 
reputation as a defender of Senate traditions by even offering the 
motion. Polls suggest that as the trial continues, it's hurting 
Republicans. House prosecutors hope to interview Monica Lewinsky 
this afternoon.

	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- President Clinton plans to tour  
tornado-damaged areas in Arkansas today, a day after five counties 
were declared federal disaster areas because of last week's storm 
damage. One Tennessee county was also declared a disaster area. The 
storms killed one person in Tennessee and seven in Arkansas and 
damaged thousands of homes and businesses.

	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Myanmar has arrested at least three  
members of the country's main opposition group for distributing 
anti-government leaflets, a state-owned newspaper reported. The New 
Light of Myanmar said the arrests occurred Dec. 22 after an 
investigation into the distribution of pamphlets in public places

African opposition party official was slain, authorities said. Last 
night's massacre came amid fears that the assassination of Sifiso 
Nkabinde would re-ignite violence in Richmond, in southeastern 
KwaZulu-Natal province. Nkabinde, a leader of the small United 
Democratic Movement party, had a contentious relationship with the

	Prosecutors To Interview Lewinsky  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors brushed off Democratic fury  
and arranged to interview Monica Lewinsky today. It was a sudden 
turn in President Clinton's impeachment trial that triggered new 
partisan convulsions and led to a barrage of efforts to end the 
case. ``We would be derelict in our duty ... if we didn't talk to 
her,'' said Rep. William McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House 
managers presenting the case for Clinton's removal from office to 
the Senate. ``We've never even met her.''

said. Police said the bus skidded on the road between Trahuetten

Slovenia. It went over an embankment and rolled several times. The 
cause of the accident was unclear. Police said the bus apparently

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A million faithful packed a dusty Mexico City  
racetrack today to hear a call to arms from Pope John Paul II -- a 
summons to take to the streets and confront the challenge of 
Protestant evangelism. The papal Mass was a powerful display of the 
aging pontiff's spell over this predominantly Roman Catholic 
nation. ``Mexico, always faithful!'' chanted the crowd, intent on 
showing the pope that their affection hasn't diminished since his 
first trip here in 1979.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Nine Christian denominations voted today to  
move toward a broad affiliation of churches -- a rare victory in a 
four-decade campaign to unite 20 million Protestants, despite their 
differences. The agreement asks participating churches to declare 
publicly in the year 2002 that they are Churches Uniting in Christ. 
These churches would agree to share one baptism and to recognize 
one another as ``authentic expressions of the one church of Jesus 
Christ.''

	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic leaders today recommended  
the expulsions of six IOC members in an unprecedented response to 
the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the games. The 
embattled president of the International Olympic Committee said the 
action was aimed at ending ``the ugliest chapter in the history''

antidepressant, a market estimated to reach $2.5 billion this year.

the hospital Jan. 18 because there was nothing else the hospital 
could do for him, the newspaper said, quoting an unidentified

Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., after contracting lung 
cancer. He is too weak to undergo chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Implicated in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee members who have resigned, have  
been recommended for expulsion, are still under investigation or 
issued a warning Sunday in connection with the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal inquiry: 

</P>
<P>
                           	 *RESIGNED:

personal benefit of himself and for a very substantial amount. He 
further accepted for himself and members of his family medical care

amounted to $216,010. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Face Policy Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has broad support in  
Congress for big boosts in military spending at the start of a year 
that otherwise promises more clashes over foreign policy and 
defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
	As discord reigns over Clinton's impeachment, Republicans are  
poised for later battle over treaties, trade, U.N. funding, 
sanctions and presidential diplomatic appointments. Some Democrats 
promise a fight over the military's budget, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton is in a dogfight with Iraq, close to showdown  
in Kosovo, angry over Japan's steel exports, and worried about the 
course of China and the stability of Russia. All raise the need for 
better relations on foreign affairs with the Republican-controlled 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences between the White House and Congress extended last  
year to matters well beyond the water's edge, where bipartisanship 
is a fading Capitol Hill tradition. Congress failed to appropriate 
enough money to pay U.N. dues, blocked appointments, cut Clinton's 
requests for foreign aid and offered little support for any 
presidential foreign policy initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The year ended as it began, with impasse over paying for family  
planning abroad, which conservatives injected into several bills 
including major foreign affairs legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Friday, Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign  
Relations Committee, threatened the administration again. He 
challenged the White House to submit two treaties he wants defeated 
before he'll even consider a major Clinton goal: ratification of a 
universal ban on nuclear arms tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said the 1972 Anti-Ballistics Missile Treaty will be  
tossed into ``the dustbin of history.'' He also wants to dispatch 
the 1997 environmental treaty agreed by the United States and 37 
other countries in Kyoto, Japan. Helms gave no signal that his 
cooperation with the Democratic administration would increase in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hard-nosed North Carolina Republican has not been the  
administration's only effective opponent on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Another has been Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., champion of the  
anti-abortion provisions that stymied major legislation including 
some that resulted from painful compromises between Helms and the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent 15 minutes of his 77-minute State of the Union  
address last week on defense, trade and other issues related to 
foreign affairs. He urged Congress to help him ``pursue peace, 
fight terrorism, increase our strength and renew our alliances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president had little to say about his most immediate  
challenges: whether to use NATO air strikes to stop Serb attacks in 
the Serbian province Kosovo and how far to go with U.S. air strikes 
to end Iraqi defiance of U.N. weapons inspections. Serbia is the 
dominant republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, Clinton noted only that NATO is pressing the Serb  
government ``to stop its brutal repression ... to bring those 
responsible to justice, and to give the people of Kosovo the 
self-government they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Iraq, he said America will ``work for the day when Iraq has a  
government worthy of its people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other pressure points range from North Korea to the Middle East  
to the economic turmoil in Asian markets and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton outlined a course for foreign affairs in 1999 that seeks  
to protect Americans at home and abroad with more money for the 
military, for dismantling Russia's still-dangerous weapons industry 
and for the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to spend even more than the $12 billion the  
Democratic president will propose to add to the next military 
budget. House liberals led by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said an 
increase is unnecessary and could take away from pressing social 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Another issue on which Clinton will have Republican support and  
some Democratic opposition is his plan to budget $7 billion over 
the next six years for a ballistic missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the prospects for GOP agreement fade.  
</P>
<P>
	``In some area, the president's ability to lead is limited by  
the uncertainty of congressional support,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden 
of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden put ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,  
which seeks to end all nuclear testing, as the Democrats' top 
priority, along with ending the danger of nuclear weapons falling 
into more unfriendly hands, payment of U.N. arrears, more money for 
diplomacy and reform of U.S. sanctions policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the White House faces disputes with Helms'  
committee over possible presidential nominations. Most notable is 
that of veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke as U.N. ambassador, 
whose selection is embroiled in questions over his compliance with 
anti-lobbying laws. 
</P>
<P>
	And that won't be all.  
</P>
<P>
	Sickly Russian President Boris Yeltsin's future remains in  
doubt, as do the U.S. response to global terrorism, nuclear 
proliferation and drug-dealing and resolution of tension over Cuba, 
North Korea, Iran and whatever the next world hot spot will be.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Criticizes Some U.S. Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrives on American soil  
this week with a skeptical view of American policies and the way 
Americans live. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes the U.S. government is too cavalier about dropping  
bombs on adversaries and resorts too often to economic embargoes. 
Americans in general, the pontiff thinks, spend their money too 
frivolously and are too indifferent about the plight of the world's 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this is expected to dampen the enthusiasm that will  
greet John Paul when he arrives in St. Louis from Mexico for a 
30-hour visit Tuesday, which starts with a 45-minute meeting with 
President Clinton in a hangar at the airport. No one knows whether 
the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky will be a topic. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official, speaking privately, said Clinton is  
expected to defend his policies towards Cuba, Iraq, the Middle East 
peace process and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	According to estimates, upwards of 600,000 may turn out, weather  
permitting. It will be the sixth time John Paul will have set foot 
on American territory in two decades as pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, John Paul assailed U.S.-British air strikes against  
Iraq as ``aggression.'' And in his annual speech to diplomats Jan. 
11, the pope said the bombing campaign showed ``once more that war 
does not solve problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It complicates them, and leaves the civilian population to  
bear the tragic consequences,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tad Szulc, who has written a biography of John Paul, said, ``He  
gets upset every time we bomb somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Drew Christiansen, a senior fellow at the Woodstock  
Theological Center in Washington, said: ``The Holy Father has been 
very clear in his condemnation of use of force and in his 
conviction that issues must be resolved diplomatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope believes that military forces should be limited to  
rescue operations 99.9 per cent of the time, Christiansen said. One 
occasion when the Vatican appeared to acquiesce in the use of force 
was in Bosnia in 1995, when Bosnian Serb positions were the target 
of U.S.-led air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen said the ``nonviolent action'' used by East  
Europeans against their communist rulers was, in the pope's view, 
the model of how to deal with totalitarian regimes. While welcoming 
the demise of communism, the pope believes that ``savage 
capitalism'' exploits workers and is no less an evil. 
</P>
<P>
	He decries Third World countries' debt burden and advocates debt  
relief. He opposes economic sanctions against Iraq and other 
countries because, he believes, they don't work and add to the 
suffering of society's poorest members. 
</P>
<P>
	He laments the failure of the United States and the West in  
general to spare Rwanda from the ethnic violence that claimed more 
than 500,000 lives in 1994. Clinton has acknowledged he was remiss 
in not doing more. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Middle East, Vatican spokesmen reject Israel's claim to  
an undivided Jerusalem, and the United States says the fate of the 
city should be decided in negotiations between Israelis and 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences, the pope can hardly be described as  
anti-American. One U.S. official, declining to be quoted by name, 
said, ``We don't agree all of the time. We agree much of the 
time.'' A key area of agreement, he says, is the need for increased 
democracy and protection of human rights in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	During the pope's groundbreaking visit to Cuba a year ago, his  
critiques of the U.S. embargo against Cuba were brief and 
infrequent. In contrast, he repeatedly stressed the need for 
freedom and a rebirth of moral and spiritual values on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenes of the pope traveling around Cuba may have softened  
American attitudes, making possible subsequent administration steps 
to remove obstacles to private humanitarian relief efforts for 
needy Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen recalls papal criticism during previous U.S. visits  
of the ``sin of indifference'' among economic elites and of the 
``materialism, consumerism and superdevelopment'' of American 
society. The pope also has been critical of the widespread use of 
abortion and capital punishment in the United States, intervening 
on several occasions to try to stop executions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine  
America, believes international topics could dominate the papal 
agenda in the meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees the United States as the most prosperous country in  
the world, having a moral responsibility, not just as a matter of 
charity but of justice,'' Reese said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Wants Saudi Oil Quota Lowered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- An Iraqi minister said Sunday that Baghdad  
will ask OPEC to reduce the quota of another member nation -- oil 
mammoth Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid said on Iraqi satellite TV that  
the Saudi quota should be cut by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	Rashid blamed high production by Saudi Arabia for the sharp drop  
in global oil prices, which have harmed the economies of 
oil-dependent nations like Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they did not increase their production, they would have  
made the same money because prices would be higher,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement came as Arab League foreign ministers meeting in  
Cairo pledged to work for the lifting of U.N. trade sanctions on 
Iraq but did not heed Iraq's demands to unilaterally lift the 
sanctions and condemn last month's U.S.-British airstrikes on the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, produces about 8  
million barrels of oil a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has long charged that Saudi Arabia has been the biggest  
beneficiary of U.N. limits on Baghdad's oil exports, imposed after 
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the invasion, Iraq was producing more than 3 million  
barrels a day. It now produces just 2.5 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1.7 million barrels a day of Iraqi crude are exported to  
the international market, mostly under a U.N.-approved oil-for-food 
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy 
needed food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, because of low world prices, Iraq has not been able to  
come near its dollar target of $5.2 billion in oil sales every six 
months. During the most recent six-month period, Iraq's oil sales 
were about $3 billion, U.N. officials have said.

<HEADLINE> Pole Vaulter Sets US Indoor Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Jeff Hartwig has broken his own American  
indoor pole vault record -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig broke the record by a half-inch when he cleared 19 feet,  
4 3/4 inches at the USA Track and Field National Pole Vault Summit on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel really, really good right now,'' he said. ``My training  
has been really good coming into this meet so I knew I could do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, who also holds the American outdoor mark, attempted a  
height of 19-8 1/4 after setting the record. 
</P>
<P>
	But he failed on all three attempts at that height, which was  
the same as his outdoor record. Hartwig set the outdoor mark of 
18-8 1/2 at last year's Goodwill Games.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Clinton No Respect for Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Former President Bush thinks Bill Clinton  
lacks respect for the presidency, but believes the country will 
bounce back after Clinton's impeachment trial ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tried to stay out of all the Washington mess,'' Bush  
said Saturday at the end of a keynote address to the Safari Club 
International's 27th annual hunters' convention. ``But I must 
confess I have been deeply concerned by what appears to be a lack 
of respect for the office I was so very proud to hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to an audience of international big-game hunters and  
conservationists, Bush was confident any national embarrassment 
caused by Clinton's sex scandal would be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is strong and it is resilient. And the presidency,  
the office of the presidency, is strong and it is resilient,'' Bush 
said ``The trials of the present will soon pass away and once again 
our country will be respected and strong around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Impeached by Congress on charges of perjury and obstruction of  
justice in the Monica Lewinsky sex case, Clinton is being tried in 
the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Text of Samaranch Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Text of the speech of IOC president  
Juan Antonio Samaranch on findings of an inquiry into corruption in 
Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, which led 
to recommendations Sunday for the expulsion of six International 
Olympic Committee members: 
</P>
<P>
	``First, I want to express my deepest apology to the athletes,  
the people of Salt Lake City and Utah, the global Olympic Family, 
and the millions of citizens worldwide who revere the Games and 
hold in esteem the high standards the Games represent. My apology 
is for the actions of those IOC members who violated the bidding 
process for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sincerely disappointed that IOC members were involved in  
the events revealed in this investigation and am deeply saddened by 
their conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC Executive Board met today to take actions based on the  
report of the Ad-Hoc Commission. While our decisions are 
unprecedented in their scope, the Executive Board and I feel these 
steps are fully justified. The members in question breached their 
Olympic Oath and violated the faith bestowed in them by the Olympic 
Family. The actions of a number of IOC members and SLOC bid 
committee members were improper and clearly outside the guidelines 
and policies of our organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are resolute in our determination to root out the  
improprieties and to ensure that this never happens again. The IOC 
was the first organization to launch an inquiry, and now we are the 
first to report and act on our findings. We will do whatever is 
necessary to protect the integrity and ideals of the Olympic Games 
and to restore the peoples faith in the Olympic Movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Executive Board looks upon this investigation as an  
opportunity to put our house in order and enact the necessary 
reforms to keep it that way. This is the beginning, not the end, of 
our work. I am certain that the Olympic Movement will emerge from 
this crisis stronger than ever. I take personal responsibility for 
seeing these reforms enacted, and the IOC will deal with any member 
who has not met the ethical standards set forth in the Olympic 
Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier today, the IOC Executive Board took six very  
significant steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, effective today, on the advice of the IOC Executive  
Board, I have temporarily excluded six IOC members, pending a vote 
of the entire IOC Session on their expulsion next March in 
Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second, the Executive Board has decided to continue the  
investigation by the Ad Hoc Commission into the conduct of three 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Third, the Executive Board voted to issue a warning to one IOC  
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fourth, the Executive Board has decided to form an Ethics  
Commission that will introduce globally-accepted guidelines and 
procedures to ensure that the IOC conforms with the world's best 
practices in self-governance. It will be composed of outstanding 
senior persons, a majority of whom will be independent, outside 
</P>
<P>
	members.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fifth, the Executive Board has decided to broaden its  
investigation to other cities involved in the bidding for the 
Olympic Games. I would like, though, to be very clear on one point. 
The Games of Sydney and Salt Lake will not be moved. 
</P>
<P>
	``And finally sixth, the Executive Board recommended that major  
reforms to the host city bidding and election processes be 
instituted with respect to the 2006 Olympic Winter Games and future 
Games thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gravity of these issues led me to call an extraordinary  
meeting of the IOC session March 17th and 18th. At that meeting, 
the IOC will deal decisively with these issues. We will continue to 
root out wrongdoing and expel any member found guilty of 
inappropriate conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of today, three IOC members have elected to resign. I would  
like 
</P>
<P>
	to thank them for taking the honorable path.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Executive Board is unanimous in its decision that six  
members must be expelled. I therefore encourage each of them: 
tender your resignations. Do not wait to be expelled by the 
Session. Put an end to this ugly chapter in the history of the 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``These members have done great harm to the Olympic Ideal. Now  
</P>
<P>
	their greatest service to the Olympic Movement is simply to  
accept 
</P>
<P>
	their fate.  
</P>
<P>
	``I also want to thank the members of the Ad-Hoc Commission  
(Vice President Pound, Vice President Schmitt, Judge Mbaye, Dr. 
Bach, Chevalier Dr. Rogge and IOC Director General Francois 
Carrard) for giving their time to this difficult exercise. I 
appreciate the speed with which they dispatched their difficult and 
crucial duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, I would again like to extend my personal apology to  
the Olympic Family for the troubling concerns that have surfaced in 
the last few months. It should not have happened. I am sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the decisions we made today will demonstrate our  
resolve to never let this happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will now ask the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Commission, Richard  
Pound, to present the report, following which the IOC Director 
General will provide you with the specific details of the press 
statement that will be issued following this press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees New Threat of Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the six years since President Clinton's  
first defense secretary declared ``the end of the Star Wars era,'' 
the administration has come nearly full circle in weighing the 
threat posed to America by long-range nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of insisting the threat lay far in the future, the  
administration says the future has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are affirming that there is a threat, and the threat is  
growing,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen declared last week in 
announcing that the administration is asking Congress for $6.6 
billion over the next five years to build a national defense 
against missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's statement provoked criticism from Russia and China -- the  
only countries with nuclear missiles that can reach American 
territory. The comment also marked a turning point in the 
administration's view about whether small-scale nuclear wannabes 
like North Korea, Iran and Iraq can develop ballistic missiles with 
intercontinental range. 
</P>
<P>
	As well, it brought the Democratic administration's approach  
closer in line with the Republicans, who have argued for years that 
Clinton was underestimating the missile threat. The Republicans 
favor a crash program to build missile defenses as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	At a flashy news conference in the Pentagon on May 13, 1994,  
then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin declared that the end of the Cold 
War and dissolution of the Soviet Union meant the United States had 
no further need to invest heavily in a futuristic shield against 
all-out nuclear attack. Aspin officially killed the Strategic 
Defense Initiative that President Reagan launched in 1983, which 
became known as Star Wars for its emphasis on space-based weaponry 
to shoot down missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This signals the end of the Star Wars era, and it signals the  
end of a battle that has raged in Washington for a decade over the 
best way to avoid nuclear war,'' Aspin declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Aspin relegated the national missile defense work to a  
``technology'' program -- meaning mainly lab work rather than 
engineering an actual weapons system. His successor, William Perry, 
began a turnaround in April 1996 by upgrading the program to 
``deployment readiness,'' to make the technology ready by 2000 for 
fielding as early as 2003. Perry saw a widening missile threat on 
the horizon but none on the doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as last year the view of U.S. intelligence agencies  
was that a long-range missile threat from potential Third World 
adversaries was unlikely to emerge before 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen now says the threat has arrived, and a missile system must  
be built. Remaining questions are whether it can be made to work, 
how much it will cost and whether the United States will have to 
abrogate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in order to deploy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said a formal decision on fielding a national missile  
defense will be made in June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have many new threats with which to deal, and we need to  
make sure that we are able to fulfill our responsibilities 
regarding our own defenses,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among questions this new emphasis on missile defense raises is  
``Why now? What's changed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's changed over the last six or seven months has been an  
acceleration in the threat'' from efforts by North Korea and Iran 
to develop and deploy long-range missiles -- ``missiles that have 
the potential to reach our homeland if launched,'' said Robert 
Bell, senior director of defense programs and arms control on the 
White House's National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August North Korea fired a three-stage missile over Japan,  
signaling a surprising advance in missile technology, but it has no 
missile now that could reach U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles, director of the Ballistic  
Missile Defense Organization -- created by Aspin to replace the Star 
Wars program office -- said the perceived missile threat is so great 
now that the Pentagon is willing to push its missile defense effort 
to a ``high risk'' pace. 
</P>
<P>
	No other defense projects are being accelerated at this pace  
with as little testing done, he said. ``We are doing this,'' he 
said, ``because of the urgency of the need'' for a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Some defense analysts are skeptical that the administration  
really intends to deploy missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Spring, senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage  
Foundation, said he doubts either Cohen or Clinton is interested in 
accomplishing a national missile defense. But he saw ``really good 
news'' in Cohen's talk of the missile threat being immediate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have given up the idea that they can run away from the  
threat,'' Spring said.

<HEADLINE>  Super Bowl Not Super Bore Anymore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- No, it's not the Stupor Bowl any more. The game  
finally has come of age. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last decade, there have been as many exciting Super  
Bowls as clunkers, a departure from the first 20-plus games, when 
only three or four were worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sunday's game between the Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos  
figures to be competitive again. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, the defending champion, is favored by only a touchdown,  
largely because the Falcons were 14-2 during the regular season and 
proved themselves by winning at Minnesota last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Atlanta also has another incentive, one that was rekindled  
last week, with Falcons coach Dan Reeves on one side and Broncos 
coach Mike Shanahan and quarterback John Elway on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who coached Denver for 12 seasons, believes Shanahan and  
Elway got him fired by the Broncos after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would probably mean more to him getting the Super Bowl  
trophy against us because he was here and the way he was dismissed 
and all the things that have circulated about his career here,'' 
Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe says of Reeves. ``It would give him 
more ammunition if he could get it against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's history.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway, win or lose, is almost sure to retire after 16 glorious  
NFL seasons. The Broncos, naturally, will use the ``win one for 
John'' angle to get him a second consecutive ring. Elway will be 
starting his fifth Super Bowl, the most by any quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	But history says it will also be a good, competitive game, as it  
has been in the last three Super Bowls -- last year's a 31-24 
victory by Denver over Green Bay that broke a 13-game losing streak 
for the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of those were by Denver, coached by Reeves, which lost by  
an average of 32 points in 1987, 1988 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The game in between in 1989 broke the trend of Super Bores  
instead of Super Bowls -- a 20-16 victory by San Francisco over 
Cincinnati 10 years ago at Pro Player Stadium, then known as Joe 
Robbie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the game in which Joe Montana drove the 49ers 92 yards  
in the final 3 minutes, 20 seconds, capping the comeback with a 
10-yard TD pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, in Tampa, Fla., came the closest and most  
exciting Super Bowl, a 20-19 win by the New York Giants over 
Buffalo. Scott Norwood of the Bills missed a 47-yard field-goal 
attempt in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo went on to three more Super Bowls in a row, losing all  
comfortably to Washington and Dallas twice, although the Bills led 
13-10 at halftime against the Cowboys in the 1994 game in Atlanta. 
Then, back in Miami, San Francisco won its fifth, beating San Diego 
49-26 in a game that wasn't nearly that close. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago in Arizona, Dallas won again, 27-17 over  
Pittsburgh. The Steelers had the ball and were trailing 20-17 with 
4:15 remaining. Then Larry Brown got his second interception and 
Emmitt Smith scored to clinch it for Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The next season, in New Orleans, it was Green Bay against New  
England, with Bill Parcells ready to jump from the Patriots to the 
Jets. Still, the Patriots played well, staying close until Desmond 
Howard's 99-yard kickoff return late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was last year, Denver's 31-24 win over Green Bay  
in what then was thought to be Elway's last game. It wasn't, but it 
was his first Super Bowl victory in four starts and broke that AFC 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The game wasn't sealed until Denver's John Mobley knocked down a  
fourth-down pass by Brett Favre from the Denver 31 with 32 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``To finally come and show them is unbelievable,'' Elway said at  
the time. ``You wonder if you're going to run out of years. But, 
fortunately, I hung on. All the questions we've been answering for 
the last umpteen years, it makes it that much sweeter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Falcons face the questions. After 33 years as a  
franchise, they're two steps farther than they've ever gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Add Reeves' feud with the Broncos and it adds up to another game  
that lives up to its name.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Smash Some Old Icons / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The great bull market for stocks is trampling  
some long-standing myths and traditions on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the Super Bowl indicator, a bit of whimsy that has enjoyed  
a nice 25-year run in financial folklore. Just about every year, it 
seemed, the outcome of the National Football League championship 
game in late January could be used as a cue for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	So what if it was utter coincidence? The record showed that  
stocks did poorly in any year after an original member of the 
American Football League won the game. Conversely, it was clear 
sailing for the market after a victory by any other NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Super Bowl indicator carried about as far as a blocked  
punt in 1998, when the Denver Broncos, of original AFL vintage, 
upset the Green Bay Packers -- but the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 went 
ahead and posted a 28 percent gain anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	So how can investors root against the Broncos this year, when  
they play a return engagement in the Super Bowl, this time against 
the Atlanta Falcons? 
</P>
<P>
	Or consider the vaunted January effect, much studied by  
respected analysts of market history, who documented a clear 
tendency for stocks to do well in the first month of the year. It 
provided a strong inducement for active stock traders to look for 
bargains amid the stresses of yearend tax selling in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, at this writing it's touch and go whether the market will  
finish January 1999 with any sort of clear-cut gain. Anyway, in 
recent times, investors apparently anticipating the January effect 
have pushed it further and further ahead on the calendar. This past 
year, looking at the charts, you would have to say it started 
around Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	For years now the bull market has disdained traditional  
yardsticks of stock-price valuation, such as dividend yields and 
price-earnings ratios. 
</P>
<P>
	When the dividends paid by the stocks making up the popular  
blue-chip averages produced a yield of less than 3 percent or so, 
it was considered a reliable signal that prices were getting too 
high. Now the yield is about 1.5 percent, meaning that prices have 
managed to double beyond the danger point. 
</P>
<P>
	When it came to price-earnings ratios for the blue-chip indexes,  
20 to 1 or 25 to 1 was considered about as high as it ever ought to 
go. Lately, though, by many calculations P-Es surpassed 30 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In the frenzied world of Internet stocks, the issue of P-Es can  
be shrugged off easily enough, since the companies often have no 
earnings, either present or imminently expected, on which to base a 
computation. 
</P>
<P>
	But even in the ostensibly saner, stabler realm of the blue  
chips, points out the newsletter Market Logic, ``the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index, which is now the most popular benchmark of stock 
market performance, is priced at 33 1/2 times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``No bull market in this century exceeded 25 times earnings at  
the peak,'' says the letter's editor, Norman Fosback, ``so this one 
has clearly gone stratospheric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fosback says he is ready to acknowledge that the Internet and  
other advances ``will revolutionize various segments of society.'' 
Still, he adds: ``We perceive no immediate improvements in 
productivity and economic output that can justify the current 
exalted price-earnings ratios.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few laments are being said over the Super Bowl indicator. But  
analysts like Fosback worry plenty about the market's departure 
from more serious standards of what's a reasonable price and what's 
not.

	It looks, he suggests, like ``a market that has reached, with  
Internet zaniness, the epitome of the silly season, in which stock 
prices have been set adrift from value, and where market 
participants are engaged largely in price speculation rather than 
long-term investment.''

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Clinton is a ``glorious'' man  
victimized by a ``vast and sinister'' conspiracy, Nobel literature 
laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote in a magazine article 
published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 71-year-old Colombian author asked in Cambio magazine if it  
was fair that Clinton ``must squander his historic destiny just 
because he couldn't find a safe place to make love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The novelist, who first met Clinton in 1995 at a dinner on  
Martha's Vineyard, said the president had dealt with the scandal 
with dignity, and was justified if he didn't tell the whole truth 
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The price of Honduran coffee, the  
country's leading export, has tumbled as a result of the Brazilian 
economic crisis, the national coffee growers association has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency, the real, has fallen in value by about  
30 percent recently, making the country's coffee prices more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of a 100-pound bag has fallen to $107 from $125 as a  
result of the Brazilian devaluation, Fernando Montes, president of 
the Honduran Coffee Institute said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling coffee prices are aggravating economic problems caused  
by Hurricane Mitch which raged through Honduras in October and 
November, devastating the Central American nation's agricultural 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee exports earn Honduras, one of the hemisphere's poorest  
countries, more than $400 million a year. For every dollar that 
coffee prices fall, Honduras loses $2.4 million, Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honduras is the world's 10th largest producer of coffee.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors To Interview Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors brushed off Democratic fury  
and arrived to interview Monica Lewinsky informally Sunday -- a 
sudden turn in President Clinton's impeachment trial that triggered 
new partisan convulsions and led to a barrage of efforts to end the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be derelict in our duty ... if we didn't talk to  
her,'' said Rep. William McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13 House 
managers presenting the case for Clinton's removal from office to 
the Senate. ``We've never even met her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three House prosecutors, Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., Ed  
Bryant, R-Tenn., and McCollum arrived in midafternoon at 
Washington's stately Mayflower Hotel. Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato 
Cacheris, came earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The House managers said they wanted to ask substantive questions  
of Ms. Lewinsky about her relationship with Clinton. McCollum said 
he wanted to question her about ``her current state of mind on the 
grand jury testimony that she gave.'' In that testimony, the former 
intern said Clinton never asked her to lie about their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republican senators expressed skepticism about calling any  
witnesses, an issue that is likely to be put to the Senate this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want the Senate to become a spectacle, a scene,''  
said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, adding he would support only 
witnesses who ``can add a lot.'' Sens. Slade Gorton of Washington 
and Olympia Snowe of Maine expressed similar misgivings. Snowe 
commented she does not want the trial ``to turn into the Jerry 
Springer show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Mayflower Hotel where Ms. Lewinsky was housed, concierge  
John Dignan said the former White House intern has received about a 
dozen messages by phone and fax -- some with off-color comments but 
most offering support. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really doesn't want to see these things, so we've been  
throwing them away,'' he said, specifying that the hotel checked 
with Ms. Lewinsky before discarding the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, meanwhile, said he would go  
ahead with a plan to submit written questions to Clinton, even 
though White House lawyers -- who first suggested the questions -- 
now say the attorneys would respond rather than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the  
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott 
said in a statement. A response by Clinton attorneys ``is not a 
substitute for the president answering the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Reno, Nev., former President Bush said Saturday night  
that he was ``deeply concerned'' by ``what appears to be a lack of 
respect'' for the presidency by Clinton. But Clinton's predecessor 
said the case ``will soon pass away and once again our country will 
be respected and strong around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that shattered the Senate's bipartisan approach to the  
impeachment trial and caught senators from both parties off guard, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office obtained a court order 
to help the House schedule the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's staff told a judge Friday she was obligated to cooperate  
under an agreement giving her limited immunity from prosecution. 
But Charles Bakaly, Starr's spokesman, said, ``This is not our 
interview. The substance of the questions are not ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive Sunday, many of the key players had a  
say: 21 senators appeared on the Sunday talk shows, as did five of 
the 13 House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead House manager Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the interview, an  
often-used tactic in court trials to size up witnesses, was to 
learn ``the kind of witness she would make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the now-rancorous atmosphere, the surprise move by House  
Republicans gave Senate Democrats a new opening to denounce the 
perjury and obstruction of justice case presented by the 
prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers ``are swinging wildly for the fence for a home  
run'' to save a case ``in serious trouble,'' Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., said. On Saturday, Senate Democratic Leader Tom 
Daschle called the Republican tactic ``raw partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky interview was injected into the trial just as the  
Senate faced crucial decisions this week and just as a bipartisan 
agreement governing the first phase of the trial was about to run 
its course. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the chamber's respected expert on  
history and traditions, said he will move to dismiss the case. If 
that fails, senators would decide whether to call witnesses, 
initially for depositions. Most Republicans support testimony; most 
Democrats do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said they were intensifying work on means to  
end the trial and end the political gridlock that confronts the 
Senate: Republicans possess the votes needed to call witnesses, and 
Democrats hold enough votes to block the president's removal. It 
takes a two-thirds majority to oust the president but only a 
majority for other motions in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 
55-45 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Sunday talk-show circuit, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,  
suggested that witnesses ``could be limited to only the obstruction 
of justice charge,'' because that's where the major conflicts in 
testimony exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., acknowledging that Byrd's motion is  
unlikely to generate Republican support, proposed a ``motion to 
dismiss-plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That motion in essence would contain the facts that the  
president has dishonored the office, that he had an inappropriate 
relationship, that he misled the American public. It does allow us 
to dismiss based with sort of a censure resolution contained in 
that dismissal.''

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Parties Begin Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The image is frightening: sports writers stoked on  
free beer dancing to the music of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
	It could happen only at the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	The Daddies will perform Tuesday at one of countless parties  
leading to Sunday's game. Some 150,000 people are coming to town, 
and most hotels require a four-night minimum stay, which means 
plenty of time to kill before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a weeklong exercise in excess. No one's  
complaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much going on,'' said Alex Munoz, executive  
director of the South Florida Super Bowl Host Committee. ``You can 
go to a Super Bowl, not go to the game and still have a great 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Pro Player Stadium's capacity is 75,000, many visitors  
obviously are making the trip for reasons other than attending the 
Denver-Atlanta game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to go through life drunk, fat and stupid,''  
said Jeff DeForrest, a local radio talk-show host. ``But if you do, 
Super Bowl week is the way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeForrest has survived a dozen Super Bowls, but this one might  
be his toughest test yet. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, there's not one media party, but two. They're  
sanctioned by the host committee, as are a cook-off for charity 
with top chefs from NFL cities showcasing regional cuisine, and a 
three-day beach party held by the NFL Players Association. The bash 
on the beach is expected to attract many former and current 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all of these guys get tickets to the game, and there are a  
lot of them in town,'' Munoz said. ``They'll go there and hang out 
and watch the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are also concerts and VIP gatherings, as well as countless  
parties not considered official events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard rumors that Michael Jordan is throwing a party,''  
Munoz said, ``and Deion Sanders is having one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest bash is the only one hosted by the league -- the  
annual commissioner's party. Invitations are free but limited, and 
one broker is selling them for $850 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 5,000 of commissioner Paul Tagliabue's closest friends --  
the media, employees of NFL teams and other guests -- will attend 
the soiree Friday at the Miami Beach Convention Center. The event 
requires 154,000 square feet of floor space, the equivalent of 
eight football fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put an equal emphasis on three elements: decor, food and  
entertainment,'' said Sue Robichek, who is planning her fourth 
commissioner's party. ``This year it's an undersea adventure to 
exotic shores. We'll have three stages of simultaneous 
entertainment plus smaller stages with live music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The media party featuring Big Bad Voodoo Daddy also includes ice  
skating in a downtown Miami park. Munoz declined to reveal how 
he'll produce an ice rink in 80-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the action moves to Pro Player Stadium. Companies  
such as Coca-Cola, General Electric and Toyota will hold parties 
before and after the game in a corporate village that includes 20 
tents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each one has a different theme, from Key West to Palm Beach,  
to depict the area,'' said Barton G. (no relation to saxophone 
player Kenny G.). His event production company is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're bringing boats and 20-foot palm trees into the tents,  
and we'll have a pool with synchronized swimmers in one of them,'' 
G. said. ``I'm trying to figure out how to heat the water so they 
don't freeze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	G. also plans a menagerie of subtropical animals.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have flamingos, iguanas and alligators,'' he said. ``The  
biggest alligator is a five-footer, and then there are babies 
people will be able to hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's tough to top, but one other event will try.  
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest party is Sunday at 6:18 p.m.,'' Robichek said.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when the game kicks off.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Leader Seeks New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A prominent anti-abortion leader said the  
days of clinic protests such as Operation Rescue are over, calling 
for a new approach to the movement after the fatal shooting of a 
doctor who performed abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Robert Schenck, who lamented violence against abortion  
providers after the Oct. 23 shooting death of Dr. Barnett Slepian 
in Buffalo, cautioned against a return to clinic protests such as 
massive 1992 protests in Buffalo that he helped organize. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new time, it calls for new methods,'' Schenck told  
The Buffalo News Sunday. ``We cannot revisit the past. Perhaps we 
ought to be clearing the slate and making a whole new agenda for 
the pro-life movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schenck suggested abortion opponents instead focus on providing  
alternatives to abortion at pregnancy crisis centers and 
encouraging the government to better regulate abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenck said he would not take part in a return of 1992's  
``Spring of Life'' protests that local abortion opponents plan for 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's their decision. I'm not going to participate,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Schenck also said he regretted his decision to leave roses and  
pray at Slepian's office two weeks after his shooting. Schenck said 
he didn't consider the feelings of Slepian's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynne Slepian called Schenck a hypocrite and mailed back the  
flowers.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Steady at Mid-Session / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen Monday  
on continued worries over the Brazilian currency crisis. Japanese 
stock prices were little changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.33 yen in midmorning trading, up 0.68 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo but less than its New York level of 
114.54 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 3.14 points,  
or 0.02 percent, to close the morning session at 14,151.26. On 
Friday, the average closed down 7.63 points, or 0.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar strengthened overnight amid persistent concerns about  
economic problems in Brazil and the rest of South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say that the dollar's strength against the yen derived  
from suspicions that Brazil's financial woes will hurt Asian 
markets as much as those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar lost some of its gains in morning trading in  
Tokyo on worries that trade frictions between the United States and 
Japan may be increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher was in Tokyo for  
trade talks Monday and traders said they would be watching for 
comments indicating the United States was becoming displeased with 
Japan's growing trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus increased 14.4 percent last month.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.48 yen, up from  
131.92 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started mixed in light trading  
following a decline in U.S. stock prices on Friday, when the Dow 
Jones industrial average closed at 9,120.67, down 143.41 from 
Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 3.19 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,094.10. 
The TOPIX closed down 7.63 points, or 0.69 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.720 percent from Friday's finish of 1.725 
percent, driving its price up to 100.64 yen from 100.60 yen.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Groups To Boycott Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Privacy groups will announce a boycott Monday  
of all products from Intel Corp. until the company agrees to 
disable new technology in its upcoming line of Pentium III computer 
chips that helps identify consumers across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not even the tamest privacy advocate has failed to condemn  
it,'' said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Inc. of Green 
Brook, N.J., which lobbies on a range of high-tech issues. 
</P>
<P>
	It organized the boycott with the Washington-based Electronic  
Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said late Sunday that the company  
hadn't been notified of the boycott. He said Intel has been in 
talks about its technology for several weeks with Junkbusters, and 
previously had meetings planned this week with both Catlett's group 
and the privacy information center. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulloy said it would be ``difficult to tell'' the potential  
impact of any boycott of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest chipmaker with $26.2 billion in sales  
last year, announced last week that its new Pentium III chip, to be 
sold within months, will by default transmit its unique serial 
number internally and across the Internet to help verify the 
identity of users. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can turn the feature off, but it turns itself back on  
each time the computer is restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to making about 85 percent of the world's computer  
processors, Intel also manufactures memory chips plus hardware for 
computer networks, communications and graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Catlett called the Pentium III chips that already have been  
produced ``toxic hardware.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They should destroy them,'' said Catlett, who spoke last year  
at a summit on Internet privacy in Washington organized by the 
Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their boycott, organizers will unveil a parody of the  
company's ubiquotous ``Intel Inside'' logo. Theirs features the 
same familiar swirl but with the words, ``Big Brother Inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said its technology is needed to encourage trust in  
Internet sales and also can be used to avoid piracy by preventing a 
single copy of a software program from being installed on several 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``That serial number can be linked in databases like your Social  
Security number is used by credit bureaus and marketing 
companies,'' Catlett said. ``It allows a massive profile to be 
efficiently collected and sold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., urged Intel on Friday to  
reconsider its plans, ``to better balance both commercial and 
privacy objectives.'' Markey is the the senior Democrat on the 
House consumer protection subcommittee and active in Internet 
privacy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's announcement comes at an awkward time for the Clinton  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, undersecretary of state for commerce, was to begin  
negotiations Monday in Europe -- the same day as the boycott 
announcement -- over a tough new privacy law enacted by the 
15-nation European Union last October. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't have come at a worse time,'' Catlett said. ``This  
new feature from Intel is really throwing kerosene on the fire of 
the trans-Atlantic privacy negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron must assure Europeans that the United States has adequate  
privacy protections or risk a prohibition against businesses in 
those 15 countries from disclosing personal information about 
citizens there to U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron warned Friday that such a ban would carry ``a very adverse  
impact on the operation of the economies on both sides of the 
Atlantic and could be a very serious blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Electronic Privacy Information Center said it will meet  
later in the week with the Federal Trade Commission to discuss 
Intel's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has criticized the online industry for its failure to  
protect privacy rights, and the agency successfully pressed last 
year for a new law that prohibits Web sites from collecting 
personal information from children without parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the FTC also is suing Intel for alleged  
antitrust violations. The trial is set to begin March 9.
