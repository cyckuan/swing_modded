<HEADLINE> 450 PKK Rebels Killed in Cross-Border Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 450 rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed since the Turkish
security forces launched the cross-border military operation in
northern Iraq Wednesday, the semi-official Anatolia news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted sources of Turkey's General Staff, who
declined to be named, as saying that 12 military personnel of
the Turkish government, including village guards, have also died
and 23 others were wounded in the massive military operation
against the PKK rebels, who are based in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government troops are searching Beyazdag and
Hayirsiz mountains where the PKK militants are sheltered after
the Turkish F-4 fighter and Cobra helicopter gunships airraided
some PKK camps in northern Iraq, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It said that the government troops are trying to wipe out
all the PKK guerrillas in Dugun and Cudi mountains to which they
fleed following the bombardment of the Turkish fighters in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military operation, the largest in scale over the
past few years, followed a call for aid by Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has strongly protested the Turkish
military campaign against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan told reporters today at a
press conference in Moscow, capital of Russia, that the Turkish
government must withdraw its troops from northern Iraq as quick
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 2,000 Kurds today protested outside the
Turkish consulate in the southwestern German city of Stuttgart
against the recent Turkish military operation in northern Iraq,
according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
They called on Germany and the European Union to exert
pressure on the Turkish government to end the military campaign
against the PKK guerrillas, who reportedly attack Turkish
military and civilian targets in eastern and southeastern Turkey
from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war for autonomy in
eastern and southeastern Turkey since August 1984. Its armed
wing, based in northern Iraq, has been waging hit-and-run
battles against the government forces.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Rearrangement of Nile Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today denied there are any
discussions under way with other Nile basin countries on
rearranging the share of the river water.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Wali, deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture
and acting minister of irrigation, said no contact has taken place
between Egypt and any Nile basin state on possible redistribution
of Nile water.
</P>
<P>
The minister also denied that any Nile basin state has talked
about Egypt's projects outside the valley, in Toshka and Sinai.
</P>
<P>
Wali was answering an interpellation at the People's Assembly
if the efforts by Ethiopia and other Nile basin states to set up
dams and other projects would affect Egypt's quota of water.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is considering building four dams along the Blue Nile,
the larger of the river's two branches which meet in Sudan. Egypt
fears that such construction would lower its water share.
</P>
<P>
Wali said ministers of irrigation from the Nile basin states
met in Egypt in February but neither the quotas of each state nor
the projects set up were discussed.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Egypt and Ethiopia signed an agreement reaffirming
their respect to the right of each country to the Nile water.
</P>
<P>
The minister also denied the opposition newspapers reports on
the transfer of the Nile water to Israel, noting that since he
assumed office in 1982 Israel did not submit "any official or
unofficial request for part of Egypt's quota of the Nile."
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1959, Egypt signed an agreement with Sudan on
sharing the Nile water. It has since ensured the access to 55.5
billion cubic meters, 99 percent of its sweet water resources.
</P>
<P>
It was predicted that Egypt will need some 75 billion cubic
meters of water in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The government said earlier that it is making joint efforts
with some other Nile basin countries to make best use of the
available water resources.
</P>
<P>
The Nile basin groups Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda,
Eritrea, Burundi, Kenya, Zaire and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Met with Irish Officials on N. Ireland Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- President of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, Gerry Adams and Vice-President Pat
Doherty met Irish officials in Dublin today to seek a new
ceasefire in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
This was the first such talks since the governments of Britain
and Ireland banned official contact with Sinn Fein after the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) ended a 17-month truce in February of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Dublin talks followed an initiative by Britain's Prime
Minister Tony Blair who on Friday eased the ban on official
contact with Sinn Fein without seeking an IRA ceasefire as a
precondition. Adams has accepted Blair's offer and the meeting
with British officials was expected to take place on Tuesday in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted Irish Prime Minister John Bruton as saying
the goal of the talks was to seek a new ceasefire by the IRA to
its 28-year guerrilla war against British rule of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to have meetings for the sake of meetings
because that would compromise the safety of this state and its
people," Bruton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"But if there is a genuine prospect of a ceasefire, a meeting
can be organized to see if we can help bring that about," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Adams, who declined to give details of his discussions with
Irish officials, played down expectations of a breakthrough on a
ceasefire the IRA ended in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the talks with British officials were overdue
because Sinn Fein was a legitimate political party which polled
some 16 per cent of votes in the May 1 British election.
</P>
<P>
Although Blair government will hold talks with Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political organization is unliked to participate in he peace
talks on Northern Ireland to be resumed on June 3 unless it agrees
to give up violence and struck a ceasefire agreement with the
British government.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Resignation Shakes Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Isilay
Saygin resigned today in the Aegean city of Izmir, fueling
specualtion that the coalition government by pro-Islamic Welfare
Party (RP) and center-right True Path Party (DYP) is on the verge
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Saygin, DYP deputy, submitted her letter of resignation to RP
leader and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and DYP Chairwoman
and deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, saying that she worked not
for the political post, but for the service for the people.
</P>
<P>
Saygin resigned after a censure motion was put forward Friday
by the opposition parties to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
The motion claims that the government was pushing the country
into a "climate of fraternal feud" and trampling upon the basic
principles of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
It bears the signature of 23 deputies, including
Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz, Democratic Left
Party (DSP) Chairman Bulent Ecevit, Republican People's Party
(CHP) head Deniz Baykal and Democratic Turkey Party leader Ismet
Sezgin.
</P>
<P>
The motion said: "the government has divided our citizens into
two camps such as the 'believers' and the 'nonbelievers' and
shaken our state system by adopting the kind of attitudes which
wear down our country's institutions."
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, copies of the motion must be
distributed to the parliament members within three days and the
preliminary debate will be held seven days later.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament is expected to debate the motion on May 20 and
if the parliament agrees to put it on its agenda, the
full-fledged debates will be held two days later. One day after
these debates the final vote will be taken.
</P>
<P>
In order to oust the government, the opposition must muster a
minimum of 276 votes.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have 259 seats in the parliament. The rest
of the "no" votes will have to come from DYP dissidents led by
Yalim Erez, who stepped down from his post as the industrial and
trade minister together with former Health Minister Yildirim
Aktuna in April.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Continue Bombardments in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Tensions shrouded south Lebanon
today as Israeli forces, from their positions in the so-called
"security zone," continued bombardments at suspected guerrilla
targets in mountain areas opposite the south Lebanese buffer
zone.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that Israeli
artillery opened fire around 4:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) at Iglim
Al-Toffah, a ridge some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut, from
where Muslim guerrillas often launch attacks on the
Israeli-occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops at Zaffateh fired 155mm and 120mm heavy
artilleries at the heights of Sojoud, Rihan and Mazraa Eqmata in
Iglim Al-Toffah, the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The hill of Jebal Al-Dhahr in the southwest part of the
Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley was also shelled by the Israeli
forces.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the Israeli forces bombarded Jebal Al-Dhahr
and Qatea Mimas in the Western Beqaa, causing fires of bushes,
the anonymous sources added.
</P>
<P>
However, no casualties were caused in the bombardments, the
sources stressed.
</P>
<P>
In response to the repeated Israeli bombardments, the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that its
fighters fired mortar shells at an Israeli patrol comprising
three tanks in the area of Kassarat Al-Aroush in the afternoon
and "precisely hit the targets."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, said
that its militants also bombarded the Israeli outposts at Telal
Ahmadiyeh and Kawkaba with mortars and rockets at 6:00
p.m. (1500 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Neither the Israeli army nor sources in the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon militia have confirmed the guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah admitted today that two of its guerrillas died in a
violent clash with Israeli commandos in the Western Beqaa
Thursday night, in which one Israeli officer and two soldiers
were killed and seven others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency quoted sources in
the buffer zone as saying that a high-ranking Israeli military
delegation inspected front positions of the Israeli occupation
forces and their surrogate SLA militia in the occupied border
strip today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the delegation met a number of officers of the
1,000-strong occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed and some 40 others
wounded in fightings with guerrillas of the Muslim Shiite
Hezbollah in south Lebanon, the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, since this year.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Arab NGOs' Conference Initiates Bank for the Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A bank for the poor will be set up in
Egypt as part of the humanitarian program of the Arab
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), said the head of the Arab
Council for Childhood and Development here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference held to mark the inauguration of
the second Arab NGO Conference, Prince Talal Ben Abdel Aziz said
the bank is designed to stave off any social impact that could
result from economic programs.
</P>
<P>
Along with the bank for the poor, the conference will initiate
five other national and humanitarian ventures including an Arab
open university, to promote an Arab childhood development
program.
</P>
<P>
Aid, extended by the Arab Gulf Program for Supporting UN
Development Organizations set up in 1981, reached 109 countries
through 16 UN groups and 140 NGOs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The aid helped implement more than 460 projects to serve women
and children in the domains of health, education and the cottage
industries, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Prince Talal lamented that the Arab community was
facing hundreds of challenges including dissipation of wealth and
human resources, marginalizing the role of women, the spread of
illiteracy, violation of human rights and shackling of freedom of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of UN organizations and regional offices in
Cairo and Arab NGOs attended the three-day UN-sponsored conference
under the theme of "Participation, Giving and Development".
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session today, Egyptian Minister of
Social Affairs and Insurance Amal Othman said Egypt has 14,600
NGOs working in 17 social service fields, with benefactors
reaching 14 million, while its cottage industry has benefited 1.3
million limited-income citizens.

<P>
BEIRUT, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Fuad Sinyoura, Lebanese minister
for financial affairs, described here today a three-day official
visit by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to South Korea this
week as "very successful."
</P>
<P>
Hariri returned home earlier this morning after winding up
the first visit by a Lebanese prime minister to the Eastern
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Sinyoura, a member of the delegation accompanying the prime

senior officials from the two countries."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Paris-based Orient Radio, he said
that the South Korean leaders expressed to the Lebanese prime
minister their great faith and confidence in Lebanon's future
and its role in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and his entourage held meetings with South Korean
President Kim Young Sam, Prime Minister Koh Kun, Foreign
Minister You Chong-Ha and other cabinet members.

"The authorities in Seoul believe that Lebanon is the key to
relations between the Far East and the Middle East, and
consequently Eastern Europe," the Lebanese official said.
</P>

He underlined that the Lebanese government follows the policy
of opening up to all friendly and brotherly countries,
especially those having rich experiences such as the South-East
Asian countries, in order to draw lessons in the economic
development.
</P>

<HEADLINE> mee0517hke - - Jordan Stresses Palestinian Refugees Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 17 (Xinhua) - Jordan reiterated today that the one
million-strong Palestinian refugees in the kingdom should go back
to their homeland in the West Bank and finally settle down there.
</P>
<P>
Jordan should concentrate on the human dimension of the
Palestinian refugees and help them restore their political rights,
including the rights to returning to their homeland and
compensation for their losses, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan told
visiting Canadian Middle East peace coordinator Andrew Robinson.
</P>
<P>
Hassan was echoing King Hussein who said earlier this week that
Jordan wasn't a substitute homeland for the Palestinian refugees
who should build their homes on their own national soil.
</P>
<P>
The monarch was referring to an American Jewish plan to spend
700 million U.S. dollars in helping all the Palestinian refugees
permanently settle down in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian refugees conditions should be improved and all
the infringements on their political rights and ambitions be
condemned, said Hassan to Robinson who is on his second visit here
in two months.
</P>
<P>
Jordan believes that the peace in the region should be
established on justice and international legitimacy, the crown
prince added.
</P>
<P>
Such aims can be achieved through the efforts by the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency which was established to deal
specifically with the Palestinians issues in Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza strip, but not by some other
groups, said Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has promised to help the U.N. agency overcome its
financial difficulties through asking donor countries to increase
their assistance.
</P>
<P>
Some 1 million Palestinians were made homeless during the first
Middle East war in 1948 when Israel took control of part of the
Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians then went to live in the refugee camps in
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Palestinians make up about two-thirds of Jordan's
population. Some of them are refugees and descendants of
refugees.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Campaign to Ban
Landmines (ZCBL) has welcomed the government's recent
announcement banning anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, ZCBL Chairman Lawyers Moyo said today the ban
would dispel any doubts whether Zimbabwe had stopped landmines
production and sales.
</P>
<P>
ZCBL would now pursue transparency in monitoring and the
eventual destruction of landmines that remain in the southern
African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are especially concerned about compensation and
assistance, both medical and psychological, for survivors of
landmines and for families of victims," Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has joined South Africa and Mozambique in landmines
ban.
</P>
<P>
Among Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) countries
expected to follow suit soon are Mauritius, Malawi and Swaziland.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Pledges Exhaustive Efforts to Revive Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
top adviser will visit Israel soon in Egypt's efforts to
resuscitate the deadlocked Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will exert its utmost to break the current deadlock but
the entire situation does not call for optimism," said Osama
al-Baz today, who will leave for Israel in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
"It has become crystal-clear that the Mideast peace march
reached an impasse," he told reporters here, urging the parties
concerned to continue their peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Egypt at present aims to urge Israel to change its
position so that the derailed peace process be put back on the
right track, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks broke down since March
when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem, which it captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Baz stressed the irreplaceable mediating role of the United
States in the Mideast peace process, saying that Egypt wants the
U.S. role to continue because it is vital and important.
</P>
<P>
"Roles by other parties could help but we should not think of
replacing the U.S. role by another one," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are auxiliary Arab and European roles but at the end
Israel is the party that should move," Baz added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on punitive measures against Israel, the
Egyptian official skirted the possibility of using economic
pressures on the Jewish state to bring it to respond to the peace
efforts especially when the lastest U.S. diplomacy failed to do
so.
</P>
<P>
"We still seek to persuade Israel to move on and we do not
think of sanctions now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of current options before the Arabs, Baz said the
Arabs have issued resolutions against the Israeli settlement
policies.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is now well aware that the issue of Al Quds (Jerusalem)
is highly sensitive to Arabs, to Muslims and to Christians as it
is to Israelis," he said.

in parliament.

France, the United States, Italy, Canada and Cameroun itself are
monitoring the legislative elections.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Aqaba Port to Become Free Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- It will cost 3 billion U.S. dollars
to turn Jordan's Red Sea port city Aqaba into a free zone, said a
Jordanian government official here today, two weeks after the
government made the decision.
</P>
<P>
The money is mainly for the infrastructure construction which
will take seven to eight years to finish, said Jawad Anani,
Deputy Prime Minister for Development and Prime Ministry Affairs,
after a regular cabinet session this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
To change Aqaba into a free zone is one of the several
decisions the government has made to help the economic
development of the country, whose transit trade earned some 15
percent of its gross national product in the 1980s, Anani said.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan said earlier this month that the new
policy for Aqaba, window on the world, would boost the country's
links with the world and enable it to benefit from its central
geographical location, the availability of resources and
qualified manpower.
</P>
<P>
The deep-water port in Aqaba is one of the most efficient
ports in the Middle East region and stands in an ideal location
to handle trade linking nations of the Far East with Jordan,
Israel, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Before the Gulf crisis from 1990 to 1991 when Jordan was
Iraq's main trading partner, the Aqaba port served as the primary
entry point for transit trade bound for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The port is well-equipped with roll-on and roll-off facilities
to handle conventional, container, and bulk cargo vessels.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government troops have
killed 902 rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in
the past three days of military operation in northern Iraq, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted sources of Turkey's General Staff, who asked
not to be named, as saying that the Turkish government troops have
also wounded 126 PKK militants in the ongoing battle since
Wednesday when they crossed into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen PKK rebels surrendered to the Turkish security forces,
who are searching Beyazdag and Hayirsiz mountains where the PKK
militants are sheltered after the Turkish fighters bombed some
PKK camps in the region, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkish F-4 and F-16 fighters took off from the air bases
in Diyarbakir and in Ehrac of Malatya province to strike at the
PKK bases in northern Iraq every morning.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government troops are trying to wipe out all the
PKK guerrillas in Dugun and Cudi mountains following the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military campaign, the largest in scale over the
past few years, followed a call for aid by Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has strongly protested the Turkish
cross-border military operation against the PKK, which often
attack military and civilian targets in eastern and southeastern
Turkey from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 people, including the PKK rebels, civilians
and the government troops, have been killed in conflicts since
August 1984 when the PKK started a separatist war for self-rule
in eastern and southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Rate Among UK Youth Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Attempted suicide among the youth
under the age of 25 in Britain is soaring, according to a shock
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, commissioned by the Samaritans, reveals the number
has doubled in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a third of the 500 young people who took part in the
survey said they knew someone who had killed themselves. Figures
for 1995 show 738 young people aged 15-24 committed suicide,
averaging two a day.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s around 100,000 attempted suicides a year
were referred to hospitals. That number has increased by nearly 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Suicide is now the second most common cause of death for young
people after road accidents, claiming more lives than cancer or
any other disease.
</P>
<P>
Factors associated with youth suicide include:
</P>
<P>
-- Drugs and alcohol, a third of youngsters who kill themselves
are drunk at the time;
</P>
<P>
-- Physical and sexual abuse;
</P>
<P>
-- And ethnic origins, young Asian women are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
Samaritans' chief executive Simon Armson said:"Sadly it seems
the stiff upper lip is not yet a thing of the past."
</P>
<P>
"We need to do all we can to help young people realize the
importance of talking about difficult feelings."
</P>
<P>
The Samaritans call for increased awareness of the signs of
suicide risk, wider discussion in schools and colleges, a
challenge to intolerant attitudes and encouragement for people
feeling low to go to their GP or talk to friends or family.

<HEADLINE> Date of Liberia's Polls to Be Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings
today confirmed that west African leaders will decide next week
whether to postpone Liberia's elections scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted Rawlings as saying that
the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) will meet in the Nigerian capital of
Abuja on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Many Liberian candidates and parties appealed to postpone the
elections mainly because of inadequate preparation.
</P>
<P>
"We are not unaware of the complaints by some of the
candidates to postpone the polls," Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "It must also be recognized that we have been in
Liberia for too long."
</P>
<P>
The former ECOWAS chairman was referring to the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG, which was sent to that
country in 1990 to end the civil war started by former warlord
Charles Taylor, now one of the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
The elections are the final stage of the ECOWAS-brokered Abjua
peace plan signed last August by all parties involved in the
Liberian conflict. Endiem

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, the
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
today welcomed the end of civil war in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the latest developments in Kinshasa, Salim
said, ''I am particularly relieved and gratified that the entry
of the forces of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo/Zaire (ADLF) in Kinshasa have reportedly been
fairly smooth, and relative stability is beginning to return, ''
said an OAU press release.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, "Kabila and the ADLF have won the civil war and
the challenge before them now is to win and consolidate the
peace.''
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Kabila will form a broadly-based
transitional government, incorporating other important elements
of the Congolese/Zairean society.
</P>
<P>
Salim said: ''I am confident that Kabila and the new
administration he is about to form, will, in addition to meeting
the immediate challenges, be laying the ground for the process of
democratization to unfold in a serious and purposeful manner so
that ultimately at the end of the transition, the people of
Congo/Zaire can decide through the ballot their own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
''For the moment, we look forward to a new Congo/Zaire which
can play a crucial role, not only in the affairs of the region,
but the continent as a whole,'' Salim said.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Freezes Mobutu's Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Federal Council (federal
government) ordered today to freeze all of Mobutu Sese Seko's
assets in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government announced that the decision to freeze the
assets of Mobutu and his family members entered into force
immediately as Mobutu no longer exercised the function of a
Zairian president.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government ordered all organizations administering
Mobutu's assets in Switzerland to report at once to the federal
finance department. But it did not disclose the amount of Mobutu's
assets in the country.
</P>
<P>
On May 16, the Swiss federal government decided to freeze
Zairian President Mobutu's villa in Savigny, Vaud, about 60
kilometers northeast of Geneva, according to local press reports.
The decision was made after Mobutu reportedly fled the Zairian
capital of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
On May 7, the general prosecutor in Lubumbashi asked the Swiss
government to freeze Mobutu's villa worth 8 million Swiss francs
(about 5.5 million U.S. dollars). Lubumbashi is in the control of
the Zairian Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire (AFDL) led by Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Toughens Press and Publication Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today toughened the law
concerning press and publication in a bid to crack down on weekly
tabloids that repeatedly slung mud at the royal family, leaked
military secrets and intruded citizens privacy.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan this afternoon enacted some amendments
to the Press and Publication Law, saying it is aimed at holding
the press away from ``distortion and misrepresentation."
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the law will substantially increase
financial penalties for violating the law. The exact amount of
financial penalty has not been disclosed yet.
</P>
<P>
The law primarily prohibits publication of material offensive
to the royal family, information about the Jordanian Armed Forces
and Jordan's military arsenal and articles that offend the
dignity or personal freedom of individuals.
</P>
<P>
Weekly tabloids in Jordan are usually supported by political
parties and publish criticism on the government. The government
repeatedly intervened and some of the tabloids were once and for
all forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Now, the government controls two of the most important Arabic
dailies and the only one English daily Jordan Times through
holding shares in equity companies.

<HEADLINE> Al Receives Iraqi Protests on Turkish Incursions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Esmat Abdel Meguid, Arab League
Secretary General, today received a message from Iraqi Foreign
Minister Saed Sahhaf protesting against the Turkish troop
incursion into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf denounced, in the message conveyed by Iraq's delegate to
the Cairo-based League, the Turkish infiltration into northern
Iraq which inflicted losses among the Kurdish people in this
region.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the "intensive Turkish violations of Iraqi
territories" since May 5 which were followed by raids and sorties,
and then the land invasion since last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi top diplomat renewed his call on Turkey to reconsider
its polices towards the situation in northern Iraq "in view of
relations of neighborhood and mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
With the support of air bombing and artillery fire, about
25,000 to 50,000 Turkish troops have pushed across the border into
northern Iraq assaulting the rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), in the largest military assault over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day military operation, the Turkish government
troops have killed at least 902 PKK rebels and wounded 126 others,
Turkish military sources said.
</P>
<P>
EU, the Arab league, Russia, France, and other countries also
asked Turkey to pull its troops out of northern Iraq, a region
that is still very fragile.
</P>
<P>
However, A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman had denied the
accusations that the offensive violated Iraqi sovereignty, saying
that it was aimed at helping Kurdish Democratic Party rebels in
their fight against their rival, PKK guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military sources said that the operation in northern
Iraq will continue until the area is swept free of the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, fighting for control in northern Iraq and also for
autonomy inside Turkey in the southeastern region, uses bases in
Iraq to launch cross-border attacks on Turkish security troops.

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests 122 for Violating Election Codes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 70 people were arrested for
violation of election codes in the past 24 hours as the countdown
began to the presidential elections slated for coming Friday, a
press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian judiciary authorities announced in a report carried
in Persian evening paper Kayhan that a total of 122 people had
been arrested for the violation in Tehran and other parts of the
country in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The report said that some of them were arrested for using
government facilities to promote their favorite candidate and some
for tearing off candidates' posters or spraying dye over their
pictures.
</P>
<P>
It said that a number of the supporters of one of the
presidential candidates were arrested Saturday by the special
election squad because they were organizing a caravan which
played loud music.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary authorities said that these people will be
punished in accordance with the election law. However, the report
did not elaborate on it.
</P>
<P>
With only four days left to the presidential elections day,
the supporters of the two main rightist and leftist candidates
have been mincing no words in attacking the other side.
</P>
<P>
An observer said that the amount of negative campaigning here
has been unheard of in the past 16 years. This is reminiscent of
the early years of the revolution when accusations and counter-
accusations were abundant.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of the rightist Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri are accusing the Speaker's arch rival former Cultural
and Islamic Guidance Minister Mohammad Khatami of being a liberal
and not fully following Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's supporters for their part have accused the Speaker
of not being sophisticated and cosmopolitan enough to become the
highest executive authority.
</P>
<P>
The two main contenders Nateq-Nouri and Khatami seem to be
well aware of the attacks on them. Nateq-Nouri admitted last week
that there is a strong opposition to him among educated Iranian
women.
</P>
<P>
"A woman professor has told her female students that if Nateq-
Nouri gets elected Iran will go back 50 years," Nateq-Nouri told
a group of his women supporters.
</P>
<P>
Khatami for his part has lamented the distribution of tracts
and pamphlets that attack him viciously as a "liberal".
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the election competitions are becoming more
sensitive as the minutes go by. The closer the election day is,
the more the wings will clash with each other.

Corretja, who lost in straight sets to Rios in last month's

trailed 2-0 in the opening set before found his form and stromed
back.

He made the decisive move by breaking back for 4-2 and serving
out for 5-2 in the third set. But he needed two of his three match
points as he raced into a 40-0 lead in the ninth game. He rounded
off the match when Rios returned a powerful serve long.
</P>

This was Corretja's second clay court title of the year, after

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes Turkish Incursion Into N. Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati today voiced its opposition to the military incursion by
Turkish forces into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said at a press conference that "we oppose the
violation of the borders of the countries by other countries."
</P>
<P>
Velayati said "we strongly believe that the territorial
integrity of Iraq must be preserved."
</P>
<P>
"Whoever violates territorial integrity must be stopped," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by the Iranian foreign
minister on the issue is rather mild and protocolic. It shows that
Tehran would not like to offend its neighbor of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 to 50,000 strong Turkish government troops have
crossed the border into northern Iraq to attack the rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) based in the region. About
100 PKK members were killed and some of them have already fled
to the Iranian territory.

<P>
ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian 500cc motorcycling world
champion Michael Doohan won the Italian Grand Prix for the
consecutive fourth year on Sunday in Mugello.
</P>
<P>
The win was his fifth victory in a row at the Mugello
racetrack, north of Florence. The triple world champion also won
the San Marino Grand Prix in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Luca Cadalora had to settle for the second on a Yamaha,
10.056 seconds behind, and Japan's Nobuatsu Aoki was third on a
Honda.
</P>
<P>
It was Doohan's third win in four races, which gave him a
convincing lead in the championship standings with 95 points,
ahead of Spanish teammate Alex Criville on 78.
</P>
<P>
Doohan, who secured his first pole position of the season on
Saturday, made a cautious start and was back in fourth place after
the first lap with Japanese Honda rider Tadayuki Okada leading.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian broke out at the end of lap four while from
the seventh he was in front to the finish.

<HEADLINE> Most Disabled People in China Have Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Seventy percent of China's 60
million disabled people now have stable jobs, a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Qingtong, vice-chairman of the China Federation of the
Handicapped, described this as showing that the living conditions
of the disabled people across the country are being further
improved.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a handicapped person himself, is also a member of the
Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the disabled people in China used to find
employment in welfare enterprises, which helped accommodate nearly
one million disabled workers, but could never provide sufficient
job opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
Things have greatly changed since the Law on Protecting the
Disabled came into effect in May 1991, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The law requires enterprises and institutions to employ the
handicapped people according to a proper ratio, and also
encourages the disabled people into self-employment," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Special employment offices for the disabled across the country
have also played a significant role in helping the handicapped
people to find jobs, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Besides employment information, these offices also provide
capability appraisal and vocational training for the handicapped
job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has 1,280 such offices above the county
level, as well as 445 special vocational training centers for the
disabled people.
</P>
<P>
"More such institutions are needed before there is a complete
solution to the employment problem for the handicapped," Wu
noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Launches Massive Cross-Border Operation, Criticisms Ensue (I) (By Zheng Jinfa) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish contingent of about 25,000
to 50,000 has crossed the border into northern Iraq assauting the
rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), a move
intended to bring stability to the poverty-stricken eastern and
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The military operation is also meant to facilitate an
appropriate situation so as to develop the economy in the
region. However, the large-scale cross-border intervention has
drawn fire internationally.
</P>
<P>
With the support of air bombing and artillery fire, the
cross-border assault against the PKK this year is significantly
different from the previous ones. The Turkish military operation,
the largest in scale over the past few years, followed a request
for help by Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mesud
Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The KDP gave the best guidance ever to the Turkish
security forces against the PKK. Now, there is no doubt that the
KDP preferred Turkish friendship.
</P>
<P>
According to the KDP information, Turkish F-4 fighters and F16
fighters every morning take off from the air bases in Diyarbakir,
center of southeastern Turkey, and in Ehrac of Malatya province,
bombed the selected PKK areas of Sinat, Hakurk, Zeli, Shivi and
Zap in northern Iraq. Later, Super Cobra helicopter gunships
also raided the PKK bases in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government troops have killed at least 902 PKK
rebels, wounded 126 others and 15 PKK militants surrendered to
the security forces during the military operation which was
launched Wednesday, Turkish military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that twelve Turkish military personnel also
died and 25 others were injured in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Following the four-day strong intrusion, most of the PKK
rebels in northern Iraq have fled toward the Iranian-Iraqi
border, but to their dismay, the Turkish government troops cut off
the escape route to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the PKK rebels had to hide in the mountains between
Dohuk and Sersing. Other PKK militants were trapped between the
Turkish crossing between Habur and the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish forces, who have entered 40 kilometers deep inside
northern Iraq, fanned out into the Iraqi mountains, hunting for
the PKK guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Launches Massive Cross-Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The PKK, although with the political, military and economic
support from some countries, has suffered a heavy blow during the
Turkish operation, which aims to demolish the camps and bases of
the PKK, whose members have reportedly spent the winter making
preparations to infiltrate Turkey and raid the military and
civilian targets in eastern and southeastern Turkey during the
summer months.
</P>
<P>
According to a Turkish official figure, Turkey spends 6 to
7 billion U.S. dollars in attacking the PKK, which has been
fighting a near 13-year-old separatist war for autonomy in
eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate all of the PKK rebels is Turkey's fixed policy.
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has said that Turkey is
trying to cast off "this heavy burden" in a bid to invest
in the region where the PKK has been waging hit-and-run
guerrilla warfare against the government forces.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish cross-border military operation has drawn
strong condemnations and criticisms from the world.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has strongly protested Turkey over the
campaign against the PKK and asked the Arab League to halt the
operation.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi letter addressed to the league said: "Iraq holds its
right to reciprocate against Turkey's activity and demands
compensation for the damage, under international law."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan told reporters Saturday in
Moscow that the Turkish government must withdraw its troops from
northern Iraq as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Kurds Saturday protested outside the Turkish
consulate in the southwestern German city of Stuttgart against
the recent Turkish intervention in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They called on Germany and the European Union (EU) to pressure
the Turkish government to end its military campaign against the
PKK guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
EU, the Arab league, Russia, France, and other countries also
asked Turkey to pull its troops out of northern Iraq, a region
that is still very fragile.
</P>
<P>
However, Nicholas Burns, spokesman of the U.S. State
Department, has said: "We believe that Turkey has a right to
defend itself from PKK terrorism. Turkey must protect its
population in southeastern Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Turkish military sources said that the operation in northern
Iraq will continue until the area is swept free of the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi sources here said that the Turkish government launched
the cross-border military operation and try to deploy its troops
on the Iraqi territory to prevent the PKK rebels from
infiltrating Turkey. But the sources added that the Iraqi
government would never allow the Turkish troops to be stationed
in their country.

Chirac said that France and China can make concerted efforts to
contribute to "the building of a world that is plural, harmonious,
more stable, and more pacific".
</P>
<P>
He said that "I wanted my visit to China to end with Shanghai,
the 'Pearl of the Orient'", and "the crucible of Chinese modernity
and the symbol of the opening up to the outside world by a country
engaged in one of the most extraordinary economic and social
transformations in history."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he chose Pudong to address the audience because
Pudong will become one of the foremost economic centers in Asia in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders of the world will build their businesses here

global attention as those in New York, Tokyo, London, and Paris,

</P>
<P>

negotiations to this end, he said.

that globalization proceeds in a manner that is fair to all, that
respects rules agreed to by all, and in a spirit of reciprocity".
</P>
<P>
Expressing a satisfaction with the results of his China tour,
Chirac said that from a long-term and strategic point of view,
China and France, and Europe at large, can build a cooperative
relationship, and they can conduct cooperation in many fields like
energy, civil aviation, and power industry.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he hoped that French banks can be involved in
China's financial services.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Susi Susanti Back in Form but Keeps Low Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's badminton
queen Susi Susanti could have defeats and disappointments, but she
always doesn't have to wait for long for her next appearance atop
the podium.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, who married Indonesian giant Alan Budi Kusuma in the
most publicized wedding ever in badminton world in February,
suffered a third-round shock exit to China's Dai Yun at the
All-England Open two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
When people are guessing her era could be over, three more
months passed and the former Olympic and world champion Susanti
returned to good form.
</P>
<P>
In an international simulation match organized by the
Indonesian badminton authority, Susanti came from one set down to
beat Olympic silver medalist Mia Audina, who is now ranked third
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, the only women's singles shuttler who completed a
"Grand Slam" of Olympics, All-England Open, world championships
and Grand Prix finals, proved her repertoire of skills were not
outdated.
</P>
<P>
"I used to play as the first selected women's singles and let
others to be my backup," she told Indonesian media before leaving
Jakarta for the Sudirman Cup world mixed team championship which
is scheduled to start on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"But this time I would be a backup to Mia Audina," she said.
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, she would take advantage of probable
sitting out at the Sudirman Cup to win a comfortable physical edge
for the world individual championships that will begin one week
later.
</P>
<P>
In the previous championships, many top shuttlers who showed
well in the Sudirman Cup were too exhausted for the individual
event to win.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old legend would wait for her chance to come to
dispose of top players like world number one Ye Zhaoying of China,
whom she defeated at last year's World Cup and World Grand Prix
Finals.

<HEADLINE> Zairean New Government Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean new government to be
formed by Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila has received
recognition from various African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government today expressed its willingness to work
with the new government in Zaire, saying that it had no problems
with the developments in the Central African country.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport this
morning from a three-day visit to Moscow, Kenyan Foreign Minister
Kalonzo Musyoka noted that his government was extremely pleased
that despite the developments in Zaire, the unity of that country
seems to be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Kenya had maintained a "positive
neutrality" over the situation in Zaire all along but it had
supported the people of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister said that the importance of the Nairobi
summits on the Zaire crisis should not be overlooked as they
played a crucial role in encouraging dialogue as a means of
settling the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila yesterday proclaimed
himself head of state of Zaire and renamed the country as the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
In Dar Es Salaam, President Benjamin Mkapa on Saturday said
Tanzania will cooperation with the Zairean rebel leader Laurent
Kabila, if he forms the government.
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Kabila forms the government in Zaire, we will deal
with him because he will be the head of the government," he
said while giving a joint press conference with the visiting
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari at the state house.
</P>
<P>
In a press communique released Saturday night, the Angolan
government extended greetings to Laurent Kabila for the seizure
of state power by the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for
the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) led by him.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government strongly hopes to establish political
and state relations with the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and holds that the two countries can develop friendly relations
of cooperation for mutual support and mutual benefit in the
atmosphere of peace and stability in the region, said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) on Sunday
acknowledged the civil war victory of Kabila and his rebels and
called for a broad-based transitional authority representing
Zaireans of other political shades.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kabila and the AFDL (rebel alliance) have won the civil
war and the challenge before them now is to win and consolidate
the peace," said OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Enterprises Urged to Enter into Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo recently
wrote an article urging state-owned enterprises across the country
to explore their market potential so as to improve their economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
Wu wrote the article for a current economic benefit promotion
campaign in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu argues that only market-oriented management can free the
state-owned enterprises from their current difficulties. "Quite a
lot of enterprises are still not able to fit themselves to the
demands of the market mechanism, which is mainly why they are
facing so many difficulties," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the market has changed from a seller's to a
buyer's market, and more and more competition is being introduced
into the market, "under this situation, an enterprise will have no
other choice but to learn to submit to the market rules."
</P>
<P>
Wu also argued that three lessons should be drawn from those
who have succeeded in the market. One is to actively seek a
greater market share for the enterprise's products, the second is
to explore more technology-intensive and highly value-added
products, and the third, to rationally use all the enterprise's
resources so as to reduce cost and raise profit.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Military Supplies to South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati today denied any military supply to the Hezbollah group
in Lebanon and condemned the recent aggressions of Israeli forces
on South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said at a press conference that Iran rejects any
unfounded accusations made by the Israeli regime against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused Iran of supplying armament to the Hezbollah
group in their recent ambush against the Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have shrouded south Lebanon since last Thursday when
the Israeli soldiers and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, exchanged fires in the region.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that South Lebanon has been occupied by
the military force and it is bombing the region beyond the
occupied territories," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister noted that is the double
aggression against the Lebanese people. "What Israel has done is
on contrary to the U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 425 and
against all humanitarian standards accepted by the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi also warned Israel
against aggressions on Muslims during the Islamic mourning month
of Moharram.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi stressed that Israel does not respect international
regulations and security agreements, adding that resorting to
military attacks against Lebanon is part of Israeli expansionist
policies.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province To Label Seeds With "Identity Card" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's major grain producer of
Hunan Province has begun a practice to mark seeds with "identity
cards" that carry essential information, to safeguard farmers'
interests and promote agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Crop and tree seed strains that are produced and sold in the
province must be labelled with cards, defining clearly their
names, weight, quantity, quality, producers, sellers, storage
guide, and dates, according to the provincial bureau of
technological supervision.
</P>
<P>
Seeds' light sensitivity, temperature sensitivity, and planting
time limit must be also provided. And different seeds are marked
with different colors.
</P>
<P>
The practice is aimed at improving seed production, marketing,
and management involved. Farmers and administrators, when
suffering losses, can easily find out those who are held
responsible.
</P>
<P>
Unmarked seeds were often mixed and used wrongly, resulting in
large-scale drops in output and great losses for growers.
</P>
<P>
The province requires more than 500 million kg of crop seed
strains annually.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Supports Parliament Speaker in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati today voiced his support to Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri in his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said at a press conference that "I
do believe Mr. Nateq-Nouri has priority for elections because of
his capability and experience."
</P>
<P>
"I have only announced my personal position. That is not my
official position," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said, "I have said my personal position as an
Iranian citizen. Since any Iranian citizen has the right to vote
for the presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
Iran's presidential elections have never been as vital or
sensitive as the upcoming round over the past 18 years since the
late supreme leader Ayatollah Khomenei toppled the Pahlavi
dynasty and declared the founding of the Islamic republic on
April 1, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the serious and tense competition is under way
between two prominent and major figures -- Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
and former cultural and Islamic guidance minister Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
With his far-sightedness, his principles, his personality,
Khatami has enjoyed strong support among university staff and
students, educated people and the middle-class urban community.
</P>
<P>
Whereas, his rival Nateq-Nouri entered the electoral scene
with greater readiness. He has the trust and confidence of
the country's conservative commercial circle and relies on
support from the rural population.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Interior Ministry has prepared a total of 33,400
polling stations for 33 million eligible voters around the
country at the election day on May 23.
</P>
<P>
The latest public opinion poll conducted among Tehran
residents indicated that 40.8 percent of those polled will vote
for Nateq-Nouri and 33.8 percent for Khatami.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Cheng Jun scored a five
stroke to claim the 400,000-U.S.-Dollar China Open golf title at
the Beijing International Golf Club here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng hit a final round two under par 70 to remain a big gap
between himself and Australia's Adrian Percey who finished with 67.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old winner had a four round aggregate of 280, eight
under par. American Mike Cunning and South Korea's Mo Joong-kyung
tied for third place on two-under-par for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
It was Cheng's first tournament victory. "It's a surprise and
shock to have won," said Cheng, "It feels like nothing I have ever
felt before."
</P>
<P>
He picked up a 72,000 dollar as first prize money for his
victory.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Mo birdied four holes in a row starting from the
second to get to four under for the tournament, just two strokes
behind Cheng.
</P>
<P>
"I really felt the pressure for the first five holes but I
always felt that there was no way Mo could continue his form,"
said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
On the 10th Cheng holed a 20 feet uphill putt for a birdie to
extend his lead to six with seven to play. Only a back nine of
three-under-par 33 by Percey stopped Cheng from winning by a much
larger margin.

from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- As part of its efforts to develop energy ties
with the former Soviet republics, now following free market
economy, Oman has singed a Caspian Sea pipeline accord with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came a week after Oman Oil Company signed
with the Houston-based Union Texas Petroleum a deal to explore
and develop Kazakhstan oil reserves, Gulf News, a local
newspaper, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was singed in Moscow during a visit by Oman's
Minister of Commerce and Industry Maqbool Bin Ali Bin Sultan
earlier this month, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Oman has 7 percent stake against Russia's
24 percent and Kazakhstan's 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A new round of talks will begin this month in France
between Jordan and the Paris Club to reschedule the country's
2.1 billion U.S. dollars debt, a government official has said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is optimistic that it will convince the international
group specialized in debt issues to accept Jordan's requests,
said Jawad Anani, Deputy Prime Minister for Development and Prime
Ministry Affairs, Saturday following a regular cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
The rescheduling will include foreign debt that the kingdom
must repay between June 1997 and June 2000 to its official
creditors.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Jordan and the Paris Club reached a three-year
agreement to reschedule 1.2 billion dollars of Jordan's foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan is ready to start immediate negotiations to
initial an intellectual property rights (IPR) agreement with the
United States, a government official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Work is underway to finalize an intellectual property law
(in Jordan)," said Trade, Industry and Supply Minister
Hani Moulki.
</P>
<P>
Such a law will pave the way for the upcoming negotiations
and is a dire need since Jordan is about to join the World Trade
Organization soon after signing a partnership agreement with the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been listed by the U.S. as one of the countries
that have the worst situation in IPR protection, Jordan Times
reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government is reviewing offers from the
U.S. and Asian oil firms to build a refinery in the Red Sea Port
of Aqaba, said a government official Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed refinery in Aqaba, soon to be a free zone, will
be operational by the year 2000, said Ahmed Bashir, secretary
general of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
He said the refinery's entire output of about 250,000 barrels
per day will all be exported.

NANNING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- There are 8.5 million women aged
from 16 to 55 in the labor force in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, who account for more than half the region's
total labor force, and they have become a major force in its rural
economy.
</P>

them have received technical training, and more than 80 percent of
these have learned one type of skilled labor.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Lawyer Assaulted for Defending Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian lawyer defending an
Israeli accused of spying was punched by his Egyptian colleague
after the court adjourned its second hearing of the case today
until June 14.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer went up to the front row where Farid Al Dib was seated
and delivered several fist blows on his face.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified man was overpowered by Dib's bodyguards and
then let out of the High State Security Court here.
</P>
<P>
The attack was then followed by clashes between Dib's
supporters and lawyers apparently angered by Dib's volunteer
service in the Israeli spy case that opened trial on April 24.
</P>
<P>
During the 30-minute hearing, the prosecution repeated its
charges against Azzam Azzam, the 34-year-old engineer accused of
spying for Israel, and his Egyptian colleague, Emad Ismail.
</P>
<P>
The pair, arrested in November, again pleaded their innocence
in court to charges of spying for the Jewish state that can carry
sentences of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Two Arab-Israeli women are being tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
Dib, a well-known Egyptian lawyer, has been under harsh
criticism for the last few weeks and it was rumored that he had
been fired from the semi-official Al Akhbar newspaper where he
works as a legal advisor.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Bar Association said last week that it has summoned
Dib before its disciplinary commission on June 11, a decision
following a complaint filed against Dib by several lawyers in
April.
</P>
<P>
They blasted him for having "accepted the defense of the
Israeli suspect without being officially appointed by the court"
and "declared at the opening of the trial that the accusations
against Azzam were fabricated."
</P>
<P>
The statement demanded Dib to be penalized "because it is
inadmissible for Egyptian lawyers to be used to spread Israeli
lies."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 but several
professional unions in Egypt are staunchly opposed to
normalization with the Jewish state and take disciplinary action
against members who defy them.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief to Call for Direct Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has expressed his intention to invite leaders of Greek and Turkish
Cypriot communities in Cyprus to have direct talks on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency today quoted the U.N. chief as saying that
he expects peace talks on Cyprus to begin in New York in the
second half of June although no real progress has been achieved in
proximity talks between the two sides.,
</P>
<P>
Annan also said that both Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have indicated their
willingness for talks.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side has expressed concern over the fact
that no common ground has been reached in on-going U.N.-led
proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides have been conducted by U.N. Resident Representative in
Cyprus Gustave Feissel since March to prepare the ground for the
U.N.-proposed direct talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Saturday, Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said the decision to call for direct talks
rests in the hands of Annan, and the Greek Cypriot side has
already stated that it would not refuse such an invitation.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the Turkish Cypriot side remains
intransigent in its stance concerning a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes European Ambassadors Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said here today that all European ambassadors could
return to Tehran except the German ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that "if the ambassadors of
other countries are not returning because the German ambassador
is not back, then it is up to them."
</P>
<P>
On April 30, the Iranian foreign minister said that some
European ambassadors, especially German and Danish ambassadors,
are unwelcome in his country.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and Germany strained after a Berlin court
verdict ruled on April 10 that Iran's top leaders were behind
the assassination of four exiled Kurdish opposition leaders in a
Berlin restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Then all European Union (EU) member states except Greece
withdrawed their ambassadors from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The EU announced on April 29 that it suspends ministerial
level exchange and critical dialog with Iran in a protest against
the involvement of Iranian leaders in the assassination.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference, the Iranian foreign minister
urged Germany to correct its "mistake."
</P>
<P>
He said "If there is a mistake in policy decision, it must be
rectified. If the decision is rectified, the problem is solved."
</P>
<P>
Velayati noted that the Germans have not rectified their
approach yet. "What happened in that court was not a judiciary
matter but a political one."
</P>
<P>
"What they did is contrary to all international rules and
regulations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that relations between Iran and the
West are not likely to be improved in the near future.

<HEADLINE> China's Dominance in Athletics Challeged At East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China was facing strong challenges from
both Japan and Kazakhstan in the track and field, and our athletes
have to steal titles from Japan in the track events in order to retain
our dominance in Asia, said a top Chinese athletics official here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jimin, team manager of the Chinese athletics squad that took
16 out of 43 golds medals, said "Japan had its harvest of 12 gold
medals through its men athletes, and Kazakhstan also stole some four
or five titles from China from the bonanza at the athletics
competitions."
</P>
<P>
By taking the last athletics event in the women's 4x400m relay,
China that garnered 29 golds in 1993, finished atop with 16 golds, 19
silvers and 17 bronzes, beating Japan to second on 16-12-14.
Kazakhstan that made its debut in Pusan bagged home seven gold medals
through 12 athletes in 11 events, with South Korea returned with the
remaing four gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"The last event played a pivotal role for China to equal Japan in
golds and surpass it with silvers in the medal tally," said the team
manager.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese quartet, including 200-meter specialist Chen Yuxiang,
outpaced their Japanese rivals to take the women's 4x100 meter relay
in 3:35.27. Japan finished second in 3:36.60 with South Korea in
third in 3:54.05.
</P>
<P>
"We had sent in both veterans and new faces for the Games and our
athletes had their performances to our satisfaction in general," said
Yang who predicted that China could win 18 golds with their best
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Among the honorable veterans were Jin Ling in the women's high
jump, Zhang Lianbiao in the men's javelin, Li Tong in the men's 110
meters, Li Meisu in the women's shot put and Xiao Yanling in the
women's discus, who all won the golds for China in their strong
events.
</P>
<P>
"Our young athletes also displayed their prowesss, to whom we
cherished more hopes as they will become the milestones for our
country in the international competitions in future," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yi, Yan Jiankui and Zhang Jian, all at the age of 21, took
the women's 100 meters, 200 meters and 800 meters respectively for
China in the four-day athletics competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Japan was strong in the men's track events, with the 100 meters
and 200 meters in particular, our runners were in the close distances,
but have to double the efforts to whet their weapons in order to steal
the golds from Japan in the future," said the manager.
</P>
<P>
Of 16 gold medals for Japan, their men athletes notched up 12,
staging a serious challenge to China for its dominance in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"We also had pities left here as veteran Huang Geng, Asian record
holder, and Yu Yiqun failed in both the men's and women's long jumps,
and our women walkers also suffered blunts in their strong event,"
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Asia will see a three-member conflict among China, Japan and
Kazakhstan should the latter dispatches more athltes in the future,
said the Chinese athletics manager.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan enjoyes unchallengable advantages in the men's pole
vault and women's heptathlon, we had a long way ahead us to catch up."
</P>
<P>
However, no Asian record was set up in the athletics finals of the
East Asian Games, with Chinese Jin Jing became the sole competitor who
made the attempts in the women's high jump.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Urged to Ban Lotteries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Cutting across party lines, 125
members of the Indian parliament on Saturday urged Prime Minister
I.K. Gujral to immediately ban all lotteries in the country, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum submitted to Gujral, they demanded promulgation
of an ordinance for the immediate ban of single-digit lotteries
and a direction to all the state governments to discontinue
lotteries run by them.
</P>
<P>
"Gujral has assured us to look into the matter and I am sure in
three months at least single-digit lotteries will be banned,"
Vijay Goel, a member of parliament, told a press conference here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Goel led a delegation of MPs to meet the prime minister on the
controversial issue of lotteries in the country which, they
argued, may result in speculative activities.
</P>
<P>
Goel further said that under the provisions of present laws, in
case of private lotteries, the state governments had the power to
ban the same in their respective states.
</P>
<P>
However, in the case of state-sponsored and state-run
lotteries, only the central government is empowered by the
constitution to notify a ban, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hence we had urged the prime minister to get a legislation
passed for a total ban on lotteries," Goel was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Leaves Cairo for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Mideast peace
envoy Miguel Moratinos left here today for Israel wrapping up a
two-day visit to Egypt as part of his shuttle diplomacy in the
region to revive the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Moratinos told reporters that he will push
the Palestinian and Israeli sides to adopt positive stances
towards the Mideast peace issue.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu within the context of European efforts aiming at
salvaging the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that at the end of his tour of the region he
will fly to Moscow to brief senior officials there on the present
situation in the Middle East and efforts exerted to break the
deadlock in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
"Those efforts should be exerted in coordination with the
U.S.," he added.
</P>
<P>
The European official said earlier that he is likely to return
to the region after calling an emergency meeting of senior
European officials next week.
</P>
<P>
As for the role that could be played by the European side after
the failure of the mission of U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross,
Moratinos said the EU is "deeply concerned over the impasse of the
peace drive, especially on the Palestinian track."
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived here Friday, a day after Ross returned home
empty-handed after his renewed shuttle diplomacy failed to resume
the peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians which
were suspended following Israel's construction of a new Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> Minister: No Change in Iran's Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- There will be no change in Iran's
foreign policy despite the 7th presidential elections slated on
Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said here
today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the foreign minister said Iran's foreign
policy is defined by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. He ruled out any
possibility of reconciliation in the diplomatic relations between
the United States and Iran, which were severed in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran is now at a crucial stage as a new president will be
elected to replace 64-year-old President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
who has been in service for two consecutive four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the serious competition is between Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and former cultural and Islamic
guidance minister Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran's president has not much say in
foreign policy or in politics, economy and national defense, while
the supreme leader, Parliament, senior clergymen and Guardians
Council are the key factors influencing or deciding the policies.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 110 of Iran's Constitution, the general
policies of the country are determined by the leader of the
Islamic revolution. A new president can not impose serious
changes in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
As to economic policies such as the Second Five-Year
Development Plan, they have to be approved by both the Iranian
Supreme leader and the Parliament. So, the president is only
taking care of the executive affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Iran's relations with the United States,
Velayati said the United States has not changed its hostile
policy toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said "We believe the U.S. policy would not
succeed. There is no clear horizon for the U.S. policy in the
region. This feeling is also shared by Lebanon, Syrian and
Palestinian officials. Americans are not dealing with a simple
issue in the Middle East but a complicated one."

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko
together with his family and relatives, arrived in the Moroccan
capital Rabat this morning on board three aircraft, according to
a report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan news agency quoted reliable diplomatic sources as
saying that Mobutu is expected to remain in Morocco for a short
time and that he and his family will stay in an accommodation
arranged by the Moroccan authorities, whereas his relatives will
stay in various spots of Rabat and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean president left Kinshasa, capital of the country
Friday, after the rebels led by Laurent Kabila approached the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Zairean Government Spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba reportedly told
a press conference in Zaire Friday that Mobutu would no longer
take any part in the government of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean law permitted Mobutu to effectively step aside
without actually resigning as president, added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Mobutu will stay in Morocco for 48
hours en route to exile, and that France is reported to be his
ultimate destination.
</P>
<P>
After its May parliamentary election is over, France is
expected to allow Mobutu to stay in southern France where he has
large possessions.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- India's exports of gem and
jewelry (including diamonds) have declined by four percent to
5.243 billion U.S. dollars in 1996-97 from 5.458 billion in
1995-96, The Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the export of diamonds is more alarming, according
to the latest figures released by India's Gem and Jewelry Export
Promotion Council (GJEPC).
</P>
<P>
The export of cut and polished diamonds at 4.234 billion
dollars has shown a decline of about 9.2 percent over the previous
year's figure of 4.662 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite this fact, the gem and jewelry sector continues to be
one of the largest foreign exchange earners for the country,
accounting for nearly one-fifth of the country's exports.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Qatar Expects Israel to Attend Doha Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Qatar expected that Israel will
attend the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit due to
take place in the Qatari capital of Doha in November unless
some drastic political events changed the situation.
</P>
<P>
"It's a purely economic forum and we expect Israel to
participate in it...but, as you know, all these things are linked
to developments on the political front," Fawaj al Attiyah,
spokesman at the Qatari Foreign Ministry was quoted today by Gulf
News, a local newspaper, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Business and government leaders of all Middle East and north
African countries are expected to converge on Doha on November 16
for a three-day economic summit, the fourth since the peace
conference in 1993 in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Israel has attended all the three previous summits held
separately in Casablanca of Morocco, Amman of Jordan and Cairo of
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
But doubts have been raised if Arabs will continue to share
the platform with Israel after the Israeli government failed to
commit itself to the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Reports said earlier that officials from several key Arab
states had met in Washington to discuss the issue amid increased
tensions between the Arabs and Israel after the Jewish state
began building thousands of houses for Jews in Arab East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
However, the Qatari official said he had not been informed of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I am not aware of any such large meeting in Washington. But
as far as we are concerned we are going to go ahead with the
conference and as of now we expect Israel to attend it," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Qatar and Oman established economic ties with
Israel. But plans for expanding the ties have been put on hold
because of strained Arab-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
After the Israeli government balked on withdrawing its troops
from the West Bank city of Hebron and started the settlement
construction in East Jerusalem, Qatar suspended plans
to exchange trade offices with Israel and Oman froze its ties
with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Exchange Reserves Reach Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- India's foreign exchange reserves
have crossed 23 billion U.S. dollars, the highest level for the
country, The Financial Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency assets of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
jumped to 23.32 billion dollars on May 9 from 22.67 billion a
fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
If gold and special drawing rights (SDRs) are included, the
total foreign exchange reserves of the country during the
fortnight rose from 26.75 billion dollars to 27.28 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The present level of foreign currency assets covers eight
months of imports of the country, market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady rise in foreign exchange reserves over
the past few weeks, primarily due to RBI's continuous buying of
dollars from the market and a slowdown in imports, analysts said.

BRAZZAVILLE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zairean Prime Minister Likulia
Bolongo, who abandoned Kinshasa as the rebel forces caputured the
capital, arrived in Congo's capital Brazzaville in exile Saturday
afternoon, Congolese officials confirmed.
</P>
<P>
As president Mobutu Sese Seko fled the capital on Friday, and
army chief General Mahele Lieko was killed by his own soldiers,
there is no clear leader of Zaire's elite presidential guards,
which, numbered over 1,000, remaining in camps in southwestern
surburbs of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Congolese officials said Bolongo, after warning the government
forces, especially the presidential guards, against putting up
any armed resistence against rebel troops, left Kinshasa with his
family and chose exile in Brazzaville just across the Zaire
river.
</P>
<P>
Bolongo and his team also carried the body of General Mahele,
who had been killed late Friday night when he tried to persuade
Mobutu's presidential guards against looting or fighting against
the rebel troops led by Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
As his rebel troops controlled most of the strategic points in
capital Kinshasa, Kabila earlier Saturday declared himself head
of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who remains in Zaire's second largest city of
Lubumbashi, said he would annouce a government of national unity
within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether Mobutu, who fled to his northern
stronghold of Gbadolite, has fled abroad in exile.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Mobutu, who refused to give up the title
of president, would further fly to France via Morocco to seek
political asylum. But neither government has so far made any
official statement about the matter.

peoples dates back to ancient times, and that high-level visits
between the two countries will help increase cooperation in all
areas.

<P>
He reiterated that the Nepalese government does not allow any

<HEADLINE> Heavy Gunfire Heard Overnight as Rebels Seize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZZAVILLE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Heavy gunfire and bombarding
were heard overnight Saturday across the river from Kinshasa,
signalling final resistence of the government forces as Laurent
Kabila's anti-government troops seized full control of the
Zairean capital.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats in Kinshasa reached by walki-talki confirmed
this morning saying although rebel troops saw little armed
resistence as they marched into downtown Kinshasa in the daytime
Saturday, they met tenacious resistence from the former
presidential guards loyal to exiled president Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Fighting took place in Kinshasa's southwestern surburbs as the
rebel forces, having taken over most of the strategic posts in
the capital, tried to seize control of the military camps.
</P>
<P>
Army generals had persuaded the 2,000-strong guards into
staying in the camps and abandoning street fighting against
marching rebels in a bid to avoid unnecessary blood-shedding in
the capital with a teeming civilian population of five million.
</P>
<P>
Some Mobutu-loyalists rejected the order and, after killing
army chief general Mahele Lieko Bokungu Friday night as he
attempted to persuade the guards against putting up resistence,
fought back.
</P>
<P>
But a rebel spokesman said this morning that they have already
gained control of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, leader of the rebel Alliance of the Democratic Forces
for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) which have so far seized
almost all the territory of the Africa's third largest country,
has declared himself president and changed the country name from
Zaire to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Remaining in Zaire's second largest city of Lubumbashi, he
said he would annouce a new government of national unity within
72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu had fled Kinshasa for seeking political asylum abroad.
His prime minister general Likulia Bolongo, together with many
army generals, also abandoned Kinshasa and chose exile in the
Congolese capital Brazzaville Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Turkey to Make Popeye Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Turkey have agreed
to jointly produce the sophisticated Popeye II air-to-ground
missile, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Noah Shahar, spokesman for Rafael,
Israel's arms development company, as saying that the deal is
initially worth about 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has already bought 50 Popeye I missiles for its fleet
of F-4s currently being upgraded at Israel Aircraft Industries.
</P>
<P>
The new deal would involve a consortium to be established
between two Turkish firms and Rafael to jointly produce the
Popeye II, a smaller missile, but with more advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
News of the deal comes just two weeks after the visit to
Israel by Turkey's Defense Minister Turhan Tayan followed by a
visit of Turkey's deputy chief of staff Gen. Chevik Bir and 23
top military officials.
</P>
<P>
"In every one of their visits to the military industries, we
presented the Popeye missile and they were impressed," Shahar
said.
</P>
<P>
"The first stage of the project was to sell the Turks the
Popeye I for their F-4s being upgraded," he said. "And there is
an understanding with two Turkish firms to continue the
production of the Popeye II jointly."
</P>
<P>
The Popeye II, designed for deployment on fighter aircraft
and has a range of 150 kilometers, is expected to be delivered
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The highly-accurate Popeye missiles were developed based on
the combat experience of the Israel Air Force and have been
operational since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Israel has marketed the missile abroad. Rafael and Lockheed
Martin, a missile development firm based in the United States,
have already cooperated to produce the 3,000-pound AGM-142,
virtually identical to the Popeye I, for the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
They are also involved in a joint venture to produce the
Popeye II, also known as the Have Lite.
</P>
<P>
Rafael has also sold the Popeye to Australia and is currently
negotiating a deal to supply them to South Korea as well.
Reports from Britain said that the British Ministry of Defense is
also interested in the Popeye missile, as well as the Arrow
anti-ballistic interceptor.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Orders Mobutu Loyalists to Hand Over Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZZAVILLE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, who has
declared himself Zairean president after his anti-government
troops seized capital Kinshasa, today ordered reminants of the
government troops to hand over arms in designated assembly camps.
</P>
<P>
The order, carried by radio which was monitored here today,
said surrendered soldiers would be "treated well", warning that
there is no way that they can fight fate.
</P>
<P>
"Mobutu has fled in exile. So are the generals. So who are you
fighting for?" said the radio address to the elite presidential
guards loyal to former president Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Despite peaceful takeover of the Kinshasa city proper by
Kabila's troops in the daytime Saturday, members of the former
presidential guards loyal to exiled president Mobutu Sese Seko,
put up a tenacious resistence Saturday night as Kabila's troops
tried to control their military camps in the southwestern suburbs
of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the former government troops had fled even
before Kabila's forces entered the capital.
</P>
<P>
Kabila also called for "all the forces" to be united around
him to achieve national unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
His troops have so far seized nearly all the territory of the
Africa's third largest country including capital Kinshasa and all
the major cities and towns since they started their revolt in
eastern Zaire in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
A new government of national unity would be announced by
Monday, according to Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Forbids Looting in Zairean Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZZAVILLE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, Zaire's rebel
leader who has declared himself president, today forbade looting
and crime of any forms in capital Kinshasa already taken by his
troops.
</P>
<P>
He delivered the order in a radio address from Zaire's second
largest city of Lubumbashi and monitored here today, assuring
Kinshasa residents that they are safe and protected to carry on
their "normal activities".
</P>
<P>
"Go out to the street. Open your business. Carry on your
normal activities," said Kabila whose troops have so far enjoying
a reputation of good discipline, which is in a big contrast to
Mobutu's former government troops who were notorious for looting.
</P>
<P>
In the daytime Saturday, Kabila's troops took the presidential
palace, the national television and radio stations, and most of
other strategic posts in the capital after marching into Kinshasa
meeting with minimum resistence from former president Mobutu Sese
Seko's government forces.
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy gunfire heard overnight in Kinshasa as the
Mobutu loyalists from the former presidential guards put up
tenacious resistence against control by Kabila's troops over
their military camps, the situation was calm this morning.
</P>
<P>
"We have gained control and they have agreed to surrender,"
said a statement issued by Kabila's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, remaining in Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest city
which acts as the military headquarters of Kabila's Alliance of
the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL),
has not yet come to the capital owing to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to announce a new cabinet by Monday.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a complete
supervision system to ensure a stable and healthy financial
sector, today's China Daily quoted the '97 China Financial Outlook
issued by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
The system consists of financial laws and regulations, central
bank supervision, self-discipline, and internal controls of
financial institutions, and public surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The State will establish the Banking Association of China,
aimed at regulating competition among financial institutions by
drafting joint pledges and competition rules. Other
self-disciplinary organizations, like an insurance association,
will be gradually set up.
</P>
<P>
PBOC, China's central bank, will monitor the implementation of
internal controls together with its auditing departments. It will
also issue the PBOC Head-office Manual for Financial Supervision,
clarifying the functions of its different departments.
</P>
<P>
The country will draft scientific evaluation methods for the
quality of bank assets by combining international practices with
China's situation.
</P>
<P>
The business scope of securities firms will be strictly
regulated to focus on intermediary business, and dealers'
operations and underwriting will be brought under strict control.
</P>
<P>
The firms will be refrained from deposit-taking or lending,
and prohibited from engaging in project financing or any other
industrial and estate investment.
</P>
<P>
Trust and investment firms' functions will be defined as actual
trustees and agents, focusing on intermediary business. High-risk
and insolvent trust and investment companies will be asked to
leave the market, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> China Expected to Increase Banana Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to further
increase banana imports if domestic taxes fall or international
price concessions continue, today's "China Daily" quoted an
official with China Fruit Circulation Association (CFCA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's banana imports doubled the 1995 figure to hit 400,000
tons in 1996, while its production fell from 3.13 million tons in
1995 to 2.54 million tons last year owing to an unusually cold
spring in south China.
</P>
<P>
China's emergence as a significant banana importers last year
helped the international banana market, which the United Nations
Food and Agricultural Organizations predicted would have a 650,000
tons of surplus by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The possible hike in China's banana imports stems mainly from
the projected rise in demand and the country's limited production
capacity, said Chen Yushan, vice-president of CFCA.
</P>
<P>
Although China's banana production has increased steadily over
the past decade, it can not meet demand. Consumption of banana
will continue to rise as living standards further improved, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China's banana production has been rising steadily since
1978. The bulk of domestic bananas grow in South Guangdong
Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with a small
proportion produced in southeast Fujian Province and southwest
Yunnan Province.

<HEADLINE> China Promoting Supervisions Over Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- More efforts are needed to improve
management of brokers, in a bid to promote the healthy development
of the fledging brokerage industry in China, today's "China Daily"
quoted an official with the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce (SAIC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
China had more than 54,000 registered brokers in 1995, which
conduct businesses in a broad fields covering commodity exchange,
financial markets, real estate, technology, information, culture,
sports and labour services.
</P>
<P>
The brokers have played an important role by guiding production
and optimizing social resources, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Lured by high profits, some illegal brokers trade
fraudulent commodities as well as practice and accept
bribes. Swindling and tax evasion are frequent, he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to standardize the brokerage market a broker law had
been placed on the agenda of the National People's Congress. After
three years of study, the framework of the law has gradually come
into being.
</P>
<P>
Early this year SAIC issued a circular stressing the
implementation of the brokerage management regulation which took
effect in December 1995. SAIC calls for further management of
brokers' qualifications, registration and contracts.
</P>
<P>
The official said the administration launched a nationwide
audit on brokers in April. It will last until the end of
September.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces and Muslim
guerrillas continued exchanging fire in south Lebanon Saturday,
and one member of an Israeli-backed militia was injured in the
clashes, the Voice of Free Lebanon Radio reported on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes launched two rounds of bombing at guerrilla
bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the
Syrian-controlled Western Beqaa in southeast Lebanon around 9:00
p.m. local time (18:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The warplanes fired four air-to-surface missiles at the
guerrilla targets at Qliyeh and Zleiyah, the Christian-owned
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The air raid was accompanied by a wide-scale sweep of Israeli
forces with heavy and medium machineguns in the area.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, the Israeli occupation forces fired
dozens of shells into the sky over the area, and Israeli warplanes
also carried out frequent reconnaissance flights.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that one group of its fighters attacked the Israeli
position at Sojoud in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone"
at 8:00 p.m. local time (17:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It said that the guerrillas used machineguns and
rocket-propelled grenades in the fighting, killing and wounding
a number of Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army admitted that one member of Israel's client
militia, of South Lebanon Army (SLA), was slightly injured when
the guerrillas shelled one of the militia's positions in the
eastern sector of the border strip.
</P>
<P>
High tensions have shrouded south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict for four days.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance said that its guerrillas successfully
foiled an infiltration attempt of Israeli commandos out of the
occupied border strip Saturday afternoon, the second in 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
It said that the clash erupted at 4:00 p.m. and lasted more
than two hours, but it did not mention any casualties.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli officer and two soldiers were killed and seven
others wounded in a violent clash between Hezbollah guerrillas
and Israeli commandos in the Western Beqaa Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The trade of fires between the Israeli forces and the SLA
militia on the one side and the guerrillas on the other
constitutes a daily scene in south Lebanon, where Hezbollah
spearheads the guerrilla warfare to oust the Israeli occupation
from the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in 1985 to protect northern Israel from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Western Troops Silent Over Rebels' Takeover of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZAVILLE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The 4,000-strong western rescue
troops based in Congo's capital Brazzaville are silent over
Zairean rebels' peaceful takeover of capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Zaire's rebel forces of the Alliance of the
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL),
marched into Kinshasa meeting virtually no armed resistence from
the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebel leader Laurent Kabila, who is still in
Zaire's second largest city of Lubumbashi, declared himself head
of the Democratic Republilc of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We've not received any order for any rescue mission," said
commander Bob Anderson, spokesman for the United States
operation, aboard the assult ship off the coast and ready to
evacuate foreigners from Kinshasa just opposite Brazzaville
across the Zaire river.
</P>
<P>
Televised reports from Kinshasa showed that the
well-disciplined rebel troops, who were calmly marching along the
streets in downtown Kinshasa, were warmly welcomed by the local
citizens, especially the young people.
</P>
<P>
Neither did the coming rebels, who strided along the streets
with their rifles on their back, nor did the retreating
government troops, who fled without arms and even without
uniforms, loot or disturb the local residents.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently there is no need, at least for the moment, for the
rescue mission," said a French officer, heading a company of the
country's foreign legion.
</P>
<P>
Together with the United States marines code-named "Guardian
Retrieval" and soldiers of the French foreign legion, a British
battalion and troops from Belgium and Portugal, are also closely
watching the situation in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
A few hundreds of foreign citizens are currently still in
Kinshasa, mostly diplomats and foreign journalists, ignoring
repeated advice to leave.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ports at both sides of the river Zaire have been
closed and under tight military control. There is no sight of
boats of any kind moving on the river.
</P>
<P>
Congolese soldiers petrolled streets of capital Brazzaville,
especially along the major one along the river.
</P>
<P>
Brazzaville, a city with an original population of 800,000,
have been crowded with refugees, numbered about 200,000, fleeing
from across the river from Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
All the hotels, big or small, are teemed with people from
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"The government is quite nervous about the refugee situation
in the capital, which is bound to be nervous in the days to
come," said a Congolese official.

<HEADLINE> Banana Supply to Increase on International Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Banana supply on the world market is
likely to post a surplus of 650,000 tons by 1999, said a study
from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
The study, based on the present conditions of production an
marketing of bananas, foresees that world stocks available for
export in 1999 will be 12.87 million tons as against an import
demand of 12.22 million tons.
</P>

PUSAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Men's basketball team of Chinese Taipei

</P>

exchanging leading position several times. Chinese Taipei, with all
members from a veteran team, led the halftime 31-29.
</P>
<P>
With two shots fronm Bateer and Wang Sheng, China jumped to lead

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Raises Bank Rate by 0.50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Bank raised the bank
rate by 0.50 percent as a contractile measure against credit
expansion, which has already crossed the target for the current
fiscal year ending on June 30.
</P>
<P>
A central bank announcement said Saturday that the bank rate
had been fixed at 7.50 percent from the present 7 percent and the
new rate would come into effect from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said that the move will discourage the
commercial banks to borrow from the central bank's discount
window.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the overall credit, both to the government
and the private sector, has expanded by 15.4 percent on
year-to-year basis, crossing the target of 11.5 percent for the
current 1996-97 financial year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the deposit growth rate remained at a low
level of below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The credit growth rate should not exceed the deposit growth
rate," said a senior central bank official, explaining the
Bangladesh Bank's latest monetary policy measure.
</P>
<P>
Bank rate - the floor rate on which the central bank lends to
the commercial banks from its discount window - was last raised in
September 1996 when the deposit growth rate came down to a
historic 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the government was following a non-expansionary credit
policy, a heavy public borrowing from the banking system has been
blamed for crossing the target of lending for the year.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said government borrowing from the banking
system presently stood at 17 percent against private borrowing of
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's banking and non-banking borrowing was 17
billion taka (about 425 million U.S. dollars) while the private
sector's was 16 billion taka (about 400 million dollars) so far.

<HEADLINE> Pak, U.S. to Hold Defense Consultation Meeting in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The third meeting of the
Pakistan-United States Defense Consultative Group (DCG) will take
place in October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The American side has proposed that officials of both
countries should meet in October for deliberations," a local
newspaper quoted an official source as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, the source said, would now confirm the dates on which
officials of both countries would meet to discuss specific issues
within the framework of the group.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani delegation, to be led by the secretary of
defense, will include other civil and military officials and
representatives of the three armed forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side will be led by an assistant secretary of defense
and will comprise officials of the Defense Security Assistance
Agency and some other concerned departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the issue of return of Pakistan-owned and paid-for military
equipment, including three P-3C Orion for Pakistan Navy, has been
settled, Pakistan is likely to re-articulate its arguments for
securing the release of the F-16s, which were to sell out to a
third party under the Brown Amendment, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The other issues, which are likely to be taken up in DCG
meetings, include schedule of military exercises, military
education programs, international peacekeeping and other regional

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices in World Market to Keep Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Coffee prices will keep rising in
the world market in the next months due to an increase of demand
and reduction of supply, local media said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Seevers, vice president of the Costa Rican Coffee
Institute, was quoted as saying that coffee reserves in many
consumer countries are declining.
</P>

surpassed its expectations, Seevers said.
</P>
<P>
The total 1997-1998 coffee output in the world will be about 98
million 60-kilogram (132.16 lbs) bags, of which 24 to 27 million
bags will go for domestic consumption, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM Proposes Budget Cuts for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister
Amnuay Virawan has proposed to slash the country's expenditure
budget for next year by 2.58 percent as part of its fiscal
stabilization policy.
</P>
<P>
The original fiscal 1998 spending target of 1,008 billion baht
(38.77 billion U.S. dollars) will now be cut by 26 billion baht
(about 1 billion dollars) to boost investor confidence, according
to Amnuay, who is also finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The revised 1998 budget would be 982 billion baht (37.77
billion dollars), compared with the current budget of 925 billion
baht (35.58 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The adjustment has been proposed to suit the country's economic
slowdown, which has lasted for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The revised budget for fiscal 1998, which begins on October 1,
1997, provides for the economy to grow about six percent.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay made the announcement Saturday after a meeting with
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called following the Thai baht was heavily
assaulted during the week in overseas money markets, and the stock
market index dropped to 561.19 points, the lowest in six years.
</P>
<P>
Other measures which Amnuay proposed included establishment of
a fund by commercial banks to rescue the stock market, which
dropped 98.91 points during the past two weeks; interest rates cut
by 1 to 2 percent to stimulate the economy; indefinite
postponement of plans to increase civil servants' pay scale by 5
percent across the board, which would cost the state 19 billion
baht (731 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
He also called for belt-tightening in both the government and
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
His proposals would be submitted to the cabinet meeting for
approval on May 27.

</P>

the U.S.'s unilateral move against the country, ASEAN should stick
to its decision on accepting Myanmar as a member, stressing that
ASEAN should pursue its 1995 decision on inclusion of Myanmar in
ASEAN and making clear that Thailand will not be swayed from
adhering to its position to support Myanmar in becoming an ASEAN
member.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit also extended invitation to Than Shwe, his Myanmar
counterpart, to pay an official visit to Thailand, which was
accepted, according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is also one of the leading foreign investors in
Myanmar, ranking third after Britain and Singapore with over one
billion U.S. dollars in 39 projects at the end of March this year
covering sectors of oil and gas, hotels and tourism, livestock
breeding and fishery, industry estate and transport.
</P>
<P>
Thai investment was highlighted by its involvement in
development of two Myanmar offshore natural gas fields -- the
Yadana and the Yetagun, from where gas is to be sold to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also cooperated with Myanmar in current years in the
transport sector by granting two loans of 150 million and 11.5
million U.S. dollars respectively for building Myanmar's new
Mandalay International Airport and for upgrading the
Tachilek-Kengtung road which leads up to Bangkok through Chiang
Rai.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these, Thailand is also intending to develop a
deep-sea port in the area of Bokpyin in Myanmar's Tanintharyi
division to link a neighboring sea port of Thailand -- Bagn
Saphan.
</P>
<P>
In the industry sector, Thailand also joined in setting up an
industrial zone in Yangon after Singapore and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar official papers, in their editorials today, hailed the
successful visit of the Thai prime minister to Myanmar, noting
that the visit has moved friendship and bilateral relations a
notch up as such visits characterize mutual regard and
good-neighborliness.

</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo, Railway Minister Han Shubin
and K. Y. Yeung, Chairman and Chief Executive of Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corporation, attended the inauguration ceremony at the
Beijing West Station. Wu cut the ribbon for the launch of the
train service between Beijing and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Wu stressed the importance of opening
this passenger express on the eve of the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland, due on July 1 this year. He expressed his hope
that the operation of the new service will be conducive to the
long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The railway minister told a group of journalist that the
Beijing-Kowloon express is a donation by his ministry to the
upcoming return of Hong Kong. He pledged to make it a safe, luxury
and comfortable "high quality train".
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive talk with Xinhua, Mr. Yeung said that the
launch of the Beijing-Kowloon passenger train is just the first
step of the cooperation between his company and the Beijing
Railway Bureau (BRB). He disclosed that the two sides are
negotiating on a long-term cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to BRB officials, the No. 97 train leaves Beijing

The BRB officials told Xinhua that the rail-tracks in both the
inland and Hong Kong are standard ones and have the same gauge of
1.435 m.
</P>
<P>
Many Hong Kong reporters came here specially to cover the
event. Some of them were so excited that they forgot to board the
train until it had begun to move. Railway police prevented them
from attempting to get in the moving train.

Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (89-90) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will China's inland areas and Hong Kong mutually
recognize records of formal schooling and professional
qualifications after 1997? Will records of formal schooling and
professional qualifications of the British Commonwealth be
abolished?
</P>
<P>
Answer: At present, institutions in China's inland areas
basically recognize records of schooling issued by Hong Kong
colleges and universities. However, Hong Kong has failed to adopt
a positive attitude on the recognition of records of formal
schooling issued by institutions of higher learning in the inland
areas.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, along with more exchanges and enhanced
understanding between the two sides, with the transfer of
government in 1997 approaching, Hong Kong has had a slight change
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The attitude now is selective recognition. For example, the
British Hong Kong government has since 1994 allowed professionals
from inland areas to work in Hong Kong, stipulating that such
professionals be graduates from 36 institutions of higher learning
directly under the State Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Hong Kong now recognizes records of
schooling from these schools.
</P>
<P>
Article 142 of the Basic Law has the following
stipulations: "The Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region shall, on the basis of maintaining the
previous systems concerning the professions, formulate provisions
for assessing the qualifications for practice in the various
professions;"
</P>
<P>
"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
shall continue to recognize the professions and all professional
organizations recognized prior to the establishment of the Region,
and these organizations may, on their own, assess and set
professional qualifications;"
</P>
<P>
And "The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region may, as required by developments in society and in
consultation with the parties concerned, recognize new professions
and professional organizations."
</P>
<P>
It can be believed that, after 1997, fair treatment will be
given to records of formal schooling and professional
qualifications acquired from the British Commonwealth and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will cultural and sports organizations in Hong Kong
be subjected to administration by relevant departments of the
central government after 1997? In what name will they participate
in international events?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to the Basic Law, the principles of
non-subordination, non-interference and mutual respect will serve
as the basis for the relationship between non-governmental
organizations in fields such as education, science, technology,
culture, art, sports, the professions, medicine and health, labor,
social welfare and social work, as well as religious organizations
in the Hong Kong SAR and their counterparts in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that cultural and sports organizations in Hong
Kong and the inland areas will have neither a relationship of one
side providing leadership over the other nor a relationship of one
side being subordinate to the other.
</P>
<P>
Rather, they will have a relationship of mutual independence,
mutual promotion and mutual development. This policy will allow
cultural and sports undertakings in both places to prosper.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, cultural and sports organizations
in the Hong Kong SAR may continue to participate in or host
relevant international events. And they may, as required, use the
name "Hong Kong, China" in relevant activities.

<P>
NANJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province in east China has
made painstaking efforts to publicize ISO9000 Quality Control
Standards and help more local enterprises get an edge in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
ISO9000 quality control standards were worked out by the
International Standardization Organization (ISO) in 1987 in light
of modern management theories about quality control.
</P>
<P>
The ISO9000 quality control standard certificate has now become
a guarantee of good product quality, trustworthiness, and modern
management.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 local export-oriented enterprises in Jiangsu have
been given certificates for having met ISO9000 quality control
standards, accounting for one sixth of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with ISO9000 certificates have seen quick growth in
their exports, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
The province's Bureau for Inspection of Import and Export
Commodities has planned to practice ISO9000 quality control
standards in 20 large enterprise groups to be established in the
next two years.

<HEADLINE> Life In Remote Chinese County Becoming Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The average annual income of farmers
and herdsmen in Wuqia County in a remote part in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which was only 250 yuan about a
decade ago, has now risen to 1,031 yuan (about 124 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This has not been an easy job for Wuqia, and it's the first
Chinese county on the Pamir Plateau that was able to get the
average income of farmers or herdsmen up beyond 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The county is 2,100 meters above sea level, and for centuries,
the people there, from Kirgiz and other ethnic groups, lived a
poor life. It suffered from frequent snow, wind, and hailstorms,
and from earthquake and other natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, an earthquake registering 7.4 on the Richter Scale
almost levelled the county's buildings, and the county seat had to
be rebuilt with state funds.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the county has taken advantage of state
aid-the-poor policies and developed a market economy and spread
the use of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The local government has shown herdsmen how to raise corn by
using plastic sheeting, develop mineral resources, and get started
in the transport and border trade business. These measures have
improved local people's standard of living, and most of the
migrant herdsmen are more settled. In 1996, the number of
livestock was 280,000, and 47 percent of them were taken to
market.

JINAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong province has
the second largest population among the country's provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, with a total of 87.38
million people under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The largest population is held by central China's Henan
province.
</P>

With the establishment of the Chongqing Municipality last
March, Sichuan province in southwest China, which used to have the

<P>
Shandong reported a natural population growth rate of 3.84 per
thousand last year, lower than Henan and Sichuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
While Shandong's population is only about 3.1 million more than
Sichuan's, experts predict that Sichuan's population will surpass
Shandong's again in seven or eight years, if the three provinces
keep the same population growth rates as 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Using Virus to Control Pests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A new virus pesticide is
expected to replace chemical fertilizers in China because it does
not have harmful effects on the environment.
</P>
<P>
Another major benefit is that different viruses can be
cultivated to single out one pest from among many insects and
destroy it without having any effect on other insects or living
things, explains Qi Fenglai, director of the Shijiazhuang Huanye
Biological Pesticide Plant.
</P>
<P>
The pesticide is Qi's brainchild. It is the result of 15 years
of research and has been refined to be much more effective than
chemical fertilizer, and is being mass produced.
</P>
<P>
Huanye No.1, a pesticide used against bollworm, is one
example. It is as much as 46 percent more efficient in killing
pests than chemical fertilizers, and useful insects like ladybugs,
or spiders and other natural enemies of pests are as much as 77
percent more likely to be unaffected than when chemical
fertilizers are applied. Per-unit cotton output has increased by
more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The pesticide is quite different from chemical fertilizers
because it does not harm crops, human beings, or animals, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
The state has decided to increase the use of this high-tech
development in China.

<HEADLINE> China to Plant More Mango Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China is to plant more mango trees
to try to increase its mango output to 750,000 tons in the year of
2000.
</P>
<P>
This was learned from a recent national trade discussion
focusing on mango marketing, held in this capital of the southern
Chinese province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade farmers in the subtropical provinces of
Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan and Fujian have become keen on
growing tropical fruits, including mangoes.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 varieties of mangoes are grown in China,
including some imported quality strains. By 1995 the growing area
of mangoes had reached 100,000 ha, and the annual output was
150,000 tons, compared with 16,000 ha of growing area in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, which has a history of mango growing dating back to the
Tang Dynasty (618-907), now has 26,666 ha of mango trees,
accounting for one third of the country's total mango growing
area. Mangoes grown here are sold in more than 20 cities in
interior areas as well as Hong Kong, according to local
officials.

<HEADLINE> COSCO Combines US East Coast, Mediterranean Shipping Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The China Ocean Shipping Corporation
(COSCO) has combined its shipping lines from Beilun Port in this
city in east China's Zhejiang Province, to the east coast of the
United States and to the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
A COSCO official explained that the adjustment was made to
streamline the export of commodities from Zhejiang and to
encourage export-oriented enterprises in east China to make more
use of Beilun Port.
</P>
<P>
COSCO will increase the number of ports of call for container
ships after combining the two shipping lines and will use new
ships capable of holding 3,500 containers each to replace old ones
which are only capable of holding 2,000 containers each.
</P>
<P>
The official further explained that the company's normal weekly
shipping service to the east coast of the US will not be changed,
and the 84-day period for a return trip will also be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The service from Beilun Port to the US east coast started last
June and was also this Chinese port's first scheduled ocean
shipping service.
