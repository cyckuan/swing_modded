   MADISON, Wis. _ The issue that gray February day was one of
delicate balance: how to assure the freedom to discourse on
Hitler's ``Mein Kampf,'' as one participant put it, but not to use
the word ``Jew'' as a verb, to lecture on sexuality but not to
refer to female students as ``babes.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate _ over a faculty speech code _ filled the pale blue
faculty senate room in Bascom Hall with passion. It was the latest
round in a dispute that began on the lakeside campus of the
University of Wisconsin nearly two years ago but had been
simmering, in some fashion, for generations. A plaque on the
building's entrance celebrates freedom of inquiry _ the ``fearless
sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found'' _
installed after the 1894 exoneration of an economics professor
accused of teaching socialism and other ``dangerous ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The question on the floor _ and it is being mulled on hundreds
of campuses across the country, from the University of California
to Bowdoin College in Maine _ was how to promote such ``fearless
sifting'' while still creating a welcoming environment for groups
that have historically felt slighted at American universities. For
while robust intellectual inquiry is a self-stated goal of every
university, so too is creating a diverse and tolerant nation.
</P>
<P>
   Student and faculty codes punish, sometimes through suspension,
expulsion or firing, words or deeds that create an environment
perceived as hostile. Backers say codes insure that minorities and
other vulnerable groups will not be mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cost to freedom of speech and it is borne unfairly
by certain members of the community,'' asserted Stanlie M. James, a
professor of Afro-American and women's studies. ``The harm is
immeasurable.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents see codes as the worst form of politically correct
paternalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want Big Brother stepping in and telling us what to
think,'' said Jason Shepard, a student member of the committee
examining the Wisconsin faculty code. ``They assume that all
minority students, all members of the same group, have the same
response to speech. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Charles Kors, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, and Harvey A. Silverglate, a Boston lawyer, sought to
document the effect of the codes and similar programs in their 1998
book ``The Shadow University.'' The university today, they
complained, ``hands students a moral agenda upon arrival, subjects
them to mandatory political re-education, sends them to sensitivity
training, submerges their individuality in official group identity,
intrudes upon private conscience, treats them with scandalous
inequality and, when it chooses, suspends or expels them.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1987 and 1992, about a third of the nation's colleges
and universities enacted codes of conduct that covered offensive
speech, said Jon Gould, a visiting scholar at the University of
California, Berkeley, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on codes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was the code passed in 1987 at the University of
Pennsylvania that forbade ``any behavior, verbal or physical, that
stigmatizes or victimizes individuals on the basis of race, ethnic
or national origin ... and that has the purpose or effect of
interfering with an individual's academic or work performance;
and/or creates an intimidating or offensive academic, living or
work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Most famously, the code was applied against a white Penn student
named Eden Jacobowitz in 1993, when he called a group of noisy
black sorority sisters outside his window ``water buffalo.'' The
university's judicial inquiry officer charged him with racial
harassment. An Israeli-born Jew, Jacobowitz insisted the term _
from the Hebrew behema, slang for a rude person but literally water
buffalo _ has no racial overtones. After a highly publicized
hearing before an administrative board, charges were dropped.
Later, the code was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   While some codes have been struck down by federal courts as
patently illegal or amended after coming under attack in the media
or by students, many colleges and universities still have them,
though they are rarely invoked.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, was the situation with the faculty code at
Wisconsin until last year, when First Amendment advocates decided
it was time for it to be abolished. This was partly because the
code, which had never led to a disciplinary act, had still been the
basis of several investigations of faculty members. Its existence,
opponents argued, chilled discourse. The Wisconsin student speech
code had been struck down by a Federal court in 1991. Now it was
the faculty's turn. But efforts to kill the code proved more
complex than imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The February debate began with the usual legal disquisitions
from the podium _ how to interpret the First Amendment in
conjunction with federal harassment regulations _ but shifted
course when Amelia Rideau from Montclair, N.J., rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rideau, a 20-year-old junior, recounted how in a recent
Chaucer class her professor described a character as ``niggardly.''
Ms. Rideau, a vice president of the Wisconsin Black Student Union,
did not know the word, which means stingy and has no racial
origins.
</P>
<P>
   She was unaware of the controversy in Washington the previous
week over the firing (and ultimate rehiring) of a white mayoral
aide for using the same word. The only black in the class of 50,
Ms. Rideau said she approached the professor afterward and told him
of her feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rideau thought the teacher had understood and agreed not to
use the word again. But at the next class the professor brought in
an article about the Washington flap and began a discussion about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used the word `niggardly' over and over, five or six
times,'' she said. ``I ran out of the class in tears. It was as if
he was saying to me, `Your opinion has no value.'''
</P>
<P>
   When her speech ended to vigorous applause from minority
students in the Madison audience, most members of the faculty
senate _ historians, geneticists and philosophers in worn sweaters
and hiking shoes _ sat in silence. There was no doubting the depth
of Ms. Rideau's pain. But there was no way any code could be
enacted that would bar a professor from using the word
``niggardly.'' And that put the faculty in a quandary.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Her talk created a sense that there are things here that
students of color want that we can't deliver,'' David Ward, the
university chancellor, asserted later.
</P>
<P>
   Two percent of the student body at the University of Wisconsin,
one of the nation's premier research institutions, is black. How to
increase that representation is very much a concern of
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 70s, institutions like ours made promises to
recruit minority groups, and by the late 1980's it was clear many
had failed,'' said Roger W. Howard, the associate dean of students.
``There built up a very significant level of frustration. We had
said we wanted to be a different place, a more welcoming place. Yet
we kept getting told that this was not a comfortable place for
minorities. So we asked ourselves, `What else can we do?' And that
is partly where the speech codes came from.''
</P>
<P>
   After much debate in early March, the faculty senate decided, by
a vote of 71 to 62, to narrow its speech code but not quite abolish
it. Starting with the pledge that the university is ``unswervingly
committed to freedom of speech,'' the new language says that ``all
expression germane to the instructional setting _ including but not
limited to information, the presentation or advocacy of ideas,
assignment of course materials and teaching techniques _ is
protected from disciplinary action.'' This means that even if
students are offended, professors cannot be punished if they prove
the words were relevant to the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin is not alone in its concerns or its solution.
Attracting and retaining minority students is a top goal of every
major university in the face of the growing legal and political
threat to race-conscious admissions. In fact, the movement to end
the codes is often allied with efforts to end those admissions
policies. But just as often, the movement is spearheaded by people
who believe universities have trampled on sacred free-speech
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., is reviewing its
student and faculty speech code to support free expression more
vigorously. At Southern Utah University, a computer-use policy,
which bars downloading material that is ``racially offensive,
threatening, harassing or otherwise objectionable,'' has also come
under attack and university review.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite some people's belief that colleges today are
Stalinist outposts where the slightest misstep into apparent
intolerance is punished by the political correctness police force
(also known as deans of student affairs), campuses report few
bias-related incidents. While there are occurrences involving hate
e-mails or posters with racial slurs and intimidation of
homosexuals, university officials say campuses are not plagued with
the problems of a decade ago, when the codes were drafted.
</P>
<P>
   For both faculty and students, it was a difficult time of
transition from a mostly homogeneous society to a more mixed
culture. Before the 1980s, campuses were mostly white-guy clubs:
homosexuality was less accepted, campus culture less accommodating
of minority concerns, and far fewer women were found on faculties
and in professional schools.
</P>
<P>
   As colleges diversified, speech codes for students and faculty
were seen as one buffer. Brown University ejected a student for
yelling racial and religious epithets outside the dormitories one
night; Sarah Lawrence College brought disciplinary action against a
student using an antigay slur and engaging in ``inappropriate
laughter'' seen as mocking a gay student.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Connecticut banned ``exhibiting, distributing,
posting or advertising publicly offensive, indecent or abusive
matter'' after a 1987 incident in which eight Asian-American
students were spat on and taunted by six white students.
Paradoxically, it was another Asian-American, Nina Wu, a junior,
who challenged the protective policy by hanging a poster listing
groups she disliked, including ``homos,'' on her dormitory door.
After throwing Ms. Wu out of university housing, the university
reinstated her under a judge's order and withdrew the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-80s, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
was still heavily male (today it is nearly half female), a group of
women students complained to the provost about sexual harassment on
campus. The provost, John Deutch, asked one of his deputies, Samuel
Jay Keyser, to devise a policy against sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rules written by Keyser's committee was the banning of
any sexually explicit film on campus without a film board's
approval. The board, a mix of faculty, students and administrative
staff members, was called the Ad Hoc Pornography Screening
Committee, and it adopted guidelines that included an insistence
that the film ``reflect believable reality or normalcy in the
relationships and sexuality displayed'' and that the film ``not
unfairly reflect the viewpoint and sexual feelings of men and/or
women.''
</P>
<P>
   The code was challenged by Adam Dershowitz, a student (and
nephew of Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor), who
projected the movie ``Deep Throat'' on the wall of an MIT dormitory
common room on registration day, 1987. He was prosecuted by the
university under the code, but the charges were dismissed by a
faculty-student committee, which found that the film rules were
``an excessive restraint on freedom of expression at MIT'' The code
was quietly abandoned several years later.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, horrified by what they saw as social engineering,
soon joined forces with liberals who were worried about free speech
to condemn all such codes. Critics said vigorous, sometimes hurtful
debate was the point of a university. As Jonathan Rauch wrote in
his 1993 book ``Kindly Inquisitors,'' ``If you insist on an
unhostile or nonoffensive environment, then you belong in a
monastery, not a university.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, the University of Wisconsin student, said such codes do
more harm than good by offering false comfort. The better way, he
says, is for vulnerable groups to face the discomfort straight on:
``Pursuit of knowledge requires us to ask the tough questions,''
Shepard, who is gay, said. ``And when we do so, people feel uneasy.
There is no way around that.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Keyser, who is retired, agrees. ``The codes were a
mistake. They were a response to a significant group in our
community that was unhappy. But you can't solve the problem with a
code. It was an easy solution that didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not universal. Apart from black, gay and Hispanic
student groups who say that they suffer from humiliation, a number
of women faculty members at Madison recalled the uneasy life before
codes. Theresa Duello, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
Wisconsin's medical school, said that when she joined her
department in 1982, she was told by the chairman that he could not
believe he had to introduce a woman who was taller than he and
thought he would ask her to begin by discussing her first date.
</P>
<P>
   Carin A. Clauss, a law professor who campaigned to keep the
code, said she was especially sensitive to the need for regulations
supporting minority groups and women because she went to law school
when women made up fewer than one percent of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Clauss' main opponent in Madison was Donald Downs, a
political scientist who has come full circle. His first foray into
the free-expression issue was in 1978, when he wrote a book on
American Nazis seeking to march in Skokie, Ill., home to many
Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really identified with how the survivors felt,'' professor
Downs recalled. ``I argued that targeted racial vilification as a
form of assaultive speech crosses the First Amendment line. I
hadn't thought hard enough about the special place of free speech
in a public forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he says, he would favor permitting the Nazis to march in
Skokie just as he favors doing away with all speech codes because
they sacrifice something too significant. He draws parallels with
Prohibition. He also sees an analogy with affirmative action,
saying that, like codes, it gives rights to one group by taking
rights away from another, something he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a central point made by professor Kors and Silverglate
in their book ``The Shadow University.''
</P>
<P>
   They see the codes as part of a larger liberal orthodoxy imposed
by the 60's generation that has taken over college faculties and
administrations, especially the offices of student affairs, which
promote sensitivity and diversity training during freshman
orientation, for dormitory advisers and in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   They say the main victims of this orthodoxy are those who are
not part of it, like Christians who consider homosexuality and
abortion unacceptable and find themselves unable to express
themselves on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who say that while they oppose the codes now,
they served a role when they were enacted. ``There is no question
that the codes did, to some unmeasurable extent, influence and help
create more appropriate attitudes toward race and gender and sexual
orientation,'' professor Downs said. But this was at the cost of
instilling fear of intellectual honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Delgado, a law professor at the University of Colorado
and an early advocate of codes, says that social scientists
increasingly favor what is called the confrontation theory, which
holds that the best way to dampen racism is through clear rules
that punish offenders because the rules' very existence leads
people to conform to their principles. He says this has largely
replaced the social-contact theory, which asserts that racism is
best overcome by placing people of different creeds in constant
contact with one another, and that through such contact they will
see the error of racist attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the codes, despite the changes campuses have made in
recent years, the vulnerability felt by minorities remains raw.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. McPherson, the president of Macalester College in St.
Paul, says that in October 1997, a black student found racist slurs
written on the note board she had hung outside her dormitory room.
The culprit was never found but students held a vigil and public
meetings. Even though there has been no similar event on the campus
since, black students still tell McPherson how the incident upset
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is that gnawing sense of vulnerability that has made the idea
of removing the codes unpalatable to the people they were set up to
protect. They recognize the shaky legal ground on which they sit _
no student speech code that has been challenged in court has
survived _ and worry that the codes will be abused if left on the
books. But they fear the signal such a change would send to
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have become more integrated, I have a sense that the
sorts of incidents we had 10 years ago we don't really have
today,'' observed professor Clauss of Wisconsin. ``Now, women make
up 47 percent of our law school and things are certainly easier.
But we are getting Hmong and Muslim students. I am never sure that
minority interests are adequately protected. There was a Muslim
student in the health program here who raised religious objections
to massage therapy and wanted accommodations to respect his belief.
Whether we take those things seriously depends on sensitizing
people. Who knows what minority will arrive tomorrow?''

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

criticism from publishing houses.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BRINGING OUT THE DEAD &LR;  By Joe Connelly. Vintage Contemporaries,
$12. Frank Pierce, a paramedic working the night shift in the
Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York, is driven to emotional
exhaustion by the brutal world he witnesses. Last year in The New
York Times Book Review, Charley Rosen called this ``a stunning
first novel'' and praised ``the vigorous rhythms of Connelly's
writing _ the poetry of broken bodies and broken lives.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILD THOUGHTS FROM WILD PLACES &LR;  By David Quammen.
Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13. This collection of magazine
articles covers a lot of territory _ from the Missouri River to
Tasmania to Chile _ but is grounded in the author's reverence for
the natural world. ``Quammen easily passes the acid test of any
essayist: He is a good companion,'' James Gorman wrote in 1998.
``He has a wide range of knowledge, an agile pen and a generous
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RED HOURGLASS: LIVES OF THE PREDATORS &LR;  By Gordon Grice.
Delta, $11.95. This is an arrestingly macabre ode to rattlesnakes,
black widow spiders, tarantulas, jackals and other creepy critters.
Grice ``combines the observations of a naturalist with a dry,
homespun philosopher's wit,'' Richard Bernstein wrote last year in
The New York Times. ``This is first-rate, unsentimental writing
about nature and about the ways that human beings try to cope with
the most terrible cruelties that nature offers up.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PACK OF CARDS: AND OTHER STORIES &LR;  By Penelope Lively. Grove,
$13. A young intellectual and his materialistic girlfriend, a
sharp-eyed grandmother visiting her daughter in London and an
agoraphobic housewife are among the characters featured in these
realistic, small-bore tales of British life in the Thatcher years.
``Lively writes beautifully, with meticulous detachment,'' Jay
Parini wrote in 1989. ``The stories ... are uniformly entertaining
and, often, inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued the author's first novel,  &UR; THE
ROAD TO LICHFIELD &LR;  ($12), in which a 40-year-old suburban mother
traveling back and forth to an English village to tend to her dying
father falls in love with one of his neighbors. In 1991 Ellen Pall
called this ``a homey, companionable book'' that is ``concerned
with time and memory.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CHILDREN &LR;  By David Halberstam. Fawcett/Ballantine, $17.95.
The author, who was a young reporter in Nashville, Tenn., in the
1950s, tells the story of the black college students there whose
protests were instrumental in igniting the civil rights movement.
The result is a ``powerful, densely packed'' narrative, David M.
Oshinsky wrote last year. ``There is much to admire in Halberstam's
book.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; KILLING THE DREAM: JAMES EARL RAY AND THE ASSASSINATION OF
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. &LR; , by Gerald Posner (Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$15), the writer who attacked Kennedy conspiracy theories in ``Case
Closed'' takes on Ray's claim of innocence in the 1968 murder of
King. This skeptical account is ``a model of investigation,
meticulous in its discovery and presentation of evidence,'' Anthony
Lewis wrote in 1998. ``And it is a wonderfully readable book, as
gripping as a first-class detective story.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KALIMANTAAN &LR;  By C.S. Godshalk. Owl/Holt, $14. In the 19th
century, a young Englishman is driven by his idealized love for his
dead mother to create his own private raj in Borneo and help the
British government expand its trading empire. This is ``a first
novel of formidable imaginative power,'' Annette Kobak wrote in
1998. ```Kalimantaan' is the work of a born storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGIA O'KEEFFE: A LIFE &LR;  By Roxana Robinson. University Press
of New England, $19.95. This authorized biography chronicles the
artist's long life and career and ``does much to give body to the
O'Keeffe myth,'' Hayden Herrera wrote in 1989. ``The author
presents a person who was both vulnerable and fierce, passionate
and coolly withholding, sensuous yet oddly unsexual.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DARKNESS VISIBLE &LR;  By William Golding. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$13. This disturbing novel explores the intertwined fates of a boy
hideously scarred during the London blitz and a set of beautiful
twins scarred by their father's icy neglect. ``Golding's magical
fable ... draws us with seductive words into a vision of elemental
reality so vivid we seem to hallucinate the scenes,'' John Thompson
wrote in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAFE EUROPA: LIFE AFTER COMMUNISM &LR;  By Slavenka Drakulic.
Penguin, $12.95. In these essays, a Croatian journalist finds a
metaphor for the daunting problems of Eastern Europe in the bad
teeth of her friends and relatives. ```Cafe Europa' ... is studded
with such everyday observations that open out, like windows, to
reveal wide-angled historical vistas,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in
The New York Times in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNEXPECTED SALAMI &LR;  By Laurie Gwen Shapiro. Algonquin,
$10.95. At the center of this 1990s screwball comedy are a spoiled
New Yorker, her Aussie bass-player boyfriend and his ex-bandmate, a
recovering heroin addict who is taken in by a Jewish-Italian family
in New York. It all makes for an ``endearingly quirky first
novel,'' Anthony Bourdain wrote last year.

DEVELOPMENT OVER TAKING ARIZONA'S SMALL TOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS FISCUS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Queen Creek to Surprise, Laveen to Higley, bulldozers
threaten the Mayberrys of central Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Small towns where people raise ostriches and hang out at
watermelon festivals are under siege, targeted not just for 100 or
200 new homes, but for thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles southeast of downtown Phoenix, Queen Creek has a
red-brick town hall and a shop where if you buy 9 pounds of
sausage, the 10th is free. A country store offers hayrides. And up
to 9,000 new houses are headed for the town.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest of Phoenix, Surprise cherishes its annual community
watermelon feast and a Fourth of July parade that recently featured
huge puppets of Uncle Sam and the Liberty Bell made by children.
Now the community is growing so fast that its city-limits signs
boast, ``Population _ increasing daily.'' The latest count: 19,000
residents, up from fewer than 10,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The small-town, rural atmosphere is on a collision course with
the growth machine of America's sixth-largest city. Places that
used to be in the boondocks have become housing hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   For longtime residents of these hamlets, this leaves two
options: move, or adjust to the added conveniences _ and the added
traffic, crime and commotion _ of big-city life. &QL; 
WORRIES IN THE EAST
</P>
<P>
   The phone book in the town of Queen Creek looks like a pamphlet.
When a wife wants to find her husband at work, she drives along a
country road or two, scanning fields looking for the right tractor.
People say that when they venture into town, they know just about
everyone there.
</P>
<P>
   John Scott has enjoyed this lifestyle for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   At Scott's One Windmill Farm in Queen Creek, he eyes his 200
hens, a humid greenhouse filled with tomato plants, and his 10
acres of crops.
</P>
<P>
   A single windmill, a Christmas gift from his kids, towers over
his dirt driveway. A collection of old tractors, some from the
1920s, sits out by the road.
</P>
<P>
   He worries how his lifestyle will survive with all the new
houses headed for the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people move out here, they don't want to accept things
the way they are,'' he says. ``They think they have to have a
supermarket, they have to have a bank. It really bothers me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it would make life more convenient, but my
concern is that we'll end up with a Circle K on every corner.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jean, says Queen Creek was a good place to raise
children because ``it was a long way to walk to get into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids rode horses. The family raised pigs and chickens. And
when you would go into town, ``you knew people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The community, with its postcard views of the Superstitions, the
Four Peaks and the San Tan Mountains, still features field after
field of potatoes and grazing land for horses. But the Town Council
has approved plans for about 6,000 new houses, and plans are
pending that could add 3,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Scott points to a field of grain, saying, ``People have
taken to the idea that food falls from the roof at Safeway after
midnight. That doesn't happen. To take all the farmland and turn it
into stucco homes is nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   She bemoans the loss of agricultural land to housing communities
and the loss of water wells to golf courses. Such concerns are
facing far more than just the people of Queen Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County already has added more people than any other
county in the country since 1990 _ and the growth shows no signs of
slowing down. &QL; 
NO SURPRISE HERE
</P>
<P>
   In Surprise, the signs that say, ``Population _ increasing
daily'' aren't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   A John Deere tractor putters down a dirt road past a farm that
donated 500 watermelons for the annual feast. A half-mile away is a
new housing development with row after row of roofs _ and a sign
noting that a Walgreens drugstore is coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   Along Bell Road west of town, there's a point that seems to
separate the Sonoran Desert from the stark reality of an expanding
civilization. Look to the west, and all you see is a mountain,
creosote bushes and cactuses. A sign warns that there are no
services for the next 38 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But to the east, over a small rise, new houses are just a mile
away and coming closer every day.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine any line throughout the Valley where development stops,
says real estate analyst R.L. Brown, ``and each day it pushes out a
little further.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the far northwest Valley, he observes: ``Everywhere you
turn, people are building.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Until recently, for example, El Mirage had been anything but a
magnet for developers. The population is about 5,700.
</P>
<P>
   But about 7,000 homes are planned, and the town's population
could reach about 35,000 within four to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth comes at a time when the city already is having
problems with its drinking-water system. El Mirage's tap water last
year violated federal drinking-water standards, officials said, but
they say the problems have been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The building frenzy also is headed for Laveen, a community
southwest of Phoenix that doesn't even have a town hall or city
hall. Nearby there's a restaurant with views of the city lights at
night _ and a hitching post so regulars can ride their horses to
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A Laveen school marquee advertises an upcoming ``community
BBQ.'' There are upscale horse properties, and some large farm
houses near South Mountain, including ones where two and three
generations of the same family live.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are in the works for at least 2,000 new houses for Laveen,
and the surrounding area is expecting to be one of the biggest
areas for growth during the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're displacing one lifestyle for another,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Most would vote for the first lifestyle, he says, noting that
most people think that sunrise and sunset in Laveen is pretty nice
but that sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic in Phoenix is not.
</P>
<P>
   But, he wonders, if you don't put more people in places such as
Laveen, ``where are you going to put all the people who will come
here?'' &QL; 
IRRESISTIBLE FORCE
</P>
<P>
   And they will come. Metropolitan Phoenix has been one of the top
housing markets in the country for years. More than 30,000 homes
are going up annually around the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That growth is even reaching into Maricopa, south of Phoenix
near Interstate 10. A developer is pitching Pecan Valley Ranch as a
community just 25 minutes from the high-tech jobs in south
Chandler. Builders soon will begin a 6,000-acre development with a
golf course in Maricopa, just one of several housing projects
planned for the community, once best known as the site of a
regional landfill.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S THE ATTRACTION?
</P>
<P>
   Brown says land in Maricopa is available for about $7,000 per
acre, instead of $50,000 or more per acre in more centrally located
spots. Planners in Pinal County, where the town is located, are
cooperative; development fees are low; and there's still a rural
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Places such as Maricopa, Queen Creek and Surprise used to be
defined by their proximity to farms. But that's changing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Maricopa County, we are losing over 5,000 acres of
agricultural land each year,'' says Dave Iwanski, executive vice
president of the Agri-Business Council of Arizona, a trade group.
``That's 5,000 acres of actively irrigated farmland being
urbanized.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 25 years, he said, there will be little if any
agricultural land left within the Salt River Project, a massive,
turn-of-the-century undertaking responsible for the greening of the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That's a contrast to 1997, he said, when Maricopa County ranked
13th in the nation in agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable. It has to happen,'' says Stanley Paul Cook, a
San Diego-based consultant for Landiscor Aerial, which maps
development in the Valley. ``It's easier to harvest interest from
the bank than it is to try to grow alfalfa in the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Selling hundreds of acres can be a jackpot for farmers. Many
would like to retire after decades of hard work, and their children
aren't interested in continuing the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Those and other factors are changing the face of many rural
areas. &QL; 
LOOK WHAT'S COMING
</P>
<P>
   Recently, analysts say, prices for a single lot in Surprise
climbed from about $10,000 to $25,000 in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   North of Sun City West, Cook said, the last full section of
citrus left in the Valley is in escrow. Continental Homes wants the
640 acres to build Pleasant Valley Ranch, a community of 2,400
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Near a southern portion of Gilbert in the southeast Valley, a
new convenience store sits across the street from a country store,
which has a cowboy standing next to a ``Whoa'' sign painted on one
wall. Rural homes, one with a ``Bunnies For Sale'' sign out front,
separate subdivisions of trendy homes under construction.
</P>
<P>
   New homes are being built so fast that the community of Higley
east of Gilbert soon could be history.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gilbert took the first step to annex 273 acres in
the heart of Higley, a place where residents are scarce but
fiercely loyal to their community's identity. Its downtown consists
of a mix of businesses where customers can buy Latin-music CDs,
18th-century bathtubs and 50-pound sacks of chicken feed.
</P>
<P>
   Shea Homes plans to build 738 homes in the community. To express
their disapproval, Higley resident Ed Welch and his neighbors
recently painted a 50-foot wall next to the site fluorescent pink.
Another resident, Jim Staples, described the project as ``our
Boston Tea Party.'' Residents say the development could triple the
size of the Higley School District and put an end to the quiet life
that Higley residents enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; People in communities such as Queen Creek say they are
committed to preserving a rural feel, despite the explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   The town approved a growth management law that requires
developers to expand roads, sewers or parks at their expense if
their projects strain current facilities. Community leaders also
favor low- to medium-density housing, pushing for homes on large
lots.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook says that when you have new housing communities next to
farms and dairies, ``eventually, 95 percent of all the farmland is
going to cave in'' because of neighborhood complaints, increased
traffic or the money that can be made by selling land.
</P>
<P>
   Scott of Queen Creek agrees, saying, ``A lot of times we're
almost forced to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's holding on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not leaving here,'' he says. ``There's no way I can just
pick up and move.''
</P>
<P>
   He will keep growing crops used in posh eateries throughout the
Valley, from RoxSand to the Phoenician and the Buttes. He will
brace for more drivers annoyed by tractors in town. And he has
planted 200 peach and apricot trees to make up for the loss of a
nearby orchard that is being sold for housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Gilbert,'' he says. Not long ago it was all farmland.
``Today, it's all houses.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend likely won't stop, Cook says, because growth likely
won't stall anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got water, land, jobs. Why would it stop?'' &QL; 
LOSING THAT CHARM
</P>
<P>
   Some say there's hope.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert already has experienced the explosive growth that is
headed to the Valley's rural areas. But Gilbert Planning Director
Scott Anderson says that the influx of people hasn't cost the town
its rural charm.
</P>
<P>
   An annual survey by the town asks what attracted people to
Gilbert. The top answer used to be schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Number One reason now is the rural, small-town
atmosphere,'' he says. ``We're almost a community of 100,000, yet
we still have a rural character. We're making efforts to save some
of that character.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An agricultural land alliance also has been formed to consider
buying smaller tracts on the fringe of town for community gardens
or vegetable farms. Using such techniques, cities and towns can
hold onto their rural flavor while adding thousands and thousands
of new homes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But Councilwoman Jo Albright isn't so sure. While the survey
says people are attracted to Gilbert because of the rural
atmosphere, it may be a matter of perspective. She's lived in
Gilbert for 20 years and says the rural feeling of the past is all
but gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered for years how they see any at all,'' she says.
``I think it's dead and buried, myself. . . . They must have come
from a highly urbanized area to think this is rural.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; With the hamlets around Phoenix facing such rapid growth, many
worry that the places that give them their special rural character
will be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Places like the Higley Hot Dogs hut.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Inside is a parrot named Sammy that squawks, ``Cubs win!'' and
``Go Bears!'' When a police officer walks in, the bird says, ``Call
the Cops!''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of every workday, owner Joe Kryza picks Sammy up and
makes the short stroll home. He notes that all the construction
crews in the area have been great for the family business.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife, Jeri, isn't so optimistic. She looks at the
hundreds of homes being built down the street and says life is
bound to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it,'' she says. ``I'd rather be country.'' &QL;

DRESS GIVEAWAY HELPS TEEN GIRLS GET TO PROM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Racks and racks of donated fancy dresses lined the quiet Phoenix
store Saturday morning as a line of girls snaked across the
sidewalk outside.
</P>
<P>
   There is little to tell about these dresses' pasts: a tiny hole
where a pin likely held a corsage in an elegant long purple dress;
a tugging at the hem of a light pink shift where a bridesmaid might
have caught the heel of her dyed pump; a little rip where a
shimmery bracelet tore the tulle of a white gown.
</P>
<P>
   But the high school girls cared less about where these dresses
came from and more about where they were going.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Chavez, 15, peered inside, eyeing the bubble-gum-pink
shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh look, it's so cute,'' said the Glendale High School
sophomore. ``It doesn't look too fancy. Perfect for prom.''
</P>
<P>
   By arriving almost three hours before ``Prom Dress '99,'' the
dress giveaway, began, she secured a prime spot to comb through the
donated taffeta and silk gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, 250 high school girls from Buckeye to Mesa
scoured the racks of 900 free dresses to find the right color, the
perfect fit, ``the'' dress.
</P>
<P>
   They scurried through Affordable Tuxedo on Peoria Avenue, whose
owners, Nancy and Mark Richmond, volunteered the shop for the day.
They tried on dresses and modeled them for parents who waited
patiently outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to the window. Come over here,'' Veronica's mother, Josie
Chavez, called.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica transformed herself from a shapeless girl in baggy
sweats to an elegant girl ready for a dance as she twirled in front
of her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' Mom mouthed, sighing relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, these proms are so expensive,'' added Chavez, a cashier
for Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, two of my girls had proms. I bought the dresses,
the shoes, the hose, the hairpieces, and it's, `Oh I need to have a
little clutch bag,' '' she said. ``You just can't do it. I
suggested she wear the same dress from last year, and it's, `Oh,
are you crazy?' This really helps.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Stacey Millstein's idea a year ago when she heard about
a similar program in Washington, D.C. She asked for dresses in
community newsletters, at her synagogue and at her son's Scottsdale
high school.
</P>
<P>
   And she got them. A man donated 30 dresses from his four
daughters' stockpile. A woman in Kingman collected 150. And soon,
the cars were booted from Millstein's three-car garage to store the
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   This mother of a teenage son understands the importance of a
dance in a high school girl's life and how finding the right dress
can mean the difference between having fun or staying home. It
wasn't solving hunger or homelessness, but it ``can make the girls
feel like princesses just one night,'' said Millstein, 35.
</P>
<P>
   She sent letters to 52 schools across Arizona, asking counselors
and teachers to spread the word about the giveaway to girls who
might not otherwise be able to afford to go to the prom. All she
required was that the girls brought student identification cards.
</P>
<P>
   Women who heard of the giveaway volunteered to help girls pick
out dresses. They searched racks of dresses, some never worn and
with the store tags to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   As volunteer Amy Phillips of Mesa helped these young girls, she
was 16 again, getting ready for the prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at these dresses, and you think no one would ever
wear these,'' she said, ``and then these girls put them on, and
they're beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled as she watched a tiny Size 3 long cream dress find a
new life with Brandye Grant, 18, of West Valley High School in
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be able to go without this. Everything is so
expensive,'' said Grant, as she selected cream brocade pumps, Size
8. ``I wouldn't even think to ask my mom to pay for this. She works
so hard as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   As many of the girls left Saturday, dresses in hand, they had
everything but a date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on that,'' said Evita Chavez, 17, Veronica's older
sister.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Robinson already had a date _ her boyfriend, who waited
outside with her parents. She smiled as she displayed an elegant
purple off-the-shoulder long dress, ready for Arcadia High School's
prom.
</P>
<P>
   Her mom put her hand to her heart, and tears formed in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a good kid, and I'm so excited for her,'' Mary
Robinson said. ``We could not have afforded to send her.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to Millstein and hugged her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She deserves so much more,'' Mary Robinson said, ``but this is
all we have today.'' &QL;

VAUGHN NOW POWER OF ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Plush carpeting. Two humongous TV sets in the
middle of the room. State-of-the-art CD apparatus. A magazine
selection including everything from Playboy, Road and Track, and
Sports Illustrated to the duPont Registry (``A Buyer's Gallery of
Fine Houses''). Spacious lockers, over which are affixed ceremonial
baseball bats. You can even park your own car in a real,
honest-to-God parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   This is most definitely not Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn says he doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stuff out here,'' he says. ``But I'm not used
to this type of situation, and I never want to get used to it.
That's not what it's all about. It's all about the game. This game
is still the game.''
</P>
<P>
   How true. A game is a game and a home run is a home run, and
that most certainly was a home run and a half that Maurice Vaughn
hit for the Angels in Friday night's Freeway Series exhibition with
the Dodgers at Edison Field. After going homerless in his 56 Cactus
League at-bats, Mo launched a 2-and-1 pitch from Ismael Valdes to
dead center, the ball clearing the 400-foot sign and a second fence
about 15 feet beyond that before landing a good 25 or 30 feet
farther on a green expanse where seats once accommodated fannies at
Rams games. This jaw-dropping wallop might very well have either
hit, or gone over, the back wall behind the TV camera in Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit it good,'' observed Angels skipper Terry Collins, in a
classic display of baseball-lifer succinctness.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn doesn't look quite right in that Angels uniform with the
cut-away tops and the dark blue sleeves, but you already knew that.
But he's still Mo. He's still raving about his home-state
Connecticut Huskies (he was given an honorary jersey during a
winter visit to Gampel Pavilion), asking about the Celtics and how
Johnny Val is doing, and reminding anyone who asks that the New
England fans ``always stuck wth me, through good times and bad
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He's an Anaheim Angel now. Goodbye, Easton. Hello, Newport
Beach. This born-and-bred East Coast guy, a product of Norwalk,
Conn., and Trinity Pawling, and Seton Hall, and the Red Sox is now
ensconced in the land of arrive-lates and leave-earlys, where
baseball is not a passion but a diversion ranking somewhere on the
entertainment scale between watering your lawn and going to the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's life and death in Boston,'' he says. ``That's true. But
it's always life and death to me, no matter where I am. If we win,
we'll bring the fans out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fans have been told that the Angels will be better this
year, but one thing no one seems to have any control over is
something known locally as the ``Angel Curse.'' That's correct,
Vaughn apparently has traded in the Curse of the Bambino for the
Curse of the Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Just this past week, the team lost the services of the Merrimack
Valley's own Gary DiSarcina until sometime after the All-Star Game.
The classy shortstop was hit by a fungo bat swung by coach George
Hendrick, sustaining a broken bone in his left forearm. A day or so
after that, veteran lefthander Chuck Finley was struck by a line
drive off the bat of Oakland's Jason Giambi, delaying the start of
his regular season by at least a turn. The Angels already had lost
starter Jason Dickson (shoulder) for the season. And let's not
forget center fielder Jim Edmonds, who had an MRI Friday in an
attempt to discover the source of recurrent back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's face scrunches up in mock horror when confronted with
the spectre of another curse situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' he says. ``Let's not talk about curses. I have to
believe everything will be all right. We just have to keep our
heads above water until Gary comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he doesn't want to talk too much about what transpired
back in Boston, but since he's still Mo Vaughn the buttons are very
easy to push.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just see the writing on the wall,'' he says. ``I
could see it coming. What got me out of Boston was that I wanted to
speak my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The raging question in Boston remains: Was it more owner John
Harrington's doing, or general manager Dan Duquette's? Or were the
Red Sox pooh-bahs of a like mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never could tell,'' Vaughn says. ``Both have to take
responsibility. I'm not going to put the blame on any one person,
and I don't blame anybody. It was just time to move on. If I had
stayed in Boston, I would have retired as an angry player, and
that's wrong, because I love this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have done everything they could to make Vaughn feel
comfortable out here, starting, of course, with paying him about
$13 million a year. The distance to center at Edison Field has been
reduced from 408 to 400 (it could have been 440 on Friday and
Vaughn still would have put that one out), while the left field
power alley has been changed from 396 to 387. Vaughn's name was not
mentioned, but who in baseball doesn't know that his primary power
alley is left center to dead center?
</P>
<P>
   Still, it won't be Fenway, as Vaughn well knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenway was a great place to hit,'' he says. ``Everyone knows
that. But I've always used the whole field. The wall gave me some
things, but right field took away some things, too. One balances
out the other. If you're gonna hit, you're gonna hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks good. ``I'm at 245,'' he says. ``Right where I want to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed the big homer Friday with a hard line out to
left-center, both of which made people feel better following his
homerless Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring training is a lot different out here,'' he says.
``That's one thing I've learned. It's crazy. On game day, if you're
on the road, you work out at your own place from 9:30 to 10:30,
take a half-hour bus ride, and then sit around until 1 o'clock
doing nothing. I could never get loose. I kept saying, `How can you
guys get ready like this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He knew what people expected, so he basically promised his
manager, teammates, and the media he would not enter the regular
season without at least one homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried,'' said Collins. ``Mo is not someone I've
been concerned with.''
</P>
<P>
   It all starts for real Tuesday night, and that's when the
scrutiny _ such as it exists out here _ will start. The Angels will
be expecting a huge bang for their considerable bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel pressure when I signed my last contract, and I
won't feel any pressure this time, and I'll tell you why,'' says
Vaughn. ``I think everyone ought to play in a major market, because
they toughen you up. You play in New York, Boston, Philly _ places
like that _ and that will get you ready for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be ready for anything because I am prepared and I work
hard. Baseball is not a six-month deal for me. I won't get down
after a bad day, because I know how this game goes. I will promise
to bring my regular intensity to this ball club. I am ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about May 7? Anaheim at Boston. Everyone back home has
that one circled on the calendar. Has Mo?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gone crazy thinking about it, but, sure, I know what
that is,'' he says. ``It will be nice to see some friends. But the
fans? You never know how they will react to you.''
</P>
<P>
   We know this much: They react. In Boston, Mo Vaughn stirs
passions. Here? We'll have to check back in October.

SOBER SINCE '95, HANK KUEHNE IS MAKING A MASTERFUL COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A lifelong dream fulfilled and a Masters invitation
guaranteed, Hank Kuehne did not allow himself to be swept away in
the emotional flood that gripped friends, family members and
well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Kuehne had earned the right to celebrate. A
recovering alcoholic, he had just concluded a three-year journey
from a room in a Minnesota rehabilitation center to a tee time at
Augusta National Golf Club by advancing to the final match of the
1998 U.S. Amateur Championship last Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   His teacher, Hank Haney, offered a congratulatory hug. Kuehne
countered with a bit of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I've got to work on my pairing,'' Kuehne told Haney on
the eve of the U.S. Amateur finals. ``I want to play with Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both finalists in the U.S. Amateur earn trips to
Augusta, only the winner is paired with the defending Masters
champion in the opening round. Kuehene, a three-time All-American
at SMU, sealed his Thursday tee time with Mark O'Meara by knocking
off Tom McKnight, 2 and 1, in the finals at Oak Hill Country Club
in Rochester, N.Y., last August.
</P>
<P>
   When Kuehne and O'Meara step to the first tee Thursday, Haney
plans to have a handkerchief handy in case his tear-streaked eyes
cloud his view of his two prized pupils. Haney, the former SMU golf
coach, has worked with O'Meara for 15 years and has tutored Kuehne,
23, since he was an eighth-grader who regularly outdrove the
members at Stonebridge Country Club in McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see them playing together at Augusta,'' Haney
said. ``It's going to be incredible. Hearing Mark being announced
as the Masters champion will be enough to give me goose bumps. But
having Hank next to him, because of where he's been and what he's
overcome, will make it even more special. As a teacher, it's your
ultimate dream.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kuehne, it may be more than that. Not only will he be making
his debut in one of golf's major championships, he'll be paired
with his favorite player on the PGA Tour, a guy Kuehne has known
for a decade because of their mutual ties to Haney.
</P>
<P>
   In a poignant bit of irony, he'll be joined between the ropes by
his brother, Trip, who will serve as Kuehne's caddie. When Trip
qualified for the 1995 Masters, Hank Kuehne was unable to watch his
brother compete because he was not granted television privileges at
the Hazelden Center for Youth and Families, an alcohol-and-drug
treatment facility in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Having his brother beside him at the Masters, in Kuehne's
estimation, serves as a subtle reminder of how much things have
changed in his life since he took his last sip of alcohol on Feb.
3, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something very special to me,'' Kuehne said. ``It's
going to be emotional. It's something that you can't really put
into words.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ernie, comes close.
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas-based lawyer, Ernie Kuehne has watched his daughter,
Kelli, win two U.S. Women's Amateur titles and begin her LPGA Tour
career. He has seen Trip, a Dallas banker, finish as runner-up in
the 1994 U.S. Amateur and lead Oklahoma State's run to the 1995
NCAA championship. Last summer, he watched Hank hoist his U.S.
Amateur trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No family has ever had our success in amateur golf. Period,''
Ernie Kuehne said. ``But what Hank has accomplished in his personal
life is far greater than anything any of the Kuehnes have done on
the golf course.''
Turning point
</P>
<P>
   Always a promising junior player, Hank Kuehne began drinking at
13. By the time he enrolled as a freshman at Oklahoma State, he
could still control a golf ball but not his cravings for alcohol.
Then, he took a drive that changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   While heading out to party with friends, Kuehne _ who had only
one drink in his system at the time _ ran a stop sign and struck
another vehicle. Although none of the three passengers in the other
car sustained serious injuries, Kuehne broke four ribs, suffered a
concussion and spent the night in a cell at the Stillwater, Okla.,
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, brother Trip and Oklahoma State coach Mike
Holder picked him up from jail. Seeing the long looks on their
faces made a lasting impression. Within days, he was headed to
Hazelden for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw what my behavior and what I was doing to myself ...
did to my brother and other people, I didn't want to live like that
any more,'' Kuehne said. ``I've been sober since Feb. 3 of '95. You
never can just say, `OK, I'm well.' I'm always going to be an
alcoholic. But I've been very lucky in my recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing his rehab, Kuehne transferred to SMU. Now,
every day is a sober blessing. And a challenge. Of the 30 people in
his 1995 rehab class, Haney said Kuehne is the only one who has not
suffered a relapse.
</P>
<P>
   His salvation, say friends and family members, has been golf.
Kuehne learned to funnel his compulsive tendencies toward birdies
and bogeys rather than booze. His scores lowered and his confidence
rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcoholics have to trade one addiction for another. John Daly
had to turn to caffeine and smoking,'' Trip Kuehne said. ``Hank
traded drinking for golf.''
Coming back
</P>
<P>
   Endless hours on the practice tee have resulted in Kuehne
earning All-America honors during each of his first three seasons
at SMU. Along the way, tales of Kuehne's explosive drives have
caught the attention of college and professional players.
</P>
<P>
   There was the tournament in El Paso where Kuehne, boosted by a
tailwind, overdrove the green by 50 yards on a par-4 hole. He has
bested Art Sellenger, a former national long-drive champion, in an
exhibition. During the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in January, PGA
champ Vijay Singh stopped Kuehne as he left the driving range and
asked him to pound a few balls.
</P>
<P>
   Singh challenged him to clear a fence approximately 300 yards
away. Eventually, Kuehne succeeded. He offered his driver to Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it's your turn,'' Kuehne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Singh said, softly. ``I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, a longtime friend of the Kuehne family and one of
the PGA Tour's longest hitters (296.3 yards per drive in 1998),
said Kuehne's length could make him a surprise contender in Augusta
if he has a good week with his putter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits it farther than anybody out here on tour,'' Woods
said. ``The fairways are enormous at Augusta. If he keeps it on the
correct side of the fairway and rolls some putts, he'll be fine. I
still think an amateur can win at Augusta if he has the right
attitude and gets some breaks. Hank has the talent and he's plenty
brash. I think he'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent returns suggest otherwise. Before heading to Georgia last
week for 10 days of pre-Masters preparations that included a
college tournament and a challenge match with British Amateur champ
Sergio Garcia, Kuehne finished 47th at the Morris Williams
Collegiate Tournament in Austin. He fired rounds of 81-76-76 in the
March 23-24 event at Austin Country Club, causing Ernie Kuehne to
downplay his son's chances to make a memorable debut at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going there to win. He's not going there to make the
cut,'' Ernie Kuehne said. ``He's doing it to fulfill a lifelong
dream and for the learning experience. He hasn't been playing well
lately, but as long as he gives 100 percent effort, he doesn't owe
anyone an apology. My love is no greater if he shoots 62 or 85.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus, then, is on the experience and not the scorecard. And
during his dream week in Augusta, Hank Kuehne is slated to
experience practice rounds with Woods, Arnold Palmer, Ernie Els,
Fuzzy Zoeller and others. He will sleep in the Crow's Nest, the
dormitory style cubicle in the top floor of the clubhouse set aside
for amateur participants.
\Nsubheds:Kuchar memories
</P>
<P>
   Whether Kuehne survives to play the weekend rounds remains to be
seen. He said he draws inspiration from the effort of Matt Kuchar,
a Georgia Tech golfer who finished 21st at the 1998 Masters while
competing as the reigning U.S. Amateur champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing what he did is proof that it is possible for an amateur
to come in and play well at Augusta,'' said Kuehne, whose best
score in four practice rounds at the course is even-par 72. ``As
far as how my game fits Augusta, my ball-flight trajectory is
left-to-right, which is a really good fit for the golf course. And
my long game seems to fit really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really got expectations or goals for this week,
because I think that would hinder my game and get in the way. I
want to do the best I can do and see how the putter holds up. That
should be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Haney said he is most curious about his pupil's course
management skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``His game is a lot like Tiger's,'' Haney said. ``He's got the
strength to overpower a course. But he's not just a long hitter.
Hank's got a great imagination for golf. He's got a certain amount
of touch around the greens. For a player his age, his course
management skills are good. But he still has a lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Augusta, in turn, should prove to be an eye-opening experience
for a player with designs on joining the PGA Tour later this
season, perhaps at the U.S. Open. Regardless of what lessons he
learns in his first Masters, Kuehne figures he learned the most
important one long ago, in a Minnesota rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, I was sitting in my room at Hazelden with
other addicts _ heroin and other things. And I couldn't even play
golf,'' Kuehne said. ``Look at where I am today. I don't care if I
shoot 90. I'm just happy to be headed to the Masters. Hopefully,
I'll be prepared and able to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   A final checklist for Thursday should include a hankey for
Haney. Just in case the Kuehne-O'Meara pairing tweaks a few more
heartstrings than the teacher can handle.

RAMBIS SECOND-GUESSES HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Lakers coach Kurt Rambis' decision to keep
Shaquille O'Neal on the bench in the final 49 seconds against
Phoenix paid off with a victory Friday, but Rambis second-guessed
himself Saturday, after O'Neal had complained about the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably a wrong decision of mine,'' Rambis said. ``He
is our money guy and make-or-break guy. We need him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal did not appear in the locker room before Saturday's game
against the Warriors and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reid comes through: Forward J.R. Reid made the most of his 14
minutes against Phoenix, scoring 14 points. But he knew he was
likely to return to the bench again, even after his good showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like more minutes. Travis (Knight) would like more
minutes,'' Reid said. ``We'd all like to see more minutes. You just
have to wait for your time. I'm hoping they've seen what I can do.
I played with Kurt (in Charlotte) for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid received a phone call Saturday from his former North
Carolina coach, Dean Smith, but wasn't home. The pair speak to each
other once or twice a month to keep in contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does that with all his players,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis sympathized with Reid's playing predicament, although he
couldn't guarantee expanded minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough that whenever you throw somebody out there and they
respond (and you decide) not to use them again,'' Rambis said.
``But then Sean (Rooks) played a great game the game before and
didn't get to play (against Phoenix). It's a tough scenario... to
give them all playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesting the call: Lakers forward Rick Fox was unhappy about
the double technical he received from referee Ted Bernhardt on
Friday in Phoenix after being called for setting a pick out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention was to set a pick, but I got chucked out of
bounds,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the technicals, Fox said: ``That's called speaking your
mind. First, I tried to be nice, but I wasn't making much progress.
It was a real quick hook. That's usually a sign (the referee) was
wrong. I said it's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox joked that he was going to have start budgeting his money if
he keeps accumulating fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make the money these other guys make to be getting
fined. I've been fined about $8,000 this year,'' Fox said. ``I need
to see an end quick or there will be no vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson ill: Rookie Ruben Patterson did not feel well before
the game and did not suit up.
</P>
<P>
   Charity drive: Saturday's game marked the beginning of the
Lakers' Feed the Children food-drop program at the Forum. Fans are
encouraged to bring non-perishable food items. A portion will be
distributed to the refugees from Kosovo.

MAVERICKS' BRADLEY LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS, AT LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He was one of the last players to show up at the
Mavericks' practice facility during the NBA lockout last fall. That
prompted speculation that center Shawn Bradley was up to his old
tricks.
</P>
<P>
   When the off-season rolls around, Bradley usually locks up the
basketballs, puts his sneakers in the attic and spends the
off-season getting re-acquainted with his lovely family. That
routine routinely led to Bradleyarriving at training camp
overweight and woefully out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   But unbeknownst to many of Bradley's staunchest critics, he
altered his routine last off-season. The 7-foot-6 gentle giant put
in extra work, lifted his share of weights and finally made
basketball a priority in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here most of the summer, and I was working out with the
guys off and on,'' Bradley said. ``It just so happened that when
the lockout hit the holidays, I spent it with my family, and I
hadn't done that in seven or eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why not spend the holidays with my family? It was a good
opportunity. But that didn't mean I stopped working out and stopped
doing the things that I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Mavericks coaches tell it, the Bradley who felt the
heavy brunt of many harmful jokes from fans during his first 18
months in a Mavericks uniform has suddenly become the voice of
reason on this team. He has also become the Mavericks' most
productive and most improved player from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably been our best player this year,'' said Don
Nelson, the Mavericks coach and general manager. ``I didn't think I
would say that, but he's had a marvelous year, and he's been very
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six years _ and three teams _ after being the No. 2
overall pick in the 1993 NBA draft, Bradley is as upbeat and sure
of himself as he has ever been. His shots are falling, his
rebounding is above par and his shot-blocking is superb.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is averaging eight points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.36 blocked
shots a game, and is shooting a team-high 49.3 percent from the
floor. Nice numbers for a player who admittedly did not live up to
expectations his first five NBA seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call this a year that I've felt more confident and
comfortable than any other year,'' Bradley said. ``More than
anything, I've just had a confident level coming into this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, the maturity thing has helped me to just go out and play
hard every night and try to do the things that Coach needs me to do
to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Nelson de-emphasized Bradley as a prime scoring threat,
the six-year veteran's game has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn's played great,'' point guard Steve Nash said. ``He's
come out every night and really has been focused and alert on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a positive for us, and that's allowed his game and
his skills to blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and the Mavericks will take an 11-22 record into
Minneapolis tomorrow night against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
Bradley said he is ashamed of the Mavericks' record, because he
believes this team is better than its .333 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at half-a-dozen games and say we should have won
them,'' Bradley said. ``If we would have come to play those nights,
we would have won those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's another six games we can look at and say, `Boy, we
had opportunities to steal those, but because of our maturity level
we didn't.' So we've had half-a-dozen giveaways and half-a-dozen
almosts. If we would have gotten some of those games, we'd be right
around .500.''
</P>
<P>
   Wishful thinking from Bradley, who said he would rather trade
his fine season for a few more victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately it doesn't matter how good a year I've had,''
Bradley said. ``Maybe it's part of a basis for growing, but we need
to figure out how to win more games, regardless of how good an
individual plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is glad Bradley has finally become a consistent factor on
the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he would play at this level for the rest of his career, I
would be happy,'' Nelson said. ``But I still think he'll continue
to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he feels good about his game, but I don't think he's
happy that we're not consistently winning. But I think he feels
good about where he's at during this time in his life.''

WHAT'S NEXT? BASEBALL LOOKS FOR A SEQUEL TO THE GREAT CHASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire hit his 70 home runs, and Sammy Sosa saluted
everybody in sight. The New York Yankees were compared to every
great team from the 1927 Yankees to the Taiwan Little League.
</P>
<P>
   When all the shouting was over and all the bows had been taken
last season, baseball officially declared itself cured in full from
the 1994-95 players strike, and the game could once again be
officially declared the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo, Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a magical year,'' McGwire said. ``It may never
happen again. Then again it might.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, how? What could baseball possibly do now to keep the
magic alive after such a special season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball needs to do this year what it needs to do every
year,'' Rangers president Tom Schieffer said. ``Keep the focus on
the game on the field and away from the economics. If that happens,
everybody prospers. If the focus is on the economics, then it hurts
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise words, no doubt, but since everybody has signed a contract
and the next labor negotiations are still a couple years away, then
it shouldn't be too hard to keep both eyes on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But toward what? What could happen this season that would
capture the nation's attention and serve as a fitting sequel to Big
Mac and Sammy Across America.
</P>
<P>
   Some possibilities are offered.
Rocket out of sight
Baseball has not had a 30-game winner since Denny McLain won 31 for
the Detroit Tigers in 1968. In this time of the five-man rotation,
it would seem almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Roger Clemens at his best on the best team in baseball,
the Yankees, and everything going right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what I could do with this team,'' Clemens said.
``I'm surrounded by a lot of great players.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' career high is 36 starts. McLain started 41 in 1968.
David Cone was 20-7 with a 3.58 earned-run average for the Yankees
last season. Clemens had a 1.98 ERA in winning 20 for the Toronto
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine what would happen if the Yankees scored 6.89 runs
per nine innings for Clemens as they did for Cone, or if he has
closer Mariano Rivera coming in after him instead of Robert
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   If Bob Welch can win 27 games for the 1990 Oakland Athletics
then surely Clemens ...
Triple for Junior
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey is still baseball's most glamorous player, and it's
time he did something Jordanian, like winning the Triple Crown.
Baseball hasn't had a player win his league's batting, home run and
runs batted in titles since Carl Yastrzemski did it for the Boston
Red Sox in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey has led the American League in home runs and RBI,
and his career best average is .327. A Triple Crown is not out of
the realm of possibility, and be assured, it would be watched with
a tremendous amount of excitement come September.
.400 hitter
Tony Gwynn has flirted with the .400 mark all through the decade,
finishing as high as .394 in 1994. He's now 39 and continually
bothered by a variety ailments, so his quest for .400 has probably
come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   There are other candidates:
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Larry Walker hit .366 in 1997 and .363 last season.
He plays in Coors Field, the ultimate hitter's park. He was 17 hits
short of .400 last season, which is less than one hit per week.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez is 23. He hit .358 in 1996,
then .300 in 1997 and .310 last season. With more maturity,
experience and knowledge, he could get really, really good.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud hit .363 for the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993 to lead
the American League in hitting. His batting average dipped under
.300 the next four seasons until he came back and hit .354 for the
Mets last season. Now he has Mike Piazza and Bobby Bonilla hitting
behind him, a great swing and great discipline at the plate. He
walked 96 times as opposed to 73 strikeouts last season.
3,000th Hit Parade
This one is going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Future Hall of Famers Wade Boggs, Cal Ripken and Tony Gwynn are
closing in on their 3,000th hit. Gwynn needs 72 hits, Boggs needs
78 and Ripken is 122 away. At least one and probably all three will
attain that special mark.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be as thrilling as 70 home runs, but the occasions
will give baseball the chance to salute three excellent players of
this generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do it, it's something you can sit back and be proud
of,'' Ripken said. ``It's a degree of success, a level of
achievement. It shows you've played a long time with some
success.'' \Nsubheds:New kids on the block Young talent always
excites fans with promise of greatness to come, and there are
plenty of nominees this season. Boston has outfielder Trot Nixon;
Detroit has outfielder Juan Encarnacion; Oakland is excited about
third baseman Eric Chavez, and the two best rookie pitching
prospects are probably San Diego's Matt Clement and Toronto's Roy
Halladay.
</P>
<P>
   But before the season is over, all eyes may be on the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the obvious. Outfielder J.D. Drew, a former Florida
State All-American, may be the most exciting young player to hit
the big leagues since Griffey Jr. He has great all-around talent
and was 15 for 36 in his short stay with St. Louis last September.
</P>
<P>
   This season he'll be playing full time and batting ahead of the
best power hitter in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the real thing,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   But also watch out for the Cardinals' 19-year-old lefthanded
pitcher Rich Ankiel, who was 12-6 with a 2.63 ERA in two short
seasons in Class A. He has also struck out 222 batters in 161
innings.
</P>
<P>
   He is considered the next truly dominant pitching prospect, and
the Cardinals may take a chance with him in the rotation, just as
the New York Mets did with Dwight Gooden in 1985. He is starting
the season in the minor leagues, but he may not stay there long.
Swinging for 71
How about another Great Home Run Chase? McGwire said it's foolish
to even think of such things now but who can resist, especially
after how much fun it was last season. But McGwire and Sosa are not
the only ones on the tout sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle is moving from the White Sox and pitcher-friendly
Comiskey Park to the Baltimore Orioles and Camden Yards, which has
the shortest (364 feet) left-field power alley in the majors. He's
already being mentioned as a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be tough to accomplish,'' Belle said. ``It's tough
enough just to hit 50. Everything has to go well from the start of
the season. But I'm sure it could be done. I'm sure McGwire could
do it again.''
Pennant race
</P>
<P>
   How could we forget this? Well, we did last season. The Rangers
and the Anaheim Angels had a pennant race that was overlooked by
almost everybody, and not many got caught up in the three-way chase
for the National League wild card.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of sizzling races to the end would certainly get
things stirred up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably see one or two pennant races, and that's the
real fun of baseball,'' Schieffer said. ``That's where the main
focus should be, then the individual records.''
</P>
<P>
   Some intriguing possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   NL East _ It's been a long time since the Atlanta Braves were
pushed during the regular season, but the New York Mets spent huge
wads of cash in the off-season to do just that. This could be a
terrific pennant race, and baseball in general does well when the
Mets have a good season.
</P>
<P>
   NL Central _ Houston, St. Louis, Cincinnati and the Cubs all
have legitimate shots.
</P>
<P>
   NL West _ The Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants
have one of the great rivalries in baseball. Now that the Dodgers
have taken on the role of Evil Empire, it would be fun to watch the
modest-spending Giants make them sweat out the summer.
</P>
<P>
   AL East _ How delicious would it be if someone _ either the
archrival Red Sox or the Rocket's old team, Toronto _ were to knock
off the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   AL West _ The Rangers, Angels and the Griffey-led Mariners could
slug it out all summer.
</P>
<P>
   AL Central _ This is a long shot, but what about Detroit, in the
final season of Tiger Stadium, mustering up enough pitching and,
after losing 97 games last season, knocking off the invincible
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the most exciting thing possible in this era of
widely disparate spending, a small-market team rising up and
knocking off one of the financial powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
   What a season that would make.  &LR; tagtop:T.R. Sullivan, (817)

SOME TEAMS FACING MUST-WIN SITUATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The season is here, and for some teams, the pressure will be
greater than usual. All teams need to win _ at least those whose
owners aren't hacking payroll and trading away stars _ but for some
there could be jobs on the line this season.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mets _ Their owners spent huge amounts of money on Mike
Piazza, Al Leiter, Bobby Bonilla, Robin Ventura, Rickey Henderson
and Orel Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Having done that, owner Nelson Doubleday said, ``Coming close is
not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine has done an admirable job in two full
seasons, but he must win something to keep his job, especially
after the Braves lost first baseman Andres Galarraga and closer
Kerry Ligtenberg. He'll get fired if they don't at least make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no goal to make the playoffs,'' said Valentine, who has
not made the playoffs in nine full seasons as a manager. ``I have a
goal to make the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Indians _ This has been a tremendous success story.
Now all that's missing is a World Series title, and it hangs over
everybody associated with the team. The Indians are still the
Yankees' toughest competition, if they can keep from falling asleep
in the watered-down American League Central. Last season, manager
Mike Hargrove said there were times when the Indians coasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to get to the World Series, and to do it, we will
have to get past the Yankees,'' first baseman Jim Thome said. ``To
do that, we've got to get to the point where we play at the same
level all season. We've got to stay away from those long stretches
where we don't play fundamentally well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers _ They've annoyed everybody, first by
signing Kevin Brown, then by having general manager Kevin Malone
jokingly predict a Dodgers-Yankees World Series.
</P>
<P>
   With faced with all the criticism, Malone said, ``We didn't
realize people would be so jealous and envious.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, everybody wants to beat the Dodgers this season.
</P>
<P>
   AL West _ It's very simple. All four managers in this division _
Johnny Oates, Seattle's Lou Piniella, Anaheim's Terry Collins and
Oakland's Art Howe _ could get fired if they don't meet certain
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is they're all good managers. ... but only one can
win the division.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds _ Denny Neagle's shoulder is ailing, and there
is no suitable replacement. General manager Jim Bowden's admirable
attempt at respectability is already in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks _ They believe in their hearts they can
with strong starting pitching and a mediocre lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs _ They could have won a division title with Kerry
Wood. Now, they once again find themselves scrambling. They could
also get crushed by free agency after the season with Steve
Trachsel, Kevin Tapani and Mark Grace among those eligible.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON TOM KELLY
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's good, but his ways are harming young Twins
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins have an excellent manager. They still
desperately need a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly was superb when he had a veteran ballclub that knew
how to play the game. But those years are long past, and Kelly has
not been good working with the Twins' young players. Kelly is too
demanding and too impatient, and way too many of the Twins'
prospects have faltered under his withering glare.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Twins sold former No. 1 pick Dan Serafini to the
Cubs and sent down pitcher Frank Rodriguez and first baseman David
Ortiz, just three more talented young players who failed to make it
in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Twins could start the season with five rookies in the
lineup _ shortstop Cristian Guzman, first baseman Doug
Mientkiewicz, third baseman Cory Koskie, left fielder Chad Allen
and center fielder Torii Hunter _ and two in the rotation, Benji
Sampson and Mike Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is not the manager you want for that kind of team.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't alone. Tony LaRussa had problems in Oakland when the
Athletics tried to rebuild, and Jim Leyland, after three division
titles in 1990-92, became overly frustrated after the Pirates had
to start over.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-successful managers just have a hard time accepting it's
time to start over. At some point, the Twins will need to make a
change. \Nsubheds:Royal flush The Kansas City Royals had a winning
record this spring, but don't expect that to continue into the
regular season. The sad part is the Royals could have been in much
better shape with a little more vision.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, the Royals let Chili Davis, Jay Bell,
Jose Offerman and Dean Palmer slip away as free agents instead of
trying to get something back in a midseason trade. If they could
have traded each one for one good prospect, plus do the same with
Kevin Appier, Jeff Montgomery and Jeff King, their rebuilding
program would be off to a great start.
</P>
<P>
   There is still some talent there, most notably outfielders
Carlos Beltran and Jeremy Giambi. But the Royals missed a great
opportunity for a speedier recovery.
\Nsubheds:Short hops
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth: Stats Inc. has devised a formula to rate
infielders' range. Its formula shows that Mark McLemore was
second-best among major-league second baseman the past three years,
and Royce Clayton was third among shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a spring makes. Six weeks ago, the Braves were
loving left-handed pitcher Bruce Chen, and the Pirates were down on
Kris Benson, a former No. 1 pick. Now Chen is the one who was
demoted to their minors, instead of being the Braves' next pitching
prodigy, and Benson has cracked the Pirates' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   With Jeff Frye playing at second base for most of the 1997
season, the Red Sox turned a league-leading 179 double plays. Last
season, with Frye on the disabled list for the entire season, the
Sox were last in the American League with 128 double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Curtis Goodwin, on going from the Cubs to the
Rockies: ``Coors Field was a little too yuppie for me. Everybody
has way too much money in that place. ... Wrigley Field is more of
a baseball crowd. They know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds outfielder Dmitri Young dyed his hair yellow because he was
tired of being mistaken for Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers announced they have sold one million tickets, so they
are assured of the American League-record 35th consecutive season
of one million-plus in home attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners are looking good on their Randy Johnson
trade. Carlos Guillen is their starting second baseman, Freddie
Garcia is in the rotation and John Halama is in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much good in the Phillies' camp, but closer Jeff
Brantley has had a great spring and appears over his 1997 shoulder
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners pitcher Jose Mesa on Garth Brooks: ``I bought one of
his CDs in 1993, and it had some good songs. I was hoping I'd face
him, maybe hit him right here \Rthe rib cage\S. He wants to know
what it's like playing up here? I could show him. It's nothing
personal.''
</P>

JORDAN COULD SAVE HORNETS FROM SHINN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   April's Fool: Fox Sports anchor Keith Olbermann. Despite
Olbermann's erroneous ``scoop'' last week, Michael Jordan isn't
again ``un-retiring'' to play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   It's something much bigger, much better, more believable.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is coming back to own the Charlotte Hornets, and, in
doing so, to again own the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan can't legally own and play at the same time, his
rise to ownership is a perfect scenario for him, Hornets owner
George Shinn and the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn: Because of an impending divorce and a sexual-assault
lawsuit that have burdened him with shallow pockets and a
horrendous image, he needs a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Seems he'll give up majority control for around $150 million. In
doing so, he brings in a closer on Charlotte's new arena deal. The
Hornets are the only NBA team without either a new arena or firm
plans to build one, but that changes with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that his involvement would make \Ra new arena\S a
lot more likely,'' said attorney John Fennebresque, who heads
Charlotte's arena committee and who met with Jordan at his New York
restaurant recently. ``I said we need money and we need your
stature. He is very interested. He loves North Carolina. He
wouldn't move here, but he would spend a significant amount of time
here. He wants to be very involved in the management of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan rides in on his white horse, Shinn quietly moves to
Florida, saving around $7 million in taxes on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   NBA: Commissioner David Stern acknowledges sparking the
Jordan-as-owner negotiations. If it works, it's another Stern coup.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn, a penny-pincher who wouldn't pay to keep stars like
Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson or Glen Rice, would be replaced by
Jordan, who would give the NBA an incredibly popular minority as an
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be super because we need more black owners, and
there has never been one of real significance yet,'' said Houston's
Charles Barkley. ``We need more black coaches, too. Black coaches
are like UFOs. You have sightings of them every now and then. Black
owners are even more rare. But few blacks have that kind of money.
Thank goodness Michael does.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan: The immediate thirst he would quench for himself is
being involved in basketball day-to-day, something he sorely
misses. And is there really any question how successful he would
be?
</P>
<P>
   Think of agent David Falk as his general manager, former North
Carolina coach Dean Smith and Nike chairman Phil Knight on his
advisory board and former players like Buck Williams as minority
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the things that Michael has done for the NBA, that
would be a fitting scenario for him now,'' said Houston's Eddie
Johnson. ``I knew he would not be able to stay retired from
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, if former teammate Luc Longley is right, maybe we're putting
way too much thought into this: ``Michael must be having trouble
finding ways to spend his money. We should all be so bored.''
SPOTLIGHT ON ... DENNIS RODMAN
Zany behavior hitting Rodman in the wallet
</P>
<P>
   The worm continues to turn, down.
</P>
<P>
   First comes the revelation that Rodman has made bad decisions
costing him as much as $13 million since the lockout ended.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to become his own agent, fired agent Dwight Manley
and then retired, moving the Bulls to renounce their rights to him
and thus void his Larry Bird exception where teams could go over
the salary cap to pay him. A league source says the Miami Heat was
willing to guarantee Rodman $5 million in the first year of a
two-year deal with an option on the second. (Instead, Rodman signed
a one-year contract with the Lakers for a pro-rated salary of
$500,000.) Two weeks ago, Converse voided his endorsement contract
because he had violated certain provisions in the deal and
conducted himself in a manner where they could not rely on him. The
deal would have paid him $3 million this season and a potential $5
million next season in its last year. That's a total of $13 million
and this excludes whatever gaming debts he has in Las Vegas, where
he is rumored to be some $200,000 in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes his most recent behavior with the Lakers: he refused
to re-enter a loss to the Kings, showed up late for the next
morning's practice and then held a 30-minute, clear-the-air meeting
with coach Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like we got some things straight, like how it's
important to be on time and come to practice,'' said Rambis. ``We
tried to emphasize how important he is. But with him, you'll never
really know if it got through.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
Around the East
</P>
<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino fired back at the talk-show critics
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 4] percent of the people who don't work for a living and
call those shows, I'm not concerned about them,'' he said. ``What
the Fellowship of the Miserable \Rtalk-show callers\S doesn't
understand is that we're a second-year team.'' ./././.Despite his
team languishing near the bottom of the East, Bulls owner Jerry
Reinsdorf is anything but disappointed: ``I think Tim Floyd should
be coach of the year.'' ... When Reggie Miller wins in New York, he
grabs the microphone and answers questions for hours after the
game. When he loses there, such as last week, he stoops to the
cowardly low of issuing a statement for reporters. \Nsubheds:Best
and worst Worst coach I: Jim Cleamons did such a good job in Dallas
that his next two employers have been the defunct women's ABL and a
college All-Star team that will play the Harlem Globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   Worst coach II: Seattle's Paul Westphal is coming under severe
criticism from players for not running plays for the team's best
pure shooter, Hersey Hawkins. In their eight-point loss in San
Antonio, Hawkins took only three shots while center Olden Polynice
launched 11.
\Nsubheds:Around the West
</P>
<P>
   Cleamons' record in 98 games in Dallas was 28-70, two games
better than Don Nelson in his first 98. Nelson now readily, humbly
acknowledges that drafting Dirk Nowitzki was a mistake. ``I did a
great disservice to Dirk \Rby touting him as Rookie of the
Year\S,'' said Nelson. ... The most shocking score of the season
occurred March 27 in Anaheim: Clippers 103, Jazz 77. But the
strangeness went deeper. The game marked the first time in 12 years
that John Stockton and Karl Malone were each held under 10 points
in the same game. ... Injury of the season goes to Phoenix's Rex
Chapman, on the injured list with ``turf toe.'' ... It was a solid
week for Portland's Isaiah Rider, who was suspended by the league
for one game for going into the stands at Golden State, received
his second multiviolation traffic stop in five weeks, got sued by
the Detroit fan he spit on during a game last season and missed one
practice.
\Nsubheds:Numbers Game

First it was the lockout, decidedly won by the owners. Now, it's

spoof of overweight Kings center Oliver Miller, Billy Hunter and
the players' association sided with Miller, calling the Gorilla,

DOCTOR ALLIANCE COULD RESTORE LOCAL CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ For scores of local physicians, the
bankruptcy last month of Long Beach-based MedPartners Provider
Network proved to be a financial and administrative nightmare,
leaving some to wonder if and when their next paycheck would
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But for Dr. Marvin Kanter, the firm's woes represent a
potentially lucrative opportunity. Having recently extricated his
own Agoura Hills physician group from MedPartners' parent, Kanter
and three partners hope now to annex some of the struggling
company's other local group practices, creating in the process a
regional physician-management powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It's terrain others have traveled and stumbled on, but Kanter
and company are convinced they are positioned for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen this whole industry and the way it's changed,''
Kanter said of the group in Agoura Hills, northwest of Los Angeles.
``It's not as bad as everyone paints it.''
</P>
<P>
   Working in his favor is that Kanter has made a career of turning
adversity to advantage. In the late 1970s, when other doctors were
bristling at what looked to be a disenfranchising new way to
finance medicine, the Los Angeles pediatrician embraced managed
care by starting his own physician group to negotiate top rates
from insurers like Blue Cross, Health Net and PacifiCare.
</P>
<P>
   As HMOs grew, so did Kanter's Community Medical Group, expanding
from a handful of doctors and 100 patients, to nearly 150 primary
care and specialty physicians treating 50,000 enrollees in Simi
Valley and Thousand Oaks, in Ventura County, and Agoura Hills, West
Hills and Tarzana in L.A. County.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when industry consolidation pushed many smaller players
out of business and cleared the way for a few large management
firms to buy up practices across the nation, Kanter sold to one of
the biggest, MedPartners, grossing roughly $25 million and
retaining an executive position with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many doctors considered companies like MedPartners
_ whose parent company is based in Alabama _ to be a godsend,
allowing them to give up fiduciary responsibility while still
practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world was changing and we thought MedPartners was the way
to go,'' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship was not meant to be, however, and Kanter's
biggest coup came in December when he and his partners bought their
business back from MedPartners at a significant discount, missing
by days a retroactive bankruptcy filing forced on the Long
Beach-based division by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Despite operating the largest physician network in the state,
one caring for more than 3 million health plan enrollees at its
peak, MedPartners hemorrhaged money. A routine audit, followed by a
closer examination of the company's books last month, revealed
finances so shaky the state Department of Corporations seized the
firm's administrative wing and immediately filed for bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Kanter tell it, the decision to get out of MedPartners
early was a no-brainer. ``MedPartners was in disarray,'' he said.
``I was worried about where things were going and thought the group
would be better off, both for the doctors and for patient care, if
we re-engineered our identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now free from the corporate yoke, Kanter and his partners are
working to stabilize their own physician ranks before embarking on
an expansion plan that they expect will double the company's size
by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are the dominant player in the West Valley,''
Kanter said. ``We will be more dominant in the whole Valley, and
other parts of L.A. as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to the strategy is attracting new physician group practices,
and that's where MedPartners may prove useful to Kanter a third and
final time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state stepped in, MedPartners has declared full
retreat in California, voicing its intent to unload practices
either back to physicians or to outside investors. ``We've made it
public we're looking to sell,'' said MedPartners spokesman Robert
Mead.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with a recent slump in market prices for medical
practices, that anxiousness to leave could push MedPartners to sell
off its practices at a discount. The best of those practices in the
San Fernando Valley, and eventually Greater Los Angeles, would then
be potential targets for Kanter's clan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner of Progressive Health Care Systems _ an
administrative entity created in the buy-back of Community Medical
_ the company expects to double its physician and enrollee ranks by
the end of 1999. But instead of buying MedPartners' practices, they
hope to convince the new owners to buy into Progressive.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for a one-time fee and a sliver of future billings,
Progressive would manage the practices' paperwork, coordinate
standards of care and negotiate contracts for the physician groups
with health plans and hospitals. Progressive said it would also
connect practices through a corporate intranet, allowing for online
referrals and consultations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to manage physicians, not own them,'' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be some support for the concept and similar
groups are starting to crop up elsewhere in the state. Riverside
Medical Clinic, a 90-physician practice in Riverside County, was in
the process of buying itself back from MedPartners when the state
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally we felt bigger was better, but we've seen that
local systems probably work better because they're more responsive
to the community,'' said Riverside Chairman Dr. Steven Larson.
``The era of big, roll-up physician practice management companies
is over. They don't add value.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson said it is unclear how big groups such as his own and
Kanter's can grow before they reach their own points of diminishing
returns, but ``certainly MedPartners passed that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson said he expects Riverside to close its acquisition within
another month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Others voice similar support for physicians regaining their
practices, but warn that independence is not a cure-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these physicians can buy their practices back and regain
control, we think that's a good thing,'' said Elizabeth McNeal,
vice president of medical policy for the California Medical
Association. But a bad partner can be nearly as damaging to a
practice as a bad owner, McNeal said, and execution will be key to
the success of groups like Progressive and Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the biggest concern, Kanter believes, Progressive
should thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progressive is going to be a physician-oriented company,'' he
said. ``We're going to try to create the right incentives for
physicians to want to work with us here. We know we've got to be
very careful how we re-create managed care going forward and our
bent is to pay attention to the details and do it right.''

SECOND PLACE IS NOT FIRST LOSER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Youth and sports.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always about winning.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of it.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is how I see it.
</P>
<P>
   Who am I you ask? I'm Jesse Sanchez, the new ``Hometown Star''
sports guy.
</P>
<P>
   I've been with the ``Star-Telegram'' sports department for a
couple of years covering everything from youth basketball to
professional boxing. I've seen athletes jump for joy at half court
after hitting a game-winning shot, and others weep in the middle of
the ring after losing a close bout. I've seen a young girl throw
her tennis racket down in disgust, and a young man stomp on home
plate after a home run like he just won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   I have not seen it all, but I've seen enough to recognize the
exhilaration of winning and the disappointment of losing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outcome, sports continues to provide great
experiences for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   I've been fortunate enough to witness several events permanently
etched in the memories of children and parents.
</P>
<P>
   I'm very lucky.
</P>
<P>
   I'm privileged, and I know it.
</P>
<P>
   Youth and sports are a special combination, and I am glad to be
a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than just running the fastest, hitting home runs, and
throwing harder than anyone else. There are no shoe endorsements on
the line, nobody kicks cameras, and besides an irate parent
blurting out a profanity here and there, it's still pretty
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   It's supposed to be. They're just young people having fun.
</P>
<P>
   As a former all-district high school player, golfer wannabe, and
recalling past experiences with professional athletes, I know
sports sometimes loses its fun.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't with children. The bottom line is not always
winning, but the lessons learned by competition.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way I see it.
</P>
<P>
   If you agree or disagree, don't hesitate to contact me.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be here for awhile, so give me a call, or send me a fax. I
am honest enough to give credit where credit is due, but I also
realize that the brightest star is not always the first one in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   I believe all children are special, even if they don't have 10
first-place trophies.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe second place is first loser.
</P>
<P>
   Children will have plenty of time to worry about all that kind
of stuff when they grow older. Now it's time to have fun and play.
</P>
<P>
   It's something I won't forget and will always keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   That's another beautiful thing about youth and sports.
</P>
<P>
   There are no real losers.
</P>
<P>
   Except for maybe the father who won't leave the coach alone.
</P>
<P>
   But even he's borderline.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way I see it.

CONE'S DRIVE KNOCKS OUT PEREZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Dodgers pitcher Carlos Perez could probably name a
hundred guys, maybe five hundred, who have the ability of knocking
him out of a game with a batted ball.
</P>
<P>
   But David Cone?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was Cone, the Yankees pitcher, who drilled
Perez with a line drive in the Dodgers' 5-4 exhibition victory
Saturday night in front of a paid attendance of 42,685 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cone hasn't batted regularly since the 1992 season with the
Mets. But Perez, a left-hander, couldn't get out of the way of his
hard-hit liner in the fourth inning and was struck on the right
elbow. Perez left the game and the injury was diagnosed as a
bruise. He is listed day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coney is a pretty good hitter, but he's not that good,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad ending to an ineffective outing by Perez, the
Dodgers' No. 4 starter. He gave up seven hits, including two to
Cone, and walked two in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos is all right. I don't think it will set him back. He's
going to be sore tomorrow,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez finished the spring with an 0-1 record and 5.72 ERA. Kevin
Brown, Ismael Valdes and Chan Ho Park, the Dodgers' top three
starters, were 11-2 this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's injury was the only dramatic moment in an otherwise
nostalgic, and chilly, evening filled with tributes to the
Yankees-Dodgers' storied rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers senior vice president Tommy Lasorda (who else?) got into
the act before the first pitch when he and Don Zimmer, the Yankees'
interim manager who was a Brooklyn Dodger in the 1950s, exchanged
barbs in a pre-game ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the Yankees will beat the Dodgers in the World
Series,'' Zimmer said, eliciting boos and catcalls.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Lasorda took the microphone and described the
Dodgers' beating New York in the 1981 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kicked the Yankees' butts like they had never been kicked
before,'' he said, and the crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the stars shone in the matchup between what many
people consider the two most talented teams in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi hit a two-run homer, his fifth of the spring, off
Cone in the third. Devon White, the Dodgers' new center fielder,
had three hits.
</P>
<P>
   For the Yankees, all-star second baseman Chuck Knoblauch led off
the game with a triple and scored on Derek Jeter's single. Jeter
also hit a 455-foot homer off Alan Mills to lead off the fifth that
gave the Yankees a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging rights will have to wait until today, when the teams
play again at 1:10 p.m. By the sixth, when both managers pulled out
most of their starters, the game was tied 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley caught his second consecutive game for the Dodgers
and went 0 for 3 before coming out after five innings. Hundley, who
played sparingly this spring, caught a season-high eight innings
against Anaheim on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's replacement, rookie Paul LoDuca, gave the Dodgers a
5-4 lead in the sixth with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw picked up his fourth save of the spring with a
scoreless ninth and the Dodgers improved to 20-9-1. Their best
spring record _ 21-11 _ was accomplished in 1988, the year they won
the World Series. &QL;

LAKERS OUT OF STEP IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Just a little more than a quarter into the game,
Lakers point guard Derek Harper took a step off the court, and
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Friday the 13th or something,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's contest was billed as '80s Night at the Forum, but
Harper wasn't referring to the decade's most famous series of
slasher movies. He was merely exasperated over the Lakers' oddly
sluggish showing against the lowly Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Lakers wouldn't have minded using Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Jamaal Wilkes, Michael Cooper or any of
the other 80's legends honored at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Lakers certainly seemed to be in a time warp, playing in
an offensive funk throughout their 81-76 loss to the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   There was one semblance of normalcy. Dennis Rodman received a
pair of technical fouls with two minutes remaining for arguing a
foul and was ejected from the game, proving the Lakers' performance
wasn't completely abnormal.
</P>
<P>
   How bad were they? The Lakers shot 28.6 percent in the first
half, making 12 of 42 shots. Kobe Bryant was 1 for 8. Derek Harper
was 2 for 8.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-point shooting was nonexistent, as they went 1 for 9 in
the first half, with designated sharpshooter Glen Rice 0 for 3.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox shot an air ball. Rice shot an air ball. Everyone else
just missed shots the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were nearly as bad from the free-throw line, making
11 of 21 attempts (52.4 percent). Shaquille O'Neal was 2 for 9,
which probably is the reason coach Kurt Rambis had him on the bench
at the end of the Phoenix game on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, the Lakers (22-12) shot an abysmal 35 percent from
the field, and 57 percent from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Warriors (14-18) weren't close to being as cold,
and that was the difference. Golden State shot 47.5 percent from
the field, which enabled them to take a 47-36 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably something that the Lakers were even as close as
they were at the break. But Golden State quickly scored the first
six points of the third quarter to stretch the lead to 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the Lakers were in major catch-up mode.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neal picked up his fourth foul with 4:57 left in the
third quarter, the situation appeared fairly dire.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did manage to cut the lead to 12 points, 65-53, after
three quarters, but there was still a light smattering of boos
inside the Forum. By then, the Lakers had also raised their
shooting all the way up to 32.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant (4 for 12) and Rice (4 for 11) were still struggling.
O'Neal (7 for 12) was the only Laker shooting better than 50
percent entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And their 53 points was a new season-low after three quarters,
eclipsing the previous record of 54.
</P>
<P>
   A semblance of a comeback finally began when Bryant converted
two free throws to start the fourth quarter, drawing the Lakers
within 10 points (65-55) for the first time since the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's jump shot brought the Lakers within eight (67-59) and
Derek Fisher's 3-pointer closed the gap to 67-61 with 7:40 left.
John Starks followed up with the Warriors' own air ball on a
3-pointer, and Bryant slashed his way inside to cut the lead to
67-63.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's eight-footer brought the Lakers with two (69-67), and
suddenly it was the Warriors who had turned cold, scoring just four
points in the first eight minutes of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it appeared the Lakers were going to apply the finishing
touch, the Warriors got back-to-back baskets from Terry Cummings
and Bimbo Coles to stretch their advantage back to six points.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Rodman's technicals, and the Warriors were able to
maintain their lead. The Lakers never got any closer than two
points the rest of the way.

EDMONDS MIGHT GO ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Jim Edmonds' health may answer the Angels' question
of what to do with four outfielders, at least for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' strained right groin was feeling better Saturday, but
his status for opening day on Tuesday is still in question. Manager
Terry Collins said he might use Edmonds as the designated hitter,
but it's more likely Edmonds will begin the season on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds last played in a game on Monday, meaning he'd be
eligible to come off the DL on April 14 -- after missing the first
eight games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, however, hasn't ruled out a starting in center field on
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get ready for Tuesday, that's all I'm
concerned about, Edmonds said. ``As far as I know I'm supposed to
be in the lineup on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, though, knows he can be patient considering the club's
abundance in the outfield, even if it means going to the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to do something else, I'll deal with that, he said.
``We've got more than enough guys to play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley, hit by a line drive on his left triceps muscle
Wednesday, will start today against Cal State Fullerton and is
scheduled to go five innings. He is slated to make his first start
of the season Friday in Texas against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Finley's counterpart today will be teammate Omar Olivares, who
will start for the Titans and go five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mike Magnante sustained a cut on the index finger of
his left (pitching) hand while opening a moving box after returning
from Arizona. The wound required three stitches to close, but
trainer Ned Bergert said Magnante will be ready by opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene was originally in Saturday's starting lineup at
catcher, but was a late scratch. He was replaced by Steve Decker.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Mo Vaughn didn't hit a home run in Arizona all
spring, but he hit one against the Dodgers Friday at Edison Field
and hit another Saturday night against Aguascalientes of the
Mexican League in the Angels' 5-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like playing in a major league ballpark,
Vaughn said, adding that every game in Arizona was played during
the day while the past two games were played at night. ``I feel
good in the day, but I hate day games.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also said he doesn't get carried away with spring
training stats. But now that the season is just days away, it's
time to turn it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close to game time, it's totally different, he said.
``When it gets for real you turn it up another notch.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad also homered for the Angels Saturday. Angels
starter Steve Sparks went four innings, allowing two runs and four
hits, including a home run by Ruben Avila.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 24,954 was pro-Aguascalientes, not unlike the
crowds at Edison Field when East Coast teams are in town.
</P>
<P>
   Because the major league baseball season officially begins
tonight, all clubs were required to trim their rosters to 25 by
Saturday night. The Angels are expected to announce the moves
today.
</P>
<P>
   The final roster spot among position players comes down to
either Chris Pritchett or Tim Unroe. With Edmonds likely to start
the season on the DL, Collins will probably go with 12 pitchers.
Ten pitchers are in, with the final two spots to be filled from the
following group: Al Levine, Scott Schoeneweis, Toby Borland and
Mike Fyhrie. Levine and Schoeneweis are expected to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Aguascalientes reminded Collins of his days as a manager
in the winter league. He managed in Mexico, Venezuela, the
Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one night in Mexico when a player from an opposing
team got into an argument with an umpire and began shoving the ump.
Things started getting out of hand, so the stadium lights were
turned off and the teams were told to leave. Collins protested the
game but was surprised to learn the procedure of filing a protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to write a letter to the ump and give him money -- 1,500
pesos, Collins said. ``Then they resumed the game and the player
who was pushing the ump was still in the game.

REMAINS OF WOMAN FOUND IN FOREST IDENTIFIED AS JAPANESE HOSTESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The skeletal remains of a woman found in the
Angeles National Forest nearly two years ago have finally been
identified as those of a Little Tokyo nightclub hostess.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's detectives said Saturday that she is Kumi Kojima, a
28-year-old Japanese national who was living in the United States
on a student visa. But now that they know who she is, investigators
have even more of a mystery on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Jane Doe is believed to have been the girlfriend of
one of Los Angeles' most powerful real estate executives, who
committed suicide three months ago after a Japanese magazine
published a story about the woman's disappearance. The case was
also strange because Kojima's parents didn't report her missing
until Feb. 28 of this year, nearly two years after her body was
found, said Sgt. Richard Longshore, the Sheriff's Department
detective who has been trying to identify Kojima since her remains
were discovered on April 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had this feeling that there was more to it than just
some bones out there,'' Longshore said.
</P>
<P>
   Kojima's death has not even been labeled a homicide. Because the
Los Angeles County coroner was unable to determine how Kojima died,
the case is being investigated as a ``suspicious death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big puzzle with a lot of the pieces missing,''
Longshore said.
</P>
<P>
   Kojima had been the girlfriend of Kiichiro Kobayashi, a top
executive at Shuwa Investment Corp., a Japanese-owned company that
invested heavily in U.S. properties in the 1980s. In Los Angeles,
Shuwa owns the Arco Plaza and The Gas Co. building in downtown Los
Angeles, several Century City office buildings and an office tower
on Brand Boulevard in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a Japanese magazine did a series of articles on
Kojima's mysterious disappearance and her relationship with
Kobayashi. On Jan. 28, shortly after publication of the articles,
Kobayashi committed suicide in San Benito County by hanging
himself, Longshore said.
</P>
<P>
   Longshore said detectives are investigating whether Kobayashi
might have been involved in Kojima's death but are not jumping to
any conclusions in the complicated case.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may have had that boyfriend, but she may have also had
other boyfriends,'' Longshore said.
</P>
<P>
   Kojima's skull was found in April 1997 by a woman hiking on a
switchback trail near Little Tujunga Road, several miles northeast
of Lake View Terrace. Kojima's body parts were strewn across 300
yards of the mountain area, but detectives are unsure if her body
was torn apart in the killing or by animals and inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the body was just tossed off the side of the road.
She was only 105 pounds,'' Longshore said. ``There's no easy
explanation for how she ended up where she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Longshore estimated the body had been out in the forest north of
Los Angeles for about a year before it was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a woman who has been dead for three years,
and now we're trying to reconstruct the details of the last year of
her life,'' Longshore said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was also complicated because police in Los
Angeles weren't even looking for Kojima. Longshore said her parents
did not report her missing to the Los Angeles Police Department
until Feb. 28 of this year, 22 months after her body was found.
</P>
<P>
   But Longshore said Kojima was a world traveler and that the
parents had been assured by her associates that she was fine and
traveling in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did everything reasonable in their power to find her,''
Longshore said. The Associated Press said Saturday that the
Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported that the woman's parents
tried to get Los Angeles police to conduct a search for Kojima in
1996 after she suddenly stopped contacting them. They told the
newspaper that the police refused to accept their missing person's
report because Kojima was not a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quotes Kojima's family as saying they were told:
``She is not a child, and it is possible she is hiding her
whereabouts out of her own will. There must be a lot of cases of
runaways even in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Kojima's body was positively identified using dental records on
March 9. Longshore disclosed her identity Saturday because of
inquiries from Japanese-language media in Los Angeles and in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Michiya Hibino, a producer for Tokyo Broadcasting System, was
one of several journalists chasing the story Saturday. He said the
Japanese magazine Shukun Bunshun published three articles on Kojima
and Kobayashi. The first was about their relationship and her
disappearance, the second was an interview with Kobayashi and the
third detailed Kobayashi's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Shuwa Corp. could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   While Shuwa was a major player in the Asian real estate buying
spree in the 1980s, the recent economic crisis in Asia forced Shuwa
to place many of its local holdings on the market. In October, the
Arco Building, its two Century City office buildings, the Glendale
building and other properties were put up for sale for $2 billion.

BRUINS ZERO IN ON DEPLETED FLYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Outshot and losing the little battles in the corners to
the Flyers through much of the opening period, the Bruins got their
act together Saturday afternoon at the FleetCenter, with Medford's
Shawn Bates and goalie Byron Dafoe taking center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, up for his second tour of duty this season, used his
great speed to finish off two scoring plays as well as the
undermanned Flyers. Dafoe, meanwhile, took over the NHL shutout
lead with a 24-save performance that put the exclamation point on
the Bruins' 3-0 victory before 17,565, moving Boston into a tie
with Buffalo for seventh place in the Eastern Conference with 81
points and giving the Bruins a 9-point bulge over the New York
Rangers and Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers took the ice minus four of their top players _
captain Eric Lindros (collapsed lung), wings John LeClair (back)
and Mark Recchi (concussion) and defenseman Eric Desjardins (knee).
</P>
<P>
   That's a total of 106 goals out of the lineup, including 40 from
Lindros and 39 from LeClair, and it showed in Philadelphia's lack
of a finishing touch around Dafoe's net and a patchwork power play
that came up empty in three tries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Dafoe was trying to preserve the shutout and saw
teammate Jason Allison assessed a a major penalty for hitting Steve
Duchesne from behind with 3:28 to play, he said he felt fortunate
that most of the Flyers' big guns weren't there to spoil it on the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had their hands full in the first period. They were
outshot, 9-1, through the first 12 minutes but came out of the
period ahead a goal, thanks to a nifty Dmitri Khristich feed to
Sergei Samsonov, who threw one fake at goalie John Vanbiesbrouck
and slipped a shot between his legs at the 16:20 mark for his 23d
of the season, one better than his Rookie of the Year campaign of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out some pretty important skill players,'' said
Bruins coach Pat Burns. ``We knew the simplest game plan they would
have would be to put it in our end and chasing it down. They did
that early and it took us a while for us to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they adapted, it was a fairly smooth ride for the Bruins,
who are 5-1-3 in their last nine games with seven to play.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a fun ride for Bates, the former Boston University
star who did not dress for last Thursday's 3-2 victory in Montreal
and was recalled from Providence March 26 after an American Hockey
League stay of nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, after Khristich kept the puck alive in the Flyers' zone,
swooped behind the net, eluded the check of Rod Brind'Amour, and
stuffed one under the Beezer's pads at 8:58 of the middle period.
</P>
<P>
   Bates's fifth of the season and the Bruins' final goal was set
up by Anson Carter at the six-minute mark of the third. Carter,
from the faceoff circle, threaded the needle with a cross-ice pass
to Bates, who flipped a backhand shot to the top corner before the
goalie could react.
</P>
<P>
   The two goals were a nice birthday present for Bates, who
celebrated his 24th in style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows my role on this team as a fourth-line center,''
said Bates. ``Anytime I can get the opportunity to get out there, I
want to make the best of it. Today, I got a few opportunities and I
made the best of them. It's just a matter of coming to the rink and
being focused mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to the net, good things can happen and each game
you play and goal you get in the National Hockey League is a
confidence-builder.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the Bruins had upped their margin to four midway
through the third after Bates wheeled in the offensive zone and
dished to Samsonov, who blasted a 25-footer past Vanbiesbrouck, but
the replay resulted in a waveoff because Khristich's big toe was in
the crease _ it was that marginal.
</P>
<P>
   The only suspense the rest of the way was whether the Bruins and
Dafoe would post the shutout, enabling Lord Byron to become the
first Bruins netminder to record nine since Hall of Famer Terry
Sawchuk did it 43 seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who dodged a bullet early in the third when Daymond
Langkow's rebound flip sailed over the crossbar with Dafoe trying
to get back into position, had to weather a brief six-on-four with
Allison out of the game and Vanbiesbrouck pulled for an extra
skater.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure was off when the Flyers' Sandy McCarthy got
tangled with Kyle McLaren in front of Dafoe, who tripped over
McCarthy's skate. McCarthy was called for interference and roughing
at 18:49, despite protesting, and the shutout was never in jeopardy
for the last 71 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they'd come out hard, but the bottom line,'' said
Dafoe, ``was we had to play our own game and not worry so much
about them. We had to take it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   When they did, the wounded Flyers never had a chance.

BRITAIN REDOUBLES EFFORTS TO STAY ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England _ Maybe you have a tennis racket and the
urge to travel. Why not call US captain Tom Gullikson and volunteer
to play Davis Cup doubles for your country? You can't do any worse
than most of the revolving-door recent pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday another stapled-together entry, Alex O'Brien and Todd
Martin, went down to the usual US defeat, though the journey was
thrilling and crammed with scintillating points _ and enough noise
to awaken the dead. In fact, the clamor of 9,400 witnesses (about
99 percent native) stuffing the National Indoor Center did awaken
Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, the homeys who'd been left for
embalmed Friday afternoon as the United States piled up a 2-0 lead
in the best-of-five World Group first-round series against Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Solo, Henman and Rusedski had each hit numerous sour notes and
were given the hook, respectively, by Jim Courier and Martin. But
in concert they found the lost chord. They got the crowd singing a
soccer song, ``Here We Go!'' while keeping the US from a series
clinch with a 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 win in an intense
struggle of 3 hours 16 minutes. Now Britain trails, 2-1, and it's
sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly all of Britain was breathing again, sniffing the heady
air of a real revival meeting that could end _ hallelujah! _ in
victory after all. Yes, after Saturday's gloomy headlines screeched
``BRITISH DISASTER,'' the Britons are back in it. To win, they need
Henman to overcome Martin and Rusedski to overturn Courier this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's even money now, and we're gonna do it,'' crowed British
captain David Lloyd. His odds on a rarity seem appropriate. Britain
has resuscitated itself from 0-2 only once, against Germany in
1930. But the US has blown 2-0 leads thrice: 1939 final to
Australia, and semifinals to Italy in 1960 and Sweden in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for one point Sunday, that's all,'' said
Gullikson. ``Either Todd or Jim will get it. I thought we'd get it
today.''
</P>
<P>
   But would Gully have bet his house (or even his daughter's doll
house?) on the doubles, a US catastrophe area of alarming
proportions? During his six-year captaincy, Gullikson has resembled
a frustrated Thomas Edison trying all sorts of materials to get his
light bulb functioning. Martin and O'Brien were his 12th
combination, and nothing glows yet. Under Gullikson, the US is 7-10
in doubles, and the wins were over guys unknown beyond their
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if two Americans stuck together and played
the circuit,'' Gullikson said, ``but it doesn't happen anymore.
Maybe the Bryan twins, Mike and Bob (1998 NCAA champs for
Stanford), will be the answer in a year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's answer was previously announced to be O'Brien and
Courier. But at a team meeting Gullikson decided that Courier, who
had expended five sets and more than four hours in beating Henman,
ought to be rested for Sunday's possible fifth-match showdown
against Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd said he was ready if we wanted him,'' says Gullikson.
``He hadn't had to go full blast to beat Rusedski decisively (6-4,
6-4, 6-2). He played so well that we thought we'd give Rusedski a
recurring nightmare if he saw Todd out there again. It worked for a
set.''
</P>
<P>
   Thereupon Rusedski, an unbroken server (77 percent, 10 aces, 8
service winners, 14 points allowed over 14 games), woke up. He
became a dangerous man in the left court with dismayingly accurate
returns, mostly chips. ``I was gonna dink and set it up for Tim,
make him look good,'' Greg said with a chuckle. That he did, as
acrobatic Henman flew all over the place, making sensational saves
and winning stabs.
</P>
<P>
   These two weren't exactly soulmates when Rusedski defected from
Canada to enlist with the Brits to challenge Henman for leadership
of the John Bull renaissance. ``Inevitably, playing on the team
together made us closer,'' said Henman. ``We might even go out to
dinner sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first set, they feasted on a declining Martin's
volleying wobbles. O'Brien, a nimble, crew-cut 28-year-old Texan
out of Amarillo and Stanford, extremely agile at the net, was the
US's leading man. He served through four break points to 4-3, and
his returns from the left court spurred the break of Henman _ the
Brits' lone loss of serve _ that was the difference in the first
set.
</P>
<P>
   But then Henman and Rusedski coalesced firmly. The Americans'
trouble was that both Martin and O'Brien are sharpest from the left
court. One had to play somewhere else, and the ever willing Martin
accepted that role. O'Brien, serving, closed the fourth set with an
incredible half-volley winner off Rusedski's toe-tickling return.
However, that was all for the Americans, who were able to scrape
merely five points against serve in the fifth. O'Brien fended off
three breakers in the three-deuce second game before Rusedski
nailed a forehand down the middle for the backbreaking break, a 2-0
lead, and . . . hello Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well for the 2-1 front-runners Sunday, the US as
well as Australia (playing at Zimbabwe), the two old rivals will
collide July 16-18 in a quarterfinal at Longwood Cricket Club. In
that case, Gullikson will have to find somebody to stand up to one
of the thorniest couples, Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge,
five-time Wimbledon champs. Drop Gully a line with your resume and
sneaker size.

HOSTS WON'T INDULGE IOC 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They may not be straphanging on city buses at Sydney
and Salt Lake, but the Lords of the Rings won't be living like
sultans at the next Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the organizers weren't worried about their precarious
budgets, they're in no mood to be seen as indulging International
Olympic Committee members' sense of entitlement. The Aussies are
talking about scrapping individual cars for the 100-plus members
and scaling back VIP lounges. The Utahans have already trimmed more
than $1 million from their IOC protocol budget, but committee chief
Mitt Romney insists the Lords won't notice. And they will be paying
for their rooms ($200 a night double-occupancy).
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not believe in staying in Salt Lake free,'' says
Romney.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think the Turin folks haven't picked up on the Olympic
theme-du-jour for their 2006 Winter bid? They're pushing ethics,
integrity, and ``transparency'' as their hallmarks. In other words:
We can't give the Lords as much as a brass lira . . . Just because
president Juan Antonio Samaranch will preside over the IOC's new
ethics panel and reform commission (whose members he's also naming)
doesn't mean he'll be making all the decisions, executive board
members insist. ``Presiding means you have the least influence,''
says US member Anita DeFrantz. ``You're essentially a traffic
cop.'' . . . The Kosovo conflict is also playing havoc with
international sport. Besides last week's postponements of
qualifying matches in Albania, Yugoslavia, and Croatia for next
year's European soccer championships, the World Table Tennis
Championships scheduled later this month for Belgrade will be moved
and the Russians have pulled out of a five-match women's volleyball
tour with the US . . . If the International Skating Union thought
that making the qualifying round at the World Figure Skating
Championships count toward the total would stop the griping, it
thought wrong. The top contenders still despise the idea of having
to skate a long program just to eliminate the Greeks and Mexicans.
``I hate this program,'' says Russia's Alexei Yagudin, the men's
champ. ``Is it stupid? Yes.'' The real issue, though, is that the
qualifier turns the week into an endurance event and has
dramatically changed the scoring formula. Under the previous
system, anyone in the top three after the short program could claim
the title by winning the long program. Now, only the top two can.
But the ISU says that having three rounds makes it more likely that
the best skater will win. ``If a job is very high, you have three
interviews for it, no?'' says president Ottavio Cinquanta . . .
Unless she's willing to cut her college classes to skate in next
season's Grand Prix circuit, Michelle Kwan may not compete again
until next February's US championships. Under the new rules, any
top skater who wants to compete in open events (which Kwan did this
season) must also commit to the Grand Prix (which Kwan didn't). The
irony, of course, is that the opens were created precisely to keep
stars like Kwan from turning pro. So how can she skate the opens
but not the Grand Prix? By turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How can the ISU keep skating judges from winking and blinking to
each other before they put up their marks, as the now-banned
Russian and Ukrainian did during the world pairs event? ``You
cannot prevent what you have not said but what I imagine you would
like to say,'' shrugs Cinquanta. ``The best way is to trust people.
If we put them in a box, it would be a bad image, a disastrous
image. It is better to stay as we are.'' . . . Harmonic convergence
for Boston skating fans later this month, with the annual Ice Chips
and Champions on Ice exhibitions falling on the same weekend. Ice
Chips (April 16-17 at Northeastern's Matthews Arena) features
13-year-old dynamo Naomi Nari Nam, 1984 Olympic medalist Josef
Sabovcik, Shepherd Clark, and US junior medalist Jennifer Kirk.
Champions on Ice (April 18 at the FleetCenter) headlines Olympic
champions Oksana Baiul, Brian Boitano and Viktor Petrenko, world
titlists Kwan, Maria Butyrskaya, Elvis Stojko and Todd Eldredge,
and US champ Michael Weiss . . . As expected, the Chinese dominated
the recent World Short-Track Speedskating Championships, winning
both the men's (Li Jiajun) and women's (Yang Yang A) titles and
both team crowns. The US, with Brookline's Dan Weinstein and
Natick's Caroline Hallisey, placed fourth in both team events, with
16-year-old Apolo Anton Ohno fourth in men's . . . The apparent
defection of three gymnasts last weekend in Richmond, Va., will
likely keep the Romanian men's team from qualifying for next year's
Olympics. Marian Malita, Viorel Popescu, and Vasile Cioana are
among their top six . . . If Marion Jones doesn't become the first
woman to win five track and field gold medals in one Olympics next
year, it won't be because the Sydney organizers didn't make it
possible. They've arranged the schedule so that Jones can compete
in the 100, 200, long jump, and 4x100 and 4x400 relays without
having to clone herself. All that remains is for the international
federation to approve _ and for Jones to deliver . . . Add
synchronized diving (don't try this at home) to the Olympic
aquatics menu for Sydney. There'll be springboard and platform
events for both men and women and, yes, the Chinese should
dominate. Should be a couple of medals for the Americans, too . . .
The inaugural winter Goodwill Games will be held in Lake Placid
next February, two decades to the month after the Adirondack hamlet
hosted the Olympics. Program includes figure skating, skiing,
jumping, snowboarding, bobsled, luge, and short-track speedskating.

GODOLPHIN TRIES DIRECT APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is generally agreed that this will be the most open
Kentucky Derby in years. One of the intriguing aspects of this
unsettled season is the novel approach being taken by the Godolphin
Stable of Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum of Dubai as the May 1 Run for
the Roses approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin may enter as many as four horses, three of whom will
not have run in an official race this year. Why would the sheik
consider such a tactic, which involves trial races among members of
his own stable at Nad Al Sheba Race Course? Because it is similar
to what has worked for Godolphin in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People criticize us for going straight to the Kentucky Derby,
and we know that the Derby is a very hard race to win,'' said
Mohammed. ``But the track here (which is sandy and deep) makes the
horses fit. Lammtarra had won a small race and was sick when he
came here. But he recovered and went straight to win the Epsom
Derby. What I'm trying to say is that we don't need a prep race; we
will have a prep race here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is everything here, the cameras, the track, the lights,
everything except the crowd. Godolphin is an international stable
now, and we will go wherever we can. I have not been to a Kentucky
Derby, but I have studied all the races on film to try to find ways
to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin held the first of two trial races March 21, and
Worldly Manner, who was purchased for $5 million as a 2-year-old,
won, with Aljabr second, and Prado's Landing third. Worldly Manner
and Aljabr will run in the second trial on a date to be determined
this month, and be joined by Comeonmom, who was purchased last year
for $3 million. Comeonmom was held out of the first trial because
he had battled a skin rash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comeonmom is behind because his skin is not right,'' said
Mohammed. ``He will go in our second trial, and whether he goes to
America depends on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Prado's Landing, who was third in the Dubai trial,
was selected to run in a prep, the $750,000 Blue Grass at Keeneland
next Saturday. A winner of a maiden sprint race at Laurel July 30
before being purchased by Godolphin, Prado's Landing arrived at
Keeneland Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is doing very well,'' said assistant trainer Eric
Coatrieux. ``He ran very well in the trial, and I think that was
one of the reasons that it was decided to ship him over here and
give him a chance. I imagine that we will use an American jockey in
the Blue Grass, but no decision has been made yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed was involved in the Kentucky Derby once before, but he
had no control over the situation. He bought a half-share of
Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Arazi before the colt flopped in the
1991 Derby. However, original owner Allen Paulson continued to
manage the horse's career, which concluded when he failed again in
the Breeders' Cup Mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped Arazi would run well in the race, but he didn't train
on,'' said Mohammed. ``However, I am very pleased with the way
these horses train and they will come to the races fit enough, if
they are good enough. We know it is very difficult, and we know how
important it is to win it. But we can't win it unless we try, and,
if we don't win it, we will come back again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Nick Zito continues to point Wondertross, the 8-1
favorite in early Derby wagering sponsored by Churchill Downs,
toward the Blue Grass. The promising colt, who was second to Vicar
in the Florda Derby March 13, went 5 furlongs in a best-of-the-day
1:01 3/5 at Keeneland last Monday, galloping out 6 furlongs in
1:16. ``That's exactly what I was looking for,'' said Zito. ``He
did it nice and easy. We'll come back next week and crank it up a
bit.'' Meanwhile, Zito will likely send another of his 3-year-olds,
Adonis, to the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, held the same day as the
Blue Grass. Adonis, who was sixth in the Florida Derby, went
five-eighths in 1:02 4/5 at Keeneland Monday . . . Vicar worked a
half-mile in :48 2/5, out 5 furlongs in 1:00 2/5, at Churchill
Downs Tuesday. ``He worked good; he's sharp,'' said trainer Carl
Nafzger. ``The colt's stepping up, and if he can be consistent in
the Blue Grass, that's what we want.'' . . . Cat Thief, third in
the Florida Derby and also heading for the Blue Grass, breezed 6
furlongs in 1:14 at Churchill Tuesday. Cat Thief represents the
only Derby hope for trainer D. Wayne Lukas. ``He worked good,''
said Mike Maker, an assistant to Lukas. ``He's not an outstanding
work horse, but he does what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the Daily Racing Form began publishing the
sales prices of horses, age 2 through 4, sold at auction. The
listing, which includes the site of the sale, the date of the sale,
and the price, appears at the right of the pedigree information
carried for each horse. This information will be invaluable when it
comes to handicapping maiden races full of first-time starters. The
price of a horse at sale often translates into ability on the track
. . . Joe De Francis, owner of Pimlico and Laurel, and Gov. Parris
Glendening of Maryland reportedly have ended their feud over slot
machines at the state's tracks. De Francis has been badly hurt by
competition from slots, which have been very successful at Delaware
Park, only an hour from Pimlico. Glendening ran on a ``no slots''
platform, and the two have been battling since. Now, the Maryland
tracks will receive $10 million from surplus lottery funds to boost
purses in exchange for an end to lobbying for slots. In the end,
the legislature played hardball by threatening to fund a
state-built track . . . Wonderland Park will host a race on the
``National Night of Stars'' simulcast, sponsored by the American
Greyhound Track Operators, May 8. The card, featuring 15 races from
15 tracks, will start at 7:50 p.m. and end at 12:30 a.m. This is
the third year the event has been held, and Wonderland has
participated each time. Last year, the Night of Stars was offered
at 250 betting locations. ``Wonderland is honored once again to be
chosen as a host track and a major contributor to our industry's
signature event,'' said simulcast director Ron Wohlen.

 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The loss on Opening Night was seen as an upset. The
loss a month later was, well, merely surprising. In both cases, the
Celtics were favored to beat Toronto and didn't do it. They were
manhandled, brutalized, overpowered.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be underdogs the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, your Toronto Raptors are raising eyebrows and making
strides, not to mention winning games. They see the Celtics
Thursday night in Air Canada Centre, where, entering the weekend,
they were 9-2 and in strong contention for a playoff berth, unlike
You Know Who. When Rick Pitino says the Celtics are no different
from an expansion team, the folks up north get upset. No one in
Toronto is making promises about next year. They're getting it done
now.
</P>
<P>
   You look at the Raptors and you see a nice mix of young and old
as well as someone who should warrant a spot on an MVP ballot:
Charles Oakley. Along with Kevin Willis, and sky-walking rookie
Vince Carter, the Oak Man is responsible for turning around this
recently moribund franchise. He has done the gray eminence thing to
a tee for the Raptors. (If you think this is overstated, the phone
number for the Knicks is 212-465-6471.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people outside the sport realize how big a thing
it is to have a veteran guy like Charles,'' said Dee Brown, one of
many ex-Celtics who does not miss playing in Boston. ``It's big. I
remember when I was young and the older guys held the team together
while the young guys played well one night or another. That's what
Oak does. You can't find guys like that, who do the thing he does.
Maybe that crazy guy in LA (Dennis Rodman) or Jayson Williams. It's
like a nose guard in football. You can't find guys like that. They
don't come around anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and they also have Carter, who has displaced Paul Pierce as
the presumptive Rookie of the Year. He's already got his own jam
section on the Raptors' web site and, according to Brown, is an
absolute delight off the court as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince has to be the most humble guy I've ever met, the exact
opposite of Antoine (Walker),'' Brown said. ``He's having fun. It's
just so refreshing to see someone still get excited. I remember
when I used to be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has fit in nicely coming off the bench. Last week, he
erupted for a franchise-record eight 3-pointers. (He also holds the
Boston record with eight.) He's now closer in age and wisdom to
Oakley than to Carter; this is his ninth season in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so nice here is that we are creating history,'' he
said. ``This team has never even made the playoffs. It's great to
be in that position instead of hearing `Havlicek Stole the Ball'
all the time. And they want me here. That's big. It's the first
time since my first years in the league that individuals don't care
about their numbers as long as we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the weekend, Toronto had the eighth-best record in
the East. Who would have thought that after what we saw last year
and after the two exhibitions? But they're for real. They've won in
San Antonio and at home against the Pacers. When it was mentioned
to team personnel chief Bob Zuffelato that he had himself a nice
rookie, Zuffelato didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our rookie,'' he said. ``I also like our team.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal that would have sent Tony Battie and Bruce
Bowen to the Clippers for Rodney Rogers was the real thing. Both
teams signed off on it. Then the league stepped in and said
``whoa.'' The problem was that Battie could not be traded with
someone because he had been traded within the previous two months.
He could have been traded even up for someone, or for two players,
but not with someone. No one caught that technicality and so the
deal died. What has not died is Pitino's interest in Rogers, who
will be a free agent this summer and has been on Boston's wish list
for some time. Pitino has targeted a half-dozen players he
believes, for one reason or another, have not played to
expectations. Rogers, who is finishing his fourth year with the
Clippers, is one of those lads. Plus, he can score. But he's also
had weight problems _ he was 40 pounds overweight when he reported
this year _ and there will be the ongoing question of how much a
veteran wants to play Pitino Ball. Plus, the best the Celtics can
offer is $2 million, unless they work a sign-and-trade with LA.
Before agreeing to the Bowen/Battie package, sources said, the
Celtics wanted to make it an even swap for Dana Barros, but the
Clippers rejected that . . . While we're on the subject, it's no
secret that Ron Mercer's name was heard in war rooms around the
league before the trade deadline. Depending on whom you talk to,
the Celtics were doing the calling (most teams) or were getting the
calls (Boston's version). What did Mercer think? ``I have no
control over that,'' he said. ``There are two ways of looking at
it. Either one team doesn't want you or a lot of other teams do. I
took it as a positive _ that a lot of teams wanted me, not that the
Celtics didn't want me.'' The Celtics plan to offer Mercer what
Pitino called ``a very substantial package'' as soon as they are
able. What does Mercer think? ``It's a business now,'' he said. ``I
understand that I can be traded. But at the same time, I can also
make a decision to play where I want to play. I can't be upset at
them for trading me and they can't be upset if I want to play
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This just in from Bill Strickland, the inimitable agent for
Pervis Ellison: ``Pervis is alive and well _ just like Elvis.''
Given that Ellison still isn't jogging, Strickland said, ``I think
this season is well beyond his reach. I've told him to get as
healthy and as strong as he can and come back and help the team
next year. Hopefully, he could play another three or four years.''
Strickland said he actually could find work for Ellison _ and
hinted that the places of employment were not Yakima, Sioux City,
or Rockford . . . Latrell Sprewell is going to get a nice bill in
the mail from the NBA for legal fees he now has to pay after his
ridiculous lawsuit was dismissed. The bill is well into six
figures, so look for Spree to sue his lawyers for poor
representation . . . Charles Barkley says he's feeling as good as
he has in years, thanks to more work on weights and the healing of
two hernias. As for the weights, Barkley said he has gained 15
pounds (he's at 270, he says) and ``everybody is telling me how
good I look. I don't know how I can gain 15 pounds and look good,
but obviously the weightlifting must be making a big difference.''
Someone remarked how well he was playing this year, but Barkley
pointed out that he's averaging only one point and one rebound more
per game. ``The biggest difference is that last year, I was in pain
all season with two hernias, and it was tough for me to do
anything,'' he says.

   Celtics general manager Chris Wallace just returned from the
Portsmouth Tournament for fringe players and was unimpressed.
``It's probably as weak a field as I've seen, and I've been to
eight or nine,'' Wallace said. OK, OK. We get the drift. But what
about the gossip? Well, Wallace says the skinny is that Baron Davis
of UCLA, Ron Artest of St. John's, UConn's Richard Hamilton,
possibly Elton Brand and William Avery of Duke, and up to three
high schoolers will declare themselves eligible for the draft. As
for UConn's Khalid El-Amin, Wallace said, ``He doesn't pass the
look test, but he makes plays.'' The top high school prospect is
6-foot-11-inch Jonathan Bender of Picayune, La., who has committed
to Mississippi State but may decide to go right to the NBA, where
he could be a lottery pick . . . Then there's the strange case of
Bruno Sundov. He's the 7-2 Croatian who may be the first individual
ever to be drafted (Dallas, second round, 1998) and instead choose
prep school (the Winchendon School). Then he played in the high
school stud game during Final Four weekend in St. Petersburg and
came out of it with a two-year contract from the Mavericks. Talk
about a guy getting the most out of spring break . . . Speaking of
the Duke situation, here's Grant Hill's advice for Avery and Brand.
``I would tell them, or anybody, to stay,'' Hill said. ``Especially
now. If they had won, it might be harder to convince them to stay.
But, with the exception of Trajan Langdon, all the pieces are back.
You know, come back! Get the opportunity to win it. Win it twice.
It's not just that, it's also an opportunity to get better as
players, and to grow as players and as a person. The NBA will be
there. I'm sure Brand, whenever he comes out, will be a top pick.
You know, get some insurance, stay in school.'' . . . After hinting
that he'd go with the kids for the rest of this lost season, Dallas
coach Don Nelson did an about-face against the Clippers. Dirk
Nowitzki didn't even get off the bench, his third DNP of the
season. But the Mavericks won. Nellie had to be thinking that no
rebuilding program could stand the indignity of a home loss to the
Clips.

   There might be trouble brewing in Philadelphia. Allen Iverson
has a thigh bruise and plans to rest for a few games. But during
Friday's loss to Cleveland, he went 0 for 7 and sat out the final
three quarters. There was one report that Iverson said something to
coach Larry Brown when Brown wanted him to go back into the game.
Afterwards, Brown would say only that those who want to play are
going to play, and that he still finds it mind-boggling that
players don't put the team first. Hmmmm. Asked about the night,
Iverson acknowledged that coaches and players don't always see
eye-to-eye. ``Everything is not going to be peaches and cream,'' he
said . . . Interesting sight at the end of the Lakers-Suns game
Friday night. Los Angeles trailed by a point with 11.3 seconds left
and when the Lakers came out of the huddle, Shaquille O'Neal was on
the bench. That was coach Kurt Rambis's decision; Shaq was not hurt
and had not fouled out. How can you have an MVP candidate not in
the game at that time? Free throws, that's how. It turned out OK
for the Lakers; Glen Rice hit a jumper over Danny Manning for a
1-point win. Afterward, Shaq applauded the acquisition of Rice,
which he pushed for, adding, ``I'm glad I'm the general manager of
this team. I've got this team just the way I want it.'' . . .
Michael Jordan as Charlotte owner? We asked North Carolina native
(Kinston) and former Tar Heel Jerry Stackhouse what he thought
about the prospect of MJ coming back home. ``I think it would be a
big push for the state to have him back because he's been
associated with Chicago all these years, like Chicago is home to
him,'' Stackhouse said. ``Coming back to North Carolina, people
would really cling to him being back there.'' Stackhouse also likes
the idea of Michael as mover and shaker: ``He knows what it takes
to win and what pieces are needed. I think his most valuable role
would be as a general manager to put the team together. That's what
he wants. Plus, he's got so much money, he's got to spend it on
something.''

IT'S A SORE SPOT FOR PORTUGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ When Mike Lansing's line drive struck him in the right
elbow and his arm went numb, Mark Portugal feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was broke,'' the Red Sox pitcher said Saturday.
``I really thought it was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal said when he tried to pick up the ball, he had no
feeling in his hand. His throw sailed over the head of first
baseman Mike Stanley. By the time Lansing reached second base,
trainer Jim Rowe was out of the dugout. So was manager Jimy
Williams and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Rowe asked him where it hit him,'' Williams said. ``As
soon as he said his elbow, I said, `That's it.' I didn't even ask
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was relieved when he got back to the clubhouse and some
feeling began to return to his fingers. It was an even greater
relief when X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor looked at the X-rays and said, `Oh, you've had a
lot of work done on that thing,' '' Portugal said after the Red
Sox' 10-6 loss to the Rockies in chilly Coors Field in their
exhibition finale. ``I told him, `Yeah, I'm used to having
something wrong with it.' I've got screws in there and
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, you may recall, has been on the disabled list 10
times, more than any active player, and has had his elbow operated
on twice. Five times in the last six years, he has been on the DL.
There have been freak injuries, like the time he tore his hamstring
running out an infield hit, or when he pulled his groin attempting
to kick a wad of gum he'd just discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, he had an ear infection in spring training, then
injured his right knee in his first regular-season start against
the Dodgers and needed surgery.
</P>
<P>
   For the end of the millennium, the 36-year-old righthander
wanted to stay healthy. Taking a direct hit from Lansing in the
first inning Saturday is not recommended by the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming,'' Portugal said. ``I tried to get my glove
up, but I couldn't get it there.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the injury is being called a bruise on the outer part
of his elbow. Portugal is expected to make his first regular-season
start Friday against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in St. Petersburg,
Fla. Williams said he assumes Portugal will be able to keep that
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to worry about it right now,'' Williams said.
``We're not going to do anything right now. We'll just wait and see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal said he plans on pitching. ``I could wake up and feel
fine tomorrow,'' he said. ``Throwing the ball is going to dictate
where I'm at. If it hurts to throw, I don't think they will allow
me to pitch. As long as it's not broken, I'll be OK. I've always
been a fast healer.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal said he's more concerned about how poorly he's pitched.
In his last start in Florida on Monday, he was rocked for eight
hits and seven runs. All of the runs came in the third inning, when
he was taken deep three times.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he gave up five runs on four hits in just two-thirds
of an inning. The Rockies went double, double, single, single, walk
before Portugal induced Todd Helton to ground into a double play.
The next batter was Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned with leaving the ball up in the middle of
the plate than how I feel,'' Portugal said. ``I'm throwing the ball
over the plate. At some point I've got to make an adjustment. I
can't continue to do that and get my butt kicked. I'm not doing
anybody any good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I've felt great. It's a minor adjustment, not to
throw over the middle of the plate. I've never had that problem in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, as he did after Portugal was lit up in Fort Myers,
professed no concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to get through this injury thing, see how that
plays out, but he knows how to pitch,'' the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams should know, according to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been watching me the last 15 years,'' Portugal said.
``Joe (Kerrigan) knows what I'm capable of doing. It's a matter of
going out with the right focus and getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a good spring, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal said he's been hit by line drives numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocks you when it happens,'' he said. ``Everybody knows it
can happen. That's why you try to get yourself in the best possible
position to field. It's every pitcher's worst dream, being hit by a
line drive. It's about the only way you can get hurt, getting
smoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to be gun-shy. I've taken too many
bullets.''

BIRTHDAY BOY GATES IS GUEST OF HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shawn Bates had one of those days Saturday that most
local kids who grow up worshiping the Bruins can only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Playing just 7 minutes and 3 seconds during 12 shifts with a
variety of linemates, Bates, who grew up in nearby Medford, potted
two goals _ his fourth and fifth of the season _ in the Bruins' 3-0
win over the depleted Philadelphia Flyers at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   He also would have been credited with an assist on a goal by
Sergei Samsonov had it not been disallowed when a review showed
Dmitri Khristich's skate in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   And, to cap things off, he was voted the game's No. 1 star ahead
of Samsonov, who notched his 23d goal, and Byron Dafoe, who chalked
up his league-leading ninth shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   All this, no less, on his 24th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bates's third stint with the Bruins and he hopes this
time he'll stick around longer. He began his rookie season last
year with the Bruins and played 13 games (two goals) before being
sent to Providence.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he was up from Nov. 14-Feb. 5 and in 25 games had
three goals and four assists. Then he shuffled off to Providence
again, before getting this latest call March 26.
</P>
<P>
   So, how long will he stay?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all up to him,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``If he plays
like that all the time, I don't know of any coaches that don't like
good players. It's all up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bates was matched with Khristich and Samsonov, or
Khristich and Ken Belanger, or P.J. Axelsson and Anson Carter,
things happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out to be a great birthday present,'' said Bates,
who was drafted by the Bruins in 1993 and played in four NCAA Final
Fours with Boston University. ``And it's a nice win for the team.
It puts us 9 points ahead of the team trying to catch us. But we
have seven games left and we have to play hard for seven games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates gave the Bruins some breathing room in the second period
when he scored his first goal, with Khristich drawing the assist,
to make it 2-0. The second came in the third on passes from Hal
Gill and Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first goal, (Khristich) made a nice pass to get the puck
down low to me, down below the circle. I got a step on Rod
Brind'Amour behind the net and just brought it out front and tried
to tuck it in and it went five-hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second goal, pretty much the same thing. Anson Carter
stopped on the half boards and I saw an opening and just tried to
get there and get my stick down. He made a great pass to me. He
made the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates knows Saturday's performance doesn't guarantee anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay, that's for sure, and hopefully something like
this helps,'' he said. ``It's a matter of going out there and
working hard and playing with confidence and being steady every
game. The more I get out there, the more the confidence builds up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to play hard every time I'm out there, whether it's
five, six, or seven shifts. Anytime you get an opportunity to get
out there and play, you have to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two goals and the game's top star says he did just that.

LURE OF COACHING HOOK SEIFER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ George Seifert knew when it was time to
leave the NFL. The jury is still out on whether he knew when it was
time to come back.
</P>
<P>
   The new head man of the Carolina Panthers is not only one of the
oldest head coaches in the National Football League but also its
most successful. When Seifert tired of the pressure-cooker that
coaching the San Francisco 49ers had become and walked away after
the 1996 season, he was the most successful coach with at least 100
victories in league history.
</P>
<P>
   In eight seasons, Seifert won two Super Bowls and went 108-35, a
winning percentage of .755. The next-best percentage was not that
of his legendary predecessor, the genius Bill Walsh, but of the
even more legendary Vince Lombardi, who went 105-35-6 in Green Bay
and Washington, a .740 success rate. Walsh was far behind at
102-63-1, a .617 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   To come back to pro football this fall, Seifert is risking his
position in history with a team that either has forgotten how to
win or never knew how in the first place. Even for a man of minimal
ego, as Seifert has always seemed to be, that was something to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something my wife and I talked about,'' Seifert said.
``When I left San Francisco, it was time to leave. The constant of
having that tiger on your tail takes its toll. But this was an
interesting decision. Do you live on past success and go into the
sunset? We made a decision that the days ahead are more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of traveling the world and attacking the
Pacific's best fishing areas, Seifert tired of a life without
temple-pounding pressure, so when Panthers owner Jerry Richardson
called in January and they began to talk about where they wanted
the Panthers to go, Sierra Club members had something to rejoice
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day for the wildlife and the little fishes in
the sea when I came back,'' joked the ultimate outdoorsman. ``There
were so many things I'd fantasized about doing when I'd be in a
pressure situation and I pretty much fulfilled them. When I was in
Costa Rica or Chile, I wasn't thinking about converting third and
3, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial relief began to wane, however, and sitting in a
television studio each Sunday trading jokes and comments with CBS's
other talking heads last year was not Seifert's idea of staying
close to his calling. He was still a football coach at heart, an
X's- and-O's guy, not an ex-coach like John Madden, glorying in
being glib.
</P>
<P>
   And so he is back again, in the world of migraine headaches,
ill-informed critics, and increasingly quicker sentencing to the
unemployment office.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's been a heck of a lot of fun,'' Seifert said.
``It's been more exciting than I thought it would be. The real test
comes when you get into the season and things don't work out as you
planned, but up to this point, each day has been exciting. I'm
still waiting to say, `My God, what have I done?'
</P>
<P>
   ``With free agency, you can't ease in anymore. That's probably
been a plus for me because you start to feel the competition. When
you lose a ballgame, it's hard to describe the humiliation you
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert knew little of that during his years in San Francisco
but enough to know how distasteful it can be. So why did he choose
to come to the middle of North Carolina, to a team without a
first-round draft choice that has, after a burst of success in the
second year of existence (when it beat Seifert's 49ers twice to
reach the NFC Championship game), slipped so badly that highly
respected coach Dom Capers was dismissed immediately after a 4-12
fiasco?
</P>
<P>
   Had Capers not been sacked, of course, there would have been no
opening for Seifert, but then again what did the rapid-fire
decision to fire Capers two years after he led the second-year
Panthers to within a game of the Super Bowl say about the business?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice for me to say I felt that way'' _ that the
firing of five head coaches the day after the regular season was
unfair and unseemly _ ``but all the coaches who were released would
have done it again,'' Seifert said. ``We have to continue to
realize nobody is making us do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year away I pretty much told myself that was it. I
was off into the sunset. I didn't watch much football until the
playoffs. People told me those playoffs would bother me. I sloughed
that off, but they were right. The lack of anxiety bothered me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I did begin to talk to other owners about jobs, but there
was something in Carolina. The constant pressure to win was all I
knew and that was what I was hearing from Jerry Richardson. Now I
could find out here if I can stand a losing season. I better not,
but I might.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Seifert laughed the wry laugh well known to those who
have attended more than a few of his impromptu post-practice talks
outside the 49ers' locker room. He chuckled but then he made clear
why he was really coming back to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Francisco we had to feed the monster,'' Seifert said.
``Here we're trying to create one. My wife thinks this is more fun.
If we get there, it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they do or they don't, in the end Seifert knows where
he's headed. Eventually he'll be headed back to Bodega Bay, back to
the sea, still a winner regardless of how things work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who have loved more than one woman over the
years, so I think you can be passionate about football yet also
other things in life,'' Seifert said. ``I expect to live some more
when I'm through coaching again.''
</P>
<P>

   If Cincinnati's Mike Brown selects Oregon quarterback Akili
Smith with the third pick in the draft, as many are predicting, he
should know what he's getting into. It would be the fourth time in
the '90s that the Bengals drafted a player represented by Leigh
Steinberg on the first round. Frankly, that doesn't bode well for
the Bengals. The previous three selections _ David Klingler, Dan
Wilkinson, and Ki-Jana Carter _ all were busts. If Brown takes
Smith, we'll know he's not superstitious . . . John Semcken, the
ex-vice president of the New Coliseum Partners group that is trying
to bring an expansion team to Los Angeles, has this view of the
group's new lead investor, Eli Broad: ``My experience with people
with a billion dollars is they're cheaper than you and I.'' . . .
How bad is it in Washington as the draft approaches with no
resolution yet on the ownership situation? Ex-49er director of
player personnel Vinny Cerrato was hired as a consultant by the
Milstein group that is trying to buy the team for $800 million but
John Kent Cooke, son of the former owner and still technically the
team's chief operating officer, has refused to allow Cerrato office
space at Redskin Park. So Cerrato is working in a hotel room near
the club's offices and talks daily by phone to general manager
Charley Casserly . . . Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy knows quarterback
Trent Dilfer must play more consistently, so he will have a
quarterback coach on his staff for the first time, shifting tight
end coach Clyde Christensen to the new position. Christensen is a
former quarterback at North Carolina who coached the position at
Temple, Maryland, and Clemson . . . Chiefs president Carl Peterson
insists he would not let former Kansas City coach Marty
Schottenheimer out of the three years on his contract to take over
the Redskins unless the Chiefs were compensated with draft picks
the way the Patriots were when Bill Parcells left for the Jets.
Peterson said a Lawrence Welk deal _ a 1 and a 2 and a 3 _ would
satisfy him . . . If the Milstein group is ultimately approved and
head coach Norv Turner is fired, it won't take him long to find
work. ``There'll always be a spot for Norv with me,'' said Miami
head coach Jimmy Johnson, his former boss in Dallas. ``Even if I
have to pay him out of my own pocket.'' . . . How rich do you have
to be to buy an NFL franchise? Consider this. Bob McNair, who is
seeking an expansion team for Houston, recently paid $550,000 for a
single steer at something called The Terminal Rodeo. It's a charity
event in which the steer is slaughtered for the meat and the money
is given to charity . . . When he was a consultant to the 49ers,
Walsh never thought they should draft quarterback Jim
Druckenmiller, and now that he's running the joint, word is Walsh
is trying to deal the former No. 1 choice. Walsh favored Jake
Plummer at the time and is reported to be particularly put off by
Druckenmiller's refusal to play for an NFL Europe team. Walsh is
rumored to be high on UCLA miracle worker Cade McNown and could
make him San Francisco's first pick in the April 17 draft if he can
dump Druckenmiller first . . . Although McNown was cleared by the
FBI of any shady dealings despite his close association to former
New York Mafia capo Dominick ``Donny Shacks'' Montemarano,
Steinberg believes it could yet hurt him. The FBI said McNown was
accompanied by ``Donny Shacks'' to New York for the Heisman Trophy
presentation last December. McNown and Montemarano were seen dining
that weekend at Sparks Steak House, site of the 1985 hit on Mafia
kingpin Paul Castellano. And McNown and several teammates allegedly
attended several ``Monday Night Football'' parties at Montemarano's
Los Angeles home. But McNown claimed he knew nothing of his
friend's Mob ties, and the FBI has given him a clean slate. But
Steinberg said, ``It can't help a kid to have his name in the
papers with a guy the FBI calls `Donny Shacks,' can it?'' Still,
Steinberg believes McNown may end up in the best position among the
half-dozen hot quarterback prospects. ``There's no question Cade
McNown will end up on the most successful team,'' Steinberg said,
referring to the fact he will likely be the last of the top
quarterbacks taken.

   Newly acquired Baltimore quarterback Scott Mitchell made his
first bad decision when he opted to continue wearing No. 19.
Because of Johnny Unitas, that's a sacred number in Baltimore. The
Ravens even asked the Colts Hall of Fame quarterback if he minded.
He didn't, but it's not Unitas Mitchell has to worry about. It's
the fans. ``I didn't want to come here and make people think I was
the second coming of Johnny Unitas,'' Mitchell explained, ``but
I've worn the No. 19 since I was in high school and part of the
reason I chose it was because of Unitas, an NFL Films thing I saw
as a kid. I liked his style and what he was all about, so I decided
to wear the number. He doesn't mind me wearing it. I want to be
sensitive to what it means to the people there, but as long as he's
all right with that, I'll wear it.'' . . . Mitchell's new boss,
head coach Brian Billick, is a believer in modern technology. He
intends to present his game plans to players via a slide show with
computer software that he believes should keep even the MTV
Generation interested. ``Anything with color, movement, and action
heightens the learning curve,'' Billick said . . . Ohio State
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer now says his disappointing play last
season was partially a result of the criticism he took when his
checkered academic record was made public and he responded by
refusing to talk to the press all season. ``I think that hurt me
because then they had their own free will to write whatever they
wanted instead of my word and my opinion,'' Katzenmoyer said during
an amiable discussion with reporters at the combine in February.
``In a way it hurt me more than anything.'' Katzenmoyer had not
talked to the media in a year when he decided to speak before the
draft. His shaky play last season probably has taken him out of the
top 10 slots in this draft, but his speed, size, and nose for the
ball will be a plus for whoever ends up with him . . . More than a
few NFL teams are less than pleased at what they believe to be
stalling tactics by Jerry Jones to avoid exceeding the salary cap.
Word is the Cowboys have reached agreements with former Pro Bowl
center Mark Stepnoski and wide receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail
but have yet to formally sign either free agent. As soon as they
filed contracts with the league, they would be over the salary cap
and forced to dump some veterans. Jones is hoping to avoid that by
reworking the high-priced contracts of Deion Sanders and Troy
Aikman but has yet to get that done. It is believed that he has
already agreed to sign Ismail to a seven-year, $21 million contract
that is heavily back-loaded and likely will turn out to be about a
three-year, $7 million deal that includes a $5 million signing
bonus. Despite the team's denial of a deal, Ismail was looking for
houses last week in Valley Ranch, where the Cowboys train. Ismail
did little in his career until last season when he blossomed in
Carolina, catching 69 passes for 1,024 yards and eight touchdowns.
While Jones keeps those contracts in the trunk of his Mercedes,
players such as wide receivers Billy Davis and restricted free
agent Patrick Jeffers are left in limbo. Davis, a four-year veteran
with a year to go on his contract, knows he's likely to be released
when Ismail arrives but he has no idea when that will be or where
he might end up. The Cowboys have given his agent, Jordan Woy, the
right to negotiate a trade. Jeffers, meanwhile, has several teams
interested in signing him but they will not make a move until after
the signings of Ismail and Stepnoski are official out of fear that
the Cowboys would simply match their offers. Jeffers is a
three-year veteran who suddenly blossomed late last season,
starting with a big game on Thanksgiving and ending with a
seven-catch, 92-yard performance in the wild-card playoff loss to
Arizona. The Cowboys would like to retain him but need to be sure
they have the cap room to match any offer he might get. So why
doesn't some peeved team demand that the league do something?
Primarily because, at one time or another, they all do it . . .
Here's what Denver linebacker John Mobley says it's like playing
with Bill Romanowski: ``He's the true meaning of Jekyll and Hyde.
Off the field, the guy will do anything for you. Any favor that you
need, he's going to do it. Come Game Day, this guy is stone-faced.
He doesn't say a word to anybody. He's out there yelling and
screaming and cussing. It's not the same Bill Romanowski that you
see during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of coaching burnout, Denver's Mike Shanahan has
an interesting outlook: ``It always seems to me that the guys who
have burnout have a lot of money in the bank. I've never seen
assistant coaches have burnout, have you? I've seen assistants
coach until they're 62, 63. It seems to me the guys who have
burnout are the ones who don't have to worry about their future.''
At $2.6 million a year, Shanahan may be in that category . . .
Falcons kicker Morten Andersen often goes home to Denmark in the
offseason and at times practices his placekicking on soccer fields.
``I practice hitting it over the soccer goals,'' Andersen said. ``I
remember kids being out there all the time. They think I'm playing
soccer and would say, `This guy is terrible.' Several times they
came and said, `No, you hit it in the net.' It was kind of weird,
but I used to play soccer so I understood completely where they
were coming from.'' . . . Jeff George may have finally freed
himself from limbo now that the Vikings made him a short-term
offer. Steinberg, George's agent, was surprised when the Raiders
released his client and after an initial burst of discussions teams
looking for quarterback help (Washington, St. Louis, San Diego, and
Baltimore) made other moves. ``Now we're waiting for the deck to
reshuffle after the draft,'' Steinberg said. ``I didn't get Neil
O'Donnell a position last year until June.'' George has tremendous
talent but is only 34-70 as a starter for three NFL teams, all of
whom tired of him. Steinberg also is seeking work for Warren Moon,
who he said had offers from Kansas City and Baltimore at one point
but has yet to settle on a new home even though he concedes
wherever he goes it will be as a backup. However, the Ravens have
had trade talks with the Rams about young Tony Banks, who became
expendable when St. Louis signed ex-Redskin Trent Green. If the
Ravens bring in Banks to go with Mitchell, it will be because they
were unable to land one of the top four quarterbacks in the draft .
. . Steinberg was at the NFL owners meetings in Phoenix when the
Bills announced their new long-term deal with Doug Flutie.
Steinberg represents rival quarterback Rob Johnson, who signed a
big contract in Buffalo after Flutie's arrival only to get injured
and lose his job to the 35-year-old ex-BC star. Steinberg used
Flutie's ascent as an example of how quickly a quarterback's
fortunes can change. ``Doug Flutie was in obscurity in Canada and
he comes back and makes our client completely miserable,''
Steinberg said . . . Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre was
painfully honest in an interview in the Green Bay Press-Gazette
when he said he is now making a conscious effort to abstain from
alcohol because ``I don't want 15 years to go by and be looked at
as a goofball bum who could throw touchdown passes and defy the
odds.'' Favre said the impending birth of his second child in
August has been part of the maturation process that has brought him
from protesting an NFL pronouncement that he stay away from
drinking after becoming addicted to prescription painkillers two
years ago to a guy who said, ``I can't think of one thing that
drinking has done that's been good for me or my family. I'm not
saying everyone in the world should quit drinking, but I wasn't the
best drinker in the world, so I'm quitting. Being out drinking and
doing other things isn't the best example of being a family man.
I'm not calling myself Reggie White yet, but I've tried to become a
better Christian, to show up at church and pay attention for a
change. I'm trying to make the right decisions. It's not easy.''

PLAYERS EAGER TO GIVE NEW-LOOK AUGUSTA A GO 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Masters enters its 63d session this week, with Mark
O'Meara defending on an Augusta National course that has undergone
some significant changes, including the addition of potentially
troubling rough.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tiger Woods won by 12 shots two years ago without a single
three-putt on the treacherously fast greens, there has been talk of
toughening up the course. And the opinions have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice, I liked it,'' said David Duval after playing two
practice rounds two weeks ago at Augusta before heading to Ponte
Vedra, Fla., to capture The Players Championship and firmly
establish himself as the world's No. 1 player.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the rough, considerable length has been tacked on
to the par-5 second hole and the par-4 17th. The 11th has a rebuilt
green, but more significant is the addition of trees between the
15th and 17th fairways.
</P>
<P>
   The rough won't be US Open tough, but the greens will remain
fast and firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest change will be the 17th,'' said Duval.
``I'm not so sure how the added length to the second hole is going
to affect play, because when I played, it was a little cooler and I
couldn't get there (in two) whereas in the past I could. I could
hit right over the bunker and not have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the second cut (of rough) could play a big, big role.
It changes some of the lines I've taken in the past off the tees.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who in 1998 became the oldest player (41) to win two
major championships in one year, has also played the revamped
course and believes the changes will make a difference. But, he
added, ``Do I think they tried to Tiger-proof it? Not really.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've constantly made changes at Augusta National. I
remember walking around there with Ken Venturi and he was showing
where they used to play from in the older days and here was where
the tee was on 8 and 11. Steadily and surely over all these years
and over the evolution of the Masters, there have been changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest changes would be No. 2, No. 15, and No. 17. No. 2
has been lengthened about 40 yards, so now most of the guys will
just hit it right at the bunker and you won't have as many guys
knocking it on in two. The 15th isn't any longer, but the hills on
the right side between the 15th and 17th have been eliminated and a
lot of trees have been planted that are between 30 and 40 feet
tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to think a little bit more about your tee
shots. I think the change on 17 will have the biggest impact.
Everybody just stood up and just hit it over the top of the
Eisenhower tree. Now the tee has been put back about 25 yards and
slightly to the left, and most of the players won't be able to take
it over the top of the tree. They're going to have to fit it in the
right side and the trees that have been planted on the 15th come
into play.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara is primed to defend, and as host for this year's
pretournament champions dinner, he has selected appetizers of sushi
with a little sashimi, and a Caesar salad followed by steak and
chicken fajitas as the main course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm returning as defending champion and people will be
keeping their eye on me a little closer,'' said O'Meara. ``I'll try
to do the best I can, but no matter what happens, at least I know
that in 1998 I achieved something that as a young person growing up
I would have loved that opportunity. It was a dream come true. If I
don't do as well as I'd like to this year, I'll be disappointed,
but I know that at least one time I put on my coveted green
jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Masters/British Open double has brought more exposure to
O'Meara than he ever expected, and he gives the impression that he
enjoys being more than just the neighbor who helps Tiger Woods
handle celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you've got to look at it is it's nice to be wanted,''
said O'Meara. ``If nobody calls you, nobody wants to do an
interview, then obviously you're not doing very well. At 42, my
concerns are living up to the expectations that I want to live up
to and trying to fulfill all the needs that are required of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also have a great wife (Alicia) and two great kids
(Michelle, 12; Shaun, 9) and I want to make sure that I have enough
time for them. It's a great time in my life to have experienced all
the great things that have happened to me in golf, and last year
was kind of the icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who nearly won the Masters a year ago, has tried to put
the tournament in perspective. ``I think it's something that when
you get done with your career, you are very happy for what has been
but you are still yearnful for what could have been,'' he said. ``I
had an opportunity. I don't think it's something I will always
think about. I was in Houston two weeks later and I was over it. I
was past and beyond it. It was really my first opportunity in a
major where I have contended. That might have made it a little more
difficult and a little harder to understand and grasp. It tells me
I can win that golf tournament. There is no question in my mind I
can win it. It doesn't mean I am going to, but I have the ability
to win it.'' . . . The good people at Woods Hole GC are celebrating
the centennial year of their charming course and are hoping to
locate descendants of the seven founding members to invite them to
the Founders Day Tournament on April 24 (the actual date of the
founding of the club). The names of the seven founding members:
Francis C. Foster, James Dwight, E.P. Boggs, Henry W. Harris, H.H.
Fay, A.A. Ripka, and F. Apthorp Foster. Descendants can contact
Woods Hole professional Glenn Kelly at 508-548-2932 . . . The most
recent MasterCard Collegiate Golf Rankings have James Driscoll of
Charles River CC and the University of Virginia listed at No. 80
and Massachusetts Golf Association player of the year Justin Peters
of the University of Las Vegas/Reno and Pembroke CC at No. 81. What
the heck. Matt Kuchar, who was low amateur in the Masters and US
Open last year out of Georgia Tech, is just No. 50, and US Amateur
champion Hank Kuehne is 27th . . . The Golf Course Superintendents
Association of New England has elected Kevin Osgood of Newton
Commonwealth GC president and Robert Ruszala of Hickory Ridge CC
vice president. Osgood's company, Sterling Golf Management Inc.,
oversees the operation of the William J. Devine course at Franklin
Park . . . There will be a changing of the guard in the Cape Cod
Pro-Am League, as Jim and Lois Gaguin have stepped aside after 15
years of operating the league. They've been involved in golf for
decades, in Canada and in the United States Golf Association; they
ran the press room for several US Opens. They have been true
friends of the game and of those who have covered it, and
fortunately they will still be around to handle special projects.
</P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disqualification of Nick Faldo in the final round at TPC was
another case of a spectator calling a rules violation. After
hitting his second shot on No. 6 into a palm tree, Faldo failed to
locate and identify his ball. Instead of playing under the lost
ball rule, under which he would have lost stroke and distance, he
played his next shot under the unplayable lie rule, taking a drop
under the tree. Corey Pavin advised Faldo that he was doing the
right thing, but a spectator summoned a USGA official, who ruled
that Faldo was in violation and disqualified him . . . The Eamonn
Coghlan/Neil Cusack Marathon Golf Classic will be contested at
South Shore CC April 21. Appropriately, the event is held two days
after the Boston Marathon, which Cusack won 25 years ago. The
tournament has raised $80,000 for Our Lady's Hospital for Sick
Children in Dublin and is already sold out, with 180 players signed
up . . . The 35th Hornblower Memorial, the unofficial kickoff of
the amateur golf season in Massachusetts, will be played June 4-5
at Plymouth CC. Peters will defend . . . Golf Digest's latest list
of America's 100 greatest courses will appear in the May issue,
with Pine Valley GC No. 1 for the 14th consecutive year. The New
England representatives are The Country Club composite course (12),
the Kittansett Club (39), Wannamoisett CC in Rumford, R.I. (49),
Stanwich Club in Greenwich, Conn. (70), and Salem CC (78) . . .
Bruce Lietzke, who does amazingly well in the few tournaments in
which he plays, offered this comparison between TPC at Sawgrass and
Augusta National: ``You do have to be lucky or be good enough to
have your iron shots stop below the holes at both courses. That is
about the only similarity. Augusta's greens have much more slope.
The courses are similar in that local knowledge comes into play,
and you will see mostly veteran players winning through the
years.'' Lietzke put his casual approach into perspective: ``I am a
big believer that you can hurt yourself on the practice range as
much as you can help yourself.''

WRITERS GO WRONG BY CROWNING LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Whenever there is a problem, or even the appearance of
one, it is logical that people will try to solve it. Such is the
case in the aftermath of the unsatisfactory draw that was announced
after what seemed to be Lennox Lewis's crowning moment.
Unfortunately, solutions can be worse than the problem itself.
</P>
<P>
   To become the first British heavyweight in more than 100 years
proficient enough to have had the undisputed heavyweight title
stolen from you is something to put on your resume, but Lewis
understandably would have preferred to leave New York with the two
belts that are still owned by Evander Holyfield. In fact, Lewis
will return to New York Friday night and be handed a dubious honor
when the Professional Boxing Writers Association far exceeds its
responsibilities and presents him with its undisputed title belt
during the annual dinner to celebrate boxing's finest performances
and performers of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Although understandable on some levels, this is a misguided
attempt to rectify a situation the writers had no part in creating
and one for which millions of good trees were killed so they could
lament it in newspapers from Boston to Boise. Worse, it was a
decision not arrived at by a vote of the membership or even a vote
of the executive board. How do I know this? I'm on both and didn't
hear a word about it until one of Lewis's promoters called to crow
about it.
</P>
<P>
   How does such an action differ from what the writers so often
call the arbitrary and capricious manner in which boxing's three
crime families do their business? Although this will be perceived
by some as acknowledgement by the country's boxing writers of
Lewis's ``victory,'' the fact is the membership of more than 100
writers was never asked for an opinion on it.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing writers have much to criticize and comment upon in their
sport, which is why so many of us love it so. But the awarding of
championship belts, even ceremonial ones, is not our job. The
crowning of champions is for the three crime families _ the World
Boxing Council, World Boxing Association, and International Boxing
Federation _ to worry about. It is the writers' responsibility to
report on those champions and on the crimes committed in pursuit of
the belts they wear.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lewis-Holyfield fight was erroneously called a draw, it
was the writers' responsibility to explain what they saw and why
they thought the fight was close (so close that longtime New York
Times columnist Dave Anderson scored it a draw, as did at least a
half-dozen British boxing writers, including their dean, Harry
Mullin, and Glyn Leach, editor of the highly respected Boxing
Monthly magazine) or why they thought it was a Brink's job without
the armored car.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, reasonable people could have disagreed, and did. But
for writers to interject themselves into an area they don't belong
sets a precedent the organization will live to regret.
</P>
<P>
   What do we do, for example, the next time a Keith Mullings is
robbed of the junior middleweight title, as he was a few years back
when he battered IBF titleholder Raul Marquez but didn't get the
decision? Where does it stop? And why did it start in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   That Lewis deserves to be called the undisputed heavyweight
champion is certainly a reasonable position to take, and any boxing
writer who cares to do so would be well within his rights to do
that, regardless of the fact that Holyfield still holds the IBF and
WBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the same writers so outraged at this travesty didn't
feel such compunction when Shannon Briggs was given a victory over
George Foreman he in no way deserved. They saw no need to right the
wrong of Julio Cesar Chavez retaining his title via a draw with
Pernell Whitaker a few years back. Where was the Writers
Association belt for Rosendo Alvarez, who many felt defeated
Ricardo Lopez for the strawweight title in both of their matches?
</P>
<P>
   That is the danger of a kneejerk reaction to a bad and baffling
decision. Most of the time, the second decision is worse than the
first.
</P>

   WBC super bantamweight champion Erik Morales (32-0, 26 KOs) has
promised to go for a knockout May 8 against Wayne McCullough
(22-2), and the former bantamweight champion is tired of hearing
about it. ``He thinks he can knock me out and I'm sick of hearing
it,'' said McCullough, who has never been stopped. ``He thinks he
can walk straight through me and go home. I think I can stop him.''
When Morales first made his prediction at a press conference to
hype the bout, McCullough sat laughing. Morales snapped, ``You
won't be laughing May 8.'' . . . McCullough's promoters, Mat Tinley
and Dan Goossen, have said they will file a protest if open scoring
is used in the fight, as promoter Bob Arum has proposed. His
request will be voted on April 23 by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission. Here's one vote against it . . . Holyfield apparently
got his lines crossed when he said he'd been told by God that the
Lewis fight would be finished in three rounds. Turns out the Lord
was referring to Holyfield's second marriage. Last Friday,
Holyfield filed for divorce from Dr. Janice Itson Holyfield, whom
he married 2 1/2 years ago. This comes six months after Holyfield
admitted having fathered two children out of wedlock last year at a
time when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Holyfield
is seeking joint custody of their 6-month-old son, Elijah. The
WBA-IBF heavyweight champion has nine children, including three
with his first wife and five with four women out of wedlock. When
Holyfield divorced Paulette Holyfield in 1991, it cost him an
estimated $4 million. If anyone can afford these peccadilloes, it's
Holyfield. He has grossed $205 million in purses, including $92
million during the time he was married to his second wife . . .
Undefeated heavyweight prospect Kirk Johnson will get a long-needed
elbow operation following his win over Al Cole. Johnson has had
problems for several years with bone chips, but it was not until
trainer Teddy Atlas took over his handling that the decision was
made to get it fixed. Atlas had begun questioning why Johnson
didn't snap out his punches . . . Assuming he's successful against
Paul Ingle Saturday at the NYNEX Centre in Manchester, England,
World Boxing Organization featherweight champion Prince Naseem
Hamed appears set to return to Madison Square Garden in July to
fight IBF champion Manuel Medina. That would be a rematch of a 1996
fight won by Hamed with an 11th-round KO . . . HBO's June 19
schedule looks to have top heavyweight prospect Michael Grant
mixing with Lou Savarese and possibly hot prospect Ike Ibeabuchi in
with Jeremy Williams. Ibeabuchi is coming off a stunning knockout
of the Willie Pep of heavyweights, the seldom-hit Chris Byrd.
Typical of ring ratings, the WBC has Ibeabuchi ranked 20th in the
world and Oliver McCall 10th. McCall happens to be in a Virginia
prison . . . IBF bantamweight champion Tim Austin, who may be one
of the 10 best fighters in the world, had his fists full last
weekend before he stopped Sergio Aguia in the ninth round. Austin
was coasting along until Aguia dropped him with a counter left hook
in the second round that put the champion on his back for the first
time in his career. Austin managed to survive and then rallied back
to score his 17th KO in 20 fights . . . WBC president Jose Sulaiman
has scheduled a purse bid for a Roy Jones-Graziano Rocchigiani WBC
light heavyweight title fight April 12 in Mexico City. Psst, Jose:
Jones is fighting IBF champion Reggie Johnson June 5 in a
unification fight . . . In a battle of the geriatric set, Jorge
Paez (62-12-4) will fight Tom ``Boom Boom'' Johnson (47-6-2) for
the IBA Americas (Lord, help us!) junior lightweight title on the
undercard of Morales-McCullough . . . Florida Gov. Jeb Bush fired
the head of the state athletic commission for taking a $100,000
``charitable contribution'' from Don King and then trying to
convince the commission to reverse its position of excluding
long-term contracts between promoters and fighters, a business
practice King is legendary for. Morris ``Mike'' Scionti had been
given the right to resign but he refused and was fired . . . WBO
light heavyweight champion Dariusz Michalczewski issued Roy Jones a
challenge from Germany. ``The fight between Jones and me is what
all boxing fans are waiting for,'' Michalczewski said. ``Roy Jones
has never been in a fight as tough as he would be in with me. I'd
put him under pressure from the beginning and eventually knock him
out.'' During the 4 1/2 years, Michalczewski has defended the WBO
title, the other light heavyweight championships have changed hands
11 times . . . HBO just completed work on a doubleheader featuring
Ivan Robinson vs. Angel Manfredy and IBF lightweight champion Shane
Mosley vs. John Brown, allegedly the only lightweight of a
half-dozen contacted willing to fight Mosley, who is the class of
the 135-pound division . . . Having been involved in his first big
boxing promotion (Holyfield-Lewis), Madison Square Garden president
Dave Checketts said he enjoyed the event (though not the ending)
but found boxing different from the NBA and the NHL by a whole lot.
``This is a very, very different industry,'' Checketts said. ``It's
very unregulated. People have their own agendas. It's a little
intimidating. I can't say I'm exactly comfortable in this
atmosphere.'' Who is?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one of the things that's wrong with boxing. Francisco
Javier Castillejo, newly crowned upset winner of the WBC junior
middleweight title, turned down an $800,000 payday and a no-option
deal to fight a unification bout with IBF champion Fernando Vargas.
Instead he's in line to fight a Costa Rican stiff named Humberto
Aranda who is 13-8 and has no chance to win . . . America Presents,
the promotional company run by Tinley and Goossen, has signed WBC
No. 1-rated welterweight Derrell Coley (33-1-2) . . . Four months
after saying he'd never fight in his native North Dakota again,
two-time light heavyweight champion Virgil Hill will be going back
there May 9 to work on the undercard of a match headlining former
light heavyweight champion William Guthrie and ex-middleweight and
super middleweight champion Michael Nunn. Hill (44-3) holds the
little-known (thankfully) IBC light heavyweight title, if anyone
cares . . . Boxing can still draw interest at all levels despite
its obvious faults, flaws, and flimflam operators. ESPN2's ``Friday
Night Fights'' has seen its ratings jump. In 10 telecasts in the
first quarter of this year (Jan. 8-March 5), the rating went from
.53 to 1.02, with an increase from 288,000 homes tuning in to
644,000. Dating back to last Oct. 2, the rating for that Friday
night time slot has gone from .47 to 1.02 and the number of homes
watching has gone from 247,000 to 644,000 . . . Efforts to make
Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad are ongoing _ witness their
back-to-back fights on HBO in May _ but territorial battles
persist. ``I told Don I'd be prepared to offer him and Trinidad a
large sum plus an upside based on sales, but I run the promotion,''
said Arum, De La Hoya's promoter. ``I got commitments all over the
place with Oscar. My kid's made over $100 million already. There's
no way anybody will promote him in this but us. If King is smart
and money talks, we'll be able to make the fight.'' Sources in the
pay-per-view industry speculate that sales of 800,000 would be
necessary to assure that a De La Hoya-Trinidad fight breaks even .
. . De La Hoya and Oba Carr will both train in Big Bear, Calif. for
their May 22 fight. It's a small town so they'll be hard-pressed to
avoid each other. Interest in the fight is high. The Events Center
at Mandalay Bay holds 11,780 and Las Vegas casinos reportedly have
already ordered 10,500 tickets . . . Don't want to say Floyd
Mayweather likes himself, but at the De La Hoya press conference in
LA, he said, ``They should have called this fight The Ultimate
Package because you're looking at the two best fighters in the
world. Oscar and me.'' Mayweather defends his 130-pound WBC title
vs. Goyo Vargas on the undercard.

ROUSH FIELDS A FORMIDABLE TEAM

 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   BOSTON _ Slowly but surely, Jack Roush is turning the NASCAR
Winston Cup series into his personal playground.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Ford factory-backed owner fields five cars, the
most of any owner on the circuit. The No. 26 Cheerios-sponsored
Ford Taurus of Johnny Benson, the No. 94 John Deere Taurus of Chad
Little, the No. 16 Primestar Taurus of Kevin Lepage, the No. 6
Valvoline Taurus of Mark Martin, and the No. 99 Exide Batteries
Taurus of Jeff Burton, the current points leader, all will carry
the Roush Racing banner when they queue up for the Food City 500
next Sunday at Bristol, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   And next season Roush intends to expand his operation to include
Matt Kenseth, who has become a hot commodity on the Busch Grand
National circuit.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be strength in numbers at Roush Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first six races of the season, Roush Racing has
accounted for three victories, with Burton (twice) and Martin
taking the checkered flag. In addition, four Roush drivers occupy
spots among the Top 20 in points, with Burton leading the way not
only in the Winston Cup series (by 2 over Bobby Labonte, 909-907)
but also the Busch Grand National Series (leading Kenseth by 8
points, 808-800).
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we are really pleased with most of what's happened
this year,'' said Burton, who overcame a disappointing 35th-place
finish in the Daytona 500 to record victories at Las Vegas and
Darlington. ``My problem is I tend to focus where we need to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he, crew chief Frank Stoddard, and team manager
Buddy Parrott ``are working hard with the team to improve on our
three main goals, which are to improve our pit stops, improve our
qualifying, and to run more consistently. If we can continue to
improve in those areas, then we should have a successful season.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They don't call him ``Texas Terry'' for nothing. Terry Labonte,
who hails from Corpus Christi, won a Winston Cup race in his native
Lone Star State for the first time last weekend, steering his No. 5
Kellogg's Cornflakes Chevrolet Monte Carlo to victory under caution
in the Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. With
Texas Gov. George W. Bush among the 200,000 spectators, Labonte
recorded his first victory of the season, outdueling runner-up Dale
Jarrett and younger brother Bobby, who finished third. ``This is
about as big as they come,'' said Terry after pocketing $376,840 .
. . Winston Cup drivers have a rare open date Sunday to enjoy the
Easter holiday, and Martin, Jeff Gordon, and Mike Skinner no doubt
will use the down time to recuperate from their wall encounters at
Texas. All three wound up shredding tires and tapping the wall.
Gordon suffered bruised ribs and a bruised chin from ``the hardest
hit I've ever had,'' while Martin walked away with nothing more
than aches and pains. Skinner suffered the worst, fracturing the
same right shoulder he broke last year at Texas's narrow 1-mile
oval.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four times in his Indy Racing League career, Scott Goodyear has
been so close he could taste victory, only to finish runner-up _ at
Indianapolis and Las Vegas in 1997, at New Hampshire last year, and
at Walt Disney World this year. But Goodyear finally ended his long
wait last week in the MCI WorldCom 200 at Phoenix International
Raceway, getting his first IRL victory after 21 starts. ``It feels
absolutely great,'' said Goodyear, whose triumph vaulted him to the
top of the standings with 93 points. ``It was great for the team.
We finished as high as second before, but this is definitely better
than that. It's a long time coming in the IRL.'' Goodyear led 134
laps, including the last 51, to finish ahead of runner-up Jeff Ward
and third-place finisher Robbie Buhl, who gave his Nissan Infiniti
engine manufacturers a big boost with its best effort of the season
. . . Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa was on hand at the MCI
WorldCom 200 as the guest of the Jonathan Byrd-Cunningham Racing
outfit. When driver John Paul Jr. was knocked from the race in an
accident on Lap 94, Sosa provided Paul with some comfort. ``Don't
take it to heart,'' Sosa was heard telling Paul in the garage area.
``You've just got to put it behind you, because tomorrow will be a
better day. It happens all the time. I've had bad games, but I
don't let them get to me.'' . . . Two-time Indy 500 winner Arie
Luyendyk, who hadn't been behind the wheel of an Indy car since
winning an IRL race last Oct. 11 at Las Vegas, took to the track at
the fabled Brickyard last week along with Robby Gordon, Greg Ray,
Buzz Calkins, and Eliseo Salazar for a Firestone tire test in
preparation for the 83d Indianapolis 500 May 30. Luyendyk, 45, will
make his farewell appearance in the Greatest Spectacle in Racing,
trying to become the ninth driver to win at least three times.
``You usually get all those senses and feel that you need to know
what's going on with the car and the track and the wind, it comes
back pretty quick,'' said Luyendyk, who showed hardly any signs of
rust.

OVERTIME IS MAINE EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
 FINAL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ So what did you expect, a blowout?
</P>
<P>
   Maine and New Hampshire had split their four previous meetings
this season. It only made sense, then, that when they played for
the highest stakes of all _ the NCAA Division 1 men's hockey
championship _ at Arrowhead Pond Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, the game would go
into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   And what an overtime it was, with end-to-end action, scoring
chance after scoring chance, and the two goalies _ Alfie Michaud
for the Black Bears, Ty Conklin for the Wildcats _ extending the
action. But in the end it was Maine that celebrated, as senior
forward Marcus Gustafsson put his own rebound past Conklin at 10:50
of the extra period for a 3-2 Black Bears triumph before 14,447.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafsson's goal lifted Maine to its second NCAA title. It was
a fitting finish to the careers of Maine's seniors, who were not
allowed to participate in the NCAA tournament their first two years
because of NCAA penalties against the school for rules violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first national championship we won in 1993 was for the
state of Maine,'' said coach Shawn Walsh. ``This one was for our
players.''
</P>
<P>
   For the players who stuck with the program when they could have
transferred. For the players who came to the school when they might
have gone elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears grabbed a 2-0 lead early in the second period
and appeared to make it 3-0, but their third goal was disallowed
because a player was in the crease. UNH fought back to force the
overtime, and might have won if not for Michaud, who had 46 saves,
many of them spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Maine finishes 31-6-4, New Hampshire 31-7-3. For the Wildcats,
it was their most wins in a season and their first appearance in an
NCAA championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team, it hurts and it's supposed to hurt,'' said
UNH coach Dick Umile. ``But it takes nothing away from what they've
accomplished. What they accomplished has never been done in the
rich tradition of UNH hockey. But it's tough in the locker room.
It's very difficult to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine took the 2-0 lead on a first-period goal by Ben Guite and
one at 4:10 of the second period by Niko Dimitrakos.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears appeared to make it 3-0 _ the scoreboard put up
the tally _ on a Dan Kerluke goal. But the goal was taken off the
board after video review by officials, who determined that a Maine
player's skate was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   UNH then faced a 5-on-3 power play and was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wildcats survived and battled back to tie.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Haydar scored shorthanded after UNH killed that two-man
disadvantage. Mike Souza scored at 3:33 of the third period from
Haydar and Jason Krog, and it was 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud and UNH's Conklin, who had many outstanding stops among
his 36 saves, led the teams to overtime, though they both had to
fend off some outstanding bids in the final minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Things got wild in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The puck bounced off a UNH defender's skate and pinballed to
Conklin at 2:51. The goalie stood up to a couple of Maine chances a
few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   At about nine minutes in, Filipowicz flipped in for Krog and
Michaud stopped his tip-in attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's David Cullen then hit the side of the post at the other
end.
</P>
<P>
   Maine senior Steve Kariya was not concerned that his team was
seeing chances go by the boards in OT. ``That's overtime,'' he
said. ``If I remember correctly, they had two or three unbelievable
chances in overtime and Alfie shut them down.''
</P>
<P>
   One such bid came when John Sadowski picked up a rebound off a
faceoff, skated in front, and Michaud deflected the puck away. ``He
made a great move _ I thought it was in the back of the net,''
Umile said. ``(Michaud) just got the blade of his stick on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Larose got the puck in to Gustafsson. Gustafsson shot, Conklin
saved, and Gustafsson put in the rebound. And that did it.
</P>
<P>
   Sticks, helmets, and gloves flew in the air. Gustafsson went to
the side of the net and bounced against the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of dazy,'' Gustafsson said. ``I still don't think
it's come over me. It was pure happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustafsson was a freshman on the last Maine team to play in the
NCAA tournament. And dressed in exactly one game all season. He
went back home to Sweden to serve military duty and then, despite
the sedentary freshman year, returned to Maine. He didn't exactly
envision scoring the winner in the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I was hoping,'' he said to laughs in the postgame press
conference. ``But to be realistic, no. But if I kept working, I
thought I might have a chance at it. And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   And how.

TITLE MATCH IS A REAL KNOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ I had a first and, I presume, a
never-to-be-repeated experience Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   I had breakfast on the morning of an NCAA Division 1 hockey
championship game in an IHOP directly across the street from the
main entrance to Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly was the Frozen Four doing in Anaheim? One local
scribe suggested that having Maine and New Hampshire play for the
collegiate hockey championship in Anaheim was like having UCLA and
Stanford play for the collegiate water polo championship in, oh, I
dunno, Caribou. Or Wolfeboro. Somewhere cold, anyway. You get the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   But here we were, in the opulent Arrowhead Pond (which is to the
Fleet as Bloomingdales's is to Wal-Mart), watching the Black Bears
and Wildcats wage a sensational battle in their fifth meeting of
the year, not in Orono, not in Durham, and not even in Boston.
Nope, Marcus Gustafsson gave Maine the national title by a 3-2
overtime score in Anaheim, California, of all bizarre places. But
California or not, it certainly counts.
</P>
<P>
   What the crowd of 14,447 (some 3,000 or so under capacity) saw
was some crackling college hockey. I'm sure a pedigreed hockey
purist in attendance would say that there were too many penalties
in the first two periods (15) and not enough this and not enough
that, but what the fan got for his or her buck was action, with a
Capital A. For all those penalties meant power plays, and power
plays meant scoring chances, and scoring chances meant quality
saves and those ooh-and-aah,
whack-yourself-on-the-side-of-your-head moments that are endemic to
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   And once New Hampshire's Mike Souza took a superb centering feed
from newly minted Hobey Baker Award winner Jason Krog and slipped
the puck past Alfie Michaud at 3:33 of the third period to knot the
game at 2-2, we then settled into 23 minutes of tension-filled
hockey, for it was fairly obvious from that point on that one goal
would decide the game. You just do not get more inherent
palm-sweating in sport than in a hockey game heading for OT.
Especially when it happens to be the single biggest hockey game of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine anyone just kind of popping in to see what was
going on and not being enthralled with the action, all the more so
if the patron's only brush with the sport is the modern NHL
experience. The faster flow of the college game is evident, and
when you combine the endless action with the blissful absence of
the loathsome canned noise and needless visuals that routinely
clutter up every NHL and NBA game these days, and then throw in the
two enthusiastic and skillful bands, what you had was a legitimate
college hockey atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   What we also had was a fairly unpopular new national champion.
Sorry, all you Downeasters, but you might as well face up to the
fact that your squad is distinctly lacking in admirers among the
college hockey diehards, and probably always will be as long as
Shawn Walsh is the coach. The man can coach, all right, but he can
also irritate people and, according to the NCAA, he can also bend
the rules. It will stick in many a craw that he is once again on
top of the college hockey world after being forced to the sidelines
for a full year not so long ago. ``Maine just hasn't done enough
penance,'' said one local maven.
</P>
<P>
   So the sentimental favorite was New Hampshire, and for a while
in this game it seemed that Dick Umile's club was in control of the
momentum after being outplayed by Maine for the game's first 35
minutes or so. Leading, 2-0, the Black Bears appeared to have the
game in their grasp when Dan Kerluke scored on a 2-on-1 rush with
Jason Vittorino. But the play was subjected to review, and the goal
was negated on the basis of an unfortunate Vittorino flash through
the crease prior to the shot.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire took advantage of the reprieve in a startling
manner. First the Wildcats had to kill off a 5-on-3 penalty deal.
But the real fun started when sensational freshman Darren Haydar
jumped out of the penalty box to discover _ could it be? _ yes, the
puck, the biscuit, rolling right to him. It's everyone's dream,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Haydar knew just what to do. He came swooping in on Maine
goaltender Alfie Michaud for an artful breakaway goal. Instead of
being down, 3-0, the Wildcats were right back in it at 2-1. And
just imagine the psychological flip-flop taking place.
</P>
<P>
   When UNH tied it up, Maine had to be cursing the fates, of
course, but that's where Michaud came in, just as he did against
Boston College in the Thursday semifinal. He was strong for the
remainder of the third period, and he was a monster in the OT. He
got his reward when Gustafsson, a native of Knivsta, Sweden, swept
a rebound past Ty Conklin at 10:50 of the extra session.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Southern California had a Harvard man and New
England expatriate named Scott Farden to thank for all this. He is
a pension manager and sports nut who eight years ago had the almost
laughable brainstorm to bring the hockey championships to Anaheim.
He had to be feeling pretty good as he watched this excellent game
and drank in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the game deserved a full house in a hockey-conscious
locale, but as this game unfolded, it was very easy to forget where
we were. The truth is we were in our own little world, watching two
blood rivals put everything on the line. I mean, wow, there were 87
shots on goal in a 3-2 game. You may not need to know anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night I was in attendance as Connecticut beat Duke
for the college basketball crown. As far as I can tell, no other
writer was privileged to see both the basketball and hockey
championship games in person. Sometimes this really is a very cushy
job.

REVOLUTION, ZENGA SHOW THEIR MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The mentality of the Revolution appears to
have been altered, partially by their preseason training trip to
Italy, where defensive soccer is considered an art form.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda of Walter Zenga, who has reinvented himself as
player-coach, seems to be paying off. Zenga, doubtless the best
goalkeeper in Major League Soccer, is displaying a winning touch as
a coach, taking the Italian mentality to the limit by ordering
espresso for the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution performed just well enough offensively,
capitalizing on a Joe-Max Moore goal in the 41st minute, to take a
1-0 victory over the Kansas City Wizards Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. This was
their 15th regulation-time victory with Zenga involved, equaling
their total without him.
</P>
<P>
   After Kansas City's Preki hit the post 22 seconds into the match
and Mo Johnston drove a shot off the bar in the 13th minute, the
Revolution appeared to gain composure. Zenga made key stops without
appearing to expend much effort and calmed his players by his
poised disposition.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the Revolution's few offensive forays in the first
half, Ted Chronopoulos found Johnny Torres, who chipped to Mike
Burns, who was starting at left midfield. Burns proceeded toward
the end line and crossed to Moore, who converted. The Revolution
continued to gain confidence and Burns had a shot deflected off the
post by goalkeeper Chris Snitko two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Revolution seldom threatened, while the
Wizards had two excellent chances. But Zenga kicked away a
point-blank shot by Jake Dancy and Chris Brown sent the rebound
high over an open goal from 18 yards in the eighth minute. In the
25th minute, Preki set up Chris Henderson for a cross, and Zenga
pushed Vicente Figueroa's point-blank header off the underside of
the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution began to find more space as the Wizards pushed
forward in a desperate attempt to tie. Paulo Dos Santos added
energy and helped the midfield flow after replacing Paul Keegan
(sprained knee ligament) after halftime. But Torres misfired on
their best opportunity, inside the penalty area early in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Miami last week we were unlucky in the last five
minutes,'' Zenga said. ``We were just a little lucky in this game.
We lost another player at the end of the first half and I hope
those injuries are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I preferred how we played in the first half because of the
spirit of sacrifice by the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kansas City played well through midfield with Preki and
Refik Sabanadzovic, the Wizards extended their scoreless streak to
550 minutes over two seasons. Meanwhile, the Revolution, with
little midfield flow, displayed a pragmatism that was lacking last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about last year,'' Zenga said. ``I am
happy because the team is following me and my ideas inside the
locker room. We know it is a long season and it is not easy. If we
are lucky, we will be in the playoffs. We are working every day to
improve ourselves, both in practice and in games.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga appears to be restoring the team's self-belief. He has
given them a point of reference, organized the defense, and placed
them in a position to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   With five starters missing, the Revolution had a plan to rely
on. They were content to disrupt the Wizards and counterattack, a
valid formula for the visiting team, especially one that had the
worst record in the league last season. They reverted to some
habits of a year ago, though, surrendering possession needlessly,
especially in the first half. But, unlike last year, they survived,
often because of Zenga's goalkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Only Jair was expected to create from midfield, alongside
defensive midfielders Burns, Keegan, and Ivan McKinley, and he was
often ignored as the Revolution played over midfield instead of
through it. And the emphasis of strikers Moore and Torres was as
much on retreating into defense as attacking. But the tactics suit
this Revolution team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to show somebody that they made a mistake by saying
before the season that New England would be the worst team again
because we have the same players,'' Zenga said. ``This is about
having pride and courage and the will to win. We will work hard and
see what happens by the end of the season.''

WITHOUT BURE, PANTHERS HAVE NO SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was such a blockbuster when it happened, wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure, miserable in Vancouver to the point where he was
willing to sit out the season, was finally dealt Jan. 17 to the
Panthers. His arrival in South Florida was met with great
excitement. The fans were happy, management was ecstatic, and his
teammates had visions of playoff success dancing in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   That all came to a crashing halt last Monday when Bure underwent
reconstructive surgery on his right knee, sidelining him until next
year. It was the second such operation in four years for the
Russian Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout sounded like a government conspiracy: What did
anyone know about the condition of Bure's knee when he was traded
and when did they know it?
</P>
<P>
   In a Palm Beach Post story, team orthopedist David Attarian was
quoted as saying his exam of the player revealed problems with the
knee three games after Bure arrived and that the first
reconstruction to repair the anterior cruciate ligament was already
stretching when the Panthers signed him, which ``set him up for a
series of injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Attarian said his comments were taken out of context and in some
cases, were misquoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said he was destined to have a series of injuries,''
Attarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Bure wanted to try to finish the year wearing a brace and
undergoing rehabilitation in order to avoid surgery, but that
wasn't possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was still soreness to a limited degree and some
looseness, too, and Pavel just didn't feel comfortable skating,''
said Panthers general manager Bryan Murray. ``He didn't feel he
could function at the level he wanted to. We didn't want him to be
in a position where something more could happen to his knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Bure, who electrified crowds with 13 goals and three assists

   It was one of the most memorable and dramatic sports moments of
the 1990s, the video of goalie Patrick Roy leaving the ice during
that dreadful Detroit game, after then-Montreal coach Mario
Tremblay had left him in to suffer in a rout against the Red Wings.
Roy went to the bench, glared at Tremblay, and told team president
Ronald Corey, seated behind the bench, that he was finished as a
Hab.
</P>
<P>
   He was traded four days later to Colorado, but it seemed from
that moment that Roy would take his legacy and loyalty to his next
team forever. Now it appears Roy has reevaluated his ties to
Montreal with regard to his certain entry into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me today which jersey I would wear, it would
probably be the Montreal Canadiens,'' said Roy. ``But if I play
another four or five or six years and we win more Stanley Cups, it
might be another question at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy won Cups in Montreal in 1986, his rookie year, and '93, and
both years was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the playoff
MVP. In 1996, he led Colorado to the Cup in the club's first year
in Denver. Earlier this year, Roy became the winningest goalie in
combined regular-season and playoff victories (not a recognized
record, but impressive nonetheless) and if he stays healthy, he
will likely surpass Terry Sawchuk's record of 447 regular-season
wins next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, if I take away the start, I think I've had one
of my best seasons,'' said Roy, 33. ``I've played with some
consistency after a tough start. Things have turned around really
well for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through all that, he came to terms on a contract extension that
will pay him $500,000 July 1, $7 million next season, $7.5 million
in 2000-01, and $9 million in 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement doesn't seem to have crossed Roy's mind. Funny, it
seems he's been around so long that he must be 100, but he'll be
only 34 in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always prepare yourself to retire,'' he said. ``I think,
`What can I do when I'm done?' Basically, for me, I just love this
game. I'd love to stay in this game. What would I do if I retired?
I have no answer for that.'' The real answer is, anything he wants.

   The Flyers must be wondering whether they're cursed. They had
their playoff hopes endangered Friday when it was learned that Eric
Lindros suffered a collapsed lung and had to be rushed to the
hospital. Lindros is out for the rest of the regular season. It
appears Lindros injured himself by falling on his stick after being
cross-checked in the first period of Thursday's game against
Nashville. Lindros, who remained in Nashville, won't know until
probably late this week how long he will need to recover. ``This is
a serious injury,'' said general manager Bob Clarke. ``The players'
health is of major concern to us. We won't be playing him until all
doctors are very confident that his health is fine.'' In addition,
forward Mark Recchi is sidelined indefinitely because of headaches
and nausea as a result of postconcussion syndrome, John LeClair is
bothered by back spasms, and Eric Desjardins has a knee injury.
Cursed. There is no other explanation . . . So much for loyalty.
Even Chris Chelios's kids didn't seem to have a problem exchanging
Blackhawks uniforms for those of his new team _
the-heavily-favored-Detroit-Red-Wings (from now on, think of it as
all one word). Sons Dean (age 9) and Jake (8) seem to have adjusted
just fine. ``One of the kids has jumped ship pretty quick,'' said
Chelios. ``The oldest one, Dean. They love the Red Wings now and
they were here for the first time and instead of Jocelyn Thibault
being their hero, it's Chris Osgood. My kids love hockey. I taught
them pretty well to understand what happens in hockey.''

   Jaromir Jagr is running away with the league scoring race and is
a cinch to win the Art Ross Trophy, but apparently he's still not
immune from misunderstandings with his coach, Kevin Constantine.
Last weekend, Jagr sat out the first 1:20 of a power play against
Buffalo in a game that was tied, 1-1. Constantine said Jagr elected
not to go out. ``If you look at the last two years, I don't say
anything, he just goes,'' said Constantine. ``I don't tell him one
way or the other, really. So when he stays on the bench and doesn't
go, then I put someone else out there. It's not really my
decision.'' Jagr said he didn't hear his name called, so he stayed
put . . . It sounds crazy but just once, on a Saturday night, with
a full slate of games, wouldn't it be great to have no coaches
behind the bench just for an experiment? It would give fans, the
media, and most important the players, an interesting and perhaps
much-needed perspective . . . The FleetCenter will host the
league's entry draft in June, and one local youngster to root for
is Milton's Mike Ryan. Ryan, who will attend Northeastern next
year, is a terrific forward out of BC High as well as a terrific
kid. Ryan's dad, John, is a Quincy police sergeant . . . With all
due respect to Carolina, it's absurd that a team with a 31-29-16
record is able to be seeded third in the conference. Division play
doesn't really count, so when the seeds are set for the playoffs,
it shouldn't count. It could end up that a team with as many wins
as (or more than) the Hurricanes doesn't make the postseason but
Carolina does by virtue of having the best record in the division.
Absurd . . . Speaking of the 'Canes, goalie Trevor Kidd is worried
about being exposed in the expansion draft in June. Arturs Irbe is
shouldering the bulk of the workload. ``If they're going to make a
decision now based on stats and games played, then you don't have
to be a rocket scientist to figure out that I'm going to be the odd
guy out,'' said Kidd. ``Who knows how much playing time I'm going
to get from now until the end of the season? I might get a couple
of games but we'll see what happens.'' Irbe just signed a new deal,
which isn't good news for Kidd. ``I want to be here,'' said Kidd.
``This place is a great place to play. My family enjoys it here.
But I'm not going to be Mr. Nice Guy again next year playing 22-24
games.'' . . . Panthers left wing Mark Parrish, a candidate for the
Calder Trophy as Rookie of the Year, reached the 20-goal mark a
week ago and earned a $325,000 bonus. Parrish said it was far too
soon to celebrate. ``It was no big deal,'' he said. ``I'll think of
my personal achievements in the summertime but right now I'm more
concerned about making the playoffs than any personal honors. After
we make the playoffs, that's when I'll celebrate.'' Unfortunately
for Parrish, he may be putting that party off until next year . . .
It looks as if the stretch run has taken its toll on Edmonton
goalie Tommy Salo. Salo gave up three goals on three shots in a 7-4
loss last Tuesday before being yanked, and then Thursday, in a 5-1
loss to Toronto, he was yanked again after giving up three goals in
the first. ``I saw an awful lot of panic out there in the first
period,'' said Oilers coach Ron Low. ``I don't know, there's a lot
of guys who haven't been in this kind of race before. If you're not
out there playing the game and having fun, then I think you're in
trouble.'' . . . Senators coach Jacques Martin benched his
fifth-leading scorer in games against Pittsburgh last Tuesday and
Thursday. Andreas Johansson, who has six game-winning goals, was
not pleased. ``Of course I'm mad, like any player would be,'' he
said. ``Everyone wants to play. But I'm going to get back in and be
a better player when I do.'' . . . 14 days to the end of the
season.

MICHAUD SAVES BEST FOR LAST

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There was a ``Father Knows Best'' angle to
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's overtime Maine victory over New Hampshire for the
NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Black Bears junior goalie Alfie Michaud could have transferred
from Maine after the hockey program was hit with a two-year
sanction. Instead he stayed, and Saturday &UR;  &LR; night he was named
tournament Most Valuable Player for his 46-save performance in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a talk with my dad (Alfred) after Maine was hit with
that sanction,'' said Michaud, of Selkirk, Manitoba. ``He told me
that I had given my word to play for Maine and that I should be a
man and keep my word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to think about it too much. It was a case of
keeping my word to the university, and it was the right thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this was a great reward.''
</P>
<P>
   National championship aside, Michaud is glad he stayed. ``Very
glad,'' he said. ``The Maine coaching staff is just great. They
treat me well, and all the coaches really know about hockey and how
to teach it. I'm a better goalie because of the time I spent at
Maine. And I have another year left, and I hope to have more
success. Maine has given a lot to me, and I feel I should give
something back to Maine as a player and as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaud has a habit of skating back and forth in his crease when
there is a faceoff in the enemy end. ``That's something I've been
doing since I was playing junior hockey,'' said Michaud, who
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night recorded his 60th career win. ``I feel it helps
make me relax. I actually talk to myself and I keep telling myself
to stay focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaud went to nearby Crystal Cathedral Saturday and said a
prayer for the success of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it didn't matter who we played out here the last
couple of days,'' Michaud said. ``We played a great Hockey East
schedule during the regular year, and that got us ready for any
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaud felt sorry for losing goalie Ty Conklin (36 saves),
saying, ``He played a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Michaud himself, ``I guess I played well,'' he said.
``Assistant coach Grant Standbrork told me to stay relaxed as much
as possible, and I did that. I know it helped. I actually went into
the game not thinking that it was for the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Shawn Walsh said, ``Alfie was smiling in the locker
room before the game. He was smiling during the game and between
the periods. He played a great game, and he really was smiling at
the end. He's just a winner all the way, and he earned that MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaud arrived at Maine from the Lobret Eagles in the
Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. He was Rookie of the Year in the
1994-1995 season after posting a 3.19 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at Maine, Michaud was 12-2-2 with a 2.39 GGA and
an .899 save percentage. Both losses were in overtime. In 10 of his
wins, he allowed two goals or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Michaud registered a 17-8-1 mark with a 3.14 GAA and
an .890 save percentage. He was named the Hockey East
All-Tournament goalie. He tied a school record with two shutouts
and recorded a career-high 51 saves in a 7-6 overtime win over
Merrrimack College.
</P>
<P>
   What's it all about, Alfie?
</P>
<P>
   He knows what it's all about now. He'll soon be wearing a
championship ring.

LAKERS OUT OF STEP IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Just a little more than a quarter into the game,
Lakers point guard Derek Harper took a step off the court and shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Friday the 13th or something,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's contest was billed as '80s Night at the Forum, but
Harper wasn't referring to the decade's most famous series of
slasher movies. He was merely exasperated over the Lakers' oddly
sluggish showing against the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Lakers wouldn't have minded using Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Jamaal Wilkes, Michael Cooper or any of
the other 80's legends honored at halftime. Because the '99 Lakers
certainly seemed to be in a time warp, playing in an offensive funk
throughout their 81-76 loss to the Warriors in front of 17,505.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange night,'' guard Kobe Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider how strange:
</P>
<P>
   _The Lakers shot an atrocious 34.7 percent from the field,
including 14.3 percent on 3-pointers and 56.4 percent on free
throws. Included in that was Glen Rice's worst game of the season
(4 for 13 overall, 0 for 5 on 3-pointers).
</P>
<P>
   _Forward Dennis Rodman received two technicals with 2:04 left
and the Lakers trailing 73-69, after becoming tangled with Golden
State's John Starks. Rodman tossed his jersey into the stands and
ran off the court while the Lakers lost some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   _Down 77-75 with 24.8 seconds left, Rice fouled Starks. The
Lakers coaching staff was unaware that a foul away from the basket
in the final two minutes results in a free throw and the ball for
the offensive team. So the Warriors (14-18) were able to add a
point to their lead and keep possession of the ball. In other
words, game over.
</P>
<P>
   _Lakers coach Kurt Rambis visited the officials' locker room
after the game for a rules interpretation of the play, something
that would have better served the team before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he discussed with the officials, Rambis said: ``Don't
ask another question about that. I won't answer another question. I
was very disappointed with my team's performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange night, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly, man. That's all I could say,'' Harper said. ``It
was a very ugly game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harper missed an open layup and Rice bricked two free
throws at the outset, Bryant knew something was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Glen missed those first two free throws, I thought, `Oh,
oh. Strange night tonight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But not so unusual after all, in that the Lakers (22-12) lost
another game to a team they were expected to beat and seem far from
being the team people envisioned with the acquisitions of Rodman
and Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a championship team now,'' Rice said. ``A lot of
times we play good, but to be a championship team, you have to do
it all the time. A lot of times we think we can just win on talent
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell what was more ill-timed, aside from the
Lakers' shooting. Rodman's technicals came after he tried to pry
the ball from Starks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He head-locked me and kind of wrestled me down,'' Starks said.
``I don't know if he's got a problem, but I don't understand it.
OK, I do understand it, but I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was livid over the call. ``What's new? I've got to be the
only guy in the history of the NBA to get thrown out for doing
nothing. Not throwing a punch, not harassing the referees, not
doing nothing, but by me saying the simplest things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman didn't seem to indicate any remorse over the incident,
but Bryant thought otherwise. ``I didn't think it was the wisest
choice and I think he knows that,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the rules blunder, which left the players dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to foul,'' Rice said. ``I guess it's one of the
things where we need to learn the right situations. I don't think
too many people we're aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bryant: ``We were told to foul.''

REVIEW SYSTEM FOR HOSPITALS IS AILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>

   &UR;  &LR; (Third of four parts)
</P>
<P>
   WESTERLY, R.I. _ The hospital cops were coming that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Their hefty title alone _ the Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Healthcare Organizations _ should have been enough to send
tremors through the ranks of doctors, nurses, and orderlies at
Westerly Hospital. Then there was the $22 million in federal
Medicare money the facility would lose, along with having the state
yank its license, if it failed to win accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Westerly staffers really might have been scared if they weren't
so thoroughly prepared. They'd been rehearsing for a year, with
nearly 30 drills on everything from how to keep track of drugs to
when to keep patients restrained. They'd known for six weeks when
the inspectors would be coming, and for two weeks who they would
be. Just to be safe, the hospital paid $180 for profiles of the
reviewers that predicted their pet peeves and how tough they might
be.
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't a big surprise when Westerly got a score of 91 out
of a possible 100 points in its inspection last fall. But then the
average score of hospitals nationwide last year was 92, with fewer
than 1 percent denied approval, leading many to wonder whether the
Joint Commission is more pussycat than police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long we have treated professional and institutional
licensure as a kind of entitlement, the way many judges in DWI
cases treat a driver's license as a kind of entitlement,'' says
Bruce Vladeck, a professor at Mount Sinai Medical School in New
York who until two years ago ran the federal Medicare program. ``We
have to be much more demanding of everyone involved in the health
care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Siward Hazelton, leader of the Joint Commission's inspection
team at Westerly, has similar worries: ``Our concern is that the
organization focuses only on the score of their report.''
</P>
<P>
   But Westerly Hospital vice president Walter Pannone says the
endless rehearsals mean that his hospital, which already has a good
reputation, is perpetually getting better. The cleaning and
cross-checking before the Joint Commission arrives is merely
``spiffing up,'' adds Pannone, who let a reporter and photographer
tag along during the recent review. ``We're having company so we've
shined up the place and buffed it to look nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the Joint Commission leave and then let your
guard down. You'd never survive that way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Reviewers facing review themselves
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Routine inspections like the one at Westerly are a single thread
in a web of regulation that is supposed to ensure that US hospitals
are safe. But amid mounting concerns about why hospitals make so
many dangerous and expensive errors, the reviewers themselves are
coming under critical review.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health has taken the
lead in rooting out and redressing hospital mistakes. It has one of
the nation's toughest regulations requiring hospitals to report
drug, surgical, and other errors that cause serious injuries, and
it encourages individual whistle-blowers. All of which has paid
off: Last year the DPH received 123 complaints that its
investigators proved were valid, a fourfold increase from four
years before.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that even with their tough rules, health
officials admit they have to rely on the press to find out about
many of the most troubling cases, including back-to-back maternal
deaths two years ago at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. DPH also doesn't
sufficiently mine malpractice cases for clues they could provide to
wrongdoing. And it almost always gets involved only after things
have gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public isn't satisfied and shouldn't be satisfied with
retrospective reviews, after the tragedy has occurred,'' concedes
Nancy Ridley, the assistant commissioner of health who oversees
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Registration in Medicine also has a program
to reduce hospital errors, one that is considered a national model.
Hospitals are required to report unexpected deaths or troubles to
the board, then work with it to address underlying issues. The
board carries a big stick _ the power to ban doctors from
practicing in hospitals that don't comply _ but it has never used
that power. It prefers the carrot of letting hospitals withhold the
names of those making mistakes, and keeping even those sanitized
reports confidential, which helps explain why it turns up four
times as many incidents each year as the DPH does through its more
public process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way you can do it, there's no way you can
police from the outside,'' says Dr. Arnold Relman, who chairs the
committee overseeing the program. ``Only doctors understand what
needs to be done to provide good care. No lawyers or bureaucrats or
anyone else knows how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidentiality, however, makes it difficult to assess
whether the program works, and a meager staff makes it tough for
the board to identify and punish hospitals that are not reporting.
The board also has come under renewed fire recently for being slow
to act against doctors who repeatedly make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   What about the US Health Care Financing Administration, which
has a duty under the federal Medicare program to ensure that
participating hospitals are safe?
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration has delegated most of
its oversight responsibilities to the state, and HCFA and the state
rely on the Joint Commission for regular reviews of hospitals. The
trouble is that the Department of Public Health and HCFA only
occasionally look over the Joint Commission's shoulder to see how
it is doing, and when they do, they aren't always pleased with
their findings.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case two years ago at Newton-Wellesley. The state
went in to investigate the deaths of several mothers delivering
babies and uncovered what it called serious systemic troubles. But
the Joint Commission, in its review just a year before, gave
Newton-Wellesley a score of 97 along with a commendation, an honor
bestowed that year on just the top 18 percent of America's
hospitals. Newton-Wellesley also got high marks from the commission
in precisely the areas where the state said there were problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be concerned'' about those discrepancies, says
Margaret Leoni-Lugo, the top hospitals regulator in HCFA's New
England office. ``We in HCFA could do a better job of looking at
what our process is to evaluate the Joint Commission's process.''
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers have their own processes for policing hospitals,
as do peer review organizations within hospitals. Insurers screen
patient records for errors and encourage hospitals to address any
they turn up; peer reviewers also try to ferret out mistakes, but
given the fear of malpractice suits, they try to keep any they find
out of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At best, having all those different people poking around
hospitals offers multiple defenses against errors, some going after
them from inside, others watching from without.
</P>
<P>
   More often, however, the pieces of the regulatory jigsaw puzzle
just don't seem to fit. The health department would like the Board
of Registration to forward information about systemic problems at
hospitals, but that hasn't happened. The DPH could regularly review
Joint Commission reports, but it doesn't. And regulators seldom
visit hospitals, but when something goes wrong they pile on in a
way that can sap staff morale and scare away patients.
</P>
<P>
   Government and hospital leaders are trying to address those
issues through the Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of
Medical Errors, which was launched two years ago. But Ridley, the
DPH official, says coordination ``can be even better. It needs to
be better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Learning from other high-stakes fields
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One way to see how inspectors could do a better job rooting out
hospital errors is to take a lesson from the people who inspect
airplanes and nuclear power plants. Both offer tempting comparisons
since, as with medicine, their operations are highly complex,
high-stress, and high-stakes.
</P>
<P>
   A basic premise of the airline and nuclear industries is not
just that errors can happen, but that they will. That's why
regulators insist that airplanes and reactors have redundant safety
systems. It's why alarms and other devices back up fallible humans
and fallible machines. And it's why the Japanese and French, who
may build the world's best nuclear plants, build them as much alike
as possible, letting engineers at one plant learn from errors at
other plants in a way that's difficult in the United States given
the endless variation among US reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In medicine we've always had this attitude that we're going to
take the brightest and best and teach them so they don't make
mistakes,'' says Dr. John Noble, a professor of medicine at Boston
University and vice chairman of the Joint Commission. ``That's
fallacious. We've always made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the notion that systems are more to blame than
individuals for what goes wrong in reactors and airplanes _ and
that to get people to provide critical information on those systems
failures, people must be insulated from punishment. That's why the
Federal Aviation Administration and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration strip the names off reports of near misses in
the air and study the patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give up the ability to react to an event in return for
being able to react to a pattern,'' says Dr. Donald Berwick, head
of the Boston-based Institute for Healthcare Improvement. By
contrast, he adds, when something goes wrong in medicine, the way
it did when Boston Globe health columnist Betsy A. Lehman died of a
hospital-administered drug overdose five years ago, ``the people
who suffer the most are the relatively helpless individuals who are
trapped in a flawed system that they didn't create and couldn't
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't make anything safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson from the worlds of jets and nuclear plants is
that while quality can't be imposed by outside regulators, those
regulators are essential. They encourage the sharing of safety
lessons, ensure that quality control programs are in place, and
when a utility or airline breaks the rules repeatedly, they shut
them down the way the FAA did three years ago with ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, not a single person died from an American airline
accident. That's 616 million passengers and no fatalities,'' says
Dr. Lucian Leape, who teaches at the Harvard School of Public
Health and authored a pioneering study on hospital errors.
``They've taken something that intrinsically is very hazardous _
flying an airplane _ and made it very safe. We need to apply those
same concepts to doing our work in medicine.''
</P>
<P>

Key overseer taking hard look at its methods
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Commission, the single most important group overseeing
America's more than 5,000 hospitals, seems to have gotten the
message that it has to fundamentally alter its strategies and
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure the shift in the commission's increasingly
effective program for tracking ``sentinel events,'' or mistakes
that hurt patients but can help other hospitals avoid similar
problems. Hospitals are now reporting more sentinel events in a
single quarter than they did for an entire year when the tracking
began four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear the new thinking as Dr. Dennis O'Leary, president
of the Joint Commission, explains how this year he'll begin using
comparative death rates and other performance measures to hold
hospitals accountable for care they deliver and mistakes they make.
He's also looking for ways to inspect hospitals as often or seldom
as they need it, rather than today's standard three-year review, as
well as to temper the inflation of commission scores.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, you can see the changes already underway by
following Joint Commission inspectors on reviews like the one last
year at the 125-bed Westerly Hospital near the Connecticut-Rhode
Island border. The reviewers spent less time than they used to
going over paperwork and checking against the commission's 550
standards, and more looking over doctors' shoulders, tracking
nurses, and looking for evidence that the hospital is making
quality a consideration in everything it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our style has changed,'' says Michael Cronin, one of the
inspectors at Westerly. ``You're seeing the Joint Commission
spending more time trying to teach hospitals things we see working
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Making hospitals safer, however, won't be easy for the Joint
Commission. And it may be even tougher to transform its image as a
captive of the industry it oversees.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly a function of the organization's makeup: Seven of
its 28 board members represent the American Hospital Association,
and another 15 come from other parts of the medical industry, such
as the American Medical Association. The commission also almost
never turns down a hospital for accreditation, and it has a
nonprofit subsidiary that hospitals can hire to help them prepare
for inspections. What's more, hospitals foot the hefty bill for
Joint Commission inspections, which in Westerly's case was $17,000
for a three-day visit by three reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the name the commission gives its inspectors _ it calls
them surveyors _ reinforces the sense they're not there as
independent reviewers but as part of a process of self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke, it really is,'' says Dr. Sidney Wolfe, president
of the Health Research Group, a Washington-based consumer
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been talking about reforms for 14 or 15 years,'' Wolfe
adds. ``Their response to all the criticism is, `We're changing
it.' It's just like a floating crap game: The changes that have
been made are mainly ones favored by hospitals that they
regulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives, however, say the Joint Commission is too
tough and too nitpicking, too likely to take away points for
problems that mainly involve paperwork and unlikely to give them
credit for running a safe hospital in tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Berwick of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement takes a
middle ground: ``The conventional wisdom is that the Joint
Commission is the fox watching the chicken coop. That comment comes
from people who haven't been there and looked at it. Its problem is
more a lack of systemic thinking. It still is regulating as if
hospitals were a cottage industry.''

<P>
   It depends who you ask. Here's what various agencies and
researchers have come up with for 1998, or for the most recent year
they studied. Their definitions of mistakes differ slightly, but
most involve preventable errors that resulted in injury or death.

elsewhere: a total of more than 2 million a year nationwide.

SEEKING A PRESCRIPTION AGAINST MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Last in a series of four) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY -- Hospital executives used to blanch when the
conversation turned to medical errors. Now they're the ones
bringing them up.
</P>
<P>
   The particular errors aren't any easier to acknowledge, but
there's a growing realization that the problem is so widespread and
deep-seated that it can no longer be avoided -- and that mistakes
are relatively easy to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that in Cleveland, hospitals are publishing their
failure rates on everything from caesarean sections to bowel
resections, so patients can compare. In Philadelphia, they're
installing computers in doctors' offices to teach them how to avoid
mistakes. And in Boston they're pioneering software that makes it
almost impossible to prescribe too many drugs, or too few.
</P>
<P>
   America's most ambitious laboratory for error-proofing a
hospital, however, is here at the base of Utah's Wasatch Mountains.
Doctors at LDS Hospital have waged a 15-year war against mistakes,
and they now have 60 models being applied from Austria to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   They started with simple things, like seeing whether patients
were getting antibiotics during the critical two hours before
surgery. Everyone knew that would reduce infections, but they also
found that in the typical preoperative tumult the drugs were given
too early or too late. When they finally got the timing down, the
infection rate fell by a factor of four.
</P>
<P>
   Same with pneumonia. Doctors at rural clinics began paying more
attention to using the right drugs at the right time -- and saved
20 lives in the first year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in those and other cases was startlingly simple:
Doctors and nurses typically know what to do, but hospitals are so
complex that things often don't get done right. Orders are issued,
but the key to rooting out errors is ensuring those orders are
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity of modern medicine makes it very difficult to
execute well,'' says Dr. Brent James, who spearheaded many of the
changes. ``I am convinced that we would see major improvements in
medical outcomes -- on the order of what new science like genetic
breakthroughs are likely to produce -- if we could just apply what
we already know consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't the only true believer. Dr. Arnold Milstein, who
advises California's biggest businesses on health issues, says that
``1999 is a great moment in history to take a leap forward in this
area of medical errors. The beauty of raising it now is that there
are solutions in our tool shed, they just aren't being utilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health plans are getting a wake-up call that the time is
limited during which they can continue to expose their hospitalized
patients to these kinds of avoidable errors. It's the end of an
era.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals institute corrective measures Bay State hospitals were
among the first to get the message, and to act on it.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest place to measure the results is at places like
Franciscan Children's Hospital in Brighton, which experienced one
of the most tragic cases of things going wrong. The death there in
1996 of Alexis Masiello, a 2 1/2-year-old who slowly suffocated
after her breathing tube became disconnected, led officials to
overhaul equipment and policies.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital replaced most of its old-style ventilators. It
installed a network that lets nurses check a patient's condition
from a computer screen in every other patient's room and that
filters out some of the false alarms that may have delayed the
response to Masiello. And glass walls replaced concrete ones to
give nurses a better view into rooms with patients who need more
frequent checking.
</P>
<P>
   Procedures were transformed, too -- to make it more likely that
problems identified in areas like patient surveillance are
corrected, to ensure that nurses arrange for cross-coverage when
they're away from their patients, and to be certain that equipment
is maintained the way it is supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Since the hospital was unsure just what caused the slow response
to Masiello, it made changes that ``address the whole spectrum'' of
possibilities, explains Paul J. DellaRocco, Franciscan's president.
As for whether the financially-strapped hospital did the right
thing making such expensive changes, DellaRocco says that ``only
time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center have
been struggling with similar issues, trying to balance tight
budgets while putting into practice lessons learned from the 1997
death of Alexis's mother, Michele, at Memorial Hospital, which is
now part of the UMass hospital system. They have tightened
procedures for handling drug overdoses, revised the way they order
restraints, mandated more careful handoff of care from one nurse or
doctor to another, and otherwise sought to answer doubts the
Department of Public Health raised about their treatment of Michele
Masiello.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases and others, hospitals have followed a basic
formula: Ferret out the systems and people at the root of the
problem, then figure out how to prevent not just that mistake but
any that are related.
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors and nurses ran such a
root-cause analysis last year after Charles Merritt Jr., a
79-year-old chemist from Winthrop, went into a coma and later died
after doctors treated him for a stroke when he really was having an
insulin reaction. The hospital upgraded its operations to ensure
that laboratory results get to caregivers quicker and more
accurately, that everyone understands the needs of
insulin-dependent patients, and that other things that went wrong
with Merritt are less likely to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't find epiphanies in most of these cases. We find
tweaking, continuous tweaking,'' explains Maryanne Spicer, Mass
General's compliance chief.
</P>
<P>
   Good hospitals generally don't tweak their operations only after
something goes wrong; they do it all the time as part of the health
care industry's new mantra of continuous quality improvement. CQI
means putting in place as many fail-safe systems as possible, and
finetuning them even when they seem to be working. And it means
``making the right thing to do, the easiest thing to do, whether
it's in the doctor's office, the emergency room or the operating
room,'' says Dr. James Reinertsen, a long-time advocate of quality
improvement and the chief executive officer of CareGroup, the
parent company of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make it hard to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   They're trying the same thing at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
the Mayo Clinic, Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, the University of
Pennsylvania Medical Center, and scores of other facilities here
and around the nation. And it's not just big hospitals that are
pushing hard on the error-prevention front, although they are more
likely to have the resources to experiment with new and
often-costly systems.
</P>
<P>
   At the 118-bed Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, members of
the hospital staff have been testing creative ways to cut errors
since 1995, well before it became a priority in the wider world of
medicine. They devised 20 fail-safe systems for drug orders alone,
along with ways to make sure the wrong limbs are not operated on
and the right X-rays are shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little hospitals can do it faster and safer,'' says Linda
Shyavitz, Sturdy's president. ``We joke that we're really glad that
Nike gave up its old motto because now we can use it: Just Do It.''
</P>
<P>
   Drive is on to prevent errors As ambitious as the efforts of
individual hospitals are, the movement against medical mistakes is
likely to become even more intense and effective in the near
future. That's partly because the oft-criticized hospital
regulators are making the prevention of errors a major priority,
and because big state and national groups are joining the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recognized that it
is not just a tragedy for the patient when a doctor cuts off the
wrong leg or repairs the wrong knee, which happens about 50 times a
year nationwide. It's also embarrassing for doctors. So about a
year ago it began pushing its 16,000 members to use an indelible
pen to sign their initials on the limb they want to operate on, so
it would be almost impossible to mistake. A recent survey found
that 40 percent of academy members are following its advice.
</P>
<P>
   Other orthopedic surgeons have their own signature approaches to
minimizing errors, from writing ``no'' in big letters on the joint
or limb not to be done, to drawing an arrow pointing to the one
slated for surgery. Some place an ``x'' on the spot, but it's
sometimes unclear whether that's the limb to operate on or to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong-site surgery is something we can wipe out like we wiped
out polio,'' says Dr. S. Terry Canale, first vice president of the
academy and the leader of its signing drive. ``Most doctors who
don't do it don't know about it, or their ego is too big, or
they're too busy. The guy who is too busy is the guy we want to get
to, because he's the guy who's going to make the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association also is involved in
error-prevention, mainly through its three-year-old National
Patient Safety Foundation. It is spending about $5 million for
research on ways to enhance safety, and is laboring to get people
thinking and talking about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Coalition for the Prevention of Medical
Errors recently moved from the talking stage to the doing. The
group, founded two years ago and involving everyone from hospitals
and doctors to government regulators, this month told every Bay
State hospital about concrete things they can do to reduce
medication errors. Some are relatively quick and painless, like
using individual packages of medicine that contain just the dose
patients need, and ensuring a pharmacist is on-call even if one
isn't on duty; others are longer-term and more expensive, such as a
computerized drug-ordering system that eliminates the risk of
handwriting errors and catches incorrect dosing.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning. Hospitals soon will be getting
suggestions on ways to avoid operating on the wrong site, how and
when to use patient restraints, and other things the coalition
hopes will keep Massachusetts out in front of the error-prevention
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to prevent errors is ``a comparable social movement to
underage smoking,'' says Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice president
of the Massachusetts Hospitals Association and a leader in the
coalition. ``It's a huge societal collaboration between health
organizations, schools, the media, etc. . . . And the stakes are at
least as high (as with smoking), if not higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups offer other advice on ways to keep errors from
happening. The non-profit Institute for Safe Medication Practices
keeps tabs on the latest drug-related mistakes and tells hospitals
how to avoid them. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations is moving to let hospitals more easily
compare success and failure rates on procedures like heart bypass
surgery, which can signal if they are making more or fewer errors
than their counterparts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Even the US Army is getting involved. It's sponsoring an
experiment to see whether lessons on performing under pressure that
were learned in commercial aviation can be applied to the equally
high-stress environment of a hospital emergency room. The answer so
far is an unequivocal yes, with errors dropping by as much as 80
percent after emergency department staffers are taught teamwork and
other approaches used by pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot initiative, which includes Holy Famil Hospital in
Methuen, ``is not a panacea,'' says Robert Simon, manager for the
project, which is being run for the Army by Dynamics Research
Corporation of Andover. ``But teamwork offers a lot of
opportunities to break the error chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding ways to make it safer Breaking the error chain has been
a preoccupation bordering on obsession for 15 years at LDS Hospital
in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   It may have something to do with the single-minded determination
of its original owners: the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, or Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the high standards key staffers here learned while
training at teaching hospitals in Boston, then applied in Salt Lake
City's competitive private hospital market. Or it may be the fact
that LDS linked up to computers so early and exhaustively,
installing a terminal in every patient's room 10 years ago and
doing away with paper records, all of which gave it such good
measurements of patient care that it could easily assess whether
improvement schemes were yielding real improvements in patient
health.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the result is a series of elegantly simple
and exceedingly effective ways of making basic treatments work
better.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the situation with surgical infections. Doctors here
and elsewhere have recognized for years that administering
antibiotics within the two-hour window before surgery could reduce
wound infections by a factor of four or more. But their studies
also showed that the drugs sometimes were administered in the
patient's room, other times in the waiting room or operating room.
The bottom line was that they were given at the right time just 40
percent of the time at LDS, which actually was better than at many
of Boston's biggest hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: nurses now set up a bag with antibiotics at the
same time that they start a patient on intravenous fluids, and
anesthesiologists turn on the antibiotics at the same time they
start their sedatives. The result: hospital compliance with the
two-hour rule soared from 40 to 99 percent, while its post-surgery
infection rate fell from 1.8 to 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For patients, that meant dozens of fewer cases each year of
painful, disfiguring, and sometimes deadly infection, while for the
hospital it meant an annual savings of $750,000 in treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
   The savings have been equally dramatic with a computer-order
system for drug prescriptions that not only catches doses that are
too high or low, but uses a patient's medical history to prevent
potentially dangerous allergic reactions. That cut by two-thirds
the number of severe drug errors and yielded the hospital a savings
of $500,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases and scores of others LDS doctors took a novel
approach: rather than looking to scientific breakthroughs or more
expensive machines and drugs to upgrade their care, they looked to
getting more from existing technologies and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than put quality assurance in a quality assurance
department, it has become part of our practice and our research,''
explains Dr. David Classen, who set up the pioneering computer
system and helped concoct the error-resistant ways to execute
treatments. ``The model for all our work is, don't assert blame,
don't assign error. Find a problem and fix it.''

FATAL ERROR BECOMES CATALYST FOR REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Sidebar, Part II, Hospital Errors)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN ROMANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was more than just a colossal mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   More than four years after a patient's death from a chemotherapy
overdose at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, hospital officials are
still crisscrossing America in an effort to help prevent similar
tragedies. It's precisely the sort of effort that experts say is
needed if the war against medical errors is to be won.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dana-Farber is a far different place than it was in 1994,
when Globe health columnist Betsy A. Lehman died while receiving
treatment for breast cancer. A physician order-entry computer
system catches medication errors before they reach the patient.
Teams of physicians and nurses work together to discuss the way
care is delivered. Patients and their families are included on
committees and provided the means to educate themselves about their
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, staffers are encouraged to be forthcoming
about errors that might occur.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Boston hospital has been a catalyst for
other cancer centers to make changes. A survey of 12 major centers
across the country showed that more than half switched to a safer
method of implementing medication orders following Lehman's death.
Several, including New York's Sloan-Kettering Hospital, have turned
to computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system in the cancer industry is not fixed,'' says Jim
Conway, chief operating officer at Dana-Farber. ``But we have
improved patient safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when Dana-Farber physicians scribbled
handwritten notes on a pad of paper. Today, oncologists sit in
front of a computer screen and fill out an electronic form that
asks for the name of the drug, its intended dosage and the number
of days it is to be dispensed. If the physician makes a mistake --
typing 400 milligrams instead of 40 milligrams, or asking for the
medication to be dispensed over three days instead of one -- the
computer signals a potential error.
</P>
<P>
   Only when all the information jibes with the computer's cache of
data can the physician sign off. After that, the order must travel
through a system of checks involving a series of specially trained
nurses and pharmacists. ``It doesn't save time,'' says Dr. Charles
Fuchs, chief of ambulatory care at Dana-Farber. ``But it's time
better spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Bartell, head of pharmacy, says eliminating errors is the
goal, ``but you know errors will happen because humans are behind
the systems. But you hope the systems are safe enough so the errors
are caught before they reach the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is an adaptation of one that has been in place since
1993 at Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital, where Dana-Farber's patients
are now hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer institute became exclusively an out-patient facility
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have to make dozens of decisions a day,'' explains
John Glaser, who helped spearhead the transformation and is now
vice president of information at Massachusetts General Hospital and
the Brigham. ``They make mistakes, and sometimes people get hurt.
We determined that things could be improved at the point when the
physician is making the order.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Brigham, the computer system is credited with catching
400 errors a week out of 13,000 medication orders. ``The dose might
be too high, or the wrong test is being administered, or it might
tell you that if you use a different drug it might be cheaper,''
says Glaser. '`Overall, it means that someone is getting better
care thanks to the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar system is now up and running at Mass General, and
Glaser says discussions are underway to upgrade systems at two
other affiliated hospitals, North Shore and Newton-Wellesley.
Elsewhere, Boston Medical Center and Children's Hospital are both
in the process of implementing computer systems. Although
Dana-Farber's system cost $1.7 million, Glaser says money isn't the
biggest obstacle for hospitals looking to convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some places get nervous,'' he explains. ``Sometimes it's a
case as to whether their physicians will do it or instead say, `I
won't do it, I'm not a clerk.' `` Indeed, one of Conway's biggest
challenges when he left Children's Hospital for Dana-Farber was to
change the environment at the institute. ``We had a lot of people
working hard but not the mechanism for them to work together,'' he
says. ``It was a major piece of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lev, a cancer survivor who has been a patient at
Dana-Farber since 1989 and serves on several committees, is
grateful for the change: ``The place used to be very conservative,
very Harvard. Their way was the best way. But when Betsy Lehman
died, there wasn't a person in the institution who didn't feel the
anguish and the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   A computer system probably could have caught the error that led
to Lehman's death. Along with another breast cancer patient, she
received 4,000 milligrams of a chemotherapy drug for four
consecutive days rather than the intended 1,000 milligrams per day.
The error was attributed to a clinical fellow, who wrote an order
for the total dosage of 4,000 milligrams using an order form
intended to indicate the daily dose. Lehman, who voiced concerns
about her condition, died three weeks later, while the other
patient, aged 52, suffered serious heart damage and subsequently
died of her cancer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Lehman's death was not discovered until two months
later when a data manager noticed the dosage error while inputting
information on a breast cancer study. After it became public,
Dana-Farber wasted little time making changes and speaking out. In
the first three years alone, hospital officials and staffers took
part in more than 40 seminars around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unique is there was no shortage of people willing to
jump on a soapbox and tell the world, this is what we did,'' says
Fuchs. ``We could have stopped there but we didn't. We created a
conscience. We became a vanguard on how to do it safely and promote
good care.'' Dennis O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most hospitals fall short of experiencing the cultural
transformations of the degree Dana-Farber did,'' says O'Leary.
``They were eventually forthcoming in dealing with the issue, but
what they ended up doing was transforming the whole ethos of the
organization. Their behavior was unusual. They are a model to be
held forth.''

FAMILY'S TRAGEDIES REVEAL FLAWS IN MEDICAL SYSTEMS

   &UR;  &LR; (First of four parts)
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Alexis Masiello was going to go home.
</P>
<P>
   After spending her entire 2 1/2 years in hospitals undergoing a
dozen operations to repair birth defects in her chest and stomach,
after thousands of hours of therapy and meals delivered by drip,
the chocolate-haired toddler was at last going home. Her father had
quit his job to take care of her, her mother was putting the
finishing touches on her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night of Oct. 10, 1996, the medical system at
Franciscan Children's Hospital in Brighton that had kept Alexis
alive failed her. Sometime after 7:30 her breathing tube became
disconnected. Alarms should have sounded, and may have, but no one
came. The licensed practical nurse assigned to Alexis was meeting
with an insurance executive. A childcare worker eventually noticed
warning lights on a TV monitor, but it was too late. By then,
Alexis's brain had been robbed of oxygen for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later Alexis Masiello died, without ever making it
home.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Masiello drew into herself after the death of her
daughter Alexis. She'd already been stretched by the demands of
three children at home in Oxford and one in the hospital in
Brighton, a divorce and remarriage, and her job as a paralegal. One
steamy day in July she swallowed several fistfuls of pills, then
was taken by ambulance to Worcester's Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Again, things went wrong. Nurses gave her medicine to calm her.
When that didn't work they restrained her, then apparently left her
unattended. Sometime over the next 90 minutes she coughed up and
inhaled the powder they'd given her to absorb the overdosed drugs.
This blocked her airway. By the time nurses checked on her she'd
stopped breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Michele died 10 days later, nine months to the day after her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Masiello cases are more than isolated tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   They are a lens into the unsettling and unseen world of
medication errors, faulty diagnoses, delays in treatment, and other
preventable mistakes in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, such mishaps were as carefully cloaked as the
Masiello cases have been, and were rationalized as inevitable in a
complex health system that relies on caregivers who, despite heroic
efforts, are fallible humans operating under intense pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, hospital errors have become a red-hot topic
across the world of medicine. It's partly that researchers have
documented how widespread they are, with more than 300 people dying
and another 3,000 being seriously injured every day in America
because of mistakes made in the very facilities that were supposed
to make them better. It's also that regulators are shifting from
blaming individuals to looking at flaws in the system that
encourage errors, which is beginning to make doctors, nurses, and
administrators more willing to own up to errors and act to prevent
future ones.
</P>
<P>
   Seen in this context, the Masiello cases are instructive. They
happened at two hospitals considered top-notch. They occurred in
part because systems designed to protect patients broke down. Most
of all, what happened to Alexis and Michele suggests how widespread
serious medical errors are today _ widespread enough that they
could happen twice within a year to the same family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Michele nor Alexis should have died,'' says Gary
Masiello, Michele's husband and Alexis's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to understand how it happened, how it could
happen twice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A young life spent in a hospital
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alexis never knew life outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Born at Memorial, she was transferred to Massachusetts General
for surgery when she was less than a month old. After eight months
in the pediatric intensive-care unit, she was discharged to
Franciscan. The Masiellos chose the Brighton facility, founded 50
years ago by Joseph P. Kennedy, because it was the only place in
the region capable of helping a child with such a long list of
needs make the jump from hospital to home.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis posed a special challenge almost from the start. She had
trouble talking, in part because of the tracheostomy tube jutting
out from her neck. She had trouble moving, given the patchwork of
lines linking her to life-sustaining breathing and feeding
equipment. And while she was affectionate and curious, her nurses
say her learning was a slow process.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexis was a fighter, having survived repeated operations to
separate her trachea from her esophagus, which were fused from
birth, and to repair her kidney, stomach, lungs, and urinary tract.
Now she was beginning to communicate with sign language, and to
make do with what entertainment she could find within easy reach of
her crib.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that often meant playing with the ventilator that
helped her breathe. Nine months after Alexis arrived at Franciscan,
her nurses' notes indicate that she ``made several attempts to
reach vent and dials. Was successful first time.'' Two months
later, she managed to kick off her tubing, and when nurses reached
her, she was ``slightly cyanotic,'' a condition of oxygen
deprivation that turned her face purplish-blue. And a September
1996 report warned that Alexis had suffered a ``blue spell again''
and would ``disconnect self frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she fiddled with her equipment to get attention; other
times it was her way of alerting nurses that mucus was clogging her
tube. Hospital staff responded by moving the breathing machine out
of reach and suggesting she be monitored more carefully. ``Watch
closely for safety,'' one nurse wrote in September. Later that
month another nurse urged that a ``team discussion'' be held ``to
come up with plan to address patient's playing with equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   That meeting never was held, although there were informal
discussions that led to her being weaned off the ventilator during
the day. Her father, meanwhile, says he never was told about Alexis
playing with her breathing machine or about the episodes where
she'd turned blue after disconnecting it. And Dr. Gerald M.
Loughlin, a professor of pediatrics at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins
Medical School hired by Gary Masiello's lawyer, says Franciscan
staffers should have recognized that Alexis's history of tampering
with equipment put her ``at great risk for a catastrophic event.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Alexis really at risk?
</P>
<P>
   Franciscan administrators insist she wasn't, given all their
safety systems. There were alarms set to sound at her bedside and
at two nursing stations when her heart or respiratory rates fell
too low, and two more that rang only at her bedside to signal
troubles with the ventilator or air heater. There were twice as
many nurses and respiratory therapists as at a typical hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Even better proof of Franciscan's vigilance, says the hospital's
president, Paul J. DellaRocco, is that it has ``one of the lowest
mortality rates in the state,'' despite caring for children who, on
average, have more than twice as many medical complications as a
typical pediatric patient.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis also got special attention from her caregivers, in part
because her parents had their hands full at home and lived an hour
away. ``She was like a little sister, that's the relationship that
developed,'' recalls Kerri Foxon, a former nurse's aide at
Franciscan.
</P>
<P>
   But an investigation by the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health after Alexis's death suggests that, whatever the intent,
safeguards were lacking. Her ventilator wasn't always maintained
the way it should have been, inspectors wrote, and staff members
weren't always assigned to check on patients like her.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the fact that alarms were sounding on her unit
all the time, most of them false, indicating that a child's heart
rate had jumped because he was playing or had fallen because he had
fallen into a deep sleep. DellaRocco says that while the buzz might
have been disconcerting to outsiders, nurses generally were on top
of the situation. But state inspectors, who visited the unit and
interviewed staff, concluded that ``nurses did not evaluate the
validity of most equipment alarms.''
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't just outsiders who, in retrospect, say conditions
were ripe for something to go wrong with Alexis or the 20 or so
other children on Unit 3. ``I wonder whether people were
conditioned not to pay attention to alarms because they went off 24
hours a day,'' says Foxon, a nursing student at Northeastern who
was working on Unit 3 the night Alexis stopped breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Franchi, who was a senior nurse on the unit, says those
equipment alarms probably made sense in an earlier era, when
children on ventilators generally lay still and weren't constantly
setting off their buzzers. Today, however, dramatically improved
surgical and rehabilitation techniques let children be active
enough that the older alarms may be obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only in hindsight,'' Franchi adds, ``that we can say we
needed something better for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Alarms should have sounded
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To understand just what Alexis Masiello needed, and why she
didn't get it, state investigators and others have tried to piece
together, moment by moment, the last hours of her life.
</P>
<P>
   She was sitting up in her crib on the evening of Oct. 10, 1996.
Shortly after 7:30, a staffer switched her from the oxygen-mist
collar that gave her extra air during the day to the ventilator
that offered more secure support at night.
</P>
<P>
   At about 7:40 p.m., however, Alexis's heart and respiratory
rates started to fall, and by 8 p.m. they were both registering
zero on a data strip that tracked minute-by-minute responses. But
it wasn't until just before 8:30 that Foxon, the nurse's aide,
looked up at a TV monitor at the nurse's station and noticed the
readouts signalling trouble.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into Alexis's room and found her ``face down in her bed
. . . she was purple,'' Foxon recalls. ``The tube was still
attached to the trache in her neck,'' but the fitting that should
have been on the ventilator ``was flailing off the end of her
bed.'' Foxon hit the emergency button. Within 10 seconds, help was
there. While medical staff managed to restore Alexis's circulation,
she had been cut off from oxygen for too long to keep her brain
functioning. Life-support equipment was withdrawn two days later.
</P>
<P>
   On that much everyone seems to agree. But why it took hospital
staffers so long to respond is hotly contested and will be up to a
jury to decide in a lawsuit filed by her father.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Masiello and his lawyer say the alarm monitoring Alexis's
breathing should have begun ringing by 7:47 and continued for 41
minutes at her bedside and on TV monitors at two nurses stations.
And lights on the monitors should have flashed.
</P>
<P>
   Foxon testified in a deposition that she heard an alarm ringing
at the nurses station for as long as 15 minutes while she was
attending another child. When she finally could respond, ``I saw
that Alexis's monitor was flashing and alarming double zeroes,
which meant a zero zero next to her heart rate and a zero zero next
to her respiratory rate.'' Until she reached the TV screen, Foxon
added in an interview, she could not be certain it was Alexis's
alarm ringing rather than that of another child.
</P>
<P>
   Other staff members have varying recollections of alarms at the
nurses stations ringing for long periods, or not at all, with most
unsure what happened on that busy night more than two years ago. No
one reported hearing Alexis's bedside alarms, although one should
have been ringing as a result of her respiratory woes and the other
to signal that her ventilator was detached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been in her room and looked at her and didn't hear her
alarm go off,'' Franchi, one of the supervising nurses that night,
said in an interview. ``I don't recall hearing it, but I can't say
it didn't go off.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensed practical nurse assigned to Alexis was meeting
nearby with an insurance representative from 8:05 to 8:25 that
evening, and as health department inspectors wrote later,
``interview (with LPN) and clinical record review lacked evidence
that the child was monitored by the LPN or by other nursing staff
during this period.''
</P>
<P>
   That nurse and three other hospital staffers being sued by
Alexis's father declined to talk to the Globe although they said
through their lawyers that they did all they could for Alexis.
</P>
<P>
   Franciscan head DellaRocco, meanwhile, says that ``in the 60 to
90 minutes before the child was discovered in respiratory arrest,
she had been personally cared for, or observed in her room, by four
different trained members of the medical staff. At least four more
members of the medical staff were involved with direct patient care
to the patients in adjoining rooms, or were in the immediate
vicinity of one or both of the nurse's stations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time prior to approximately 8:30 p.m. on Oct. 10,
1996,'' he adds, ``was there any warning or indication that the
patient was in distress.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what did go wrong, DellaRocco says he and his staff
examined nearly 40 different scenarios, from monitors and alarms
malfunctioning to power problems to human errors. Unfortunately, he
adds, ``the Franciscan Children's Hospital has been unable to
determine with certainty how or when this child became disconnected
from her respirator, nor why one or more of the multiple redundant
backup alarm systems in place failed to give adequate warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing who, if anyone, was to blame is of critical importance
to Gary Masiello and those he is suing. But to many of those who
were at Franciscan that cloudy fall night, what matters more is
understanding why the safety net failed to catch Alexis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never know if it was human error or technological
error,'' says Franchi. ``But it had to be an error, human or
technological, for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Coyle, who oversees the Massachusetts health
department's hospital inspections, agrees: ``If this case isn't a
good object lesson that you have to be on your toes all the time, I
don't know what would be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Things go wrong, once again
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy struck the Masiello family again nine months later. And
once again, state officials say what went wrong underlines the need
for hospitals to check and recheck their work even after they have
done all the safety checks they think they need.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis's mother, Michele, arrived at the Memorial Hospital
emergency room at 6:45 p.m. on July 1, 1997. Over the previous two
days she'd ingested 37 tablets of the anti-anxiety medication
Xanax, 48 of the muscle relaxant Soma, an undetermined amount of
the anti-convulsant Depakote, and ``some alcohol,'' according to a
Department of Public Health review of her hospital records.
</P>
<P>
   Michele was fed an activated charcoal powder to absorb as many
of the drugs as possible before they reached her bloodstream. Blood
samples were drawn, and an electrocardiogram was run. About 90
minutes after she arrived, soft wrist restraints were applied to
her hands when she tried to leave for a cigarette, state inspectors
say. After 2 1/2 hours, she was given Haldol, an antipsychotic
agent, and her hands apparently were untied. When she tried to
climb out of bed 35 minutes later, her hands were tied down again.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning nurses checked on her and found she was
``unresponsive, without respirations, and a heart rate below 40,''
about half of normal. Hospital staff found that she'd somehow
coughed up and inhaled some of the charcoal, which limited her
supply of oxygen, slowed her heart, and caused her to go into
arrest. She was stabilized, the charcoal was suctioned from her
lungs, and she was transferred to the coronary care unit. But
Michele never awoke. Ten days later her life support equipment was
removed.
</P>
<P>
   The health department report on the incident found a series of
deficiencies, including the fact that a nurse, rather than a
doctor, administered the antipsychotic drug, in violation of
hospital procedures. Another violation, investigators wrote, was
that ``there was no attempt to identify and treat the cause of the
patient's behavior or attempts at less restricted interventions.''
And much of the required documentation of care was missing, making
it impossible to know just what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   One thing officials do know is that not enough was done during
the 90 minutes before Michele was found unresponsive at 1:30 a.m.
``The nurse on duty acknowledged that she was not with the patient
since 12 o'clock,'' and there is no indication that anyone else was
paying particular attention to her, says Coyle, the health
department supervisor. ``The facility has a policy requiring that
restrained patients not be left unattended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This patient was left unattended and was known to have
ingested very large quantities of drugs, all of which when they
accumulate together can cause vomiting. She also was restrained, so
even if she tried to turn herself over she couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gary Masiello, he says he wasn't told what had happened
to his wife until he called the hospital at 7 a.m. on July 2 _ more
than five hours after she'd gone into arrest, was resuscitated, and
had been transferred to the coronary care unit. ``They gave me no
indication anything went wrong,'' adds Masiello, who is planning to
sue Michele's caregivers, alleging ``gross negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Memorial, which is now part of the University of
Massachusetts medical network, concede that mistakes were made in
documenting the care they delivered but not in the care itself.
``The caregivers behaved appropriately in the care of a patient who
arrived at the hospital and behaved in a manner that posed a danger
to both herself and her caregivers,'' Dr. Gerald G. Steinberg,
chief medical officer of UMass Memorial Health Care, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Coyle says, ``I don't think there was any
intention here'' to do wrong by the emergency room staff at
Memorial. ``Time,'' she adds, ``gets away from you sometime when
you have a lot of people and are busy. The result was tragic.
Tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Father-husband copes with his losses
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Masiello and his 6-year-old daughter Tori live alone now in
the rambling ranch house with white siding in Oxford, not far from
the Vietnam Memorial on Main Street. He and Michele planned to
raise all the kids there. But after Michele died, Lauren and
Francis Rossetti, her children by an earlier marriage, moved in
with their dad. The place is generally quiet now, the only sound
the clicking of Tori playing on Gary's computer while he gets
dinner ready or cleans up after a day selling cars.
</P>
<P>
   To some on the other end of his lawsuits, it seems like Masiello
is trying to cash in on his family's misfortunes by pursuing
medical staffers at Memorial. It's even worse, they say, to go
after Franciscan, a small struggling hospital that took Alexis in
when other facilities said no, sustained her for 19 months, far
longer than the normal patient stay, and is now worried that this
public airing of her death will impair its upcoming fund-raising
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Both hospitals have taken steps to ensure that what happened to
Michele and Alexis won't happen again. At Franciscan, that meant
buying new ventilators with more backup alarms and fine-tuning
measures to maintain and monitor the equipment. Memorial has
tightened its procedures for handling drug overdoses, applying
restraints, and documenting care.
</P>
<P>
   Masiello doesn't like to talk about his lawsuits, or himself,
saying the back-to-back incidents are less about him and his family
than about what happened in the hospitals. But as he looks up at
the collage of pictures on his living-room wall, just above the
shelves of Encyclopedea Britannicas, he shares the memories they
stir.
</P>
<P>
   There are the ones of him and Michele at their wedding in 1992,
when he had a fuller head of hair and she was beaming. There's the
one of her looking heavier and sadder not long before she died, at
age 32. In between are several shots of Alexis, at Mass General and
later at Franciscan. And there's a tiny one of Gary's father,
Vincent Masiello, a self-employed barber who died on April 2, 1997
_ six months after Alexis and three months before Michele.
</P>
<P>
   Three deaths in nine months was almost more than Gary could
take. Losing Alexis was ``the saddest day in my life,'' he recalls,
but he had to recover quickly to ``keep my wife cheered up, to
bring my family through it.'' Then there was the loss of his
father, at the relatively young age of 53. And as Michele lay dying
at Memorial, he kept vigil for 11 days, although now ``those days
blend into one . . . I felt like I was all alone . . . It was the
loneliest feeling in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost 15 pounds over the next week, along with his sense of
purpose. ``Everyone talks about depression,'' Gary says, ``but I
couldn't relate to it personally until that point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is determined to push ahead, for himself and Tori. ``I'm
not a sob story,'' he explains. ``I picked myself up and moved
on.''
</P>
<P>
   And he offers this advice to others seeking hospital care:
``Obviously, people have to be very cautious . . . I was under the
impression that Alexis and Michele were in safe hands, that they
were being taken care of properly.''

PREVENTABLE ERRORS AT HOSPITALS CAN PROVE DEADLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Second of four parts.)
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Nearly 20 million Americans checked in to a hospital
last year assuming they'd check out healthier, or at least no
sicker.
</P>
<P>
   One out of 20 of them was wrong. They got the wrong diagnosis or
the wrong drug, the wrong limb was operated on or something else
went wrong for more than 1 million patients.
</P>
<P>
   And for 100,000 of them, the mistake was deadly.
</P>
<P>
   A blind, deaf, developmentally disabled patient at Cooley
Dickinson Hospital in Northampton had a heart attack and died after
she was fed through an intravenous line in her shoulder rather than
the feeding tube in her stomach. A homeless woman at Malden
Hospital was given bedtime sedation before taking a bath, passed
out in the tub, and died an hour later. And Charles Merritt Jr., a
79-year-old chemist from Winthrop, went into a coma and later died
after doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital treated him for a
stroke when he really was having an insulin reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of technical terms for what they did,''
Merritt's widow, Mary, says. ``But what they did to him was they
killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Merritt and the others last year are not the
rarities they were presumed to be. Massachusetts Department of
Public Health records make clear that there is barely a hospital in
the state that hasn't had something major go wrong in recent years,
although most of the mishaps were not made public. And officials
admit that what they catch is a small fraction of the mistakes that
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the epidemic of errors is now unmistakable. The
tragedy, those who have studied the problem say, is that more than
two-thirds of the mistakes are preventable. But that also opens an
opportunity: If those mistakes can be rooted out, through quality
improvement efforts being pioneered in Boston and elsewhere,
patients really would be justified in believing that they'll leave
the hospital in better shape than when they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the public hasn't rebelled before now. Maybe
it's because these errors happen one patient at a time -- it's not
like a 747 falling out of the sky,'' says Dr. Jim Roberts, vice
president for physician leadership at VHA, an alliance of 1,600
community-owned health care systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the aggregate effect of all this is like a bunch of 747s
falling out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could somehow put the problem in aggregate terms that
the public could understand, maybe somehow people would say, `We're
fed up.' '' To understand why it has taken so long for the problem
of hospital errors to surface, it helps to understand the culture
of a typical US hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses work under enormous stress, doing their best
despite the scientific uncertainties, but they operate with an
autonomy unheard of today in other high-risk professions. Their
medical colleagues aren't likely to question or even recognize
their shortcomings, nor are their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals also generally don't have alarms or other backup
systems warning that too many drugs -- or too few -- are being
prescribed. And a medical universe that revolves around individual
practitioners is ill-equipped to respond to mistakes that usually
stem from the failure of a network of doctors, nurses, pharmacists,
and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are all the built-in incentives against the
practitioner or hospital publicly owning up to errors -- from the
fear of malpractice lawsuits to the fear of acknowledging
wrongdoing to colleagues, patients, and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The first sense the public and the profession got of just how
widespread errors are came in a 1990 study by Dr. Lucian Leape and
his colleagues at Harvard. The two-inch-thick report, which looked
at the records of more than 30,000 hospital patients in New York,
found that nearly 4 percent suffered serious injuries that were
related to the management of their illness rather than the illness
itself. Some were errors of omission -- preventions or
interventions that were available but not delivered. Others
involved commission -- things done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Costly mistakes, the Harvard study made clear, happen far more
often than anyone imagined, and 1 in 10 are deadly.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken a decade, however, and a series of horror stories
to turn a real spotlight on the problem. The most widely-publicized
error was in 1994 when Boston Globe health columnist Betsy A.
Lehman died of a drug overdose at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Even as accounts of individual mistakes were leaking out,
medicine itself has become more error-prone. Increasingly complex
cures are difficult for even the best-trained doctor or nurse to
master. Managed-care mandates that hospitals admit only the sickest
patients, whose complications offer more chance for something to go
awry. A wider choice of drugs means a greater likelihood doctors or
pharmacists will pick the wrong one, and less chance they'll know
the potential complications. And more attention to the bottom line
translates into fewer doctors and nurses to make sure everything
goes right.
</P>
<P>
   Patients also are changing, holding doctors and hospitals more
accountable for their mistakes. Insurers are more assertive, too,
as they realize that eliminating medical errors will lower costs
and let America take fuller advantage of medical advances made over
the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, health watchers say, and what's left is an issue
that has moved to medicine's front burner and gotten red hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough people and organizations want to do something about it
that waves are starting to roll,'' confirms Dr. Ken Kaiser, who
runs the Veterans Administration hospital system and is a leader in
the error-prevention movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better late than never.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes happen at hospitals everywhere The American Medical
Association is talking about errors. So is the American Hospital
Association. And in Massachusetts, they have become such a
consuming issue that hospitals, doctors, government regulators, and
others have formed a Coalition for the Prevention of Medical
Errors. When those groups publicly discuss mistakes, however,
they're careful never to name the hospitals or specify the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is less reserved.
It is charged with investigating complaints against hospitals, and
its inspections for 1997 and 1998 reveal 117 cases where one or
more substantial errors were confirmed. They happened at big-city
hospitals and remote ones, involving minor mishaps and fatal ones.
Taken together, they offer a portrait of what can and does go wrong
at hospitals here and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the problem was a simple oversight, like three years
ago when surgeons at New England Medical Center left a sponge in an
11-month-old boy's bladder but didn't realize it until he had an
X-ray eight months later.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened in 1998 at Quincy Hospital, only this
time it was a metal clamp left in the abdomen of a 73-year-old
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at St. Anne's Hospital in Fall River, a dietary
aide thought he was pouring a 71-year-old patient a cup of coffee.
But the urn was being cleaned and what came out was Dip-it, a
detergent and destainer. The patient suffered mild gastritis; the
hospital made warning signs to indicate when applicances are being
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Medication errors were another frequent source of troubles. In
1997 at Children's Hospital, for instance, a 9-month-old was given
1.7 millgrams of an anti-seizure drug over a 12-hour period -- 10
times the .17 milligrams he was supposed to get. The trouble, as so
often happens, was that a fail-safe system itself failed when the
doctor wrote an ambiguous prescription, another physician and the
pharmacist failed to question it, and a nurse, trying to calculate
the right dosage, miscalculated and gave three incorrect dosages.
</P>
<P>
   The child experienced wheezing and needed oxygen but recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of a 1997 drug error at St. Vincent's Hospital in
Worcester was more troubling. During an operation to remove plaque
from the arteries supplying blood to his head, a patient's blood
pressure dropped too low, and the anesthesiologist should have
administered neosynephrine to raise it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he gave nitroglycerine, which lowers blood pressure.
The patient emerged from surgery paralyzed on his right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those cases where an error occurred despite
having what we feel were very reasonable systems in places,'' says
Dr. William O'Connor, the hospital's vice president for clinical
quality. ``Looking back, we find we had not had an error of this
sort for 17 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Oftentimes even when an error is clearcut, it's unclear whether
it was the mistake or an underlying illness that made a patient
sicker.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Shawn M. O'Neil, a 23-year-old honor student at
Framingham State College who died two years ago at Boston's Jewish
Memorial Hospital. The hospital admits it gave O'Neil a poisonous
form of the dye methylene blue for a swallow test, failing to note
the label saying the dye could be ``fatal if swallowed.'' Hospital
officials insist O'Neil was unharmed by the incident and died the
next month of pneumonia stemming from his lung disease or other
long-time maladies. Mary O'Neil, who is Shawn's mother and a public
health nurse, tells a different story: ``We were preparing to bring
him home, that tells you he was not going to die . . . Shawn said
to me after the incident, `Mom, they've killed me. I'm a chemistry
major and it's a poison.' `` The cause-and-effect relationship is a
bit clearer in the case of Diana Sousa, the 62-year-old patient at
Cooley Dickinson who was incorrectly fed through a tube in her
shoulder. While hospital officials say she already was ``very
sick'' and they are not sure what killed her, the state Medical
Examiner is. His autopsy found that Sousa died of heart failure
brought on by ``inadvertent connection of feeding tube.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt, the chemist from Winthrop who died last year at Mass
General, also was very sick when the hospital misread his insulin
reaction. His widow, who has hired a lawyer and is considering
suing, says the misdiagnosis is what killed her husband, but
hospital officials say that's not certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did everything go right here? It obviously didn't,'' says Dr.
Cyrus Hopkins, chairman of Mass General's quality steering
committee. ``If the insulin reaction had been identified earlier,
would he be alive today? Maybe, but I don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Massachusetts's 76 acute-care hospitals showed up
at least once on the state's recent list of valid complaints, with
a third of the cases involving deaths. They included the anesthesia
complications that killed a 42-year-old woman being operated on in
1997 at Southwood Community Hospital in Norfolk, along with
complications inserting a catheter for chemotherapy that led to the
death of a 56-year-old woman last year at St. Elizabeth's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 2 1/2-old Alexis Masiello tragically suffocated at
Franciscan Children's Hospital in Brighton. Nine months later her
mother Michele died at Memorial Hospital in Worcester following
complications with her treatment for a drug overdose.
</P>
<P>
   The two Massachusetts hospitals cited most often for mistakes
the last two years were Newton-Wellesley and Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. But that's not surprising, given how intensively
the state inspected Newton-Wellesley following a series of maternal
deaths, and Beth Israel after allegations of troubles in its
anesthesiology and other departments. Each media report on the
troubles generated new complaints, many from cases years before,
and each review by state investigators turned up extra issues to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in a Kafka novel at this point. There doesn't
seem to be any way out of this as long as we have special
requirements to report things that no other hospital has,'' says
Dr. Leslie Selbovitz, Newton-Wellesley's senior vice president for
medical affairs. ``I don't think people are quite candid about how
much this has hurt the place. It leads to economic strangulation
and a lack of self confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer Daley, director of health care quality at Beth
Israel Deaconess, agrees that coming under such intense scrutiny is
``painful.'' But she also says it has been ``a healthy process for
us . . . We do a root cause analysis in every one of these things
and we find things that could have been done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies uncover plethora of errors Scientists who study medical
errors don't wait for someone to report them, the way government
regulators generally do. They go out and look for them.
</P>
<P>
   And the closer they look, the more they find. That's what
researchers at the esteemed LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City found
when they compared three systems for uncovering drug prescription
problems that harm patients. The standard approach, where nurses
report the troubles, showed they happened at the rate of six a
year. When independent investigators were dispatched, they found
more problems and the rate was recalculated to 60 a year. And when
computers used to order the drugs were also used to pinpoint
errors, the rate climbed again -- to 487 drug-related problems a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Studies such as those at individual hospitals have spurred
researchers to reexamine the estimates that Leape and his
colleagues compiled in 1990 and to conclude that the true rate of
errors is two to four times higher, or about 10 percent of all
hospital admissions. That would mean that close to 3 million
patients a year are being unnecessarily injured by the way their
care is managed.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at those figures helps clarify where and how the
mistakes are being made.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study, which is still the biggest and used most
often as a benchmark, measured ``adverse events,'' which are
injuries that produce a measurable disability and are caused by the
way an illness is managed rather than the illness itself. It found
that 70 percent of such errors clearly were preventable and another
6 percent could have been prevented if the hospital had higher
standards of care. Surgical wound infections accounted for 14
percent of the adverse events, and 72 percent of those were
preventable. Drug errors accounted for 19 percent, but of those
only 45 percent could easily have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The annual cost of those preventable adverse events was
estimated to be in excess of $10 billion, while the annual death
toll was more than 100,000 -- twice the number who die each year on
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   When his study first came out, Leape says, the natural response
of government regulators and hospitals themselves was to point
fingers and assign blame, to try to unmask individual incompetence
and get rid of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   But today there is a recognition that errors generally happen
when a doctor and nurse aren't communicating, when hospital staff
haven't absorbed new medical information, or when other systems in
the hospital aren't working to protect patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very very few of these injuries are caused by errors made by
bad people,'' says Leape, who is considered the father of the
error-prevention movement. ``Ninety-eight to 99 percent of errors
are made by good people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can prevent good people from making mistakes, those same
fixes will prevent bad people from making them.''

 &HT;    Kosovo war connects values to foreign policy choices
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Aside from the heartbreaking plight of the refugees,
the saddest part of the continuing crisis in the Balkans is that
these countries had a choice in the post-Cold War world. After the
fall of communism, there was a brief window that might have been
opened to a different future _ instead of ethnic hatred, a
multiethnic society. If iron-fisted rule kept ethnic animosities
from erupting, why couldn't freedom do that even more?
</P>
<P>
   The frightening answer is that without courageous leadership,
freedom also fails.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia was unique as a communist country because its
strongman leader Tito never cared much for the Russian communists.
Before Tito died in 1980, he tried to give the ethnic minorities
(including the Albanians) equal status with the three original
constituents of Yugoslavia _ the Croats, Serbs and Slovenes. But he
could not give them equal economic power or make their numbers
equal. Slobodan Milosevic capitalized on the political dominance of
the Serbs in the Yugoslav federation. He traded what he had lost as
a communist leader for a vicious nationalism. He exacerbated old
hatreds.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yugoslavia has become an end-of-the-century cancer in a
Europe that is moving in the opposite direction _ trading Cold War
nationalist loyalties for cooperative economic and politician
union.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University political science Professor Dan Reiter says
NATO had other opportunities to take a strong military stand
against Milosevic, ``but you have to let negotiations fail before
you can launch a military attack.'' Milosevic tried a similar
ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo last October, though critics of
the NATO action _ including some in Congress _ have apparently
forgotten it. More than 400,000 Kosovar Albanians fled for their
lives, hiding in the mountains for weeks. But United States special
envoy Richard Holbrooke was able to get Milosevic to back off. This
time, even Holbrooke couldn't get him to budge. In addition,
American public opinion polls indicated support for the NATO action
_ and, says Reiter, ``This president is particularly poll-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Public support wavers now as NATO attacks escalate and American
soldiers are captured, harmed or possibly killed. Unlike many,
Reiter says he has faith in the rationality of the American public
on foreign policy. Even without attention to policy details, he
thinks Americans are pretty good at connecting values to choices.
Preserving peace in Europe and retaining a strong NATO are values
they support.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have shown something else that hasn't always been so
clear: support for human rights over nationalism. That is the most
encouraging sign yet that Americans have progressed since World War
II to the certain realization that we are directly affected when we
tolerate widespread atrocities and ethnic cleansing anywhere in the
world
</P>
<P>
   If so, though, why didn't we support intervening in Rwanda?
Reiter's answer is that the moral imperative, though strong, isn't
always sufficient to support military intervention. There's no
question that our historical alliance, common sharing of democratic
principles and key trade relations with Europe are key factors.
They are factors even for a president and a public who claim we
must always act to prevent genocide. Maybe in the 21st century, we
will make that an irrevocable principle.

 &HT;    Independent unto itself, Kosovo crisis poses ominous dimensions
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I hope MSNBC's Brian Williams doesn't take
offense, but a high school sophomore in my house was mocking him
the other night.
</P>
<P>
   With three U.S. soldiers having been captured by Serbs, Williams
wondered if this could be the ``Pearl Harbor moment'' that draws
the United States feet-first into Yugoslavia, emphasis on ``feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting way too wise for his years, my son was remarking on the
too-convenient analogies that are being trotted out about this
conflict: ``Bill Clinton's Vietnam.'' ``Clinton's Bay of Pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Every dime-store historian wants to see Bosnia as a duplicate
that suits the carbon paper in his mind. Another Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   _ Yes, potentially, if it becomes an open-ended American
involvement in a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yes, if America gets sucked into a war it isn't truly ready to
win (making the capture of three soldiers our Gulf of Tonkin
moment?)
</P>
<P>
   _ Yes, if ground troops head in with fuzzy objectives and
limited popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Those are truly, quite ominously, Vietnam-like criteria. Unlike
Vietnam? These:
</P>
<P>
   _ This civil war is based on ancient ethnic hatreds. In Vietnam
it was based on ideology, and on the success of Marxists to sell
promises to paupers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kosovo is seen as a regional, humanitarian concern. By
comparison, U.S. strategists held Vietnam as the essence of a world
quest and a national interest: containing communism.
</P>
<P>
   _ This is an international action _ 19 nations involved _
against a rogue despot with almost no allies with any resources to
share, unlike the well-supported North Vietnamese. Yes, Russia is
sympathetic to Slobodan Milosevic. Russia also is destitute.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO shouldn't be fooled by the three above criteria to
think that ousting Milosevic or repatriating Kosovars by force
wouldn't come at mind-boggling human costs. It would mean major
NATO carnage. It also would mean more civilian deaths (that pesky
``collateral damage''), more Albanians executed.
</P>
<P>
   If only Kosovo were an island. We could ring a naval blockade
around it. If only Kosovo were a sovereign nation, a Kuwait.
Instead, it's part and parcel of Milosevic's empire, treasured in
Serbian lore.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Vietnam, when reunification of north and south was the
goal of the communists, in this case what Serbs see is NATO
attempting to ``un-unify'' Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the bombing raids have accomplished
exactly the opposite of what they intended. They've stepped up the
ethnic cleansing. They've built Slobo into a Saddamlike hero.
</P>
<P>
   Our problem now may be acknowledging the limits of a bombing
campaign without having to land ``on the beach,'' so to speak,
simply to demonstrate that Milosevic is a global pip-squeak and we
are the mightiest mortal force on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   We now have this type of choice to make: Is it worth the
execution of more Albanians and the torching of more villages for
NATO jets to take out more Yugoslavian military hardware?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it time to hold our fire, press the issue against
Yugoslavia's genocide in the United Nations, make the refugees'
safety an international concern rather than a NATO concern, and
then put worldwide economic clamps on Milosevic?
</P>
<P>
   At some point we'll run out of cruise missiles. My son envisions
NATO planes dropping submarines from the sky when airborne ammo
runs out.
</P>
<P>
   It may be time to go ``up periscope'' and look around. If
inflicting damage on the Serb war machine is all this episode can
do, that it isn't enough. At some point, short of another Vietnam,
you say, ``that's all.''

   KOSOVO-MAIN _ TIRANA, Albania _ Humanitarian aid is being rushed
to ethnic Albanian refugees as NATO and the Clinton administration
are put on the defensive about why they didn't anticipate the scope
of the problem and preposition food and supplies. Meanwhile, plans
are afoot to airlift more than 100,000 refugees out of the region.
Most will go elsewhere in Europe while a few thousand will come to
the United States. (Roughton, Cox News Service) 20.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CLEANSE _ ROZAJE, Montenegro, Yugoslavia _ Although
difficult to independently verify, first person accounts by
refugees offer strikingly similar accounts of the unspeakable evil
unleashed upon fleeing Kosovar Albanians by Serb troops, police and
paramilitary units. Using spy planes, satellites and unmanned
drones equipped with high altitude cameras, NATO is beginning to
document the claims of the escaping refugees (Holmes/Deans, Cox

   KOSOVO PACKAGE:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels) _ Developments concerning the Kosovo
crisis. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Serbia) _ The latest strikes in the
Serbian capital. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ At its starkest, the truth in Kosovo
is simple. Serbs, enboldened or maddened by NATO bombings, are on a
rampage of ethnic cleansing that has caused nearly a quarter of the
ethnic Albanian population to flee. But close up, real life is
rarely simple. Between those deaths lies a tangled web of history,
friendships and enmities, of war and routine business that were
echoed all over Kosovo. And those are the minutae of life and death
that are drowned out by the clashing statements of Washington and
Belgrade. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MONTENEGRO (Dateline TK) _ The war's effect on this
Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Dateline TK) _ On the latest refugee flows

<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S.-POLITICS (Washington) _ Kosovo and its impact on
U.S. domestic politics, especially the presidential race. By
Richard L. Berke.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-INTERNET (Undated) _ In many ways, the Internet is
personalizing the war in Yugoslavia for Americans more than any
other form of media can. Rare accounts from individuals inside
Kosovo circulate on e-mail, chat rooms offer interaction with
representatives from all sides, and online opinion polls invite
instant voting on what to do next. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the rest of the world:
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-ECON (Rio de Janeiro) _ The failures of the Real Plan,

flown to the Netherlands.
</P>

   INDIA-POLITICS (New Delhi) _ India's ruling Hindu nationalist
party is facing a political showdown with its largest coalition
partner, a very public test of wills that has much of the nation
speculating about whether the one-year-old government is about to
fall.
</P>

the offices of a Palestinian journalist, one with Israeli state
credentials. By Joel Greenberg.

   EDUC-PARTNERS (Montclair, N.J.) _ On a frigid March morning, 35
second graders squirmed with delight in the Watchung School
auditorium at the prospect of receiving a disposable camera and a
creative assignment: recording their lives and tastes in
photographs and writing. The homework was not assigned by teachers
at this public elementary school just 15 miles west of New York
City. Instead, the assignment, handed out to some 250 children at
the school, came from researchers for Noggin, a new educational
channel that has formed a special partnership with Watchung. In
exchange for $7,100, Noggin can go into the school once a week from
now until June to run focus groups with some 250 children who
turned in parent permission slips. For Rita Miragliotta, Watchung's
principal, the partnership has been a boon, helping ease a budget
crunch. But for others in the education world, which has seen an
explosion of corporate suitors, deals like the Watchung-Noggin
partnership are things to be avoided, as they blur the line
separating schools from supermarkets.

   COLLEGE-ADMISSIONS (Baltimore) _ More and more, the college
admissions process is becoming like buying a used car, with
students holding out for better offers and some colleges quite
willing to bargain as well. By Michael Janofsky.

   KIDS-TV (Undated) _ Public lamentation over the dangers to
American children from too much sex, violence and crass
commercialism on television has been around almost as long as
television itself. But today, alongside the hue and cry lies a
quieter truth: children's television has never been better. In the
past three years, children's television has undergone an explosive
growth spurt, with new cable channels, new program blocks on
broadcast channels, and scores of new shows, many of them
instructive if not downright instructional. And at a time when
adult television is spilling over with crude humor and vulgarity,
children are spending less time watching adult television than ever
before, and more time watching their own shows. By Lawrie Mifflin.

   HONGKONG-TECH (Hong Kong) _ Richard Li, the wealthy Hong Kong
entrepreneur who means to become the cybermogul of Asia, plans to
build a $2 billion high-technology center in Hong Kong. Called
Cyberport, it is one of several futuristic technology parks that
are rising from Taiwan to Singapore. With Asia mired in recession
and the United States enjoying a high-technology boom, governments
in this region have seized on technology as a way to recapture

   INTERNET-SHOPPING-COMPLAINTS (Undated) _ As shoppers join the
Internet in greater numbers, the number of disgruntled consumers is
on the rise. One of the prime sources of frustration is the fact
that many sites don't disclose their shipping and handling charges
until late in the buying process -- and then charge high fees, in

</P>

   CYBERSQUATTERS (Washington) _ Though they are often labeled
hijackers, pirates or extortionists, ``cybersquatters'' is the most
common term for investors who stockpile Internet addresses derived
from popular words, titles or celebrities' names. But soon their
investments may become a lot riskier. Faced with mounting disputes

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich is gone, but it sounds like 1995
again in the capital with warnings of spending cuts, recriminations
over budget double talk and dire predictions of presidential vetoes
and shuttered government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are at odds over federal spending and
the debate promises to color legislative activity this year and on
into the next as the parties trade salvos over which is most
dedicated to protecting Social Security and making best use of the
growing surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans passed their House and Senate spending plans before
heading off for Easter, congratulating themselves for setting aside
money for Social Security, holding to spending limits and advancing
a tax cut while simultaneously boosting spending for defense and
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We present a budget for the new millennium that is right in
pace with where the American people want to go,'' crowed Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats claim the GOP has painted itself into a fiscal
corner. They say if Republicans follow through on their plan, it
will require across-the board cuts of 10 to 20 percent, raising the
specter of hundreds of lost law enforcement positions and thousands
of children cut off nutrition programs.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to shore up Social Security and simultaneously grant a
tax cut, Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling said, Republicans
made budget losers out of Medicare and other popular federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House threat is to veto any unacceptable cuts and
force the GOP to either negotiate or allow government shutdowns of
the sort that killed Republicans politically in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Clinton administration is simply trying to
depict them as the bad guys after presenting a flawed budget of its
own. They predict they can make the numbers work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a tough year,'' conceded Rep. Zach Wamp,
R-Tenn. ``But if we show the markets that here in Washington we are
not going to spend foolishly or blindly any longer, the economy
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   HOME BOY AL
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore might spend most of his time inside the
beltway but the erstwhile Tennessean can play his Southern card
when it suits him.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama to raise money and pick up the endorsement of Gov.
Don Siegelman, Gore told an audience he intended to campaign on the
platform of their shared ``Southern values'' of community, faith
and family. Siegelman also introduced Gore as a son of the South.
</P>
<P>
   But his geographic parentage is somewhat in dispute at present.
Gore is under attack for embellishing his historic ties to the
region when he really spent much of his youth in tony Washington
prep schools as the privileged son of a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has gone Southern in the past, building his 1988
presidential bid around the Dixie-dominated Super Tuesday primary.
His showing failed to meet expectations and his campaign collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   UP, UP, GO AWAY
</P>
<P>
   A move by some Southern lawmakers to limit commercial tour
flights over the Great Smoky Mountains has taken off in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., introduced a bill
to control the time, frequency and altitude of air flights over the
national park. Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., later joined that effort.
The park straddles their two states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Smokies are one of North Carolina's greatest natural
treasures,'' Edwards said. ``Whether visitors to the park are
camping, hiking, fishing, picnicking or just enjoying the scenery,
they should not be subjected to the annoying buzz of low-flying
planes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the legislation remains in committee, a reauthorization
bill for the Federal Aviation Administration is on its way to the
Senate floor and includes similar language about limiting flights
over all national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic has proved to be a problem over other national
parks, notably the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   STIRRING UP STROM
</P>
<P>
   Don't get Strom stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., is irked at the Clinton administration
for approving a new label for wine, one that advises consumers to
check with their doctors about the health benefits of the grape.
Thurmond believes the new label is a tacit endorsement of imbibing;
he wants the labels to warn of the health risks of alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   He's also pushing for a new tax on wine to pay for medical
research to study alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   To signal his ire over the label dispute, Thurmond is holding up
the nominations of three Treasury Department officials and he
promises more stall tactics. The department runs the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that's associated with Treasury is going to fall
under his scrutiny, whether it's a nomination or legislation,
whatever, he's got his eye on it,'' said John DeCrosta, a spokesman
for Thurmond.

<P>
   The Charter School of Wilmington sits atop the old district
high-school building like Rome on its ruins. The old school was
phased out in the mid-90s in favor of four themed minischools, the
educational innovation of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   That moment turned out to be very brief: two of the minischools
_ the Banking and Finance School and an academy based on the
progressive theories of Ted Sizer _ did not even attract enough
students to open. The Charter School of Wilmington absorbed the
Math and Science mini-school and opened on the third floor of the
building in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new school has been an instant success: its population has
already grown to 552 from 253, and next year it will begin creeping
down into the space vacated by the former high school.
</P>
<P>
   What is true in Wilmington is true generally: the charter school
movement is sweeping everything before it. There were, at last
count, 1,208 charter schools across the country, with 200 more
scheduled for September. Even the most intransigent state
legislatures are falling: in December, after several years of stout
resistance from teachers' and administrators' unions, New York
became the 35th and most recent state to pass a law governing the
creation of charter schools. Responding to all this enthusiasm,
President Clinton has called for 3,000 new charter schools by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are getting hard to find, while from advocates one
increasingly hears breathless tales of dead schools transformed, of
inner-city children engaged, of hidebound school systems rising to
the marketplace challenge with a burst of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one hears a lot of euphoria these days in the world
of school reform _ about ``multiple intelligence'' schools and Core
Knowledge schools and parochial schools and a dozen other species
of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent study from the University of California at Los
Angeles, which questions virtually all the claims made by charter
advocates, concludes that ``policy makers who hope for a broad
impact should reconsider some of the underlying assumptions that
led them to favor charter school reform in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The archeological metaphor is, after all, double-sided: is
there, in fact, something so fundamental about this particular
innovation that we should expect charter schools to become a fixed
part of the school terrain, or will they subside into the rubble of
yesterday's indispensable ideas?
</P>
<P>
   Under laws now being passed, organizations or individuals _
often parents and teachers _ can petition an officially designated
body for a charter to operate a school that is free from some or
all of the union and civil-service rules and budgetary restrictions
that govern ordinary public schools. The charter functions as a
contract in which the prospective school spells out how it plans to
operate as well as what it vows to accomplish; the sponsoring
agency monitors the school, and chooses whether to renew the
charter at the end of a specified period, typically five years.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the charter school movement is that the
difference between good and bad schools lies not in any particular
classroom practice, but in the way the school itself is
administered; or, alternatively, that without the self-governance
made possible by a charter, the desired classroom reform, whatever
it is, will never be fully realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give children access to a mission-driven atmosphere, a
school that has high expectations and a structure free from
bureaucracy, it's going to yield better results than had that child
been in a traditional school,'' says Jean Allen, the head of the
Center for Educational Reform in Washington and a strong charter
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   That theory was first articulated by John E. Chubb and Terry M.
Moe in their highly controversial 1990 book, ``Politics, Markets
and America's Schools.'' The two scholars argued that public
schools were bound to fail because they had to answer to school
boards, teachers' unions, state governments and other entities
whose interests often collided with those of children; private
schools were free to make decisions according to what worked, and
so achieved more with the same students.
</P>
<P>
   Using data gleaned from a study of 60,000 high-school students,
they concluded that the difference between effective and
ineffective school organization could amount to more than one full
year of academic achievement over the four years of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans want effective schools,'' the authors wrote, ``it
appears they must first create new institutions that, in their
effects on the choices of individuals, naturally function to
promote rather than inhibit the right kinds of organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even educators who don't share Chubb and Moe's faith in the
marketplace might agree with their critique of the bureaucracy.
Indeed, the fuel of the charter school movement lies in the
overwhelming sense of frustration and helplessness many educators
say they feel in the face of ``the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, charter schools have had an unusually nonpartisan
appeal because they prescribe nothing; both progressives and
traditionalists can create schools of their own, leaving agnostics
free to believe in the wisdom of letting a hundred flowers bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically, the charter proposal occupies a position midway
between ``choice'' _ the idea that children can attend any school
in their district _ and vouchers, which allow children to attend
private or parochial schools with public money. Liberals like
choice; free-market conservatives like vouchers _ and, as it turns
out, both have found they can live with charters.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The first charter laws were passed in Minnesota and California
in 1991; since then, the movement has blossomed, with its own think
tanks, symposiums, Web sites and committed legislators and
governors _ as well as, of course, its own pantheon of rugged
pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Chan started the Vaughn Learning Center in Los Angeles in
1992, and quickly became a poster child for the charter movement.
She had spent a quarter-century in the Los Angeles public school
system and had a lifetime's worth of scars to show for it. ``I
tried school-based management, I tried everything,'' she says,
``but they handcuff your hands with so many policies, so many rules
and regulations. If your toilet seat is broken, tough luck; you
wait till everybody's get fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, she uses her control over the school's $6 million
budget to swing advantageous deals for computers, to increase
teacher training for literacy, to reduce class size in the
bilingual program and to ``mainstream'' students in special
education.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to say what charter schools look like. The
Minnesota New Country School, in the farming town of Henderson,
resembles a Kinko's, with children at personalized work stations
and teachers moving from child to child, guiding them on long-term
projects.
</P>
<P>
   There are Afrocentric charter schools and Outward Bound-type
charter schools. Colorado has five Core Knowledge charter schools,
where children study a specified and rigorous curriculum, but the
state also has a school whose mission statement says that it
``gives equal weight to intellectual and character development''
and ``students exercise many choices as they decide which
activities, materials and resources they use, under the auspices of
their advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   With the educational marketplace jammed with competing designs,
the charter school has become the blank slate on which absolutely
everything can be drawn and tested.
</P>
<P>
   The Charter School of Wilmington differs from a typical high
school only in that it is smaller, calmer and possibly more
old-fashioned. The school bills itself as an option for students
who want to take their studies seriously. It gives out academic
letters as well as athletic ones, and holds an annual academic
banquet for students who make the honor roll. Students must take 24
courses to graduate, rather than the 19 or 20 normally required in
the district, and 10 math and science courses, rather than the
usual six or eight. All classes are divided into three
``homogeneous groupings,'' the current euphemism for academic
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive doctrine hasn't made much of a dent at the
Wilmington charter school. In most classes, students sit in rows
and the teacher stands at the front. At the same time, it is not an
airless place, and its students seem respectful and attentive. It
feels like the ideal parochial school, which is not entirely
surprising: the principal, Ronald Russo, used to run the biggest
parochial high school in the state, and he brought a number of
teachers and administrators with him.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware passed its charter law in 1995, and six of the state's
major employers, including Du Pont and Bell Atlantic, joined forces
to sponsor a school with high standards. Those two companies kicked
in $100,000 apiece, found the site and created a board of
directors, who hired Russo. None of this is atypical; charter
schools often form links with local employers, and almost always
supplement their budget with outside money.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware law allows charter schools to dispense with the
teachers' union, which the school did. This has freed Russo and his
colleagues to hire teachers they considered appropriate _ and, when
necessary, fire them. Since a third of the teachers could be
uncertified, as long as they were working toward certification, the
school hired a chiropractor with a background in biology to teach
biology, anatomy and physiology. And Russo could spend the $6,600
per student he received from the state and the district as he
chose.
</P>
<P>
   The school's teachers and administrators say that autonomy from
central control allows them to direct their energies toward their
academic mission, just as Chubb and Moe would have predicted. When
the teachers learned they had to change the science curriculum to
satisfy new state graduation requirements, they created a new
ninth-grade science course during a three-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the paragon of school-based management,'' says Charles
Biehl, the school's dean of math and science. ``We control our own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Since few charter schools are more than three years old, it's
not yet possible to say whether charter status has any effect on
academic performance. But charter proponents argue that the
anecdotal evidence so far is positive. Ms. Allen, of the Center for
Educational Reform, says she knows of 60 charters nationwide that
have either outperformed comparable noncharter schools or produced
larger gains than students had before the school converted to
charter status.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilmington Charter School is one example. Last year, its
students had the highest average SAT score of any public school in
the state; the year before that, they registered the highest score
on the state's writing assessment test. Ms. Allen also points out
that charter schools have succeeded according to nonacademic
indexes of effectiveness _ attendance, student retention, parental
involvement, teacher satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many charter schools are limping along, and 30
schools, or 2.5 percent of the total, have closed so far, according
to Ms. Allen. Six failed to win a renewal, four closed voluntarily
and the other 20 had their charters revoked.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mary Gifford, the vice president of the Arizona State Board for
Charter Schools, which has sponsored about half of that state's 289
such schools, says that most of the eight schools that have been
closed in Arizona suffered from poor management. But the underlying
problem, she says, was that parents were not satisfied. ``The
charter schools lost students and had to be creative in
operations,'' Ms. Gifford says. ``In some cases, that creativity
has led to illegality; in other cases, it just led to a big mess.''
Two schools are being investigated for shoddy, and possibly
fraudulent, bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Even a passionate charter advocate like Joe Nathan, the head of
the Center for School Change at the University of Minnesota's
Humphrey Institute, concedes that Arizona has been too eager to get
large numbers of schools up and running.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book, ``Political Leadership and Educational
Failure,'' Sidney Sarason rebukes charter school euphoria by
asking, ``Is the creation of charter schools ... exempt from what
we know about the creation of settings?'' _ that is, that
complicated new experiments in social policy tend to run into
unanticipated problems and fail.
</P>
<P>
   Sarason, a retired professor of psychology at Yale, is a harsh
critic of public schools and a strong proponent of structural
reform. But he argues that advocates, and especially political
leaders, have been so beguiled by the imagery of autonomy that they
haven't asked the hard questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have to be subjected to yet another instance of an
educational innovation the implementation of which is a catalogue
of errors of omission and commission?'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics, especially defenders of the public schools,
dispute the very premise of charter reform. ``It is time to rest
the tired rhetoric that all bureaucracy is bad and all autonomy
from bureaucracy is good,'' concludes Amy Stuart Wells, the author
of the UCLA study. Ms. Wells says that charter schools in
California are excluding the most disadvantaged parents, are not
being held accountable for academic performance, are not using
their power over their budget to save money, are not improving
academic outcomes, are not having any effect on the public schools
_ are not, in short, accomplishing a single goal of the charter
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The report is easily the harshest assessment yet published.
Diane Ravitch, an education historian and a charter proponent,
calls it ``a hit job,'' and others in the charter school world take
the study, and the major publicity it has garnered, as a sign that
the ideological fires are still smoldering. Ms. Wells insisted in
an interview that she favors charter schools but thinks they are
unfair to the neediest children. She points out that three-quarters
of California charter schools require prospective parents to sign a
``contract'' requiring volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great for the school,'' she says, ``but if you look at
it from a public-policy level you start to wonder if these schools
are creaming off some of the most involved parents.'' Ms. Wells
argues that the very notion of giving choices excludes less-engaged
parents, though studies show that one merit of the charter idea,
and of school choice in general, is that it increases parental
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools also attract the same percentage of black and
Hispanic students as public schools, according to a report
commissioned by the United States Department of Education, though
the percentage of students in poverty is slightly lower in
charters.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting choice in the name of preserving equity might have an
unintended consequence, too. Schools that don't have to respond to
dissatisfied parents don't need to change. But Ms. Wells argues
that the virtues of the marketplace model have been ``hugely
exaggerated,'' and insists that it is collaboration, not
competition, that drives school reform.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another critique of the charter school idea
that has rarely been aired. The premise of the charter movement is
that autonomy is the most important variable for school success;
or, more modestly, other reforms won't work absent autonomy. But is
this really so? The big-city public schools of a half-century ago _
which are often taken to represent the high-water mark of
educational effectiveness _ were even more centralized and
bureaucratic than the failed school systems of today. Schools in
Western Europe and Asia, whose performance puts America's in the
shade, are every bit as hierarchical as our own.
</P>
<P>
   There are also growing examples of academic success in public
schools that have radically recast the conventional curriculums.
For instance, a recent study found that Core Knowledge schools
significantly outperform comparable conventional schools. E.D.
Hirsch, the founder of these schools, says he considers charter
status irrelevant. ``It depends more on the principal,'' he says.
On the other side of the pedagogical divide, Howard Gardner, the
author of ``Multiple Intelligences'' and a leading progressive
thinker, takes a similar position. Both agree that what matters is
changing classroom practices.
</P>
<P>
   But if you believe that what finally matters is the mode of
instruction, why would you choose a content-neutral marketplace
innovation to get there?
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the public schools were doing what they were doing 70
years ago, with a rich, strong curriculum, and the teachers
understood it, you wouldn't see me advocating charter schools,''
Ms. Ravitch explains. But unlike Ms. Wells, she believes that
schools will change only if they are forced to.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you have a system in which 90 percent of the kids
are in the system and there's no interior reason to change, there
will be this continual drift toward vacuity and illiteracy and
social promotion,'' she observes. ``But once you create these
outlying organizations called charters, then the people inside the
system will say, `These people are getting public money; you've got
to hold them accountable.' Then you produce a dynamic where even
the people inside the system are demanding real standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ravitch's argument represents a metalevel of school despair:
you can change individual schools, but you'll never change the
system without a challenge from the outside. This is, in fact, the
nub of the marketplace argument. ``The test of the charter school
reform is not those schools, but what happens in the rest of the
system,'' says John Chubb, who is now a partner in the Edison
Project, a for-profit company that runs charter schools in seven
states.
</P>
<P>
   Chubb says that charter schools have already forced school
districts around the country to consider the kinds of broad changes
they once felt they could neglect. One sign of this, he says, is
the increasingly warm reception given to Edison, which, until
recently, many school boards and teachers' unions have scorned.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is converting to an autonomy-without-charters,
school-based system of management. Meanwhile, Ronald Russo says
it's no coincidence that his Wilmington district recently decided
to raise graduation requirements to 24 credits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's an extremely indirect route to a goal. School
systems will be responding to all sorts of messages from charters,
and most of them will not be about the virtues of either a core
curriculum or individual instruction. They will be about hiring,
budgeting, parent-teacher councils and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Sarason points out, many of these schools will
offer object lessons only in the immense difficulty of creating
schools from scratch. There may end up being a very large gap
between euphoria and test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Some charter schools around the country, and what makes them
different:
</P>

   Acadamie Da Vinci, Dunedin, Fla.; grades 1-6; 60 students.
Weekly classes in dance, drama, music and visual art.
</P>
<P>
   Common Ground High School, New Haven; grades 9-12; 80 students.
Abutting a state park, with an emphasis on ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Community of Peace Academy, St. Paul; grades K-8; 319 students.
A racially and culturally diverse community of students, parents
and staff'' who are asked to practice ``a nonviolent life style,''
the mission statement says.
</P>
<P>
   Elysian Charter School, Hoboken, N.J.; grades K-3; 97 students.
An emphasis on the natural and ``built'' environment, especially
the people, resources and history of Hoboken.
</P>

students. Uses the city as a learning tool, with frequent walking
tours.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Academy, Denver; grades K-9; 418 students. A
back-to-basics approach, seeking ``an academically rigorous,
content-rich educational program in the context of discipline and
respect,'' the mission statement says.
</P>
<P>
   New Visions School, Minneapolis; grades 1-8; 212 students. For
children with hearing, vision or attention-deficit disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Open Magnet Charter School, Los Angeles; grades K-5; 370
students. Now a charter school, but begun by parents in 1977 as a

children are not separated by age.
</P>
<P>
   The Village: A High School for Pregnant and Parenting Teens,
Phoenix; grades 9-12; 183 girls, 4 boys. Aims ``to provide
comprehensive instruction, promote self-sufficiency and eliminate

MELISSA VIRUS GIVES SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS A CHANCE TO INCREASE BRAND
EXPOSURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan, Calif., N.J.)   By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Cupertino, Calif., offices of the Japanese software
developer Trend Micro, an avalanche of pizza boxes tumbled to the
floor from time to time last week, and the company pool table was
commandeered as a cot. Both were a result of programmers' working
through the night to create software that would clean the Melissa
virus from computers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the impact on revenues and the company's bottom line,
the effort paid off quickly for stockholders. On Friday, March 26,
the day the virus was first reported, the company's stock, which is
traded exclusively in Japan, was listed at the equivalent of $104 a
share. At the close of trading on the following Monday, it had
climbed to $127, although by the time federal agents arrested a
suspect in the case in New Jersey last Friday morning, the shares
stood at $124.48 on the Tokyo Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the investors seem to think it's good for business,''
said Dan Schrader, director of product marketing. ``Clearly, we are
benefiting from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Trend Micro's surging stock is an exception, a benefit of
being well positioned in Asia, where the use of anti-virus software
is not pervasive, and of specializing in software to protect e-mail
servers, which were Melissa's target.
</P>
<P>
   Other anti-virus companies failed to get such a lift, in part
because they compete in more mature markets. But in addition, for
giant American players like the Symantec Corp. and Network
Associates Inc., anti-virus software is one of many products,
meaning that the potential revenue opportunities from battling a
new virus are diluted across a broad product line.
</P>
<P>
   That was not always the case. Four or five years ago, publicity
about viruses produced benefits for anti-virus companies traded in
the United States similar to those enjoyed last week by Trend
Micro. Today, the use of these digital vaccinations is so pervasive
in the United States and Europe, among both companies and
individuals, that even the unusual amount of attention given the
Melissa virus by the news media failed to nudge the market.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that in a saturated market, even a potent new
virus may inspire very few more people to buy such software. At the
same time, Symantec and Network Associates both post free updates
for each new virus on their Web sites, so keeping existing
customers protected is a net cost.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices actually dropped slightly last week for Network
Associates of Santa Clara, Calif., and for Symantec of Cupertino.
On March 25, the day before the Melissa virus appeared, Network
Associates closed at $31. A week later, well into the virus
publicity, the stock was at $30.75. Symantec closed at $16.63 on
March 25, and was at $16.13 a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely that any of those companies is going to see any
measurable revenue as a result of the virus,'' said Paul Saunders,
a research analyst at Soundview Technology Group in San Francisco.
``It's not likely there's any huge untapped market to be
penetrated. It's a fairly mature market.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that anti-virus software was installed in 75
percent of business computers.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating the situation, he said, is the fact that Network
Associates, which holds 50 percent of the market worldwide, has
been asked by the Securities and Exchange Commission for a
clarification of its accounting write-offs on companies it has
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock price behaved very differently after the
last major virus announcement. In late December, when Network
Associates announced the discovery of a virus called Remote
Explorer, the company's stock jumped 22 percent within a week.
Symantec saw a 13 percent increase in the flurry of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think the stories had some effect? Yes,'' said John
Powers, a networking software analyst for BancBoston Robertson
Stephens in San Francisco, in an interview in January. Still, he
pointed out that technology stocks in general were strong toward
the end of the fourth quarter. ``I wouldn't get carried away with
attributing all that move to the virus stories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, officials from both anti-virus companies played
down the role of virus reports in their stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tie a single event like that to our stock prices is a
little difficult,'' said Steve Trilling, director of research for
Symantec, which produces the Norton Utilities as well as Norton
Antivirus. ``The business grows over time. I wouldn't expect we
would see a spike the next week because of Remote Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the market neared saturation, virus reports often led to
huge increases in purchases of anti-virus software, a phenomenon
that encouraged the companies to publicize the existence of new
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their rush to make the first claim and counterclaims,
they're both guilty of overblowing and overpublicizing a strain of
virus,'' Powers said of Symantec and Network Associates.
</P>
<P>
   That competitive culture was back in evidence after the Melissa
discovery last week, with companies pressing their advantages in a
barrage of press releases that emphasized speed in producing fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates' press release said it was ``the first
company to offer detection and cleaning.'' Symantec offered
``detection and repair within an hour'' after spotting the virus.
Trend Micro said it had actually discovered Melissa and had been
``the first anti-virus vendor to provide a solution for the Melissa
virus at its Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of the three companies would divulge its post-Melissa
sales figures, they all reported fourfold to fivefold increases in
traffic to their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest benefit may have been simple brand exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been on the phone or in front of cameras for two days
now,'' said Sal Viveros, group marketing manager for Network
Associates. The round of publicity, he said, ``helps position
Network Associates as the technological leader in the anti-virus
world.'' &QL;

RIVAL NETWORKS CHALLENGE CNN WAR COVERAGE

 (DW) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first NATO planes went into action over Yugoslavia on
March 24, CNN mobilized, too. War reporting is a specialty of the
network, which first made a significant impression with its
round-the-clock coverage of the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since then, however, and even since the last
time bombs fell in the Balkans, in 1995. CNN no longer monopolizes
the cable news business; MSNBC and the Fox News Channel now take
chunks of the audience, too.
</P>
<P>
   But for each of the three networks, the Yugoslav fighting brings
into focus an identity question. During slow news periods, their
success depends partly on flashy entertainment flourishes. During
wars or disasters, their success depends on the accuracy, speed,
comprehensiveness and credibility of their reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of cable news is subtle and complicated, and not
just measurable by ratings,'' said Erik Sorenson, vice president
and general manager of MSNBC. ``There are other ways to measure it
_ how your journalistic colleagues view the work you do, how the
public views your work _ in other words, the battle for
respectability.''
</P>
<P>
   In that battle, CNN and MSNBC have an advantage over Fox. CNN,
19 years old, has made its name on coverage of breaking news. MSNBC
came factory-equipped with a solid news reputation because it is an
offshoot of NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, since the Yugoslav war began, the Nielsen ratings
for both CNN and MSNBC have rocketed upward faster than those of
the Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of the war, March 24-30, the average number of
households around the clock tuned to CNN rose 113 percent, and in
prime time the average number rose 79 percent, to 1.08 million. For
MSNBC, the total-day average rose 92 percent and the prime-time
average rose 107 percent (to 348,000 homes), while for Fox the
total-day figure rose 52 percent and the prime-time figure only 23
percent (to 269,000 homes).
</P>
<P>
   But when the war broke out, the Fox News Channel was on a
ratings upswing fueled largely by its prime-time growth.
</P>
<P>
   From the first quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of 1999, the
Fox News Channel's average prime-time audience almost tripled, to
221,000 households a night from 79,000. It was the only news
network to show growth in both 24-hour and prime-time ratings from
the fourth quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This is fairly remarkable, considering that three years ago
Fox's news division consisted of 28 people feeding videotape to Fox
stations for local newscasts. When the Fox News Channel went on the
air in October 1996, it reached 17 million homes; now, it is on
cable systems reaching about 39 million. (CNN reaches about 76
million homes, MSNBC about 48 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Ailes, chairman of the Fox News Channel, likes to say that
it has gained viewers by being fair and balanced. He acknowledges,
though, that the frequent criticism of his network as politically
conservative can be advantageous, whether true or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't care; most of them think the media tips to
the left anyway,'' Ailes said. ``If our enemies keep attacking us
as tipping to the right, fine. That helps us attract more viewers.
I don't care because I know we're fair and balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Several media analysts say that conservative viewers have long
believed that no news network shared their perspective, and they
are now bolstering Fox's audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``News junkies are disproportionately right wing in this
country,'' said Andrew Tyndall, whose Tyndall Report tracks the
types of subjects covered on news programs. ``That's the secret of
Rush Limbaugh's success on the radio. Fox is trying to convert
those talk-radio fans to its TV channel.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of the talk-show host Rush Limbaugh's attraction is
that he is brash and outspoken. Ailes argues that personality and
confrontation are important to the cable news business _ at least
in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our personalities are stronger,'' he said. ``Each has
defenders and detractors, but people watch them because they are
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also conservative or conservative-leaning for the most
part: Brit Hume, Bill O'Reilly, Matt Drudge and Sean Hannity.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years, CNN has only two franchise shows,'' Ailes
said, citing ``Larry King Live'' and ``Crossfire,'' a debate show.
``Larry King Live'' is by far CNN's highest-rated show.
</P>
<P>
   The network has tried to liven up prime time with a
three-nights-a-week show called ``CNN Newsstand,'' produced with
three Time Inc. magazines, Entertainment Weekly, Fortune and Time.
But the programs have averaged a 0.6 rating, well below CNN's
prime-time average.
</P>
<P>
   In May, CNN plans to shift those programs to 8 p.m. from 10
p.m., where they will face less competition from entertainment
shows and news magazine programs. It was on ``CNN Newsstand'' that
CNN broadcast a report on Operation Tailwind in Vietnam, later
discredited, that was a major embarrassment but apparently did not
harm CNN's overall credibility with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC has had its own troubles in prime time. Other than Brian
Williams. it has found no standout personality. Even his 9 p.m.
program, a straight newscast, gets only modest ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Ailes and Sorenson, who agree on little else, both say that even
if they polish up their prime-time programs, the overall battle is
still a 24-hour one, and still has an undisputed leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our battle with MSNBC _ that's intramural sports,'' Ailes
said. ``The varsity contest is CNN.''

 &HT;    Natural gas race shifts to high gear
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's natural gas deregulation, which reaches the
six-month mark today, is entering a new phase.
</P>
<P>
   With a deadline looming for customers to choose a company or be
assigned to one, marketers are scrambling to lure as many
fence-sitters as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes is expected shortly to sign legislation that
speeds the process. The Public Service Commission then will serve
notice that Atlanta Gas Light Co. customers have 100 days to choose
a marketer. Those who haven't chosen one by Aug. 11 will be
randomly assigned to one by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   A series of radio and newspaper ads has already been prepared to
put customers on notice that the time has come to ``make an
educated choice.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count, almost 600,000 of AGL's 1.4 million customers had
chosen a marketer since signups began Oct. 6. That's 43 percent,
more than most observers had expected at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now on Barnes' desk was proposed in response to the
uproar over AGL's rates earlier this year and intended to expedite
the utility's exit from natural gas sales. It was approved last
month by unanimous votes in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill gives the PSC authority to speed the ``random
assignment'' of AGL customers who have not chosen marketers by Aug.
11. Competitors will be assigned customers in proportion to the
market share they've attained. AGL will then exit the sales
business and be responsible only for distribution of gas to homes
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   PSC Chairman Stan Wise said he hopes the process can be
completed ``with a minimum of disruption'' to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some of the senior citizens and perhaps folks that don't
have English as a first language will be alarmed by it,'' Wise
said.
</P>
<P>
   AGL will notify customers twice in writing before they are
assigned. But even after their accounts are turned over to another
company, customers will not be ``married'' to them and can change
service later, Wise noted.
</P>
<P>
   A new study of Georgia's gas deregulation by Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, a Massachusetts-based think tank, forecast a
sharp increase in sales efforts ``as inactive marketers make a
last-ditch effort to gain market share before the assignment
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Residential customers are typically saving from 6 percent to 19
percent, compared with AGL's rates, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   But according to marketers, most customers inclined to switch
their gas service may have already done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that are left are those who take a long time to
make a decision,'' said James DeLong, residential marketing
director at Virginia-based Columbia Energy Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting closer to the totally apathetic people who
really don't care,'' added Betty Grant, brand manager for
Atlanta-based GasKey.
</P>
<P>
   In the race to shake loose the remaining 800,000 customers:
</P>
<P>
   _ SCANA Energy and Georgia Natural Gas Services have announced
their special promotional offers of free gas will expire this
month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Energy America plans to hire about 100 college students ``with
big smiles and rosy cheeks'' to go door-to-door to sell natural
gas, said Al McDonald, vice president of the affiliate of San
Diego-based Sempra Energy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Columbia Energy Services has launched a new advertising and
direct-mail campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shell Energy Services is matching competitors by adding
variable rates, which change by the month, in addition to rates
that are guaranteed for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers, however, may find many of the remaining customers a
hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   There may be little incentive for some to switch because AGL's
rates are currently lower than most marketers' and gas usage is
customarily low during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   In additio n, surveys indicate 200,000 to 300,000 customers have
little interest in deregulation and would be just as happy to
continue purchasing gas from AGL. As many as half of that number
are considered ``loyalists'' to the longtime monopoly supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Natural Gas Services may have an advantage with that
group. The company dropped references to its affiliation with AGL
in promotional materials during the flap over AGL's rates in
January. Restoring the references is ``something we're
evaluating,'' said A. Clifton Payne, vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors are also making deals with businesses and trade
associations, and offering special rates to their employees and
members. Such offers carry ``a little bit of trust'' for potential
customers because they come with employers' implicit endorsement.
The deals also require minimal marketing expenses to obtain
reliable customers, said Keith Sappenfield, director of marketing
support at Houston-based Reliant Energy Retail.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Energy Research Associates said Georgia's deregulation
program will serve as a model for other states. What makes the
program unique, the group said, is the ``random assignment''
process, which has attracted marketers and fostered competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should this approach prove successful, we expect to see it
replicated in other states, particularly in the South and
Southeast,'' the group said.

<P>
   Five months after Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. rattled the book industry
with the seismic announcement of its acquisition of the nation's
largest wholesaler, Ingram Book Group, the proposed merger is
undergoing intense federal scrutiny and is now being investigated
by the California attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   When the $600 million purchase was announced in early November,
Barnes &AMP; Noble's top executives confidently predicted that the
merger of the nation's largest bookseller and wholesaler would be
completed in 35 to 45 days, but the Federal Trade Commission's
antitrust review has lingered longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers, meanwhile, have organized one of the
most elaborate opposition campaigns in the recent history of the
book industry, with so many petitions, e-mails and telephone
appeals to the FTC that the agency has set aside a special line
just to record calls about the Ingram deal. (``If your call is in
reference to the proposed Barnes &AMP; Noble-Ingram merger, please
press one,'' its voice-mail system tells callers.)
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's acquisition of Ingram, a unit of Ingram
Industries, is undergoing a level of scrutiny from the FTC that is
known as a ``second request review,'' in general a rare move that
allows the agency to extend its examination of the competitive
impact of a proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   The length and type of the review does not necessarily mean the
merger is in deep trouble. Other recent book industry deals have
faced intense reviews from Federal regulators but still were
eventually approved.
</P>
<P>
   The British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of
inspection for its purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education unit,
which was ultimately approved. Bertelsmann AG's successful
acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also
received additional attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Ingram deal has galvanized strong opposition from
booksellers in California. There, a spokeswoman for the state
attorney general said Friday that the agency was reviewing the
deal. ``We're investigating,'' said the spokeswoman Sandra
Michioku, the director of public affairs for the attorney general,
Bill Lockyer. ``The process is to look at what would be the impact
of the merger and to make a decision whether it's
anticompetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FTC approves the merger, California can ask a
federal judge to block it, said Ms. Michioku, who declined to
comment on what prompted the state to get involved. She said she
knew of no other state that was investigating the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut attorney general's office is monitoring the FTC
review, although it is not conducting one itself.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble in New
York, said the company was not aware of the California
investigation, although it did receive a letter from the state
requesting information that the bookstore chain was providing to
Federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not uncommon for a state attorney general to be
interested in a transaction like this, because there have been
concerns raised about this,'' Ms. Keating said. She noted that the
company was ``confident that this acquisition will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts, Barnes &AMP;
Noble's chairman and chief executive, Leonard Riggio, said that he
expected a decision by the FTC in 60 to 90 days, which would be
sometime in June.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, based in Nashville, is the dominant force in book
distribution. Privately held, it does not disclose its market
share. Barnes &AMP; Noble's sales account for about 14 percent of the
consumer book market.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the merger's opponents are worried that the Ingram
purchase will give Barnes &AMP; Noble access to the sales data of
independent competitors or allow it to stock its stores with
popular books that might be in short supply while making a
competitor like Amazon.com wait for the same title.
</P>
<P>
   After the many recent mergers in the book industry, some
opponents of the Barnes &AMP; Noble-Ingram deal said they believed it
was getting more serious attention because they were being asked by
the FTC to provide formal declarations of opposition. The agency
declined to comment on the status of its review.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that we've been asked for declarations,
and nothing like this has happened before with the struggle with
Simon &AMP; Schuster and Bertelsmann and Random House,'' said Letty
Cottin Pogrebin, the president of the Authors Guild in New York,
which challenged the other mergers.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Cooper, a Washington antitrust specialist who is not
involved in the case, said the request for declarations indicated
that the federal review had reached a new level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests that they did reach a stage where they have
problems and they are willing to go ahead and seek a preliminary
injunction,'' Cooper said. ``I think that they have problems and
they're trying to work those out.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that declarations are normally collected in preparation
for an injunction request or for use in persuading FTC
commissioners to block a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the merger took comfort from Ingram's
announcement in March of a stategic alliance with Entertainment
Marketing Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   Through its Book Scan unit, EMIS will take over the collection
of sales data from independent bookstores that were previously
polled by Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   This move, in the opponents' view, represents an effort to
address the concern that Ingram might pass along information about
independent booksellers to Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y.,
independent booksellers have conducted a letter-writing campaign
against the merger that has delivered the signatures of more than
115,000 book buyers to the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   The independent booksellers also have held meetings with elected
officials, which have resulted in letters from officials like Sen.
Michael DeWine, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, urging the federal
agency to review the merger closely.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council in Berkeley, Calif., passed a resolution
supporting the effort of independent booksellers to block the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, a long-distance telephone and credit card
company, Working Assets, organized a telephone campaign by its
customers that resulted in 35,000 calls to the FTC to oppose the
merger, according to Janet Nudelman, a director at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Booksellers are not a particularly political group of folks,''
said Oren Teicher, who has been organizing the opposition for the
American Booksellers Association. ``They tend not to be involved in
this kind of lobbying. But in this case we have found the inverse
to be true. Booksellers are enormously responsive.''

PREACHING AND PICKING POCKETS ON A RACIAL FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time is pre-World War II in America, and the setting of
``The Mitt Man,'' Mel Taylor's combustible first novel, is the
racial frontier of Southern life. A smart grifter known as King
Fish, who lives on the treacherously jazzy margins of New Orleans
black society, gets caught trying to pick the pocket of an outsize
white racist preacher named Malcolm Cage. While pointing his
stacked-barrel derringer at him, Cage sees the spark of genius in
King Fish and decides to turn him into a preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're different, ain't you?'' is the way Cage expresses his
conviction about the man who just tried to rob him. King Fish
``ain't like no'' black man ``I ever met,'' Cage tells him. ``Shows
in your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   So begins Taylor's raw and rowdy tale of corrupted ambition and
racial tragedy, which stretches from Baptist revival meetings to
the malignant interior of a Southern chain gang. ``The Mitt Man''
is a strong debut by a writer of rough-edged power who, according
to the publisher's publicity notes, spent a decade or so in prison
himself and won a long battle against cocaine addiction before
turning to fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mitt Man'' is part ``Cool Hand Luke,'' part ``Elmer
Gantry,'' part ``Invisible Man,'' with a dash of ``Midnight
Cowboy'' for good measure. As an artistic whole, it is marred by a
maudlin ending and an occasional loss of narrative control. But
overall, ``The Mitt Man'' _ the term refers to a con artist who
exploits the religious fervor of his dupes _ is a fine, pulsating
story whose roots go deep into the violent, primordial American
racial cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Two figures dominate the action of Taylor's book. One is King
Fish, who is already in his late 30s when we meet him at the
Bucket-of-Blood, a seedy black club on the outskirts of New
Orleans. King Fish is ``a true `slickster,' a skilled pickpocket
and cardsharp'' who uses Scripture, in partnership with his lady
friends, to disarm his victims and gain a kind of racial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a small twisted way,'' Taylor writes, King Fish's scams
``struck a blow for the colored race, proved colored folks were
smart after all.'' When King Fish is set up as a preacher by his
victim-turned-benefactor, Malcolm Cage, he sees the situation as an
opportunity to continue the hustle. King Fish ``believed this crazy
cracker could show him the way to big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's other main figure (along with a large and vivid cast of
minor ones) is Jimmie Lamar, whose path crosses that of King Fish's
in prison, where he learns the finer arts of cardsharping and other
swindles from the master. Jimmie is a very different character from
King Fish. He is from Ohio. He was a football star in high school
and college. He goes to New York to make his fortune, but there he
is swept up into a world of easy sex, nightclubs and street
hustling not all that different from the older King Fish's down
South.
</P>
<P>
   When an act of impetuous vengeance brings the career of King
Fish to an end, he passes the torch to Jimmie, whom he instructs in
the mitt man swindle. But Jimmie, who begins this new career with
the necessary cynicism, becomes trapped in a complex psychological
web of greed, guilt and creeping religious conviction. He ends up
in a corrupt muddle reminiscent of the disillusioned visions of
Sinclair Lewis or Theodore Dreiser.
</P>
<P>
   Two other related themes haunt Taylor's boisterous story. ``The
Mitt Man'' is saturated with the spiritual and psychological
calculus of race. Almost all of Taylor's characters are lined up
along the spectrum of racial attitudes and actions. Cage is a
patronizing sort of racist who seeks to return black society to a
kind of benevolent plantation, complete with segregated forms of
spiritual solace. But he changes, largely under the influence of
his wife, Lorene, who grew up on a real plantation and understands,
in advance of her time, the nature and dimensions of the South's
moral blindness.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the tragedy of ``The Mitt Man'' is the undying
racial unfairness of American life, which makes for an interesting
paradox: Both King Fish and Jimmie Lamar are petty crooks, but both
run afoul of the law for actions taken outside the boundaries of
their usual grifters' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The other theme is sexual. Taylor gives play to several
full-blooded female characters in ``The Mitt Man'' who play
parallel roles in the lives of their violent, impetuous men. The
women position themselves along the same cynical starting line as
the men. Jimmie Lamar is introduced to the hustle by a woman named
Masaya, who is already a seasoned pro when they meet.
</P>
<P>
   But the women are quick to arrive at a point of moral
reawakening that turns out to be impossible for their men. The
result for the women is either redemption or loss. Whatever the
result, the divide that separates them from their men in this novel
is a kind of parallel version of the yawning racial gap that
separates the men from the American promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't but two kinda people in the wurl,' '' King Fish tells
Jimmie Lamar in prison. ``The ones that gives and the ones that
takes, and know'n what ya gonna be is the difference between bein'
a player or suckuh.'' Taylor's book gives a full understanding of
that attitude, but it is also a tumultuous, profane fable on why it
is inadequate as a guide to life.

   BASEBALL-SUIT _ When Sterling Lapinski settled into his seat at
an Atlanta Braves game two years ago, all he wanted to do was enjoy
America's pastime and drink some cold beers with his buddies from
work. Then the unthinkable happened. As Lapinski was talking to a
waitress about his next beer, New York Mets catcher Todd Pratt
swung and missed at a Tom Glavine fastball and flung his bat into
the stands, where it hit Lapinski in the head, crushing his skull.
The injuries _ and a tremendous scar _ are still with Lapinski, who
now lives in Houston. In a novel lawsuit, Lapinski has sued the
Mets ballclub saying that Pratt _ who threw his bat into the stands
three times during the game, should be held responsible. A federal
judge has dismissed his suit, but Lapinski is appealing in the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. He and his lawyers are
trying to skirt the premises liability issue (ticket stubs say
patrons cannot hold ballyards liable for injuries) by saying thrown
bats are so unusual and unexpected ballclubs should be held
responsible. Some courts in other states have agreed. (Rankin,

concerning the crisis in Kosovo. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ At its starkest, the truth in Kosovo
is simple. Serbs, enboldened or maddened by NATO bombings, are on a
rampage of ethnic cleansing that has caused nearly a quarter of the
ethnic Albanian population to flee. But close up, real life is
rarely simple. Between those deaths lies a tangled web of history,
friendships and enmities, of war and routine business that were
echoed all over Kosovo. And those are the minutae of life and death
that are drowned out by the clashing statements of Washington and
Belgrade. By Alessanrda Stanley.

   KOSOVO-MOBILIZE (Belgrade, Serbia) _ No general mobilization has
been declared, but reserve units are being called up as
specialities are required. Men who served in radio and
communications units, for instance, are being ordered to report for
duty, some Serbs say. Wartime military courts have been established
to court-martial those who do not report to their units
immediately, with prison terms for draft-dodging can range from one
to 20 years. Official Serbian state television has shown glowing
reports of young men responding to mobilization or draft orders,
and it is likely that a large majority does so. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace) _ As the tide of refugees has swelled
the miserable crowd to 30,000, conditions have deteriorated
alarmingly. Death and disease are becoming commonplace. Aid
agencies said 11 people died Friday night, and another 14 died
Saturday night, mostly the old and very young, many of them
suffering from exposure. Local journalists reported several babies
had been born in the camp, too, and that one of the mothers died in
childbirth Saturday. By Carlotta Gall.

   EDUC-PARTNERS (Montclair, N.J.) _ On a frigid March morning, 35
second graders squirmed with delight in the Watchung School
auditorium at the prospect of receiving a disposable camera and a
creative assignment: recording their lives and tastes in
photographs and writing. The homework was not assigned by teachers
at this public elementary school just 15 miles west of New York
City. Instead, the assignment, handed out to some 250 children at
the school, came from researchers for Noggin, a new educational
channel that has formed a special partnership with Watchung. In
exchange for $7,100, Noggin can go into the school once a week from
now until June to run focus groups with some 250 children who
turned in parent permission slips. For Rita Miragliotta, Watchung's
principal, the partnership has been a boon, helping ease a budget
crunch. But for others in the education world, which has seen an
explosion of corporate suitors, deals like the Watchung-Noggin
partnership are things to be avoided, as they blur the line
separating schools from supermarkets.

 &HT;    Fan plans to make pitch in court
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Sterling Lapinski settled into his seat at Turner
Field on a pleasant summer evening in July 1997, he expected to
watch the Atlanta Braves and drink some cold beers with his buddies
from work. Then the unthinkable happened.
</P>
<P>
   As Lapinski talked to a waitress in the top of the fifth inning
about his next beer, New York Mets catcher Todd Pratt swung and
missed a Tom Glavine fastball. His bat slipped out of his hands and
sailed 100 feet into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who was looking away, turned back toward the field
after hearing warning shouts from the crowd. Pratt's bat slammed
into his forehead. With blood gushing from his nose and in
excruciating pain, he was taken to Crawford Long Hospital where
doctors told him the bat had shattered his skull, crushed his sinus
cavity and tore the lining of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain was far and away the worst I've ever had in my
life,'' said Lapinski, 29, then a Southern Co. electricity broker.
Doctors told Lapinski that if he hadn't turned toward the field _
and had instead been struck in the side of his head _ he would not
have made it to the hospital alive.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Pratt flung his bat into the stands
that game, and it wasn't the last time, either. During each of
Pratt's first three trips to the plate, his bat slipped out of his
hand and sailed into the stands. Only Lapinski, struck during
Pratt's second at bat, was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Mets first baseman John Olerud passed up a bat to him after he
was hit and the Braves later mailed him an autographed picture of
Chipper Jones, Lapinski said. But that has done little to make him
forgive and forget.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski has turned from spectator to plaintiff, filing a
federal lawsuit against the Mets ballclub and its owners, Sterling
Doubleday Enterprises, seeking compensatory damages for his medical
bills and for his pain and suffering. He is now appealing a ruling
last fall by a federal judge in Atlanta who dismissed the lawsuit,
relying partly on prior baseball-injury court decisions that said
to grant spectators the right to sue ballclubs would change the way
the game is played and viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski was sitting on the 14th row behind the Mets dugout on
the third base side at the July 11, 1997, game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole incident was ridiculous,'' he said. ``Everybody who
was sitting in the stadium that night knew (Pratt) wasn't playing
up to professional standards. For him to throw three bats in the
stands and for the Mets not do anything about it is
reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who now lives in Houston, said he still feels the
effects of his injury. Parts of the top of his head are numb, his
forehead often begins itching or aches and he has a deadened sense
of smell. Doctors say there is a risk that mucus could seep into
his sinus cavity, swelling it and causing seizures, even blindness.
Lapinski said he also has an ear-to-ear scar across the top of his
head that will be easy to see if he goes bald.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview after the game, Pratt said the bat
slipped because he must have been trying to swing too hard and the
night was hot and humid. ``I guess I didn't have enough pine tar on
the bat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets ballclub, represented by the Atlanta law firm of Alston
&AMP; Bird, responded in court motions that a fan, by voluntarily
entering a ballpark as a spectator, knowingly accepts the risks and
hazards that come with watching the game, including bats and balls
sent flying into the crowd. The Mets also contended that Lapinski
failed to exercise ordinary care by ignoring the game while Pratt
was at bat.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lapinski took offense at the Mets' criticism
that he was looking away from the field. ``I would hardly say I was
being negligent,'' he said. ``If it's required behavior for fans to
keep their eyes on the field at all times then they shouldn't be
selling beer and other products while the game is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing legal arguments from both parties, U.S. District
Judge Jack Camp sided with the Mets, dismissing the lawsuit in a
ruling last fall. Lapinski is now asking the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to reinstate the case.
</P>
<P>
   In court motions filed last month, Lapinski's lawyer, Bill
deGolian, said spectators assume the risk of getting hit by
baseballs _ but not by bats that slip out of players' hands. He
noted that the back side of Lapinski's ticket stub makes no mention
of bats, stating: ``Management will not be responsible for injuries
to persons struck by batted or thrown balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets sold by major league teams mention bats this season. The
stubs say that spectators assume ``all risk and danger incidental
to the game of baseball ... including the danger of being injured
by thrown bats and thrown or batted balls.''
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit supporting Lapinski's case, Mike Marshall, the
former major league relief pitcher who holds a doctorate in
exercise physiology, testified it is ``extraordinarily rare'' for a
player to fling his bat into the stands. Bats that slip out of
player's hands typically land in the field of play, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who played 21 years, said he has ``never seen or heard
of'' a baseball player throwing his bat into the stands three times
in one game. For Pratt to let this happen ``is clear evidence that
he was handling his bat in a manner inconsistent with what is
taught and expected of a professional baseball player,'' Marshall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Records from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's
national injury information clearinghouse indicate that the chance
of a baseball fan getting seriously injured at a professional game
is highly unlikely. Most injuries occur in recreational games,
according to the clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves do not keep records of how often spectators are hit
by bats or balls, said Jim Schultz, the team's director of public
relations. ``Serious injuries are very rare but can happen and are
a concern of ours,'' he said. ``We are prepared to deal with
situations like that as best as we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, courts have resisted granting spectators the
right to sue baseball teams for injuries sustained while attending
games.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1986 case involving a woman struck by a foul ball at a Los
Angeles Dodgers game, for example, the California Court of Appeals
said that a ruling in the woman's favor could affect the way the
game is played and enjoyed by millions.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing this plaintiff and others like her to recover
damages from the ballclub, the court said, baseball stadium owners
would be forced to do one of two things: place all spectator areas
behind screens, reducing the quality of everyone's view and
preventing players from reaching into the stands to catch foul
balls; or continue the status quo and hike up ticket prices to
cover the cost of compensating injured patrons, meaning many fans
could not afford to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, neither alternative is acceptable,'' the court said,
dismissing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Camp, a federal judge in Atlanta appointed to the bench in 1988
by President Reagan, based his dismissal of Lapinski's lawsuit
largely on a Georgia Court of Appeals decision handed down in 1949.
The lawsuit was filed by a spectator injured by a wildly thrown
baseball at a game in Thomasville.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, the court said that a spectator who chooses or
accepts a seat in an unprotected portion of the grandstand
``voluntarily assumes the risks inherent in such a position.'' The
court said it reviewed numerous cases involving spectators
``injured by foul balls, flying bats and other like missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lapinski attempted to draw a distinction between injuries
by balls and by bats, Camp said he could find no legal basis for
one.
</P>
<P>
   But Lapinski's lawyer is asking the federal appeals court to
take notice of a 1938 California case _ one that involved a thrown
bat, not a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Martha Ratcliff was injured by being hit with a
bat that had slipped out of the hands of a player during a Pacific
Coast League game in San Diego. Ratcliff's lawsuit was allowed to
go to trial, and she won a $2,000 verdict against the San Diego
Baseball Club. The California Court of Appeals upheld the verdict,
saying that reasonable care should have been taken to guard against
these types of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   If Lapinski can get the case to trial, deGolian said he would
like to present as Exhibit A Pratt's interview with a New York
cable TV program, Pennant Chase, after the game, during which the
catcher joked about the three times his bat sailed into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Pratt stepped up to the plate for his fourth at bat,
in which he held onto the bat and grounded out, fans at Turner
Field were booing him vociferously. ``Some of the guys were busting
my chops,'' Pratt said of his teammates, who told him the hammer
throw at the 1996 Olympic Games happened in Atlanta the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   About the boos, Pratt said, ``I'm lucky it wasn't in
Philadelphia. It wasn't like I meant it. I apologize to the fans in
Atlanta. But, hey, hang loose.

Lapinski said he also has an ear-to-ear scar across the top of his
head that will be easy to see if he goes bald.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview after the game, Pratt said the bat
slipped because he must have been trying to swing too hard and the
night was hot and humid. ``I guess I didn't have enough pine tar on
the bat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets ballclub, represented by the Atlanta law firm of Alston
&AMP; Bird, responded in court motions that a fan, by voluntarily
entering a ballpark as a spectator, knowingly accepts the risks and
hazards that come with watching the game, including bats and balls
sent flying into the crowd. The Mets also contended that Lapinski
failed to exercise ordinary care by ignoring the game while Pratt
was at bat.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lapinski took offense at the Mets' criticism
that he was looking away from the field. ``I would hardly say I was
being negligent,'' he said. ``If it's required behavior for fans to
keep their eyes on the field at all times then they shouldn't be
selling beer and other products while the game is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing legal arguments from both parties, U.S. District
Judge Jack Camp sided with the Mets, dismissing the lawsuit in a
ruling last fall. Lapinski is now asking the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to reinstate the case.
</P>
<P>
   In court motions filed last month, Lapinski's lawyer, Bill
deGolian, said spectators assume the risk of getting hit by
baseballs _ but not by bats that slip out of players' hands. He
noted that the back side of Lapinski's ticket stub makes no mention
of bats, stating: ``Management will not be responsible for injuries
to persons struck by batted or thrown balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets sold by major league teams mention bats this season. The
stubs say that spectators assume ``all risk and danger incidental
to the game of baseball ... including the danger of being injured
by thrown bats and thrown or batted balls.''
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit supporting Lapinski's case, Mike Marshall, the
former major league relief pitcher who holds a doctorate in
exercise physiology, testified it is ``extraordinarily rare'' for a
player to fling his bat into the stands. Bats that slip out of
player's hands typically land in the field of play, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who played 21 years, said he has ``never seen or heard
of'' a baseball player throwing his bat into the stands three times
in one game. For Pratt to let this happen ``is clear evidence that
he was handling his bat in a manner inconsistent with what is
taught and expected of a professional baseball player,'' Marshall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Records from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's
national injury information clearinghouse indicate that the chance
of a baseball fan getting seriously injured at a professional game
is highly unlikely. Most injuries occur in recreational games,
according to the clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves do not keep records of how often spectators are hit
by bats or balls, said Jim Schultz, the team's director of public
relations. ``Serious injuries are very rare but can happen and are
a concern of ours,'' he said. ``We are prepared to deal with
situations like that as best as we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, courts have resisted granting spectators the
right to sue baseball teams for injuries sustained while attending
games.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1986 case involving a woman struck by a foul ball at a Los
Angeles Dodgers game, for example, the California Court of Appeals
said that a ruling in the woman's favor could affect the way the
game is played and enjoyed by millions.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing this plaintiff and others like her to recover
damages from the ballclub, the court said, baseball stadium owners
would be forced to do one of two things: place all spectator areas
behind screens, reducing the quality of everyone's view and
preventing players from reaching into the stands to catch foul
balls; or continue the status quo and hike up ticket prices to
cover the cost of compensating injured patrons, meaning many fans
could not afford to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, neither alternative is acceptable,'' the court said,
dismissing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Camp, a federal judge in Atlanta appointed to the bench in 1988
by President Reagan, based his dismissal of Lapinski's lawsuit
largely on a Georgia Court of Appeals decision handed down in 1949.
The lawsuit was filed by a spectator injured by a wildly thrown
baseball at a game in Thomasville.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, the court said that a spectator who chooses or
accepts a seat in an unprotected portion of the grandstand
``voluntarily assumes the risks inherent in such a position.'' The
court said it reviewed numerous cases involving spectators
``injured by foul balls, flying bats and other like missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lapinski attempted to draw a distinction between injuries
by balls and by bats, Camp said he could find no legal basis for
one.
</P>
<P>
   But Lapinski's lawyer is asking the federal appeals court to
take notice of a 1938 California case _ one that involved a thrown
bat, not a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Martha Ratcliff was injured by being hit with a
bat that had slipped out of the hands of a player during a Pacific
Coast League game in San Diego. Ratcliff's lawsuit was allowed to
go to trial, and she won a $2,000 verdict against the San Diego
Baseball Club. The California Court of Appeals upheld the verdict,
saying that reasonable care should have been taken to guard against
these types of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   If Lapinski can get the case to trial, deGolian said he would
like to present as Exhibit A Pratt's interview with a New York
cable TV program, Pennant Chase, after the game, during which the
catcher joked about the three times his bat sailed into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Pratt stepped up to the plate for his fourth at bat,
in which he held onto the bat and grounded out, fans at Turner
Field were booing him vociferously. ``Some of the guys were busting
my chops,'' Pratt said of his teammates, who told him the hammer
throw at the 1996 Olympic Games happened in Atlanta the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   About the boos, Pratt said, ``I'm lucky it wasn't in
Philadelphia. It wasn't like I meant it. I apologize to the fans in
Atlanta. But, hey, hang loose.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ For David Clark, an MIT computer scientist,
research is like ``an expedition into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   With the faculty and students at the Laboratory of Computer
Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Clark, one of
the lab's top managers, is about to embark on just such a journey _
one meant to liberate computing from the PC-centric world it has
occupied for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, scientists here plan to introduce Oxygen, an
ambitious $40 million, five-year research project that is being
financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA, the Pentagon's research arm. The objective is as broad as it
is audacious: to reinvent all facets of information technology,
from chips and software to computers and networks. And in the
Oxygenated future, a desktop computer would be largely beside the
point.
</P>
<P>
   In this digital new world, a person could know if a colleague
working elsewhere was reachable at her desk, because sensory-based
computers in the wall would know. A handheld point-and-click
pointing device could be used to remotely command every household
appliance to do its bidding. And instead of typing on keyboards or
stabbing at a screen with a stylus, a person would simply tell any
computer what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least such concepts are the vision. In reality, the Oxygen
project, Clark said, must walk the exceedingly thin line between an
unrealistically futuristic ``Star Trek'' notion of computing and an
overly timid short-armed reach for the easily attainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to quantum tunnel from `It's too soon' to `It's too
late,''' he said. ``You've got to have guts.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to dismiss such talk, were it not for the
Laboratory of Computer Science's track record over the last three
and a half decades. True, it has simmered at a lower publicity
temperature than its bubbly academic sister, the MIT Media
Laboratory. But since its creation in 1964, the LCS, as it is
known, has been associated with many of the most important
developments in computing.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's many historic fruits include word-processing and
spreadsheet software. And though it was invented elsewhere by
Robert Metcalfe, Ethernet, the standard architecture of today's PC
networks, was subsequently refined during the 1970s as Metcalfe
wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   It may be an MIT effort predating the lab by a year _ Project
MAC, set in motion by a $2 million DARPA grant in 1963 _ that
offers the best model for a project like Oxygen and the impact it
could conceivably have on the next generation of computing.
</P>
<P>
   It was Project MAC, after all, that redefined the computing
world by making it possible for many users to simultaneously share
a single computer. From Project MAC sprang innovations like an
early e-mail system and the concept of shared information
utilities, the forerunners of today's online communities and even
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Project Oxygen, which will be formally kicked off at the
laboratory's 35th anniversary next week, is the brainchild of the
lab's director, Michael Dertouzous, a computer scientist whose own
career traces to his days working on Project MAC as an MIT student.
Intent on putting people first, Dertouzous is determined to chart
an information technology future in which computers recede into the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to liberate ourselves from the tyranny of `going to
the computer,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, seen as a proof-of-concept testbed for technologies that
others might turn into actual products, will be based on several
components that the lab is already developing.
</P>
<P>
   The first will be called Handy 21 and will be a portable device
with a small screen, a video camera, a Global Positioning System
receiver and a powerful computer. Combining the functions of a
cellular telephone, two-way data radio, television set, beeper,
handheld computer and intelligent remote-control pointing device,
the Handy 21 will rely heavily on advanced voice-recognition
technologies that have been developed at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition _ the ability for machines to understand
spoken instructions _ is a vital part of the Oxygen project. A
group led by the MIT speech researcher Victor Zue has developed an
approach significantly different from that now being pursued by
most others in the speech-recognition field.
</P>
<P>
   Zue's Spoken Language Systems group has developed systems with
powerful speech-recognition capabilities _ in large part because
they focus on relatively narrow subject areas, like the weather,
airline reservations or local traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confess that I don't know how to build HAL,'' Zue
said, referring to the computer in ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' with
the complete conversational repertory of an eerily dispassionate
human being.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the Spoken Language Systems research group is to
achieve a limited, though seemingly conversational, voice input
system by stitching together many different recognition systems
with vocabularies based on narrowly defined subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Zue cites three factors making voice recognition more important
as a computer interface: Computers are becoming increasingly
mobile; people love to talk, and the shrinking size of computers is
making the conventional keyboard a large and ungainly component.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the design effort will revolve around the idea of
delegating tasks to machines. For example, Zue said that instead of
merely inquiring of the Oxygen system when a plane is scheduled to
arrive at the airport, the user, planning to meet the flight, might
also give this command: ``Call me half an hour before Flight 116
lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Handy 21, the Oxygen system will be based on another
building-block computer that the researchers call Enviro 21. These
devices, which would be powerful versions of the Handy 21 system,
would be embedded in office walls, car trunks or basements at home.
The systems would have extensive sensor networks meant to enable
them to monitor the state of the environment _ knowing whether an
office door is open, for example, or if the car trunk is unlocked
or the basement sump pump is operating.
</P>
<P>
   And besides merely sensing a situation, the Enviro 21 would have
the intelligence to instruct mechanical systems to close the door,
lock the trunk or reset the pump. Or by the same token, if an
office door is open, a distant colleague might infer that the
occupant would not mind being interrupted with a phone call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both the Handy 21 and the Enviro 21 will be based on a processor
chip design developed by Anant Agarwal, a computer architect at the
lab. Working with IBM, Agarwal's group is now designing a processor
architecture known as Raw. Unlike earlier chip designs which are
based on predetermined instruction sets, Raw processors subject
even the most minute, or ``raw,'' circuitry of the processor to
customization by software designers.
</P>
<P>
   Raw is a gamble, because it would be harder to program than
conventional processors. But it might have a huge payoff if the
design proves workable, by offering markedly faster data processing
and the potential for large numbers of the chips to be custom
programmed to work in powerful concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our experiments will be high risk, and they will
fail,'' Dertouzous conceded. ``But there is also low-hanging
fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Oxygen is the clearest example yet in a new direction in
federal financing of information technology research patterned
after previous research projects that upset the dominant computing
assumptions of their day. A notable example from the past is
Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about investing in long-term, high-risk
research,'' Tom Kalil, President Clinton's special assistant on
economic policy, said of Oxygen. ``What's motivating this is our
understanding of the impact of government investment in information
technology research in the 1960s and 1970s. Innovations from that
investment are driving the economy today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration,'' he said, ``really wants the research
community to invest in the future and swing for the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides speech recognition and Handy 21 and Enviro 21, the other
basic technology component of Oxygen would be a computer network
capable of linking the other systems together and also connecting
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With these, as well the underlying software that supports the
basic technologies, Dertouzous hopes that Project Oxygen can lead
to computing systems that bring a meaningful increase in human
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overarching goal,'' he said, ``is to enable people to do
more by doing less.''

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Why would Richard Li live anywhere but this
capitalist Klondike on the South China Sea?
</P>
<P>
   After all, he was born here 32 years ago. His father, Li
Ka-shing, is the biggest tycoon in town _ a rags-to-riches
billionaire who just put up a monumental, 62-story headquarters in
the heart of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But his father's empire is tied to the mercantile moorings of
trade and real estate. And the younger Li wants to build something
else _ a technology venture that will deliver Internet access and
other services to television sets and personal computers across
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Since announcing that grand plan a little more than a year ago,
though, Li is finding that a good place to make money is not always
a good place to nurture high-technology dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Li has been unable to persuade the best young local software
designers to live here while they develop the new service. One by
one, they have fled the high-rise canyons of Hong Kong for the
low-rise sprawl of Silicon Valley, where Li's venture partner, the
Intel Corp., is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we caught our last one, or has he gone back to California
as well?'' Li asked a colleague sardonically, while discussing his
plight last week. ``We keep five apartments here, but they're empty
because people keep going back.''
</P>
<P>
   For Li, the experience has brought home a bitter truth: Hong
Kong is seen by many as a technology backwater. Expensive and
lacking a critical mass of hardware or software manufacturers, it
seems destined to be a bit player in the digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than leave for Silicon Valley himself, however, Li wants
to haul Hong Kong into the information-technology mainstream. Last
month, his company, Pacific Century Group, and the Hong Kong
government announced a plan to build a $1.7 billion technology
complex called Cyberport.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberport is one of several futuristic technology parks that are
rising from Taiwan to Singapore. With Asia mired in recession and
the United States enjoying a high-technology boom, governments in
this region have seized on technology as a way to recapture their
growth.
</P>
<P>
   They regard these parks as potent marketing tools _ showcase
projects that can help vault them into the digital age and perhaps
even reverse a brain drain among their technology-minded youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis has forced countries to reassess their economic
models,'' said Alexander A. Arena, the chief executive of Pacific
Century's technology arm. ``I see these projects as laying the
foundation for the next spurt of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered question, of course, is whether creating the
architectural trappings of a high-technology settlement will induce
creative software engineers and Web designers to occupy those
gleaming new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberport is typical of the concept. Designed as a pocket-size
Silicon Valley, the office and residential park will sit on 64
acres on the southwest coast of Hong Kong island. Its mix of
buildings and leafy parks will be an oasis in this densely
populated city of 6.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the government subsidizing the project by donating the
land, office rents will be equal to those in the East Bay area of
San Francisco. That is a 70 percent discount to market rates in
Hong Kong's business district, where commercial rents are among the
highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Li has signed IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and six other
foreign companies as tenants. Eventually, he hopes that Cyberport
will be home to 100 smaller firms _ many of them home-grown _ which
he said should make Hong Kong a stimulating environment for even
his own company's restless techies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture has to change,'' Li said. ``If you don't attract
people from outside and have some sort of leadership, it will never
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Asian technology parks have an uneven track record. Some,
like the Hsinchu Science Industrial Park in Taiwan, nearly two
decades old, are well-established mini-cities with hundreds of
companies and thousands of residents. Others, like the Multimedia
Super Corridor in Malaysia, are still construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong's case, Cyberport was conceived only after the
Asian financial crisis laid bare the dangers of the territory's
overdependence on real estate and financial services. Li broached
the idea to Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, last year
after Tung said in his policy address that he wanted to diversify
the economy and make technology a new engine of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong's claim to prosperity is through trade and financial
services,'' said Otto Lin, the vice president for research at the
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ``All these
advantages are gradually eroding, so Hong Kong has to find another
road to prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin, a Taiwan-born academic who has advised the governments of
Taiwan and Singapore on technology policy, said Cyberport would
``accentuate the need for technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Hong Kong is determined to catch up with its neighbors,
he said it would have to change its business culture. Hong Kong's
emphasis on short-term speculation has made local companies
reluctant to invest in research and development because it does not
generate a quick return.
</P>
<P>
   Lin noted that spending on research and development in Hong
Kong, for example, is only three-tenths of a percent of gross
domestic product, compared with 1.4 percent in Singapore, 1.7
percent in Taiwan, and 2.8 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the attitude of Hong Kong business people, H.K.
Chang, president of City University of Hong Kong, said: ``I have
noticed a change from deep skepticism to open-mindedness. But I
don't think any of them have become true, avid advocates of
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That is in sharp contrast to Taiwan, which has been pouring
public funds into technology for about two decades. Focusing first
on serving multinational companies, Taipei has concentrated in
recent years on developing smaller, indigenous companies. Today,
native companies like Acer Inc. have turned Taiwan into one of the
world's biggest producers of computer components.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To jump-start the industry, Taiwan opened the Hsinchu science
park in late 1980 in a rural area north of Taipei. After four
expansions, it is now a 1,485-acre complex with 68,400 employees
and 245 companies. In 1997, the combined revenue of the companies
in the park was $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Technology experts note that Taiwan emphasizes more than bricks
and mortar. It has also placed a lot of emphasis on teaching
technology in its schools, colleges and universities. That has
helped entice Taiwan researchers, many of whom had left for the
United States, to return home with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Hong Kong must retool its educational system not
only to play up technology but also to promote more creative
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education in Hong Kong is based on rote learning,'' said
Wilson Tang, a civil engineering professor at the University of
Science and Technology here. ``Students believe that everything has
a single answer,'' he said. ``When something comes up that they
haven't encountered before, they tremble.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the aspiring Li, who majored in computer
engineering at Stanford University, likens the typical Hong Kong
college graduate to a ``violinist who is technically very good, but
there's no inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not just a matter of training young people to be more
innovative. Hong Kong has five major universities, which turn out
5,000 to 6,000 technology graduates a year. But it provides scant
job opportunities for these technologists. Although IBM, Dell
Computer and other major computer companies have offices here, they
tend to focus on sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Partly that is a function of Hong Kong's high costs. Intel and
Dell have both built manufacturing plants in Malaysia, where labor
costs are much lower, while IBM is setting up a chip-design center
in Singapore. Singapore may also land Dell's Internet sales
operation for Asia, which Dell is intent on moving from Japan to a
more central location in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singapore is very aggressive in terms of grants and tax
incentives,'' said Mark Stevens, the corporate vice president of
Dell's Asia-Pacific group. ``With Singapore, we are pulled to put
things here.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Singapore government announced plans to build its
own high-technology Xanadu _ a $2.9 billion complex called Science
Hub, which will encompass two existing science parks and two
universities. The project, scheduled to take 15 years to complete,
will have 20,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberport is more modest. It is designed to accommodate 12,000
employees by 2003 and will not expand beyond its patch of land. But
Arena, who is directing the project for Li, said the more intimate
scale could work to its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's small, it's like a pocket,'' he said. ``If you fill it
up, you will immediately create demand, and you can build a second
one, a third one and a fourth one. You can actually make it hard to
get into.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arena argues that Hong Kong's future as a technology center
should follow a similar blueprint. Rather than vying for
large-scale factories, the city should focus on the software end of
the business: luring designers and multimedia experts, who want to
work in a cosmopolitan metropolis. New York City has adopted that
strategy in its multimedia neighborhood, Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Li's own venture. Pacific Century is working with Intel
to create an information service that would be transmitted by
satellite to cable operators throughout Asia. The cable systems
would then deliver the service over upgraded wires to subscribers,
whose homes would be outfitted with modems _ allowing them to
receive the service either over their television sets or personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is devising the technology that would enable Li to deliver
information at high speeds over this network of satellites and
cable. But Pacific Century is responsible for designing the
``content'' _ the information and entertainment that will flow
through the system.
</P>
<P>
   Li is drawing on his experience with Star TV, Asia's first
satellite-delivered cable television service, which he began in the
early 1990s; he sold a controlling stake to Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. for $525 million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He has also recruited roughly 60 software designers to create
and package news, information and entertainment. Right now, this
mostly Asian group works in Sunnyvale, Calif., a 15-minute drive
from Intel's Santa Clara headquarters. But Li intends to move them
back to Hong Kong _ where they will design services tailored for
markets like China, India and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Before Li can realize his vision of a Silicon Valley East,
however, he has to actually build Cyberport. This being
property-crazed Hong Kong, his project has provoked noisy protests
from other developers. They say the government _ by donating the
land rather than auctioning it _ has made a sweetheart deal with
the son of Hong Kong's most influential tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism seems to be getting to Li, who has spent much of
his precocious career trying to outrun the shadow of Li Ka-shing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the same amount of money, we could make more in pure
technology,'' he said bitterly. ``I thought this was for the good
of everybody _ for the government, for us, for the industry, and so
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In mercantile Hong Kong, it seems, high-technology dreams still
pale next to the stone-cold reality of a real estate deal. &QL;

NEW RULES MAY CHALLENGE INTERNET DOMAIN-NAME SPECULATORS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Kaplan is a stockbroker by day, managing money for wealthy
clients who gamble their fortunes in regulated markets. But his off
time is spent on a new and controversial investment game in which
he and two partners have wagered tens of thousands of dollars on
catchy words and names that they hope to resell as valuable
Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Though often labeled hijackers, pirates or extortionists,
``cybersquatters'' is the most common term for investors who
stockpile Internet addresses derived from popular words, titles or
celebrities' names.
</P>
<P>
   For an investment of just $70, they can secure two-year rights
to an address. In return, they can reap handsome rewards from
companies eager to protect products or trademarks. Sometimes the
buyer is an individual with a compelling interest in using a
specific word or name in a World Wide Web site's address.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan says he and his colleagues are simply creative investors,
speculators who stake perfectly legal claims in the
rough-and-tumble land rush in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But their investments may soon become a lot riskier. Faced with
mounting disputes about Internet addresses and complaints from
trademark holders, a U.N. agency is completing a proposal for
bringing order to the chaotic assignment of addresses in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or
WIPO, is drafting new rules for registering domain names, as
Internet addresses are known. It will submit its recommendations to
the nonprofit corporation established last year by the Commerce
Department to take over administration of the Internet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A top priority of that nonprofit, the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, is to introduce competition into the
business of registering top-level domains, which is now handled by
Network Solutions Inc. under an exclusive government contract.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, the interim chairwoman of the corporation, said
she expected her group would adopt rules on cybersquatting before
authorizing any new top-level domains, the categories of Internet
addresses denoted by suffixes like .com, .edu, and .net.
</P>
<P>
   Internet addresses can be valuable enough to attract speculators
because most choice names within existing top-level domains are
already claimed. But in trying to accommodate both special
interests and international trademark laws, the proposals raise as
many questions as they answer.
</P>
<P>
   And those who would tame the Internet are finding that for every
new winner, there is almost certainly a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vocal critics of the WIPO draft proposal has been
A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami and
a member of the agency's advisory board on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Froomkin says the consequences of the proposed rules could go
far beyond the intended crackdown on cybersquatters. Unless the
proposals are revised, he warns, the Internet will end up with a
legal system that could stifle free expression and enable
governments and corporate interests to intimidate individuals into
relinquishing addresses to which they have rightful claims.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, he says, enforcement would be a bureaucratic
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has proposed, for example, that when people register
names in any top-level domain, they must agree to a procedure
permitting anyone anywhere to challenge that registration at any
time. The disputes would be settled by arbitration, but the outcome
might depend on any number of international trademark laws. And
whoever loses could be liable for all legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Froomkin and others say that the plan would let companies engage
in reverse domain hijacking, claiming any address that contains or
suggests their names or trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a policy could, for instance, hurt people like Chris Van
Allen, a Pennsylvanian teen-ager whose father registered pokey.org,
an address that reflected Chris' nickname, Pokey, as a present for
his twelfth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Prema Toy Co., which holds the trademarks to the well-known
Gumby and Pokey bendable toys, last year tried to seize the domain
name, even though the boy had no content related to the toys on his
page. Prema eventually dropped its claim.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed U.N. rules also raise questions of free-speech
rights. Is it a violation of free-speech rights to prevent someone
from using the name of a politician, government official or
corporation in the address of a Web site that criticizes or
parodies its namesake? One trend among cybersquatters has been
securing addresses based on trademarks with the addition of the
word ``sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies often buy up such names to keep them out of the hands
of critics and disgruntled former employees.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Gurry, legal counsel for WIPO, said he intended to make
significant revisions to the draft proposal before its submission
later this month. He said he anticipated that the final proposal
would define squatters more narrowly and would not give a trademark
owner the right to make a claim just because a domain includes its
name or a variation of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot interest in differentiation of commercial and
noncommercial domains,'' Gurry said last month in Washington, where
the panel he heads was holding the last in a series of
international public hearings on the draft proposal. ``Another
evolution that we see is limiting the mandatory administrative
dispute resolutions procedure to cases of cybersquatting.''
</P>
<P>
   He defined cybersquatting as ``repeated cases of targeting in
bad faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Other claims, like standard trademark disputes or cases
involving different companies with the same names, would still be
resolved in traditional courts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also require prepayment of domain
registration fees, to deter squatters who register names and then
try to resell them before the bills come due.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even modified rules could leave speculators like Kaplan
operating in a gray area. He and his partners, Eric Stuerken and
Richard Presig, have pooled some $40,000 and paid for all their
domain names. He also said that some names they registered are no
more than catchy words that people starting new businesses might
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure arbitrage,'' Kaplan said. ``It's a free market
that they put out there.'' Still, he admits, he and his partners
seek unclaimed names of celebrities or groups.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he saw Glenn Rifkin, the co-author of a book
called ``Radical Marketing,'' promote it on CNBC in January. Rifkin
had already applied for the name radicalmarketing.com, but did so
through an Internet service provider, rather than applying directly
to the central registry.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan made his application directly and got the name. When
Rifkin discovered that the address was taken, he tracked Kaplan to
a Long Island brokerage firm, HD Brous &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan insists that he and his partners have not _ at least yet
_ tried to track down potential buyers of the names they have
purchased, like barrydiller.com.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean they are not for sale. Rifkin says Kaplan
and his partners offered to sell him the name for ``five figures''
after he tracked them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They quite aggressively tried to sell me the name, having
three different people phone me,'' Rifkin said, ``one in particular
saying outright that I'd be surprised at how much information they
knew about me, including the fact that I had access to the kind of
cash I'd need to buy the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Furious, but left with few options, Rifkin instead registered
the domain name radmarketing.com.

IN `MATRIX,' THE WACHOWSKI BROTHERS UNLEASH A COMIC BOOK OF IDEAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The Wachowski brothers were seated at a restaurant
table in a Sunset Strip hotel the other morning, drinking cup after
cup of coffee and claiming, with some nervousness, that their new
high-tech, big-budget film, ``The Matrix,'' could ignite or doom
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just really want to see how the idea of an intellectual
action movie is received by the world,'' said Larry Wachowski, 33,
the older half of the team of writer-directors. ``Because if
audiences are sort of interested in movies that are made like
McDonald's hamburgers, which do have a value in the world, then we
have to re-evaluate our entire career.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   By this morning Larry and his younger brother, Andy, 31, hardly
were seeking new careers. Their film, which was almost as risky for
its studio, Warner Brothers, as it was for the friendly and low-key
Wachowski brothers, was No. 1 around the nation. The film, which
opened last Wednesday, took in $37.2 million at the box office in
its first five days, according to Warner Brothers. ``It's the
largest Easter weekend opening in motion-picture history,'' said
Dan Fellman, the studio's president for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the movie so successful?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cutting-edge film,'' Fellman said. ``No one has seen
anything quite like it. It just rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the old-style Warner Brothers action genre fare,
``The Matrix,'' which stars Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, is
a compelling but not altogether coherent blend of mythology,
religious mysticism, martial arts, virtual reality and time travel.
In part the story deals with the aftermath of a war between humans
and superintelligent humanoid computers that want to rule the
world. Reeves plays a computer hacker, and Fishburne is the leader
of rebel fighters battling those evil computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Matrix,'' cost nearly $70 million, the movie,
with its special effects, is not considered as lavishly expensive
as similar films. Warner Brothers executives said it would have
cost close to $95 million if it had been made in the United States
instead of in Australia, where film production is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Matrix'' the Wachowski brothers studied the work of
directors as varied as John Woo and other Hong Kong filmmakers,
Stanley Kubrick, John Huston, Billy Wilder, Ridley Scott, George
Lucas and Fritz Lang. They also read and reread their favorite
book, ``The Odyssey.'' Larry said: ``I read it all the time. I
always get something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film grew out of the brothers' longtime fascination (since
they were teen-agers) with ideas that challenge current perceptions
of reality. They said they were also intrigued by the way mythology
and the Internet informed culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script was a synthesis of ideas that sort of came together
at a moment when we were interested in a lot of things: making
mythology relevant in a modern context, relating quantum physics to
Zen Buddhism, investigating your own life,'' said Andy, the bigger
and quieter half of the Wachowski team. ``We started out thinking
of this as a comic book. We filled notebook after notebook with
ideas. Essentially that's where the script came from.''
</P>
<P>
   All this highbrow and even esoteric exploration seems improbable
at a large Hollywood studio, especially Warner Brothers, which
traditionally churns out meat-and-potatoes action films like the
``Lethal Weapon'' series or romances like ``Message in a Bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the studio's 42-year-old president
for worldwide production, tracked the script for four years and
pushed it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you read the script, you knew it was a new and different
kind of movie,'' di Bonaventura said. ``It had great action and
great characters, and you got a sense of how important these
filmmakers would become.'' He added, ``A few of us didn't find it
incomprehensible and felt the brothers would be able to execute
visually what some people had a hard time understanding when they
read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the studio agreed to make the movie, the brothers
hired two cartoonist friends _ Geof Darrow, who created the
well-known comic book ``Hard Boiled,'' and Steve Skrose, who once
drew Spider-Man comic books _ and made a 600-page, scene-by-scene
comic book, based on the script. What Larry Wachowski called ``this
gigantic comic book'' was shown to the studio, which then approved
the film. ``It was virtually identical to the movie,'' said Joel
Silver, producer of ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers are hardly the kind of superconfident, supersmug
action-film directors who are commonplace now in Hollywood. Modest
in manner, the brothers frequently defer to each other, although
Larry, the older one, seems more talkative. Each of the brothers is
married, and they live near each other on the North Side of
Chicago. They write their scripts on large yellow pads and work at
each other's homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Wachowskis are college dropouts. Larry attended Bard for two
years, and Andy went to Emerson College. Afterward, they worked as
house painters and carpenters, working all the time creating comic
books. Their father, Ron, a businessman, and mother, Lynne, a nurse
and painter, encouraged them.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s Larry read a book about Roger Corman, the
master of B movies, and excitedly told his brother to read it. The
Wachowskis quickly wrote a Corman-style, low-budget horror movie
that dealt with cannibalism or, more specifically, rich people
being eaten by cannibals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script was too disturbing,'' Andy said. ``We showed it to
some people in Hollywood who said: `This is a bad idea. I can't
make this. I'm rich.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cleverness of the writing stirred interest among studio
executives, however, and led the Wachowskis to write ``Assassins''
(1995), a Sylvester Stallone action film about a hit man dogged by
a rival. The film was a dud, and the brothers loathed it. Their
careers rebounded in 1996 when they wrote and made their
directorial debut with ``Bound,'' a stylish and violent action
drama with a lesbian twist: two women conspire to run off with a
suitcase containing millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Bound' we were offered a lot of lesbian thrillers,''
Andy Wachowski said.
</P>
<P>
   With the success of ``Bound,'' the Wachowskis returned to ``The
Matrix,'' the script they had been working on for years. They
credited di Bonaventura, the Warner Brothers executive who lobbied
on behalf of the script, as well as Silver, the producer, for
getting the movie off the ground. Although Silver also produced
``Assassins,'' Larry Wachowski said, ``We forgave him.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers said that, for the moment, they had no idea what to
do next. ``Maybe we'll just retire with a two-film retrospective,''
Larry said. ``We're just so tired at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The two seem to get along well, and said they rarely argued
during the writing and directing process, or engaged in the kinds
of fistfights that took place while they were growing up in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when creative arguments occur now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' Larry said dryly. ``We show the work to Mom.''

 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's public radio stations, already forced to become
more business minded as government subsidies shrink, are coming
under new pressure to behave more like commercial stations.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure comes from National Public Radio, the network
programmer on which many of the 700 public stations rely for a
significant portion of their daily broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago NPR, which itself relies on its member stations to
finance its operations, struck an Internet deal with its largest
affiliate, Minnesota Public Radio. The two organizations, which
already operate individual Web sites (www.npr.org and www.mpr.org),
intend to develop a collaborative online network that would open
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is meant to strengthen local stations' own Web sites,
many of which now offer little more than a weekly programming
chart. The planners say they will not compete with local stations
by creating a public radio supersite or by transmitting Webcasts of
radio programs (although local stations would have the option of
Webcasting NPR programs from their own sites). Instead, the Web
service would help stations around the country supplement
over-the-air fare by offering online chats with program hosts,
selling merchandise electronically and providing access to online
audio archives.
</P>
<P>
   The stated strategy is to convert online visitors into local
listeners. Currently, half the visits to NPR's site are by
individuals who are seeking information and are not yet regular
listeners, according to NPR.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the nation's public stations, which together are
heard by some 28 million listeners weekly, see the NPR-Minnesota
pact as a potential revenue-sapping threat that could siphon
listeners from their broadcasts. Stations are increasingly reliant
on listeners, who support public stations by paying to become
members and are the basis of ratings to attract corporate
underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really concerned about what happens to our members when
they disappear into a national site,'' Marita Rivero, general
manager of WGBH-FM in Boston, said during a recent telephone
conference call in which managers of public stations discussed the
planned venture.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to reassure skeptics, Kevin Klose, NPR's
president, said later in an interview, ``Nothing we do will do
anything but strengthen that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the stations' worries is an impending Oct. 1
deadline. That is when NPR, which dominates public radio's morning
and evening drive-time with its news shows ``Morning Edition'' and
``All Things Considered,'' will begin charging stations for its
programming based on a station's audience size _ ending the
network's time-honored, not-for-profit practice of assessing fees
based on a station's operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences will be felt in both small and large cities.
For example, WNYC-FM in New York is the nation's largest public
station, listened to by one million people each week. Though it
ranks but No. 22 in the market, with only a 2.8 percent share in
February, the station is able to attract corporate underwriters
interested in appealing to a well-educated audience. In populous
New York, even a No. 22 ranking means a million listeners a week;
on that basis, come October, the station's NPR fees, now $1.6
million a year, are certain to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't assume this kind of burden at this time,'' said Laura
R. Walker, president and chief executive of the station, which is
still struggling to pay off the license it bought for $20 million
in 1997 from New York City. Ms. Walker also said the ratings-based
fee model ``doesn't recognize the value of the audience we bring to
NPR, which they sell to their own underwriters.''
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiaries of the new programming payment system will
probably be stations in rural areas, whose smaller audiences should
mean that their payments to NPR will decline.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is coming in a fiscal year in which the industry is
forecasting that for the first time in public radio's three-decade
history, at least half the $500 million annual cost of operating
the nation's noncommercial stations will come from listener
donations and corporate sponsors, instead of from public subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning the old egalitarian, pay-what-you-can system for a
more market-driven fee structure is intended to create more
accountability. And it should also mean that stations should be
able to keep more of the proceeds when they create successful
home-grown programming, rather than having to pay more to NPR
simply because they have more money.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Seymour, general manager of KCRW-FM in Santa Monica,
Calif., which has its own popular daily new music showcase,
``Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' each day after NPR's ``Morning
Edition,'' said the incentives of the new network fee structure
would probably cut both ways. Under the old payment system, she
said, ``NPR was being insulated from the success or failure of
their product.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, the changing economics of public radio are
likely to speed up the industry's consolidation. Weak
college-licensed stations, which are losing academic subsidies and
in many cases are unable to build their audiences, are ceding
independence and teaming up _ just as many commercial stations did
when federal station-ownership limits were lifted several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At Pasadena City College in California, for example, trustees
are considering such a partnership for station KPCC, which lost
money last year and is facing a 59 percent increase, to $236,000,
for NPR news fees. A decision is possible as early as this month.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Public Radio is bidding for management and licensing
control of the Pasadena station. The Minnesota organization, which
is public radio's largest member, is best known for producing
Garrison Keillor's ``Prairie Home Companion.''
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1966 by William H. Kling at a small, troubled college
station, the St. Paul-based organization is now a $32 million,
six-state media empire of 30 stations with a $110 million
endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we can copy that success in L.A.,'' Will Haddeland, a
Minnesota Public Radio spokesman said, referring to the Pasadena
station. The plan would be to remake KPCC into a news-talk station
with a local news-gathering staff. In addition, MPR would help
underwrite the establishment of a digital broadcast academy at the
two-year college, with KPCC at its center.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesotans also see KPCC as a tap into a highly skilled
Southern California broadcasting talent pool. ``We have a difficult
time recruiting qualified people to downtown St. Paul,'' Haddeland
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new pragmatism also explains the NPR-Minnesota Public Radio
online alliance. The mouse-wielding multitudes from hundreds of
public radio sites could be an alluring audience for online
corporate underwriters.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, some NPR member stations fear the power of Minnesota
Public Radio and its founder, Kling, who also runs a for-profit
company, Greenspring. One of Greenspring's ventures was a catalog,
which sells public radio tie-in products and is distributed to
listeners around the nation _ a business the company sold last year
to the Dayton-Hudson Corp. for an estimated $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Public radio stations, which reaped no financial benefit from
the deal, are worried that Kling may replicate that experience on
line, said one station manager, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Kling, who also took part in the recent conference call, was
asked how electronic-commerce revenue would be apportioned among
stations. ``It's not how we divide it up,'' he responded, ``but
build it up.'' More details about the plan are to be outlined in
May at a public radio conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, airwave rivalries are likely to carry over to the
virtual world of the Web. One of NPR's prime programming
challengers is Minneapolis-based Public Radio International, which
distributes the daily business show ``Marketplace'' and a weekly
narrative by Ira Glass, ``This American Life,'' to many of the same
stations that carry NPR programs.
</P>
<P>
   Public Radio International does not yet have a Web presence. But
it is developing online tools to allow searches of its own
programming archives and also to let affiliate stations create
indexed listings of their own self-produced programs. Public Radio
International's partner in this effort is New Market Network, the
Boston-based creator of for-profit, online sites for the producers
of four public radio shows, including PRI's ``Savvy Traveler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stations can take as much or as little as they want,'' Salyer
said. ``Our goal is to provide the richest array of choices to the
listening community.'' &QL;

PATENTS: PROGRAM FOR INDEPENDENT INVENTORS; BANDAGE WITH
MICROCONTROLLER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Patent and Trademark Office is in transition, after the
resignation late last year of its commissioner, Bruce Lehman.
Lehman led the office from 1993 until late 1998 _ years that saw
intellectual property transformed from a sleepy area of law and
business to one of the driving engines of a high-technology
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman oversaw several critical and hotly disputed changes in
patent law, including the rules determining the life span of a
patent, and set U.S. policy in important international
intellectual-property treaties.
</P>
<P>
   His overriding goal was to bring U.S. intellectual-property law
into ``harmony'' with laws in Europe and Japan, and he advocated
creating an agency and laws designed to serve a global economy. For
the most part, that also meant serving institutional inventors and
corporate patent holders.
</P>
<P>
   As he guided his agency through inevitable growing pains in the
1990s, he alienated the small segment of his customers known as
independent inventors, a group he once called weekend hobbyists.
The Patent and Trademark Office says that independent inventors
filed 15 percent of the 250,000 patent applications it received in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has moved on, and the agency's acting commissioner, Todd
Dickinson, seems eager to smooth over relations with the often
vocal independent-inventor groups. Dickinson has announced a new
program to embrace independent inventors, acknowledge their
concerns and bring them into the agency's decision making. A new
department, the Office of Independent Inventor Programs, will be
run by the agency's Technology Group.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement last week said the office's intention was to
``foster regular communication between the PTO and independent
inventors,'' something the so-called hobbyists had bitterly
complained was absent under Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   The new office will hold round-table discussions, create
advisory committees and offer outreach programs for independent
inventors. As part of its new attitude, the agency is even devoting
a section of its Web site (www.uspto.gov) to independent inventors,
complete, it says, with links to ``other Web sites relevant to this
group.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bandage With a Microcontroller
</P>
<P>
   There are smart cards, smart phones and even smart bombs. Now
add smart bandages.
</P>
<P>
   Patients recovering from a wound or from surgery, or receiving
treatment for a disease or other health problems may soon wear
bandages that can detect the status of their injury or incision,
store the data and transmit it to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional bandages, this one is made of an absorbent pad
with an adhesive strip. But the pad contains a microcontroller and
battery. The microcontroller has a contact-sensitive sensor and a
timer. The pad also has a data port, so that an external link can
be made between the microcontroller and a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Sternberg, a molecular biologist and biochemist, and
his co-inventor, Jan-Tjeerd de Faber, an ophthalmologist, designed
the bandage initially as an eye patch for children suffering from
amblyopia, or ``lazy eye,'' one of the most common childhood eye
defects.
</P>
<P>
   Children with this condition must be compelled to use the weak
eye, so a patch is placed over the stronger eye for several hours
each day. But because many patients are under the age of 5, it is
often difficult for doctors to get them to follow instructions and
stick to an eye-patch schedule. So, Sternberg and de Faber came up
with the idea of a patch that monitors itself and records the
amount of time it is worn.
</P>
<P>
   The microcontroller and timer in the eye patch record a signal
when the patch is in contact with the patient, and a second signal
when that contact is broken. The time of each signal is then stored
in the chip's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the data can be downloaded to a computer via the external
data port on the bandage and analyzed by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg is president of a Milwaukee biomedical engineering
company called Biokey. He envisions bandages with different sensors
to detect the status of infection, healing, effectiveness of
antibiotics and other conditions. One bandage might have a pH
sensor to determine oxygen levels in an open wound or incision.
That would tell doctors whether the wound was healing or becoming
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Too much oxygen is toxic, but too little can hinder tissue
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to limit the sensor to anything as simple as
a pH sensor,'' Sternberg said. ``One could have far more
sophisticated sensors. There's a strong advantage to having the
sensors tailored to the individual bandage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're designing a bandage to be used by soldiers in the
field who may not have easy access to medical care, you want as
sophisticated a device as you can get. If you're designing
something for use in an intensive-care unit with doctors and nurses
there 24 hours a day, you may not want the same level of
sophistication and cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg and de Faber won patent 5,879,292.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

   TIRANA, Albania _ From a distance, the truth in Kosovo is
simple. Serbs, emboldened or maddened by NATO bombings, are on a
rampage that has caused nearly a quarter of the ethnic Albanian
population to flee.
</P>
<P>
   But close up, real life is rarely that simple. The story of Suva
Reka, just one small town amid hundreds caught up in the chaos and
horror of Kosovo, is more layered. It is a place where neighbors
say the richest man in town, who had rented his houses to
international monitors of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, was slain by Serbian police at his front
door along with most of his family, four days after the foreigners
were evacuated to safety.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a place where a Serbian car-parts salesman was
murdered two days before the bombing began, a murder that may have
helped ignite Suva Reka's explosion of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Zenel and Florije Bytyci, two teachers who are
married and have three children, is in its own way emblematic. A
demure teen-age daughter who became a vegetarian the day she began
working underground in a Kosovo Liberation Army field hospital, and
saw her first flesh wounds. A father who donned women's clothing to
escape Serbian detection as he fled. A mother who heard the
explosion of the mosque and was convinced the world was coming to
an end. A son whose first thought, as the tractor they were packed
into by the dozens rumbled down the road for their extraordinary
escape, was of his schoolwork. As the tractor pulled away from
burning houses, Azdren Bytyci, 16, turned to his mother and
exclaimed in genuine panic, ``Mama, I forgot my classroom notes and
all my diplomas.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Florije Bytyci, 38, a school librarian, was in the
dark, crowded corner of a refugee center in Tirana, describing how
she and her family and their closest neighbors arrived at the
Albanian border on Monday, walking six miles after the tractor
broke down. They had spent seven days in their neighbor's apartment
in the center of town, 13 people crammed in three rooms, afraid to
go out, spending the long hours waiting, making and receiving phone
calls, trying to find out what was happening. Florije, who unlike
her husband, Zenel, 45, is a native of Suva Reka, a town of 60,000,
knows everybody. She made and took the calls. ``We women did the
phone talking,'' she said. ``We were afraid the police listened in
on the conversations of the men.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Florije who got what she believed was the last phone call
of Sedat Berisha, the wealthy landlord. On Friday, two days after
the first NATO bombs fell, he called around noon, his voice
shaking, asking whether there were a lot of police in the center,
whether it would be safe to try to flee that way. She replied that
the whole areas was crawling with soldiers, paramilitary patrols
and police. He hung up.
</P>
<P>
   She said she heard from a family friend late the next day that
that Sedat Berisha, his three brothers, and most of their families
had been killed a few yards from their house.
</P>
<P>
   A Berisha cousin, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
watched Serbian police shoot Sedat, his three brothers and two
other cousins from his window, a few feet from the house of Sedat
Berisha, sometime between noon and 1 p.m. He believes the others,
women and men and children, were taken around the back and shot,
but said he couldn't see what happened to them from his window.
</P>
<P>
   What he did see, he described slowly and methodically, drawing a
map of the building complex where it took place. ``They fired at
them, just like that, with automatic weapons. Then they set fire to
the houses, it was over in 15 minutes.'' He said that after they
left, burning wood fell on the bodies on the ground, setting some
bodies on fire. ``After they left, I wanted to go out and drag the
bodies into the house so the dogs couldn't get at them,'' he said.
``But I was too afraid. We thought there could be snipers.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next two days hiding in the house with 10 other
family members. The police came to his door on Saturday, grabbed
his brother, made him kneel, while the rest of the family begged
for his life. The cousin said he recognized one of Serbian
officers, an old acquaintance, and said he believed that was why
the officer took 1,000 marks from him, and told him to get in his
car and go.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Bogdan Lazic, a remote acquaintance, in some ways
came even closer into the home of the Bytycis. He was killed on
Monday, March 22, at his shop. Quietly, quickly, the streets and
cafes nearby emptied before the police arrived. But the Bytycis'
close friend, whose apartment they shared, Sedat Haxha, didn't
disappear quickly enough. He was arrested with a few others as
suspects and sent to a Serbian police station in Prizren for
interrogation. Haxha, a physical education instructor, was released
the same night and made it home safely. Haxha suggested that the
obvious suspects _ ethnic Albanians _ should be ruled out. ``The
Serbs killed him themselves, as a provocation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of Kosovo is not just the human suffering, so
obvious in the faces of hundreds of thousands of people at the
border. There is also the void and confusion over what really is
happening amid the pain and panic of burning houses and the sound
of machine gun fire. There are many, many accounts of atrocities
that cannot be checked and may never be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Suva Reka, spread out in camps throughout Tirana,
recount at least three different massacres that took place in the
days after the NATO bombing began. Some refugees say they were told
of bodies burning in a schoolyard; others say they know for a fact
that police dumped dozens of bodies in black garbage bags in front
of a downtown supermarket. Others talk about seven people killed
downtown a few hours after Lazic was killed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is the deaths of the Berisha family and Lazic that seem
to have the most resonance. Perhaps because they follow a long
cycle of similar killings and vicious counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have happened,'' Rufus Dawkins, an OSCE observer who
rented the Berisha house last fall, said of the slaying of the
Berisha family. He had only heard, third-hand, that the buildings
had been looted, then burned. He had had to leave computers and
other equipment behind when he evacuated on March 21. Dawkins, from
Texas, was gone when the Berishas were allegedly killed, and had
only heard, third-hand, that the OSCE houses and offices had been
burned. But in year of mediating between Serb forces and Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas, he investigated brutal killings by
Serbs and the KLA. ``It was on both sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that the most immediate motive for the
killing of Berisha and his family was their connection with the
OSCE. Refugees from all over Kosovo have reported that landlords
and others associated with the 1,400 monitors have been beaten,
robbed and even killed, in addition to having their homes burned.
There is also little doubt that the NAT0 airstrikes led to the
frenzy of brutality that has driven hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians to flee.
</P>
<P>
   But in Suva Reka and its surrounding villages, where fighting
and also killings of civilians have been intense for the past two
years, people who have worked there as mediators, also detect a
pattern that seems to have escalated beyond all reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we kept seeing was a breakdown in what was already poor
discipline,'' said Henry Bolt, an OSCE monitor in the human rights
division who worked the Suva Reka region until his evacuation. He
was referring to the Serbian forces' tendency to ``overreact'' and
avenge a KLA killing of a Serb by slaughtering ethnic Albanians.
Refugees these days describe the Serb military as an all-powerful
killing machine, but Bolt, a British policeman, described them
instead as scared and undisciplined, patrolling KLA infiltrated
areas around Suva Reka like ``cornered rats.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``What is being carried out in Kosovo today is
Belgrade's policy, but the policy works because the police feel the
way they do.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Vladimir, like an unknown number of other
young Serbs, is on the run.
</P>
<P>
   A 29-year-old computer whiz, he received a mobilization order
last Friday to report to the Yugoslav army. Instead, he has left
home, spending nights in different apartments and wrestling with an
excruciating choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest dilemma I have,'' he said Sunday in a
quiet conversation in Belgrade's city center. ``On the one hand, I
think I should defend my country, which is being attacked; on the
other, I'm frightened that I will die for this regime.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not proud of himself, he said. Nor is he making himself
available to the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always tell them I was away in the country for the
weekend,'' he said, kicking at a pebble with extraordinary
viciousness. ``I really don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A 33-year-old artist has sent his family abroad. ``It's too late
for me,'' he said, noting that under Yugoslavia's state of war, all
men between the ages of 18 and 60 are forbidden to travel outside
the country. They cannot be granted exit visas, receive new
passports or renew their old ones.
</P>
<P>
   A friend said that Zarko, a 30-year-old lawyer, had received a
mobilization notice. When asked directly by a foreigner, Zarko
denied that, but he has left his own apartment for the house of his
wife's uncle. ``I'm doing everything I can not to go into the
army,'' he said at one of Belgrade's many cafes. ``Everyone is
trying not to fight. No one I know wants to die for Slobodan
Milosevic,'' the Yugoslav president, ``or for this wretched
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   No general mobilization has been declared; reserve units are
being called up as specialties are required. Men who served in
radio and communications units, for instance, are being ordered to
report for duty, some Yugoslavs say. Wartime military courts have
been established to court-martial those who do not report to their
units immediately. Prison terms for draft-dodging can range from
one to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Official Yugoslav state television has shown glowing reports of
young men responding to mobilization or draft orders, and it is
likely that a large majority does so.
</P>
<P>
   In general, patriotism is high in what appear to be the early
days of a long struggle of stamina and nerve with NATO, and there
is a lot of outrage over the extension of NATO's bombing this
weekend to downtown Belgrade and at least ostensibly civilian
targets like bridges, power plants and factories.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, for example, near the American and French Cultural
Centers trashed last week by angry Serbs, passersby kneeled at an
immense strip of unrolled canvas, perhaps a yard wide and 100 yards
long. Every few yards on this central pedestrian shopping street,
there was a pot of white paint and a brush, and many people stopped
to daub patriotic and anti-NATO slogans on the canvas, a haunting
and apparently appealing form of participatory art.
</P>
<P>
   The artist on the run from the army, who asked to be called
Samuel for the purposes of this story, is meanwhile more concerned
about exchanging information with some 20 friends about safe
houses. Each of those 20 people is in contact with another 20
friends, he said.
</P>
<P>
   These people move around from place to place, he said, mostly in
Belgrade, because ``it's the only terrain they know, and it's
always best to hide in a big city.''
</P>
<P>
   With Belgrade's population estimated now at some 2 million
people, swollen by Serb refugees from the earlier wars in Croatia
and Bosnia, there are many people not registered, as they should be
by law, with the police. Similarly, there are a number of
apartments that are either empty or still registered to distant
relatives or family members who are dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid to go to small villages outside of Belgrade,
even where they have vacation houses or apartments,'' Samuel said.
``There is small-town patriotism and small-town curiosity, and it
is easier to be caught.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But all these choices are difficult, Samuel said. He described
two friends with dual Yugoslav-French citizenship, who are dodging
mobilization and yet refusing to leave the country, even with their
French passports.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, he said, after ``a long, drunken and stoned
conversation,'' he sent them to an empty apartment in Zemun, a
small municipality of greater Belgrade along the Danube that was
the last outpost of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment is new and unregistered. ``It doesn't exist in
official papers,'' he said. On the other hand, it is uncomfortably
close to an important Air Force building. ``So either they can be a
target of the military police or of the Tomahawks,'' he said,
referring to the American cruise missile. ``You have to balance one
target against another.''
</P>
<P>
   And why don't they go to France? He laughed. ``It might strike
you as strange,'' he said. ``But they're very patriotic. They don't
want to leave their friends and their country now, while it is
under attack. That would be a betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of himself, he said. His wife pushed him to
leave with her, but he refused. ``I don't want to abandon my
friends or this city, which I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel had done his 15-month army service in the 1980s, before
Milosevic began ``the wars of secession'' that have engulfed the
former Yugoslavia in blood and flame. ``I did it and I hated it,''
he said. ``I hated the look of the uniform, and I hated the feel of
the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   He never reported his address to the local defense office, as
Yugoslav males are obligated to do, and believes _ since he once
lived abroad _ that the bureaucrats will think he's still there.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, he had returned to Belgrade to take part in
the massive pro-democracy demonstrations of 1996 and 1997. ``I came
home to watch Milosevic fall,'' he said astringently.
``Unfortunately, I'm still waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the people he knows, he said, ``we'd like to see
him hanging.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``if the guys from NATO come here we will
shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all raised on this paradigm of resisting external
aggression, whether it came from the United States or Russia,'' he
said, referring to Tito's doctrine of Yugoslav self-sufficiency and
nonalignment with either East or West. ``And now this is the
paradigm we prepared for.''
</P>
<P>
   The generation of young men 28 and under have a different
experience. In general, they had to fight in Milosevic's wars in
Croatia and Bosnia and many of them hated the fratricidal horrors
of the experience. Given the international sanctions on Yugoslavia
and the country's constant state of crisis, they have also been
unable to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The war against NATO is crazy, said one draft-dodger, a medical
student named Dejan who had served in Bosnia. ``They sent me an
invitation to join the army reserve, but I'm not at home and my
parents are not there, either.'' Instead, he said, ``I live like a
refugee, changing places every other night.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing of Belgrade has given him a new place to go, he
said. ``Now I spend nights in different shelters,'' he said. ``Who
can challenge me for being in a shelter?''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The official Yugoslav media said Sunday
that at least four civilians had been killed and 17 wounded in
strikes all over Serbia, as NATO widened its attacks on
Yugoslavia's civilian as well as military infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens of Belgrade interviewed Sunday expressed new
concern about how long the bombing would last, how many civilian
targets NATO would hit and how the war will end. Such concerns were
more widespread among older people who remember World War II. One
of them, a skittish retiree of 68 named Bojan, returning from
church with a sprig of willow on the Orthodox Palm Sunday, asked
that his surname not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more fear today, that NATO will hit anywhere,'' he
said. He also suggested that his friends ``are more afraid to talk
about politics and to make political jokes on the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, central Belgrade filled again Sunday afternoon
with thousands of people attending the daily anti-NATO rock concert
and wearing the target symbol that has swept the city.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there was no official word about military or civilian
casualties in Kosovo, where NATO is attempting to stop Serb forces
from destroying the Kosovo Liberation Army and forcing more ethnic
Albanian citizens to flee.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no official response to charges made Sunday by
the NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, that television footage of a
meeting said to have taken place last Thursday in Belgrade between
President Slobodan Milosevic and pacifist ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova had been faked from footage taken two years ago.
Shea said that Rugova remains under house arrest in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Given that there was no sound track for the footage, there were
immediate doubts about what Rugova had said, and even whether the
meeting had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry officials, asked on Friday whether there was
any doubt that the two men had met, scoffed at the idea, but a
request to interview Rugova went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an official government statement referred to the
meeting, saying that ``after the Milosevic-Rugova meeting, there is
a strengthening conviction of the people of Kosovo that this crisis
can be solved through political means.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, NATO planes struck bridges, fuel depots, a
heating plant, an oil refinery and an Interior Ministry academy in
Belgrade, which was said to be used for the instruction of
high-ranking intelligence officials. A military hospital near the
academy suffered broken windows but apparently there were no
further casualties among the patients.
</P>
<P>
   NATO missiles also smashed the Pancevo oil refinery, some 10
miles northeast of Belgrade, killing two refinery workers and
injuring another four, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
Another three people were reported to be injured when a fuel depot
near the town of Kraljevo, 75 miles south of Belgrade, was also
hit.
</P>
<P>
   A 73-year-old woman was killed and seven people were injured in
another NATO attack _ the third so far _ on the Sloboda factory in
the industrial town of Cacak, 50 miles south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, reporters were escorted by the army to Cacak, where
officials and factory employees said that only domestic appliances
were produced there. NATO officials, however, said that the factory
also produces ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, NATO also destroyed a thermal heating plant in the
New Belgrade district, across the Sava River from the old city
center, filling the sky with flame from a burning fuel storage
depot.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were injured at the plant, according to official
media, and supplies of hot water were cut to thousands of people.
The police academy in the nearby Banjica suburb was also destroyed,
but there were no reported casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening at about 8 p.m., NATO destroyed a second bridge
over the Danube River at Novi Sad, leaving only one railway bridge.
The Beta news agency said that cars were using the bridge when a
central span was destroyed, and that seven people on the bridge at
the time were badly injured. Sunday, boats ferried people across
the river.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also damaged another Danube River bridge at Backa Palanka,
near the Croatian border.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav media also sharply criticized NATO-led forces in
Bosnia for destroying a railroad link between Serbia and her sister
republic, Montenegro, near Strpci. An elderly railroad guard was
reported to have been killed in the action.

 &HT;    EYEWITNESSES AND AERIAL SPY CAMERAS BUILD EVIDENCE OF SERB
ATROCITIES
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 1,200.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROZAJE, Montenegro, Yugoslavia Tanks rumbled through the ancient
city of Pec, just over the border in western Kosovo, shelling
buildings to rubble at will. Gunfire crackled down the narrow
streets and black smoke billowed across the tiled cupolas and
towering spires of mosques and churches several centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   For Ibrahim Peregjegaj, though, the real terror came with a
knock on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Armed men in uniforms, Serb police or soldiers _ he's still not
sure which _ demanded to see his 19-year-old son, Beqir, who they
hauled off along with three of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   The boys could be terrorists, Peregjegaj was told, as he bade
his son a panicked goodbye. Just one more thing, the men added: Get
out of your home.
</P>
<P>
   And so, beneath grey skies on March 28, leaving behind him a
city in flames, Peregjegaj joined a ragtag convoy of hundreds of
other ethnic Albanians expelled from Pec in western Kosovo to this
grimy border town an hour's drive away.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week later Peregjegaj, 69, is a refugee standing
outside in the rain, asking a stranger to help him find his lost
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot bear to tell him,'' a fellow Kosovar whispers into
the stranger's ear. ``But I am sure they are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   By itself, Peregjegaj's tale is simply one more troubling but
unverifiable horror story from inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Placed alongside the strikingly similar accounts being told by
many of the 360,000 other refugees pouring out of the province,
however, Peregjegaj's story becomes something more a vivid
brushstroke in an emerging portrait of the rape of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Examined and cross-checked through extensive interviews by human
rights experts, the stories speak to the evil unleashed upon a
province ravaged by marauding bands of troops, police and
paramilitary thugs.
</P>
<P>
   The harrowing catalogue of first-person accounts, moreover, has
been largely corroborated by hard military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Using contacts inside Serbia as well as imagery from spy planes,
satellites and unmanned drones equipped with high altitude cameras,
infrared sensors and battlefield-monitoring radar, NATO has mapped
out the locales and proportions of a bloodcurdling campaign of
destruction and terror.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, officials say, the grim oral histories and the
high-tech eyes in the sky have documented the ruthless and
systematic campaign that heavily armed Serb forces backed with
tanks, artillery and, in some cases, combat helicopters have used
to drive perhaps one third of all the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week alone, U.S. and British military officials have
described:
</P>
<P>
   _ A coordinated artillery attack, involving at least three
different battle groups, on thousands of refugees pinned down in
the Pagarusa Valley near the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shelling in dozens of other places, including Pec, in
northeastern Kosovo, and nearby Srbrica.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction of a human rights lawyer in Pristina, who was
beaten in front of his family, then hauled off and shot, along with
his son. Their bodies were left near a gas station outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   _ The torching of scores of communities that have first been
purged of ethnic Albanians in the same manner described by
Peregjegaj and others like him.
</P>
<P>
   To that record, journalists and human rights experts have been
told of other incidents:
</P>
<P>
   In a village outside Rajovac, Serb police backed with tanks
lined up some 70 men along a river bank and executed them with
automatic rifles on March 25, eyewitnesses told the Los Angeles
Times. ``Five of my sons have been killed,'' Salim Popaj, 68, told
a Times reporter as he reached the border town of Kukes, Albania.
``I have seen it with my own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Velika Krusa, near Kosovo's southern border with
Albania, about 40 men were gunned down in a mass execution on March
26, according to a farmer from the village. He hid for days from
the Serbs before making his way out of Kosovo with a videotape
showing bodies strewn about the village. The tape, aired Saturday
by some Western television networks, appears to corroborate
interviews with six other refugees who recounted the same massacre
to investigators with the New York advocacy group, Human Rights
Watch.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Goden, also along Kosovo's border with
Albania, Serbs lined up about 20 men, many of them school teachers,
and forced them to kneel alongside a burning building on March 25,
according to refugee reports reaching the Washington Post at the
Albanian border town of Kruma. ``We don't know if they are alive or
dead or massacred,'' Rokmane Feraj, 33, told the Post. ``My husband
was so scared. He was so pale,'' she said, recalling the last time
she saw him, kneeling before a gang of armed Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling testimony is in the form of the
daily waves of refugees pouring over Kosovo's borders in the most
rapid exodus in Europe since World War II. In addition to those who
have fled the province, an estimated 300,000 were displaced inside
Kosovo and, as of Sunday, were still trying to make their way to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see families with very little luggage, ladies in slippers,
children with no shoes or socks,'' evidence of panicked departures,
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Serb repression has been so chilling that NATO
estimated over the weekend that Kosovo, a province roughly the size
of Connecticut, might be emptied of its entire Albanian community
90 percent of its population of 2.2 million in as few as ten more
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who've grown up in liberal democracies have a hard
time truly appreciating what's happening right now in Kosovo,''
said NATO commander Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a grim combination of terror and ethnic cleansing on a
vast scale. It's being perpetrated largely against defenseless
civilians by the last vestige of a hard-core communist dictatorship
in Europe,'' Clark, a U.S. Army general, told reporters last week
at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``Man does not do this to his
fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark is not speaking from speculation.
</P>
<P>
   His briefings include extensive aerial photographs, infrared
snapshots and other types of imagery. They are taken by military
satellites, high altitude U-2 Dragon Lady spy planes, low-flying
Predator unmanned aircraft, and other types of reconnaissance
planes that keep watch over Kosovo around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   These sources don't catch every act of thuggery, and much of
NATO's spy power has been limited by heavy clouds. What Clark has
seen of Serb movements and operations, however, has convinced him
that much of what the refugees report is true.
</P>
<P>
   Clark described the following six-step Serb program for emptying
an Albanian community, a process that's been captured by spy
cameras that take rapid-fire snapshots at dozens of sites across
Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tanks surround the community.
</P>
<P>
   Troops instruct everyone to remain in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Snipers are posted on rooftops to shoot anyone who ventures
outside
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitary units prowl the streets, hauling out from homes
</P>
<P>
   anyone they choose, often citing terrorist suspicions, killing
whomever they like, or marching them off
</P>
<P>
   to an uncertain fate.
</P>
<P>
   People are ordered to leave their houses _ they're typically
given an hour or less _ and are frequently beaten, robbed and
taunted to take one last look at their homes, or their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Homes are burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen evidence, and we've got some imagery on numerous
villages, in fact, that have been put to the torch by this ethnic
cleansing process,'' Clark told PBS.
</P>
<P>
   With journalists, aid workers and international monitors out of
Kosovo, the Serbs have a free hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's open season,'' said Kurt Bassuener, associate director of
the Balkan Action Council, a Washington advocacy group that closely
monitors conditions in the region. ``There's absolutely no
restraints on what the Serb forces are capable of doing, and
probably are doing, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty itself is frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am upset by what we are learning, but I'm terrified by what
we do not yet know,'' said Fred Abrahams, Kosovo researcher for
Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The known activities in Kosovo, however, track disturbingly
close to the Serb tactics during 3.5 years of fighting in
neighboring Bosnia, where more than 200,000 civilians were killed
and more than 2 million others were forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In a now-infamous example of the methods of Bosnian Serbs, some
8,000 people the vast majority of them civilians were slaughtered
and buried in mass graves in the remote town of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Bassuener fears similar massacres are unfolding inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see mass graves and ethnic cleansing on
a scale that makes Srebrinica look rather minor,'' he said. ``I
fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pattern that played itself out repeatedly in Bosnia, the
Serb troops and police across Kosovo have routinely separated out
men under the age of 60 from women and children, before sending the
refugees on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Men old enough to fight or to be recruited by the anti-Serb
Kosovo Liberation Army have been ominously absent from the streams
of refugees pouring out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this mystery of the males,'' Shea said. ``Where are
the men?''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer was stretched out along the roadside a week
ago at a police checkpoint near the village of Velika Krusa in
southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A refugee from Pec told Human Rights Watch investigators that he
was riding in an Albania-bound convoy of about 50 buses and trucks
carrying Kosovars who had been forced from their homes as Serb
troops destroyed the old city. At the Velika Krusa checkpoint, the
witness said, soldiers standing alongside armored personnel
carriers suddenly began yelling at young men on his bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the soldiers started pointing at people: 'You, you and
you _ get off the bus,''' this witness said. ``They took them about
ten to fifteen meters away, out of sight. We heard shooting. They
were all young boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees traveling the road later told Human Rights Watch
that they saw about 15 bodies laid out near the road as they passed
the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another witness with the bad luck to pass through Velika
Krusa told an equally chilling tale.
</P>
<P>
   After an all night forced march from the village of Celina, this
witness arrived with a group at the Velika Krusa checkpoint, where
they were told to board trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were getting on they took two people away and killed
them,'' this witness testified. ``One of them was Vefair Rexhepi
from Celina. He was a mute and couldn't say anything when they
asked him to speak Serbian, so they shot him. The other man was
Nait Kabashi from Obterusha. I saw this.''

<P>
   ROME _ Pope John Paul II, in a passionate but somber Easter
message assailing violence and callousness in Yugoslavia, appealed
on Sunday for a ``humanitarian corridor'' to take urgent relief to
hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing manhunts and the burning of towns and villages, but
also the din and destruction wrought by aerial attacks, John Paul
told a crowd of more than 30,000 people in St. Peter's Square that
``peace is possible, peace is a duty, peace is a prime
responsibility of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pope, in his traditional annual address ``to the city of
Rome and to the world,'' added: ``How can we speak of peace when
people are forced to flee, when they are hunted down and their
homes are burned to the ground? When the heavens are rent by the
din of war, when the whistle of shells is heard around people's
homes and the ravaging fire of bombs consumes towns and villages?''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who was rebuffed on Thursday when he issued a plea for
an end to the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia and the attacks on
the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, appealed to the Yugoslav leadership
``to allow a humanitarian corridor to be opened in order for help
to be brought to the mass of people gathered at the border of
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no frontiers to impede the work of solidarity,''
the pope said. ``Corridors of hope are always an imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul celebrated an outdoor Mass on Sunday morning. The
potted olive trees representing peace, the brilliant spring day,
and his resplendent white and gold robes contrasted with the somber
tones of his message. Before Mass, the pope, who is 78, called upon
the crowds to pray especially for the ``martyred region of the
Balkans'' and for an end to the refugee crisis that is engulfing
it.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mass was going on, a prayer was read ``that in the
Balkans, with good will from both sides, the weapons will fall
silent and negotiations are restarted, aimed at a true and lasting
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, appearing worn after three days of often exhausting
Holy Week services, entered St. Peter's Basilica after the Mass,
but emerged again as its bells struck noon, to deliver his address
and to offer greetings for Easter.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, John Paul, who was at pains not to single out
for chastisement any one side in the conflict, spoke nevertheless
of a ``diabolical spiral of revenge and senseless fratricidal
conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   He impressed on his listeners the urgency of assistance for the
masses of refugees made homeless by the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of those who have been killed, of those made homeless,
of those who have been torn from their families, of those who are
being forced to flee,'' he said. ``How can we be insensitive to the
sorrowful flood of men and women from Kosovo who are knocking at
our door, begging help?''
</P>
<P>
   After delivering his traditional message, John Paul issued
Easter greetings in 61 languages, including Serbian, Albanian and
Macedonian, the languages of three of the peoples immediately
caught up in the Balkan crisis.

 &HT;    NFL, black colleges see status change
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An aging and abandoned barn once stood just a few
miles down State Road 552, the twisting, two-lane blacktop that
meanders through tiny Lorman, Miss., and into Alcorn State
University. Its wood bleached and its nails rusted by decades of
hot, wet weather, the creaky structure nonetheless was a landmark
to those who passed it regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Painted on the side of the sagging barn, in faded, yellow block
letters, was this simple warning: ``Welcome to Hard Times, Miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when NFL scouts flocked to Alcorn in search of
prospects like cornerback Roynell Young _ the Philadelphia Eagles'
first-round draft choice in 1980 who made the Pro Bowl squad in
just his third NFL season _ that cautionary note could not have
been more misplaced. Back then a scout could pull into Alcorn for
the morning practice and identify six or seven Braves seniors to
recommend to his personnel director.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, things have changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The barn is long gone. Unfortunately, so are most of the NFL
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scouts still come,'' Alcorn State coach Johnny Thomas
said. ``But they don't come as often. And they certainly don't stay
as long.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the trend of recent drafts graphically indicates that it
is no longer necessary to dispatch legions of NFL scouts to the
historically black universities of the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference, Southwestern Athletic Conference, the Central
Intercollegiate Athletic Association or the Southern
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The return on the NFL's investment simply isn't what it used to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1996, when Pittsburgh selected North Carolina A&AMP;T
offensive tackle Jamain Stephens, have the black colleges produced
a first-round draft choice. The nine drafts in the '90s have
included only eight first-rounders from those schools, nd three of
those were in 1995. This year's draft, in two weeks, figures to
include only a handful of players from the traditionally black
universities, perhaps none in the top three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 11 NFL personnel directors indicated that, of the
players on this year's 25th anniversary Black College All-American
team, introduced at a banquet in Atlanta in late February, only
three or four rate as ``draftable.'' The offensive player of the
year on that All-American team, Patrick Bonner of Florida A&AMP;M,
probably won't even be in a training camp this July as an undrafted
free agent. The defensive player of the year, linebacker Terry
Houzah of Mississippi Valley State, is regarded only as a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The proud program at Grambling, with four members of the Pro
Football Hall of Fame, hasn't turned out a first-round choice since
Doug Williams went to Tampa Bay in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the black colleges in the draft is more than
anything else a reflection of integration in the South and the open
recruiting policies that followed. ``There's no doubt,'' San Diego
general manager Bobby Beathard said, ``that integration in the
Southern schools is the reason the black programs don't turn out
the players they used to. Sure it's had a drastic effect on the
quality of their prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said, ``Let's face it, 20-25 years
ago, Charlie Ward would have been playing at Florida A&AMP;M and not
Florida State. But the kids who once went to Grambling or Southern
or Alcorn State are going to Tennessee, Georgia or Florida now.
It's just a microcosm of society. There came a point when the big
football schools had no choice but to recruit black players. And
that drained the resources of black schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Joe, the coach at Florida A&AMP;M, said last week the old
adage still holds true: If a player has NFL talent, the scouts will
find him. Bonner, who threw for 3,575 yards and 38 touchdowns last
season in the Rattlers' wide-open attack, has been scouted several
times by NFL teams, Joe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows about Patrick; he's no secret to the NFL,''
the coach said. ``If Patrick is not drafted or isn't in an NFL camp
this summer, it won't be because he didn't get a chance to be seen
by the scouts. It will be because he wasn't good enough, plain and
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just a fact that we don't have as many prospects as we
once did,'' Joe said. ``Twenty-five years ago, a scout could come
here or go to Grambling and know he was going to track seven or
eight (prospects) overall and usually a first-rounder. Now, they
come in, and they are finding guys you maybe take in the fifth
round.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Falcons personnel director Ken Herock, who will assume
that same title soon in Green Bay, reinforced that the black
colleges are victims of societal progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids they're able to attract now are the ones who have
fallen through the cracks,'' he said. ``You know, a player who
might not qualify academically at a big school. Or a player who
transfers in, or maybe a late-bloomer. That's just the cruel
reality. I'd love to see them getting first-rounders, because their
coaches work hard and those schools have been good to the NFL. But
it's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the black colleges provided four No. 1 picks, and there
were five first-round choices in 1975, including Walter Payton from
Jackson State. But since '75, there have been just 15 first-round
selections from the black colleges. Of that group, only Jerry Rice
(Mississippi Valley State, '85) has been to more than one Pro Bowl
game.
</P>
<P>
   The black schools have produced 13 Hall of Fame players, but
that number will not increase much in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers director of football operations Tom Donahoe, in
Knoxville last month for the on-campus workouts of Tennessee's top
prospects in this year's draft, noticed the annual team pictures on
the wall. In the photographs from the 1970s, there were virtually
no black players; for the 1980s and '90s, the black players
represented the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walking along the wall and looking at those team pictures
from year to year ... was like viewing the evolution of integration
at Southern football schools,'' Donahoe said. ``Nobody ignores the
black schools. Certainly we don't. When we get a player like
(linebacker) Earl Holmes from Florida A&AMP;M in the fourth round (in
1996), we're thrilled. We just aren't getting many of them anymore,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Beathard used four of his eight selections in '97 on players
from the black schools, and his draft class was widely panned, but
he contended the situation is improving. He said Grambling, which
has its best recruiting class in 15 years, is an example of a
school that is on the rise again under Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no blame, because it's a fact of life,'' Joe said.
``Would I rather have a plethora of high-round draft picks, like we
used to have, but still have segregation? No way. We can't afford
to step back in society, and so we're not going to move ahead in
attracting the top players anymore. Everything comes with a price.
As long as the scouts still come into our place and look at our
kids, and those players get a fair shake in the NFL (evaluation)
process, then it's a small price to pay.''

   BLACE, Macedonia _ Every few minutes stretcher-bearers struggled
through the crowd, slipping and falling up the muddy slope in their
haste to get another patient to the medical tent. Others charged
the hill with children in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   They were the very few who were allowed through the police
cordon. Macedonian soldiers and police in riot gear have formed a
human barrier around the thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees from
Kosovo camping here on a small patch of land at the border, beating
back anyone who tries to pass.
</P>
<P>
   As the tide of refugees has swelled the miserable crowd to
30,000, conditions have deteriorated alarmingly. Death and disease
are becoming commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies said 11 people died Friday night, and another 14
died Saturday night, mostly the old and very young, many of them
suffering from exposure. Local journalists reported several babies
had been born in the camp, too, and that one of the mothers died in
childbirth Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis and pneumonia are already raging through the sprawling
camp, where people are sleeping in the open under the rain, or
beneath makeshift shelters of blankets and plastic. There are no
toilets and people are using the nearby river for washing and
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of thousands of people camped on the hillside and
across the fields is a messy and noisy jumble. Smoke drifts from
hundred of fires. Men squat beside their plastic shelters, others
crush together around the single white tent registering refugees.
The occasional person who tries to slip out is shoved back hard by
police or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing sense of desperation in the sodden
encampment.Many refugees appear to be in severe shock from their
ordeal in Kosovo. Expelled at gunpoint and herded into train
wagons, the refugees have arrived often with only the clothes on
their backs.
</P>
<P>
   One family held up a huge sign made out of cardboard. They had
drawn the simple message in English: ``Help.''
</P>
<P>
   More are trapped on the other side of the border, unable to pass
since Macedonian authorities effectively closed the border. A long
tail of cars snakes back up the road into the embattled province.
Many refugees have abandoned their cars, and stand massed by the
immigration booths on the road, waiting to come through.
</P>
<P>
   They face Macedonian police, who Friday used batons against the
crowd to keep them back. The Macedonian government denies closing
the border, but is adamant that it cannot absorb any more refugees
for reasons of both economic and political stability.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old mechanic, Gazmend Kumnova, said his aunt died
three days ago on the Serbian side of the border. ``It was
impossible to get food to them,'' he said. ``It was only when she
died that they let the family through,'' he said. They buried her
the next day in the nearby Macedonian capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian authorities have prevented foreign aid
organizations from working in the camp itself. Local aid workers
were doing the job, driving into the camp on tractors, laden with
food and drink. They stopped at intervals and threw provisions into
the crowd in random fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid organizations have a single, overwhelmed medical
tent alongside the camp to care for the sick. Patients, mostly old
people unable to move on their own, lie and sit around on the
ground outside. A lone figure, in white medical coat and surgical
mask and gloves, hurried through the mud searching for a patient.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have begun transferring refugees out to other
camps, piling them into buses in haphazard fashion. One bus load
was taken to the refugee camp of Ragushe, farther along the Serbian
border.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by wire fencing and guarded by Macedonian police, the
refugees were confused and fearful. ``We thought we were moving
away from an aggressor and we find something very similar to the
Serb police,'' said Hazen Dakaj, a 52-year-old refugee. He stood by
the wire fence, greeting family members stuck inside the camp.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos of boarding the buses in the middle of the night,
three of the 14 members of his family had been separated and lost.
``They brought us in buses here when they saw people dying. They
did not care if we were together or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Macedonia's reluctance to take in the refugees,
NATO countries on Sunday were gearing up to take over
responsibility for them.Turkey, Germany and Norway have pledged to
take in 36,000 refugees among them, a spokeswoman at the Prime
Minister's office in Skopje said.
</P>
<P>
   Flights were due to arrive Sunday bearing food and supplies for
the refugees, then depart with the first load of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, just down the road from the border, NATO troops were
constructing a large transit camp with military tents and showers.
A stark contrast to the chaos by the border, the NATO camp was
expected to swing into action Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees will be given food and water, medical treatment and
washing facilities while they are registered and will then be sent
on, either to other camps or abroad.

 &HT;    Braves focus on new season, chances for World Series title
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time is running out on the team of the 1990s, whoever
that might be.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with today's opening game against the Philadelphia
Phillies at Turner Field, the Atlanta Braves have 162 games and one
last October to make their case that they they deserve the title of
team of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   So do the Yankees. World Series titles in 1996 and 1998 and a
possible third this season would be more impressive credentials
than that of the Braves, with one World Series title in 1995 and
their yearly stranglehold on the NLCS. The Toronto Blue Jays are a
long shot to win their third title of the 1990s, but could make
their case with their two titles in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves win it all this year, the Yankees and the Blue
Jays would have a hard time arguing, since those teams would have
the same number of World Series titles. But Atlanta would stand
head and shoulders above them in winning percentage and trips to
the postseason in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fitting to be the last ones standing in October
1999,'' Chipper Jones said. ``That's the way a storybook ending
should go. You look at the winning percentage of teams in the '90s,
and there's nobody that can even touch us. We're very proud of
that. We have won a championship ring in the decade. It would
certainly be nice to put a punctuation mark on the 1990s with a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jones suggests, the Braves think they have case enough to
claim the title of team of the decade with or without a second
World Series championship. Greg Maddux agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's the team of the 90s? '' Maddux asked. ``Who do people
see every year in the postseason in the 90s?''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Maddux said. ``So we got one ring, big deal. We
got one. That's one more than plenty of other teams. So picky.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been in the playoffs every year since 1991 with
the exception of strike year in 1994, when there was no postseason.
That includes a record seven consecutive appearances in the
National League Championship Series, including victories against
the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1991-92, the Cincinnati Reds in 1995 and
St. Louis Cardinals in 1996 and losses to the Phillies in 1993, the
Florida Marlins in 1997 and the San Diego Padres in 1998. The
Braves have been to four out of the eight World Series this decade
_ losing to the Twins in 1991, the Blue Jays in 1992 and the
Yankees in 1996, and beating the Indians in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of what this team has done in the 90s,'' Maddux
said. ``(Whether we win another ring) doesn't change the fact of
what this organization has accomplished in the last 30 years, by
any means. I tell you what, having the success we've had, we've
only gotten one World Series ring, maybe we could have had seven.
But I still sleep pretty good at night. I'm proud to wear the shirt
I'm wearing. I think the majority of the people that play this game
would love to play for the Braves. If not, they're not winners.
They're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can argue with the Braves' consistency, which is a
testament to, among other things, the organization's ability to
continue fielding top quality teams, good health and mental
toughness. Maddux knows the difference from his years with the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so much easier to lose than it is to win, especially
over 162 games, both mentally and physically,'' Maddux said.
``That's what I think people don't understand _ how much tougher
mentally it is winning. When you play games in September and your
team is 20 games out, it's cake. You go to the ballpark, put your
uni on, and you play. You win? Yippee. So what? You're going home
next month anyway. (As a Brave) you go through 9 1/2 months.
Mentally there's a lot to that. To be able to bounce back every
year and go through it again says a lot about the character of this
team and the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   As the year 2000 approaches, Jones said the Braves aren't
thinking about the end of the run. The real worries won't come with
the turn of the century; they'll come when Maddux, Tom Glavine and
John Smoltz start pushing 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some guys that aren't spring chickens anymore,'' Jones
said. ``Yeah, everybody looks at the core of everyday players _ me,
Javy (Lopez), (Ryan) Klesko, Andruw (Jones) as being young, but as
our pitching goes, we go. Smoltzy, Glav, Maddux . . . they're all
still great. They're going to be great for a few more years, but
the clock is ticking. We realize that.

supervisor is Henry Louis Warnken; phone: (888) 346-9867.

<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels, Belgium) _ NATO moved on Sunday to assume
responsibility for hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees, even
as it sought to take advantage of a break in the weather by
increasing its bombardment of Yugoslavia. NATO nations have agreed
to temporarily accept almost 100,000 of the refugees. The alliance
is also mounting emergency relief efforts in Macedonia and Albania,
where tides of hungry and desperate refugees have overwhelmed aid
workers. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The official Yugoslav
media said on Sunday that at least four civilians had been killed
and 17 injured in strikes all over Serbia, as NATO widened its
attacks on Yugoslavia's civilian as well as military
infrastructure. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MOBILIZE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ No general mobilization
has been declared, but reserve units are being called up as
specialities are required. Men who served in radio and
communications units, for instance, are being ordered to report for
duty, some Serbs say. Wartime military courts have been established
to court-martial those who do not report to their units
immediately, with prison terms for draft-dodging can range from one
to 20 years. Official Serbian state television has shown glowing
reports of young men responding to mobilization or draft orders,
and it is likely that a large majority does so. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ At its starkest, the truth in Kosovo
is simple. Serbs, enboldened or maddened by NATO bombings, are on a
rampage of ethnic cleansing that has caused nearly a quarter of the
ethnic Albanian population to flee. But close up, real life is
rarely simple. Between those deaths lies a tangled web of history,
friendships and enmities, of war and routine business that were
echoed all over Kosovo. And those are the minutiae of life and
death that are drowned out by the clashing statements of Washington
and Belgrade. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace) _ As the tide of refugees has swelled
the miserable crowd to 30,000, conditions have deteriorated
alarmingly. Death and disease are becoming commonplace. Aid
agencies said 11 people died Friday night, and another 14 died
Saturday night, mostly the old and very young, many of them
suffering from exposure. Local journalists reported several babies
had been born in the camp, too, and that one of the mothers died in
childbirth Saturday. By Carlotta Gall.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-INTERNET (Undated) _ In many ways, the Internet is
personalizing the war in Yugoslavia for Americans more than any
other form of media can. Rare accounts from individuals inside
Kosovo circulate on e-mail, chat rooms offer interaction with
representatives from all sides, and online opinion polls invite
instant voting on what to do next. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POPE (Rome) _ Pope John Paul II, in a passionate but
somber Easter message assailing the violence and callousness in
Yugoslavia, appealed on Sunday for a ``humanitarian corridor'' to
bring urgent relief to hundreds of thousands of refugees from
Kosovo.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A strengthening low-pressure center will move from eastern
Colorado early Monday to the northern Plains on Monday night,
taking widespread inclement weather from the foothills of the
Colorado Rockies to the northern Plains. Snow will taper off over
eastern Colorado on Monday morning as winds from the north
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, an area of rain with embedded thunderstorms will
engulf much of the Missouri Valley. The rain will be mixed with
some snow from over parts of the western and northern Dakotas. The
wet weather will spread into the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   A line of thunderstorms will gain strength as humid air surges
north into eastern Kansas, Missouri and Iowa. Many of the storms
will be accompanied by high wind gusts. Shifting winds between the
ground and 10,000 feet will heighten the risk of a few tornadoes as
the storms move east Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a broken band of thunderstorms, some with large
hail, will precede a cold front as it moves from eastern Texas
early Monday to the lower Mississippi Valley on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler and drier air will spread from New England to the Middle
Atlantic States in the wake of a cold front. Sunshine will be
plentiful in most of the Northeast, but clouds and a few showers
will linger near the front over the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, another episode of intermittent mountain snow and
valley showers will spread from Oregon to northern California and
Nevada. Meanwhile, the Southwest will have a brief return to dry
conditions with ample sun.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Changing Times
</P>
<P>
   While turning the hands of a clock cannot change the weather,
Sunday's time adjustment can alter human perception of weather
events. Many daily weather trends begin at sunrise. The flood of
solar energy sets the air in motion, causing wind speed to
increase. The temperature often begins an abrupt rise. Dense fogs
start to dissipate as the sun warms the saturated air. Often,
strong weather systems overwhelm these daily cycles. But, on
average, as most people begin their day, the weather this week will
be calmer, cooler and mistier than last week, because of the change
in time.

   KOSOVO-MAIN _ TIRANA, Albania _ Humanitarian aid is being rushed
to ethnic Albanian refugees as NATO and the Clinton administration
are put on the defensive about why they didn't anticipate the scope
of the problem and preposition food and supplies. Meanwhile, plans

unleashed upon fleeing Kosovar Albanians by Serb troops, police and
paramilitary units. Using spy planes, satellites and unmanned
drones equipped with high altitude cameras, NATO is beginning to
document the claims of the escaping refugees (Holmes/Deans, Cox

   BASEBALL-SUIT _ When Sterling Lapinski settled into his seat at
an Atlanta Braves game two years ago, all he wanted to do was enjoy
America's pastime and drink some cold beers with his buddies from
work. Then the unthinkable happened. As Lapinski was talking to a
waitress about his next beer, New York Mets catcher Todd Pratt
swung and missed at a Tom Glavine fastball and flung his bat into
the stands, where it hit Lapinski in the head, crushing his skull.
The injuries _ and a tremendous scar _ are still with Lapinski, who
now lives in Houston. In a novel lawsuit, Lapinski has sued the
Mets ballclub saying that Pratt _ who threw his bat into the stands
three times during the game, should be held responsible. A federal
judge has dismissed his suit, but Lapinski is appealing in the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. He and his lawyers are
trying to skirt the premises liability issue (ticket stubs say
patrons cannot hold ballyards liable for injuries) by saying thrown
bats are so unusual and unexpected ballclubs should be held
responsible. Some courts in other states have agreed. (Rankin,

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO moved Sunday to assume responsibility
for hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees, even as it sought to
take advantage of a break in the weather by increasing its
bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO nations have agreed to temporarily accept almost 100,000 of
the refugees. The alliance is also mounting emergency relief
efforts in Macedonia and Albania, where tides of hungry and
desperate refugees have overwhelmed aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee problem has, in effect, become a second front for
the alliance, which is girding itself for weeks of bombing. Gen.
Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, charged that the
flood of refugees was part of a deliberate strategy by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to destabilize the Balkans and tie
down allied governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a calculated, deliberate, arranged, preplanned
humanitarian catastrophe,'' Clark told a small group of reporters
on Saturday at the alliance's military headquarters. ``It serves
two purposes. Not only does it change the demographics in Kosovo,
but it helps to destabilize Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO's eventual goal is to return the refugees to
Kosovo, the prospects for doing so in the near future are bleak.
NATO acknowledges that its air campaign has had little effect in
stemming the Serb effort to evict ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's military goal, they say, is to do so much damage
to the Yugoslav military and to institutions propping up the
Milosevic regime that Belgrade will ultimately agree to a political
settlement for Kosovo or, at least, withdraw its military forces
from the province so that the refugees can return under NATO
protection.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's protracted strategy, however, means that hundreds of
thousands of refugees must be taken care of in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea announced that Germany had
agreed to temporarily resettle 40,000 of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has promised to accept 20,000 refugees.
American officials said the refugees might be kept at Guam,
Guantanamo Bay or some other location not in the continental United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey will also accept 20,000; Norway will take 6,000. Canada
and Greece each will resettle 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO has conducted 11 days of bombing raids, the
alliance's air war is, in a sense, just beginning to get under way.
Because NATO's air armada has been relatively small and has
encountered bad weather, the alliance's striking power has been
constrained.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said, for example, that it launched 2700 air
missions during the first nine days of the campaign, a small
fraction of the combat flights carried out during a comparable
period of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. And of the 2700 mission, only
15 per cent of them were bombing strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, NATO is expanding its force and attacking a
broader range of targets, including the Yugoslav capital
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request from Gen. Clark, the Pentagon announced
Sunday that it was dispatching 24 Apache attack helicopters and 18
surface-to-surface rocket launchers to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets will include longer-range missiles, which would be
used to attack air defenses so that the Apache helicopters, armed
with anti-tank Hellfire missiles, could fly into Kosovo to seek out
and destroy Serbian armor and military vehicles. About 2,000 Army
troops will be sent to Albania to operate, maintain and protect the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a week or longer to deploy the weapons to Albania,
the Pentagon said. The weapons will not be used until the North
Atlantic Council, the political arm of NATO, formally agrees, and
President Clinton provides final approval.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the U.S. Army Apache helicopters in Kosovo would
technically puncture the Clinton administration's promise not to
employ ground forces in Kosovo.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels) _ NATO and European developments
concerning the crisis in Kosovo. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ At its starkest, the truth in Kosovo
is simple. Serbs, enboldened or maddened by NATO bombings, are on a
rampage of ethnic cleansing that has caused nearly a quarter of the
ethnic Albanian population to flee. But close up, real life is
rarely simple. Between those deaths lies a tangled web of history,
friendships and enmities, of war and routine business that were
echoed all over Kosovo. And those are the minutae of life and death
that are drowned out by the clashing statements of Washington and
Belgrade. By Alessanrda Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ A look at the latest military
developments comcerning Kosovo. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MEDIA (Washington) _ The Pentagon's media policy in this
war, and how it differs from the Gulf War. By Jason DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MOBILIZE (Belgrade, Serbia) _ No general mobilization has
been declared, but reserve units are being called up as
specialities are required. Men who served in radio and
communications units, for instance, are being ordered to report for
duty, some Serbs say. Wartime military courts have been established
to court-martial those who do not report to their units
immediately, with prison terms for draft-dodging can range from one
to 20 years. Official Serbian state television has shown glowing
reports of young men responding to mobilization or draft orders,
and it is likely that a large majority does so. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace) _ As the tide of refugees has swelled
the miserable crowd to 30,000, conditions have deteriorated
alarmingly. Death and disease are becoming commonplace. Aid
agencies said 11 people died Friday night, and another 14 died
Saturday night, mostly the old and very young, many of them
suffering from exposure. Local journalists reported several babies
had been born in the camp, too, and that one of the mothers died in
childbirth Saturday. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-PARTNERS (Montclair, N.J.) _ On a frigid March morning, 35
second graders squirmed with delight in the Watchung School
auditorium at the prospect of receiving a disposable camera and a
creative assignment: recording their lives and tastes in
photographs and writing. The homework was not assigned by teachers
at this public elementary school just 15 miles west of New York
City. Instead, the assignment, handed out to some 250 children at
the school, came from researchers for Noggin, a new educational
channel that has formed a special partnership with Watchung. In
exchange for $7,100, Noggin can go into the school once a week from
now until June to run focus groups with some 250 children who
turned in parent permission slips. For Rita Miragliotta, Watchung's
principal, the partnership has been a boon, helping ease a budget
crunch. But for others in the education world, which has seen an
explosion of corporate suitors, deals like the Watchung-Noggin
partnership are things to be avoided, as they blur the line
separating schools from supermarkets.

   BALKANS-STRATEGY-TWOTAKES (Undated) _The options appear to be
few. The good options, almost nonexistent. Should NATO ratchet up
its air attacks on Yugoslavia in hopes that President Slobodan
Milosevic, envisioning his land reduced to ashes, might beg for
mercy? Should President Clinton reverse himself and send in ground
troops, signaling what could be a long, bloody and unpopular
battle? Or should all nations now deep in Yugoslavia's violent
quagmire cut a deal with Milosevic to pull themselves out _ no
matter how unworkable that deal may be? Analysts are debating such
scenarios with great passion, though they offer no sure-fire
formulas. By RICK MONTGOMERY. Story will move in the ``w''

   FIREARMS-PROPOSAL-TWOTAKES (JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.) _ After months
of legal fights, a fortune in television ads and fearmongering by
both sides, Missouri voters will decide Tuesday whether to allow
concealed firearms on public streets. The campaign for Proposition
B has lived up to its billing as the year's biggest showdown
between the National Rifle Association and advocates of gun
control. By KIT WAGAR. Story will move in the ``a'' category.

<P>
   ROYALS-STADIUM-TWOTAKES (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ In recent years,
Kauffman Stadium, a jewel of a facility when it opened in 1973, had
fallen behind newer parks such as Baltimore's Camden Yards,
Cleveland's Jacobs Field and Atlanta's Turner Field in offering fan
amenities and generating revenue. When the Kansas City Royals open
their season Monday against the Boston Red Sox, they will take the
wraps off a $14 million face-lift to their stadium. By RANDY
COVITZ. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTNING-SURVIVOR (OVERLAND PARK, Kan.) _ When the weather is
good, Katie Zemel loves to run around in the grass near her
Overland Park home and kick a soccer ball with her friends. No big
deal for most 15-year-olds. But the last time Katie suited up for
the Shawnee Mission South High School soccer team, a lightning bolt
knocked down everyone on the field _ and stopped Katie's heart. By
RICHARD ESPINOZA. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   FISHER-COLUMN-TWOTAKES (KALVESTA, Kan.) _ A fragment of Kansas
has been put at risk with the recent rumblings about shutting down
Theoni School. It's a school with two classrooms, a library, an
office and just 15 students. And it's a link to an
all-but-forgotten time when every three or four miles, in any
direction, there were schools like it. But today, schools in Kansas
like Theoni can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Later this
month the board of Unified School District 457 _ representing a
900-square-mile area encompassing Garden City and environs _ will
consider the fate of the beige-brick structure that's been a
landmark on the prairie for 46 years. By JIM FISHER. Story will

FOR TWO SMALL PUPS, LIFE IS BRIGHTER

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lives are composed of sequential accidents. Sometimes planning
plays hardly any part.
</P>
<P>
   By accident, the people who moved as renters into the house on
the far side of my country lane had a dog.
</P>
<P>
   By chance _ most (BEGIN ITALICS)assuredly(END ITALICS) by chance
_ that dog, a female Australian shepherd mix, was bred by some
wandering cad of the neighborhood, a gigolo of unknown provenance.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less accidentally, I suspect, she denned her new pups
under the floor of my cabin in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   I saw them first as only two small brown muzzles, thrust out
from beneath the outer wall. They crept forth eventually, but were
afraid to be petted. They'd at least taken the chance of showing
themselves, though. It was a start.
</P>
<P>
   Then my wife and I were at the cabin another day. And the mother
dog, perhaps humiliated at her youngsters' social backwardness,
nudged them forward with her nose so they could be touched.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence of these random occurrences is that the two pups
no longer make their home under the cabin, 100 miles from here.
Instead, they are in the dog pen about 15 feet from our bedroom
window. And that much, at least, is deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   The ride back from the country must have been a terror. After
which, in two days at the veterinarian's, they suffered all sorts
of alarming ministrations _ were stuck with needles, dewormed,
deticked, bathed, and even had their toenails trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   All gussied up and sanitized, they're with us now. And I have to
say they're about the softest little creatures I ever touched.
Yesterday we had them on the front lawn, and children came from
across the street to inspect the livestock.
</P>
<P>
   There's something miraculous in the chemistry between children
and very young animals. In just part of an hour, all timidity was
gone and the pups had been wholly socialized.
</P>
<P>
   They're temporary lodgers only. The resident Brittanys, Pete and
Bear, are decent sports, and have always preferred the freedom of
the yard to confinement in the wire run. But now that the pen is
occupied by others, its desirability has been much enhanced. From
their manner I can tell they're wondering if they'll get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the puppies' first in these new surroundings,
loneliness or darkness overcame them and they set up a keening that
I heard through the window at the edge of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   By yet one more accident _ a happy one _ the night was warm,
almost like summer, so the neighbors on that side had their windows
closed and their air conditioner running.
</P>
<P>
   I first wrote about these pups when I heard them rustling and
bumping under the cabin floor; then again when I was able to see
them, and knew they were dogs in fact. And now this.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I had a letter from a reader who said he would be
interested in having one of the pups. He's to come today to look at
them, and we're hoping he'll decide the little brothers oughtn't to
be separated, and will want to take them both.
</P>
<P>
   I simply cannot write about this matter again. Three times is
enough.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow one of psychobabble's favorite terms, readers want
/{closure/} on this. I want closure. The neighbors need closure,
and the editors demand it.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the pups need closure.
</P>
<P>
   I hope, when he comes this morning, the man brings some closure
with him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS)A note: Alan and Rory, father and son, showed up
as promised, and, with their older dog, Rocky, tried to pick
between the two. They couldn't, though _ and so decided the
brothers could spend their lives together, after all. Such
goodness, if there were enough to go around, might change the
world.(END ITALICS)

   ... to get good seats.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The four dugout suites, which hold between 16 and 30 guests
each, are the first of their kind in major-league baseball. They
are below field level and adjacent to the Royals' and visitor's
dugouts. Behind the two rows of seats are the same double-deck
wooden benches the players have in the dugouts, and the fans will
discover the best vantage point sitting atop the benches instead of
in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Below the dugout suites, the dining and party areas are a few
steps from the Royals' and visiting teams' indoor batting cages.
The dugout suites are available on a per-game basis at $1,000, plus
$35 per ticket and food costs.
</P>
<P>
   The dugout suites were in such demand for opening day, the
Royals had a drawing, and Hersh, who usually watches the opener
from the upper reaches of the stadium, was selected.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the opener, the suites have been reserved for about
one-third of the 81 home dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can get too successful,'' said Mike Levy, the
Royals vice president of marketing and communications. ``People
assumed these were sold out because the Crown Seats sold out. So
lately we've been getting the word out, and they've been going
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Saferstein not only bought Crown Seats for half of the
regular-season games, but he also reserved a dugout suite for a
company party in July instead of the patio outside the Stadium Club
that he used last season.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Sportsman bought dugout suites for five games _ including
opening day, the Cardinals series and two Yankees games _ while
still keeping two season tickets for 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a baseball fan and enjoy the game, having that type
of proximity will be enjoyable,'' said Sportsman, Midwest region
director of St. Jude Medical heart-valve division. ``We've
incorporated the opportunity to bring in some of our clients who
love baseball and will enjoy the experience with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The additions of the Crown Club and dugout suites haven't cut
into season-ticket sales, which are about 9,700, Levy said. Nor
have they affected the demand for the 19 club-level suites, which
are sold out at a cost ranging between $40,000 and $60,000, plus
the costs of club-level tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a feasibility study in Kansas City to see if we could
sell these,'' Levy said. ``We found there is a market for it. Had
we found there wasn't, we wouldn't have built them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crown Seats and the dugout suites aren't for everyone. Our
field box seat, our $16 seat, is still the least-expensive field
box seat in major-league baseball. It doesn't affect the person who
walks up and buys a ticket on game day at all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The luxury suites won't be the only new touches to the stadium
this season:
</P>
<P>
   The new lower-level seats are vented with slats instead of solid
backs. That allows air to ventilate through the seats. Royals logos
are embossed on the aisle seats. On the club level, the two rows of
seats outside the suites' windows have padded bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   The Fun Zone outside the grandstand on the right-field side of
the stadium includes a new playground complete with play sets for
toddlers to 12-year-olds. The play area has a junglegym, sliding
boards, ladders and tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can follow the game on TV monitors, and families can eat
at picnic tables.
</P>
<P>
   Organist Sam Beckett will perform during the games,
supplementing recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   A sign declaring ``Cooperstown Countdown'' in the left-field
bullpen will track the days remaining until George Brett is
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25. Two pictures of
Brett adorn the sign.
</P>
<P>
   While all of the improvements may enhance a day at the ballpark,
most fans agree on what will keep them coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nice stadium will help,'' season-ticket holder Karl Hersh
said, ``but I think they need some winning seasons. And they need
an owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice, who hopes to be that owner by the All-Star break,
thinks there's a correlation between a profitable ballpark and a
successful baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what has happened with cities that have had renovated
or have new ballparks,'' Prentice said, ``I don't know whether it's
the new stadium or whether the team does better, but the fact
remains that more people come to the ballpark, and teams play
better when they have large crowds. At least the home team does,
generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a stadium that everybody is proud of and feels
comfortable being there, and they like to be there, that helps.'' &QL;

OUT ON THE PRAIRIE, SCHOOL'S THREATENED CLOSING STIRS CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ... 43 miles from Garden City.
</P>
<P>
   Times, though, have changed. Landholdings, always large out
here, have become even larger. Ditto machinery, irrigation
equipment, even production loans.
</P>
<P>
   What has shrunk in the countryside is population. In this part
of Kansas, a passer-by has to squint to see a house. As Pracht
said, until five years ago children had become almost a rarity.
Fewer young couples took up farming because of the overwhelming
costs; those who did rarely had the large families of yore.
</P>
<P>
   So as the years passed, consolidation resulted in bigger
schools, and the ubiquitous yellow buses traveled the back roads
for fewer and fewer children. Theoni and other schools like it
became almost quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Children on swings or playing kick ball during recess, seen from
a car hurrying down the desolate blacktop, were transfigured into a
barely recalled way of life, one framed perfectly against what
author Truman Capote called ``the annihilating sky'' of western
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools didn't have Theoni's staying power. Friend,
Shields, Amy and other schools in this corner of the state faded
away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Garden City boomed, going from a town of 12,000 in
the 1960s to more than double that. District enrollment _ primarily
in Garden City _ jumped from 4,500 in 1980 to 8,700 this year, a
growth fueled by large Hispanic and Southeast Asian migration
coming for the beef-packing jobs. What was a wheat, cattle and
sugar beet town became a center of beef processing and ancillary
businesses _ box making, trucking, tank manufacturing and feedlots.
</P>
<P>
   Pracht is also the principal of Garfield Elementary School, a
modernistic structure on Garden City's north side with 340
students.
</P>
<P>
   At Theoni, the faces of the children are white. At Garfield, 81
percent minority, the children's faces are mostly brown, their hair
dark and their eyes eager. When they recite the pledge of
allegiance, many '' ]do so in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Of his Garfield students, Pracht said, roughly 200 have Spanish
as their native tongue. And some bring problems _ single-parent
households, gang pressures, drugs in their neighborhoods _ that
make the difference between Pracht's two schools even starker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got wonderful kids and a wonderful staff at both,'' said
Pracht, 46, a native of Belleville, Kan., who said being principal
of two schools isn't that unusual, given Theoni's minuscule
enrollment. While he spends most of his time at Garfield, he keeps
in touch with Theoni by fax, phone and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   He works well with Theoni's two teachers, Kim Martin and Traci
Burrows. Burrows is from Monument, Kan. Martin is from Harlingen,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up to interview and they brought me out here,'' Martin
said. ``I just fell in love with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoni in Greek means ``Goddess of Truth.'' Theoni Fotopolous
was the wife of Paul Fotopolous, a Greek immigrant and western
Kansas landowner who in the early 1950s donated three acres to
School District 83. There were two stipulations: The school, opened
in 1953 at a cost of $49,392, would be named for his wife; if it
ever closed, the land would revert to his heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's that to consider, too,'' Pracht said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the isolation amid the ceaseless wind that blows out here
_ sometimes so hard that buses can't run _ Burrows, Martin and
Legg, the school secretary, said they had really never noticed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids always put up the flag in the morning,'' Legg said.
``Being little kids, one morning they raised it upside down _ you
know, the distress signal. Before you knew it, there was a passing
farmer in here, all excited and wanting to know if we were all
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not isolated. City folks might think so. Not us. Not
out here.''

<P>
   ... the issue concerns legalizing concealed firearms.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by a campaign filled with distortions about
what Proposition B would do and what might happen if it passes.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition B would allow people to obtain a permit to carry a
concealed firearm if they are at least 21 and have never been
convicted of a felony. They cannot have a misdemeanor conviction
involving a gun or a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   They can't be a known drunk, must never have been committed to a
mental institution, and must not have made threats or been violent
for the previous five years. They also must undergo 12 hours of
training.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has divided many traditional allies. Many police
officers on the street support the measure; most of their
supervisors oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Missourians Against Crime got a major boost when the St. Louis
Police Officers Association endorsed concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Sgt. John Johnson, the association's president, said the
main reason for the support was members' desire to carry guns after
they leave the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit it's a bit self-serving, but our members want to carry
legally because most officers do continue to carry after they
retire,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some gun-rights advocates are torn over the issue. Many gun
owners in rural areas are suspicious of the need to carry a hidden
handgun. And one gun-rights leader resigned to protest his group's
support of Proposition B.
</P>
<P>
   Terry W. Skinner, who was president of the Western Missouri
Shooters Alliance for two years, left the group last July because
the proposition would open juvenile records. People with clean
records as adults who are convicted of a violent crime as juveniles
could no longer own guns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't support anything that takes people's rights away for a
youthful mistake, even when they have led an exemplary life since
then,'' Skinner said. ``The rest of the group said those people are
just casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have focused their campaigns on women. Polls indicate
that most women oppose concealed firearms, but some are strong
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls and guns make a good combination for safety,'' said
state Rep. Judy Berkstresser, a Republican from Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Missourians Against Crime hired Wood Kinnard, a former Missouri
prosecutor who is on the board of governors of the Human Rights
Campaign, a national gay rights advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings and ads in gay-oriented newspapers, Kinnard has
pitched concealed firearms as a way to halt hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate or self-defense,'' one ad reads. ``Only one should be a
crime.'' The ad features photos of Matthew Shepard, the Wyoming
college student who was killed because he was gay; James Byrd Jr.,
the Texas man who was dragged behind a pickup truck because he was
black; and Billy Jack Gaither, a gay man beaten with an ax handle
in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important issue,'' Kinnard said. ``Ours is a community
where choice and civil rights are key.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that those crimes occurred even though
Alabama, Texas and Wyoming allow people to get permits to carry
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have said they have the support of the business
community. But business clearly has lined up against concealed
firearms. Only Anheuser-Busch has come out in support of
Proposition B.
</P>
<P>
   Business organizations contributed more than $500,000 to Safe
Schools' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company wants to ensure a safe shopping environment for
our customers and a safe workplace for our employees,'' said Dee
Wetzel, a spokeswoman for Schnuck Markets Inc., which contributed
$25,000 to fight concealed firearms.
</P>
<P>
   One gun-rights group, the Second Amendment Coalition of
Missouri, encouraged supporters to write, call or send e-mail to
NationsBank of Kansas City and Hallmark Cards Inc. to complain
about their executives' opposition to concealed guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention, NationsBank customers,'' the group's Web page says.
``Did you know that the CEO of your bank is giving money to the
opponents of right to carry? That's right, the money your account
earns him is being used to oppose your constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   John Galliher, a sociology professor at the University of
Missouri, said Tuesday's vote would probably turn on who gets to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supporters of concealed weapons are much more passionate than
the (opponents),'' Galliher said. ``They live for this, and they
will get their neighbors on the fence to vote for it. (Opponents)
have to convince people that it will make a difference in their
lives to get out and vote.'' (GLANCE BOX FOLLOWS)

PROPOSITION B ROUSED INTENSE, COSTLY CAMPAIGN DRIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ After months of legal fights, a fortune in
television ads and fearmongering by both sides, Missouri voters
will decide Tuesday whether to allow concealed firearms on public
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Proposition B has lived up to its billing as
the year's biggest showdown between the National Rifle Association
and advocates of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides reported raising $4 million for the campaign as of
Friday. Nearly 80 percent came from the NRA, but the fight for
voters appears to be going down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 513 registered voters conducted last week by William
Woods University found that 41 percent opposed Proposition B and 37
percent supported it. The rest were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The well-financed pro-gun forces, led by Missourians Against
Crime, is blanketing the airwaves with ads and burning up telephone
lines urging supporters to go to the polls. They have bought ads
aimed at groups ranging from libertarians and women to outdoorsmen
and crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only demographic I'm concerned about is, `Are you voting
for this thing,' '' said Brett Feinstein, a spokesman for
Missourians Against Crime.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-gun campaign is so sophisticated that an advocate with
national credentials in the gay community was brought in to drum up
support among gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Proposition B, led by the Safe Schools and
Workplaces Committee, have geared up their television ad campaign.
But with far fewer resources, their campaign pales in comparison to
the NRA's.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Safe Schools said it hoped to raise $2 million.
Through Friday, it reported raising just less than $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   That has forced the group to run a more focused campaign
emphasizing people who often deal with gun violence: health-care
workers, teachers, the black community and church leaders. Safe
Schools planned to hit all those groups this weekend with brochures
or personal appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers around the state have agreed to preach against
Proposition B in today's Easter sermons, Safe Schools spokeswoman
Lawren Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Her group is hoping for a big turnout Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA has a built-in infrastructure that from day one was
ready to turn out for this,'' Massey said. ``We need to energize
our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials are predicting that a big turnout isn't going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Rebecca Cook last week said the controversy
over Proposition B appeared likely to attract more people to the
polls. But she still expects a turnout of only 900,000 voters
statewide, or about 25 percent of those eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein acknowledges that conventional wisdom holds that a low
turnout tends to help groups such as Missourians Against Crime,
which has a solid core of ardent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's election has several unconventional aspects. There
are no other significant statewide races on the ballot. School
board and city council races that share the ballot with Proposition
B traditionally attract few voters.
</P>
<P>
   Concealed-firearm supporters also must overcome the public's
tendency to favor the status quo. Don Haider-Markel, a political
science professor at the University of Kansas, said 58 percent of
ballot measures nationwide failed.
</P>
<P>
   And the concealed-weapons issue has never before been put to a
statewide vote, so it is unclear how voters are going to react.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that we have voters with a lot of intensity,''
Feinstein said. ``But there are people on the other side who
opposed us from the start, too. The question is: How energized are
voters who have listened to both sides? I don't know where that
gray middle is. This is a weird one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many voters are probably confused. The campaign kicked off in
early January with a court fight over the ballot wording of the
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state's office drew up language so vague that
voters will have to read closely to know that the issue concerns
legalizing concealed firearms.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by a campaign filled with distortions about
what Proposition B would do and what might happen if it passes.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition B would allow people to obtain a permit to carry a
concealed firearm if they are at least 21 and have never been
convicted of a felony. They cannot have a misdemeanor conviction
involving a gun or a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   They can't be a known drunk, must never have been committed to a
mental institution, and must not have made threats or been violent
for the previous five years. They also must undergo 12 hours of
training.

OUT ON THE PRAIRIE, SCHOOL'S THREATENED CLOSING STIRS CONCERN

<P>
   KALVESTA, Kan. _ A fragment of Kansas has been put at risk with
the recent rumblings about shutting down Theoni School, 10 miles
west of Kalvesta on Kansas 156.
</P>
<P>
   It's a school with two classrooms, a library, an office and just
15 students. And it's a link to an all-but-forgotten time when
every three or four miles, in any direction, there were schools
like it.
</P>
<P>
   But today, schools in Kansas like Theoni can be counted on the
fingers of one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month the board of Unified School District 457 _
representing a 900-square-mile area encompassing Garden City and
environs _ will consider the fate of the beige-brick structure
that's been a landmark on the prairie for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   One topic will be money _ educating a Theoni child costs roughly
double the $3,700 a year spent on a Garden City student.
</P>
<P>
   The other _ one nobody disputes _ is isolation, Theoni being 37
miles from Dighton, 34 from Jetmore, 26 from Cimarron and 23 from
Garden City.
</P>
<P>
   In between are wheat fields, pastures, creek bottoms, low hills,
only occasional farmsteads and seemingly endless roads _ emptiness
to itinerants, revered homeland to residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going down without a fight,'' said Marlene Legg,
school secretary. ``I went to school here. My four kids went here.
I've worked here for 20 years. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Principal Willis Pracht figures the odds of Theoni's surviving
are about 50-50. He concedes that cost is a problem. On the other
hand, a survey shows that there are 23 preschool children
hereabouts waiting to become old enough to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago the only kids out here were farm kids,'' he
said. ``Just like they'd always been. But more and more, with the
way Garden City is growing, there are families who come out, rent
an old farmhouse or buy a couple of acres and put up with the drive
to town.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also a handful of nondistrict students. Parents in
southern Lane County drive their children to the Finney County-Lane
County line to meet the Theoni school bus. Theoni School is a darn
sight closer than driving all the way to Dighton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They promised us,'' said Legg. ``Way back before we
consolidated, we had old school districts 82 and 83. We had all
sorts of schools _ Ravanna, Eminence, Solid Rock, New Loyal,
Prairie Hope, Prairie Loa and Essex. Garden City said if we went in
with them, there'd always be a school out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mean to hold them to that. This is more than a school. It's
our community center, the place the fire department meets and where
people have dinners when relatives come. Why, we've even had dance
classes here. The PTA will draw 60 to 70 people, lots of them
without kids in school anymore. Doesn't matter. They still care.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Reed said her daughter, Sasha, a third-grader, would
face 11 hours a day on a bus or in school if Theoni closes. Those
hours looking out a bus window won't help her daughter's education.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's way too much for little kids,'' said Reed, who with her
husband, Henry, and two preschoolers lives in the northeastern
corner of the district _ 43 miles from Garden City.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In recent years, Kauffman Stadium, a jewel of
a facility when it opened in 1973, had fallen behind newer parks
such as Baltimore's Camden Yards, Cleveland's Jacobs Field and
Atlanta's Turner Field in offering fan amenities and generating
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   With new ballparks under construction in Seattle, Pittsburgh,
Houston, Detroit, San Francisco and Cincinnati _ not to mention
extensive renovations in St. Louis, and Oakland and Anaheim, Calif.
_ Kauffman Stadium was on the verge of turning into a relic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The renovations are critical,'' said Miles Prentice, who is
still awaiting major-league approval as the club's new owner. ``It
was in our overall consideration in the appraisal and evaluation we
did for the long-term viability that the stadium improvements were
absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stadiums today are successful in part because they are more
than just a new ballpark, it's a destination. I'm not going to say
the stadium is sterile. But there are a lot of things that can be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more phases of renovation, costing about $65 million, are on
the drawing board but still three to five years from fruition.
Those phases could include restaurants, a minitheater, a
reconfigured Stadium Club with more suites, and a permanent Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   So the Crown Seats and dugout suites are just the beginning in a
series of stadium upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to offer a different perspective of the ball game,''
said HOK Sports Facilities Group senior associate Ted Lopez,
project architect for the Kauffman Stadium renovation. ``The first
row of dugout suites is 54 feet to first base, and we figured
Muser, if he stands next to the stairs, he'd be about 80. It's
quite a perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the green wall behind home plate and 10 feet of foul
ground were removed in the project, creating a wide-open view from
behind home plate. All that separates those in the Crown Seats from
the field is a screen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proximity to the players will enable spectators to see beads
of sweat on the pitcher's brow and hear chatter on the field as
never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want that,'' Prentice said. ``They want to see the
sweating. It makes them feel more part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such intimacy has its price. The Royals hope to generate about
$1.5 million in revenue from the new seats.
</P>
<P>
   The 180 Crown Club seats, which cost $8,100 each on a season
basis (or $100 per person per game), were offered to existing
season-ticket holders on a seniority basis and sold out in three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The three rows of seats span from dugout to dugout. A stairway
leads from the seats down to the underground Crown Club, where
members can partake in a pregame buffet and full-service bar.
There's also a conference room to conduct meetings before, during
or after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Members can dine at tables and booths while watching the game on
a dozen television monitors, or they can order complimentary food
and beverages from their padded stadium seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get better seats than this,'' said Dan Saferstein,
president of Promotional Headwear, a Lenexa-based distributor of
baseball caps. ``I knew the whole premise of the dugout suites and
the Crown Seats was to generate revenue. I had to debate on the
price and whether it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I felt I had to give my two cents into our Royals
organization and keep them around. I try to rally the troops around
Kansas City to go to Royals games and try to support them. I've
been going for the last five years to games where there are under
10,000 people at Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the underdog, and this is a better time, when they
are underdogs, to get good seats.'' &QL;

LIGHTNING STRIKE LEFT ITS MARK ON TEEN-AGER

   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ When the weather is good, Katie Zemel
loves to run around in the grass near her Overland Park home and
kick a soccer ball with her friends.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal for most 15-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   But the last time Katie suited up for the Shawnee Mission South
High School soccer team, a lightning bolt knocked down everyone on
the field _ and stopped Katie's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, a year and a day after the lightning strike,
Katie planned to join her former teammates for a practice. She
changed her mind, though, deciding that the clouds looked too
similar to the ones carrying the thunderstorm that almost killed
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've recently been extra careful and really concerned about
the weather, and I want everyone else to be, too,'' Katie said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Shawnee Mission South was playing Blue Valley North High School
on March 30, 1998, when lightning struck the Blue Valley North
field. The bolt that hit Katie was the first lightning that
witnesses saw that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two women rushed from the stands and started cardiopulmonary
resuscitation on Katie. Doctors said the spectators' immediate
action was critical to her recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Physical therapists helped Katie relearn to sit up and walk. The
process picked up when she began to run last summer. Before too
long she was kicking a soccer ball again.
</P>
<P>
   Katie still is working to rebuild her short-term memory. She
remembers friends' names but has to look up their phone numbers.
She relies on a calendar on the refrigerator to remember when she
is meeting her friends to see a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary for me to write things down now, because
otherwise I wouldn't remember what I have to do or when I have to
do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last six weeks, Katie's memory has improved enough
for her to understand what she has gone through. And that improved
memory has brought new problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, she was just kind of unaware. She didn't have
a good grasp of what she couldn't do,'' said Phil Zemel, Katie's
father. ``Now, as time progresses, she's becoming more aware of the
things she can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie has difficulty remembering everyday things, such as where
her school locker is. For a while, she didn't remember that she
couldn't remember the common things.
</P>
<P>
   Now Katie remembers her daily frustrations. And that makes her
sad more often, her parents said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a sign of progress that her parents are glad to see.
With her improved memory, Katie also is aware of her own progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets a little easier every day,'' Katie said.
</P>
<P>
   Katie's experience is typical of people who have been struck by
lightning, said Steve Marshburn Sr., a North Carolina man who
founded Lightning Strike &AMP; Electric Shock Survivors International
after he was struck by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things frustrate us,'' he said. ``The big things,
we can deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightning strike victims often suffer mood swings and
personality changes, and they notice that their muscles don't seem
to work as well as they used to, Marshburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Katie's parents said their daughter continued to be polite and
eager to please. Phil Zemel thinks his daughter's reluctance to
bother people makes things tougher. She won't always ask for help
and seems frustrated when she can't do things on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Katie lives life more slowly since the lightning strike.
Deciding what to say takes longer now, and she moves a little
slower.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McMullen, the girls' head soccer coach at Shawnee Mission
South, is ready for Katie to start working out with her team again.
</P>
<P>
   Sports at Katie's school have become safer since the lightning
strike. The district bought lightning detectors, and all coaches
must be certified in CPR by fall. The changes were a result of
Katie's injury, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Blue Valley School District, the school now offers more
benefits to employees who learn CPR, officials are paged when storm
warnings are issued, and the district bought new lightning
detectors that will automatically page officials when a bolt
strikes, said Tom Trigg, assistant superintendent for
administrative services. Trigg expects the detectors to be
installed within a month.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City School District, coaches must know CPR and
games are supposed to stop when someone sees lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have offered Katie support. Her mother, Cathy Levin,
keeps two boxes full of cards that Katie has received, half of them
from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Burkhart, a Med-Act paramedic who helped rescue Katie,
visits occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice to see some good results for a change, because
not all the results are good,'' Burkhart said. ``She's got her
whole life ahead of her, and she's going to be all right.''

NEXT MOVE IS UNCLEAR IN TROUBLED BATTLE PLAN

   ... can shape the battlefield, strategists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Milosevic would've rolled all those Serb troops
through Kosovo, rounding up ethnic Albanians, if he knew our troops
were moving toward Belgrade?'' McInerney asked. ``No way.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a Republican presidential
prospect and former prisoner of the Vietnam War, agreed in a recent
column in /{USA Today/}: ``We must absolutely not rule out any
option, including ground troops. We cannot shrink from this, no
matter how awful the images of war appear on our televisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside _ as Clinton and his NATO partners know _ can be
colossal: human casualties. And as casualties mount, public support
weakens.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his strategy meetings with advisers, Clinton was so
firmly opposed to risking ground troops that the option ``never had
any traction,'' an unnamed senior White House official told /{The
Washington Post/} last week.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that Clinton expressly ruled out ground
forces in October, when NATO military analysts produced a study
that estimated it would take as many as 200,000 allied troops to
occupy all of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a complete eye-roller,'' the White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate for just taking Kosovo was 75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Should Clinton change his mind now, analysts say a large force
of combat troops could not be prepared to move into Yugoslavia for
weeks _ perhaps two or three months. And even the most hawkish
observers question whether Clinton and the other political leaders
of NATO have the stuff to put so many lives in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not entrust the lives of our troops to the political
leadership of this mission,'' Perle said. ``It's a terrible thing
to say, but the command of this operation should be pushed out and
replaced by people who know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem isn't so much in the leadership or in the
mission, Abenheim insisted; it's in the public's mind-set.
America's ``cult of planning'' and its reverence for high
technology have given rise to expectations that wars can be won in
swift, precise and painless fashion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disconnect'' from real warfare, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative to a NATO ground assault is to supply arms to
the Kosovo Liberation Army, a guerrilla force that has not been
much of a factor in slowing the Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   A KLA commander pleaded for help last week in an interview with
/{Newsday/}: ``If the U.S. really wants to help us, they should
provide us with arms and not just empty words.''
</P>
<P>
   This option has emerged as a politically expedient step that
keeps U.S. soldiers from ending up in body bags. It also gives
Kosovo rebels ``a chance to fight back,'' in the words of
Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the drawbacks: The KLA has little training in handling
sophisticated equipment, and putting more weapons in the hands of
ethnic Albanian guerrillas could mean more instability in bordering
areas, such as Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Face-saving peace plan
</P>
<P>
   Only one option makes sense to Susan L. Woodward, who worked in
the United Nations' peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way to save face,'' said Woodward, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of /{Balkan
Tragedy: Chaos and Dissolution After the Cold War/}. ``Go to the
negotiating table, pursue some kind of reasonable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, she said, negotiations at this stage would not
produce the results NATO had in mind _ that is, more autonomy for
Kosovo and the presence of peacekeeping forces there, as stressed
in the proposal worked out earlier this year in Rambouillet,
France.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ethnic Albanians who were terrorized and ousted from
Kosovo would find it hard to return to the Serbian province as if
nothing had taken place these past several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like (Milosevic) is looking for a solution he can
live with, where the Serbs say, `We'll take this, you take that,'
'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians who once made up 90 percent of the Kosovar
population may have to settle in designated portions of the
province _ independent of Serbia but under the protection of
international peacekeepers. In this scenario, NATO walks away
claiming victory, even if it falls far short of the initial
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mission's current problems, Woodward said, ``There
were a number of us in Washington who were predicting exactly what
has happened. How could anyone not expect this?
</P>
<P>
   ``For Serb nationalists, this is a fight against the injustice
they feel has been imposed on them for centuries. Theirs is a
culture in which the idea of a lost battle fought is better than
not fighting at all.''
</P>
<P>
   If and when that fighting ever ends, can the Serbs and their
ethnic rivals possibly live together?
</P>
<P>
   Many observers think not. But Teresa Crawford _ who has been
there _ thinks co-existence in Kosovo is possible, despite the
agony and anger etched into the faces of Kosovars now leaving their
own borders.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was expelled by Serbian authorities in March 1998 after
she and other members of a California-based human rights
organization counseled Serbs and ethnic Albanians in conflict
resolution. Crawford's group was sponsored by the independent
student union at the University of Pristina in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were my age, 24, and we'd sit down to dinner and discuss
these matters. Serbian students and Albanian students,'' said
Crawford, who is now a university fellow in the Maxwell School of
Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. ``They
didn't obsess on what happened back in 1389. They wanted a
future.''

   The options appear to be few. The (BEGIN ITALICS)good(END
ITALICS) options, almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO ratchet up its air attacks on Yugoslavia in hopes
that President Slobodan Milosevic, envisioning his land reduced to
ashes, might beg for mercy?
</P>
<P>
   Should President Clinton reverse himself and send in ground
troops, signaling what could be a long, bloody and unpopular
battle?
</P>
<P>
   Or should all nations now deep in Yugoslavia's violent quagmire
cut a deal with Milosevic to pull themselves out _ no matter how
unworkable that deal may be?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are debating such scenarios with great passion, though
they offer no sure-fire formulas. Last week, the only words that
resonated with certainty among U.S. military and foreign-policy
thinkers were those spoken by the 19th-century strategist Helmuth
von Moltke:
</P>
<P>
   ``No plan survives contact with the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's plan, experts say, clearly is in trouble. Some say it was
doomed from the start. As it's unfolded these past 10 days, the
bombing of Yugoslavia has only provoked Serb forces to step up
their removal of ethnic Albanians from the southern province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point there is no good outcome,'' said Richard Perle,
an assistant secretary of defense during the Reagan administration.
``At this point we're faced with trying to secure the least
damaging outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others argue that all this talk of outcomes and ``end
games'' defies the unpredictable ways of war _ especially when the
fighting isn't yet two weeks along. Clinton echoed this at his news
conference Friday, when he called for patience and reiterated his
belief that increased air strikes stood a ``good chance'' of
bringing success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to play itself out in the way the phrase `end
game' suggests,'' said NATO expert Donald Abenheim. ``The reality
of war is that you need to improvise. There are many, many
different ways this thing could turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the best guesses of analysts:
</P>
<P>
   Escalated air strikes
</P>
<P>
   According to NATO officials, limited air strikes already have
seriously damaged Yugoslavia's air defenses and hurt the Serbs'
ability to wage war with Kosovar rebels _ or, for that matter, with
NATO. The White House last week endorsed bombing on a broader
scale, and government buildings in the capital of Belgrade soon
were ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign, some experts think, should keep U.S.
casualties low and eventually make clear to Milosevic that his
beloved Serbia may become a cratered wasteland. This realization in
time will bring him to the table on NATO's terms, the White House
argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's asking for it,'' said Abenheim at the Hoover Institution.
``He's asking to be beaten up, and the results could be ghastly.''
</P>
<P>
   Total destruction, however, is a hard strategy to justify,
especially when NATO's mission is supposed to be a humanitarian
one. Observers say a more likely scenario would have bombs directed
at some commercial as well as military complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, meanwhile, hedges to see if the American public _
after seeing video clip after video clip of sad refugees _ will
accept more aggressive action against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton will wait until the public opinion shifts,'' said
Michael Gary Roskin, a Lycoming College political science professor
who has written several books and articles on Balkan conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If public opinion doesn't shift, that means the air war
continues _ but not without some contingency plans. Rest assured,
they're being dusted off right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign to date has failed to help the Kosovars.
Hundreds of thousands of them have been driven out of the province
as NATO planes soar high overhead, unable in bad weather to strike
Serb forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the activity in the air has been modest when compared with
the campaign over Iraq during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Iraq
faced as many as 1,000 sorties in a day; the average in Yugoslavia
has been less than a tenth of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're hitting only 20 targets a day, that doesn't carry
the shock that we delivered on Iraq,'' said retired Air Force Gen.
Thomas McInerney of the Business Executives for National Security,
a Pentagon watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a piecemeal commitment, you get piecemeal results. This
gradualism in the air strikes has given Milosevic all the chances
in the world to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Ground troops
</P>
<P>
   A legion of military analysts, including McInerney, argues that
the Clinton administration should never have ruled out the use of
ground forces to counter the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we may not have any choice,'' McInerney said.
</P>
<P>
   Using ground troops with a potent air campaign can shape the
battlefield, strategists say.

AS DOWNLOADING GAINS, RECORDING INDUSTRY SCRAMBLES TO PROTECT ITS
RIGHTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Ga., Ohio)   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late last year, Glen Richards, a 37-year-old former computer
programmer on disability, decided to make his extensive collection
of 78 rpm jazz records from the 1920s available online at no cost
to other enthusiasts. He created a Web site and began converting
his records into computer files using a method of digital
compression known as MP3, which allows music to be sent quickly and
freely over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Richards knew that listening to music via MP3 files was popular
with college students, much to the consternation of the recording
industry. But he was unsure whether anyone else had the computer
power and interest in downloading MP3 files of obscure jazz tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Half a year later, some 4,000 people had visited Richards' small
site. Visitors from as far away as Yugoslavia, Croatia, Peru,
Israel, Turkey, Malaysia and New Zealand were downloading music,
among them an office worker looking for music for his mother and a
well-known animator in his 80s who lives in the Czech Republic. As
for the legality of it all, Richards conceded, ``It's definitely a
gray area.''
</P>
<P>
   For the music business, the message is clear: downloading music
from the Internet is moving off of college campuses and into the
general population, into offices and, in some cases, homes.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago the typical MP3 user was perceived as an
insomniac college hacker. Nowadays he is Dilbert. ``The college
focus is probably not entirely accurate,'' said Michael Robinson,
the chief executive officer of MP3.com, which offers free songs for
download from 7,000 most unsigned bands. Responding to a query via
e-mail, he continued, ``The real story is that MP3 has incredibly
quickly evolved into a full-blown mainstream movement.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, to wide surprise, the most popular file to be
downloaded from MP3.com was a classical music composition,
Beethoven's ``Moonlight Sonata,'' performed by Richard Morris, a
66-year-old pianist from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The piece has been downloaded almost 100,000 times in the
previous month _ mostly from Internet addresses in corporate
offices and and government organizations, according to the music's
producer, Mike Wathen. All this for an album that a reviewer in
``American Record Guide'' called the ``worst record'' he'd ``heard
in years.''
</P>
<P>
   A classical album is considered a substantial success if it
sells 70,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   For recording companies, the embrace of MPS is happening too
fast and too soon. The rapid acceptance of listening to music as
MP3 files (which are almost CD quality) instead of on actual CDs
has caught them unprepared. Anyone with a decent Internet
connection can easily download, for free and within minutes,
software to play MP3 files, programs to convert songs from CDs into
MP3 files and the music itself, which is mostly free and easy to
find online. Industry analysts expect that a million portable
Internet music players will be sold by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where it can cite copyright infringement, the recording
industry is countering by shutting down hundreds of unauthorized
sites a week through lawsuits and legal demands. Meanwhile, it is
racing to develop by the holiday season a system of downloading
music that protects against unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson of MP3.com, which like most legitimate sites offering
free downloads makes its money through advertising and selling
consumer marketing information, has noticed that the peak time that
music is listened to on his site is now 1 p.m. Weekend downloads
have dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, suggests office workers are looking for music
during lunch. He added that less than five percent of the music
downloaded on his site, where some one million songs are downloaded
a week, comes from school e-mail addresses. This is a trend
confirmed by another popular site for music downloads, a2bmusic,
which uses a more sophisticated digital compression system known as
AAC. Educational servers have dropped to just seven percent of
traffic and peak downloading hours are from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Recording Industry Association of America, a
trade group representing the major record labels, the problem is
that copying and sharing CDs with a large group has suddenly become
far too easy. Although there are sites where music by 7,000 mostly
unsigned acts can be downloaded legally at no cost or for a small
fee), there are also thousands of computer users distributing their
favorite CD, bootleg tape or even new, unreleased material from an
artist in the same way that they used to trade cassette tapes, all
at no charge. Behind every unauthorized download there are a few
pennies is missed royalties for songwriters and record labels.
</P>
<P>
   In a recently released survey on music consumption, the
recording industry association claimed that a drop in the
proportion of music purchases made by 15-to-24 year-olds could have
been due to the ``availability of free MP3 files,'' though Hillary
Rosen, the association's president, has since claimed that there is
no hard data to support this assertion, which was made in the
release without her consent.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of downloading music, however, say that it is not
unauthorized music copying that has the industry upset, but rather
the fear that if any musician could send music around the world
instantly on the Internet, the recording companies would lose
control of music distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record establishment thinks they know everything, but
they've miscalculated,'' said Wathen, 46, of the Richard Morris CD
he produced. ``I think this MP3 stuff is going to destroy the music
distribution system that's so entrenched in the United States. The
fear is not about piracy: its about somebody like me. I spent $7000
on that CD, and I can get around all their mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the CD has only sold 100 copies, Wathen considers the
CD a success because it promoes his new system for attaching piano
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, the major record labels and technology companies
convened the Secure Digital Music Initiative with the intention of
setting an industry-wide standard for downloading music in time for
the Christmas shopping season, with compatible products available
so that music could be distributed online with profits intact. The
system would likely be a higher fidelity compression method which
it hopes will lead people away from using the unrestricted MP3
format.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the music business is faced with the absence of
a legitimate digital music market coupled with a growing audience
interested in downloading MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, Wonoh Kim, a 30-year-old student at Georgia
Tech, searched for holiday music in MP3 form for his daughter. He
had no luck. By next Christmas, all that will have changed. Online
record companies like Goodnoise, one of the main legitimate sites
charging consumers for downloading rock and pop songs, are
branching out. ``Our initial market was the 18-to-25 crowd,'' said
Gene Hoffman, the president of Goodnoise. ``But now we're changing
our name from Goodnoise to Emusic.com. We are doing that to offer
other genres for fans of jazz or swing or classical. Emusic
classical is a name that will work, whereas Goodnoise classical
would sound strange.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Frank Creighton, the RIAA's associate director, has been
watching as music downloading grows. He noted that in 1997, 60
percent of the sites they shut down were from colleges and
universities and 40 percent were from other Internet service
providers. Now, he said, that number has flip-flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Most violators have not been punished, but a few repeat
offenders selling music online without permission have been slapped
with civil lawsuits and fined _ or, in the extreme case of a
company in Houston that sold every Beatles album compressed onto a
single CD as MP3 files, brought up on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The record business has tried unsuccessfully to get a
preliminary injunction banning the first portable MP3 player, a
Walkman-like device the size of a deck of cards made by Diamond
Multimedia, claiming that it encourages piracy. In the industry's
latest move, three major labels asked the Norwegian police to
prosecute a company that provided data to a popular MP3 locater
developed by the search engine Lycos. (In America, the recording
association is hoping to reach an amicable settlement by asking
Lycos to direct consumers only to legitimate sites.)
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the prosecution in Norway would be the equivalent of
prosecuting a telephone company for listing escort services in its
Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry has even moved against some of its stars,
including the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Less Than Jake. They
have all been forced by their recording companies to take down MP3
files posted without label permission. Last month, Warner Bros.
withhheld its support when Tom Petty, put a song from his
forthcoming album on the Internet and received 150,000 downloads in
two days.
</P>
<P>
   One person who has experienced the offensive is 20-year-old
Justin Trinkes. Before he dropped out of Virginia Tech last year,
he received a call from a school administrator telling him that the
Recording Industry Association of America had demanded that he shut
down his site dedicated to the Dave Matthews Band because he posted
two illegal MP3s. Trinkes took the site off-line for four days,
then started it again when the coast seemed clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my hall there were 30 to 40 people, and most of them were
running MP3 sites,'' he said. ``That upset me more than anything
because here I am getting busted for two songs while the guy next
to me has gigabytes and gigabytes of illegal MP3s of popular
bands.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rosen, the president of the Recording Industry
Association of America, maintained the situation was not out of
hand and that within two years there would only be one way to get
music off the Internet, the copyright-protected way. She cited a
recent survey by Soundata, a national music consumer study group
that sends questionnaires to 2000 active music consumers, which
reported that only seven percent of its study group had heard of
MP3. However, Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research,
a market research company, fully 30 percent of the 13-million
online shoppers are willing to download music, and another 35
percent can easily be converted in coming years to MP3 or other
more advanced systems that are likely to surpass it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Rosen said she was optimistic. ``I'm not Chicken
Little about this,'' she said. ``I still believe that the real
online music market is coming and MP3 hasn't taken away our
opportunity to get it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The online chat last Tuesday began like others on MSNBC, with
the host introducing the featured guest to an Internet audience
logged in from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Except that this guest was Arkan, the notorious Serbian
paramilitary leader who is believed to be responsible for some of
the worst atrocities of the Bosnian war and who is reportedly now
back in action in Kosovo. And even for some of MSNBC's most
frequent chatters, the greeting scrolling across their computer
screens was surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, it's good to be here,'' it read. ``We are under the
bombing umbrella, but we're alive. I'm ready to take your questions
now!''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Internet is personalizing the war in
Yugoslavia for Americans. Accounts from Kosovo circulate on e-mail,
chat rooms offer interaction with all sides and online polls invite
voting on what to do next. But issues of ethics and taste are
arising that underscore the double-edged nature of the Internet's
celebrated immediacy and lack of space limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all still trying to figure out what to do with this
medium so when you get into a war like this you try out a lot of
new things,'' said Robert Leavitt, associate director of New York
University's Center for War Peace and the News Media. ``The problem
is you want to use all these tools and we've not thought through
what's appropriate and what's useful.''
</P>
<P>
   At MSNBC, the decision to put Arkan online _ which elicited a
raft of angry e-mail _ came only after an internal debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt you put him on television and give him a general
interest news questioner, there's a bigger chance of him pulling
the wool over your eyes,'' said Michael Moran, the Web site's
international editor. ``We exposed him to the wrath of people who
know him and know what he did, as well as people who probably
admire him.'
</P>
<P>
   The day after Arkan's appearance, the international war crimes
tribunal announced that it had indicted him, and he has since
appeared on several television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that whatever benefits the Internet offers by
removing traditional journalistic filters may be outweighed by
sacrificing traditional journalistic context.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he should be censored,'' said Patrick Ball, a
human rights activist. ``But I don't think he should be put in a
chat room where his words can take on the authority of coming from
anyone other than a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Donohue, MSNBC's chat producer, who relayed the questions
to Arkan by phone and transcribed his answers for the cyberspace
audience, said he sifted through more than 1,000 questions
submitted in the 30-minute chat session and tried to cover a
variety of subjects. ``There were several questions about genocide,
about what was happening to the men in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The one question we didn't get to was, ``Do you have a
girlfriend?'' That one always comes up, it's a good make-them-smile
question. I wanted to get to it, but we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who both participated in MSNBC's chat and watched the
television interviews with Arkan offer a glimpse at the different
effect of the mediums. ``When I saw him on TV I turned him off
because he sounded a little over the edge,'' said Carol Joy, 57, of
Delray Beach, Fla. ``But in chat when you're just reading his
statements I saw him in a totally different light. I became furious
with our government for invading his territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are logging on to the Internet to get news about the
war in numbers that have surprised many online editors. With most
reporters banned from Kosovo, people may be turning to the Internet
for alternative sources. For instance, Slate, Microsoft's online
magazine, is publishing anonymous e-mail accounts from a reporter
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the difference the Web can make,'' said Michael
Kinsley, Slate's editor. ``Unless they want to shut down the whole
telephone system they can't stop information from getting out, or
getting back in.''
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail has its pros and cons. When the independent radio
station in Kosovo was closed down last month, Leavitt, who
publishes a respected international news Web site called Global
Beat, was able to send out an alert before the wire services.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later he received two dozen e-mail messages
containing contradictory information on the fate of journalists and
negotiators believed killed in Kosovo. ``You have great difficulty
in trying to figure out what is credible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To supplement its coverage, ABCNEWS.com has been publishing
e-mail journals. ``These people are not technically journalists,''
said Mary Bruno, executive producer of the ABC site. ``These are
people wishing they had a cigarette. But that's what is really
unique to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At Time magazine's Web site, Time.com, foreign correspondents in
the Balkans leave messages on an answering machine, and an online
editor can work the information into a story. The site, which
initiated an ``ask Time'' feature about Yugoslavia, last week
received 5,000 e-mailed questions about Yugoslavia in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling _ and sometimes confusing _ war news
on the Internet circulates in the form of e-mails from people in
Kosovo or on its borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all happening so fast it's hard to process,'' said Albert
Cevallos, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, a human
rights organization. ``We're flooded with e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stuff I've seen and read is just overwhelming. You
stop and stare at your computer screen and you have to take a walk
outside.''

JUDGING BY THE BOOKS, PEOPLE DO SO COOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I've got one of your earlier cookbooks,'' an acquaintance
remarked recently. ``It looks like it erupted from Mount St.
Helens.''
</P>
<P>
   Good. That's the way cookbooks are supposed to look.
</P>
<P>
   The Butte Heritage Cookbook might be an extreme example. The day
it arrived in the mail, the binding began to crack. Now, whenever
you open it, pages become detached and flutter to the floor. The
spine of the book is in tatters. The pages that have been shuffled
back into their approximate location are spattered with tomato
sauce, smudged with cocoa, flecked with ancient curry. It's a
terrific cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbooks that look as pristine today as they were when they
arrived on your coffee table three years ago are to be approached
with caution and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   There's another funny thing about cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   We hear that nobody needs them any more. More and more young
couples are fully employed, too tired, too disinterested to cook up
something from scratch when they arrive home at night. They send
out for pizzas, or bring home frozen pies, we are told. Full meals
are prepared for takeout from supermarket deli counters. Fast food
franchise restaurants line our streets and boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   But next time you visit a bookstore, take a look at their
cookbook sections. Every five years they seem to double in size and
variety. The online book seller amazon.com has enough cookbooks in
stock to feed South America and Asia for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are a whole lot of closet cooks out there.
</P>
<P>
   Cookery allows the creative (and gastric) juices to flow. Most
kitchen projects last far less than one hour. And when each project
is completed, you can feed it to your kids, your sweetheart, the
next-door neighbors or you can hide behind the fridge and eat it
all yourself.
</P>
<P>
   These recipes are a perfect fit for cooks just coming out of the
closet.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Cauliflower
</P>
<P>
   1 cauliflower
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups cubed ham
</P>
<P>
   1 11-ounce can condensed cheddar cheese soup
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup Bisquick baking mix
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons firm butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons shredded cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Paprika
</P>
<P>
   Cut the core out of the cauliflower and feed it to your gerbil.
Place the remaining pieces or florets into a steamer and cook until
the cauliflower is fork tender. Don't overcook. You should have
about four cups of cauliflower. Drain well then dump into an
ungreased baking dish. Sprinkle with ham.
</P>
<P>
   Beat soup and milk with a hand mixer until smooth. Pour over the
ham.
</P>
<P>
   With a pastry blender cut the butter into the Bisquick until
crumbly. Stir in the shredded cheese and nutmeg and sprinkle over
the casserole. Sprinkle heavily with paprika.
</P>
<P>
   Shove the casserole into a 400-degree oven and cook for about 25
minutes, or until golden brown on top. This should serve four.
</P>
<P>
   Another Cookbook Chicken
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup sun-dried tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons oil from the sun-dried tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   8 chicken thighs, skinned
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 large cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup Wondra flour
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup freshly chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   You can use sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil, purchased by the
jar. Or, if you are using the dry product, cover the tomatoes with
hot water and let sit 5 minutes. Drain then mix with olive oil.
This mixture can sit for an hour or all day.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 3 tablespoons of the tomato olive oil into a large skillet.
Heat, then add the chicken thighs. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Turn the thighs when golden on the bottom, sprinkle with salt and
pepper again and cook until the other side is golden brown, too.
Remove the thighs to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   To the oil still in the pan add the onion, garlic, the crumbled
basil and red pepper flakes. Cook until the onion softens. Add the
mushrooms and stir-cook 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into the pan the red wine, chicken broth and the tomato
paste. Mix well, then return chicken to the pan and let it simmer
covered 25 to 30 minutes or until the thighs are no longer red
inside when cut with a sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   When done remove the chicken to a warm platter. Mix the Wondra
flour with just enough water to make a smooth paste. Stir this mess
into the pan liquids and stir-cook until the sauce thickens. You
can use more flour if needed. Check to see if the sauce needs more
salt and pepper. Add the parsley and pour the whole schmear over
the chicken pieces.
</P>
<P>
   This should serve four literary critics, accompanied by some
rice or noodles.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. _ During recess one recent morning, 35 second
graders squirmed with glee in the Watchung School auditorium at the
prospect of receiving their own disposable cameras and a creative
assignment: recording their lives and tastes through photographs
and words.
</P>
<P>
   The homework _ filling out a 27-page booklet called ``My All
About Me Journal'' _ was not handed out by teachers at this public
elementary school in the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the assignment, given to some 250 Watchung students,
came from researchers for Noggin, a new educational channel that
forged a special partnership with the school earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for $7,100, which the school has put toward buying
30 classroom word processors, Noggin can go into the school one
morning a week from January until June to run 30-minute focus
groups with students. The researchers may also observe the children
in class or have them do an assignment. The purpose, in the words
of one Noggin researcher, is to find out ``what sparks kids these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is nothing new about partnerships between schools
looking for money and businesses looking to corner the youth
market, companies like Noggin have taken the relationship to a new
level, using children as captive, if willing, subjects of market
research during the school day. Hard numbers do not exist, but
product research companies and advertising agencies say they have
signed up dozens of schools in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics think focus groups are out of place in schools, but
the partnerships are proliferating nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   At Cumberland Elementary School in Lansing, Mich., students have
taken time, occasionally class time, to participate in several
focus groups in each of the past four years. The students took
taste tests and answered opinion polls, earning from $2,000 to
$4,000 a year for the school.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's, a Catholic elementary school in Shawnee Mission,
Kan., has received about $1,000 this year for allowing students to
take part in Internet panels in which they answer questions over
the school computer. The school uses the money for extras like ice
cream parties or the petty-cash fund.
</P>
<P>
   And in Lynnfield, Mass., students at Our Lady of Assumption
elementary school spent two days last week taste-testing cereal and
answering an opinion poll that included questions about where they
got their news (Television? Radio? Their parents?) and what
television shows they liked.
</P>
<P>
   The principal, Martha Marie Pooler, compared the cereal
taste-test, for which the school received $600, to conducting a
science-class experiment. ``It's a learning experience,'' she said.
``They had to read, they had to look, they had to compare.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the partners to these deals _ companies,
school officials, teachers, parents and children _ are happy with
them. ``Our budget has been very tight in the past few years,''
said Rita Miragliotta, the Watchung School principal, who sought
parent and teacher approval before accepting Noggin's offer. ``If
we want extras, we have to be creative about ways to raise money.
And the children really seem to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the heads of other schools doing focus groups, Mrs.
Miragliotta says the deal with Noggin has been a boon. The new
channel, a joint venture of Nickelodeon and the Children's
Television Workshop, is a 24-hour, commercial-free educational
channel whose revenues come from subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Watchung students usually participate during recess. And the
children, Mrs. Miragliotta said, are learning some analytical
thinking _ and even computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   In-school focus groups are just one instance of the growing
corporate presence in public and private education. In recent
years, about 100 school districts have accepted profit-making
companies as sponsors or advertisers, according to the Education
Commission of the States, a Denver-based nonprofit group that
studies education issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Eanes Independent School District in Austin, Texas, sold
exclusive vending rights to Coca-Cola for $350,000 a year. For
selling similar rights to Pepsico, the Jefferson County School
District near Denver received $2.1 million over seven years, plus
$48,000 a year in scholarships. And New York City and Colorado
Springs now sell ad space on school buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increased level of sophistication with how
corporations are approaching schools,'' said the development
director of a New York City private school, who spoke on the
condition that he not be named out of concern that he would
jeopardize potential partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of paid polling in school is raising some criticism,
even among those who consider focus groups less offensive than
outright marketing to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that there should be some places left, like
school, where the kids are not targeted,'' said Marcie Wyant, a
consumer-science teacher at the Boynton Middle School in Ithaca,
N.Y., and one of a growing number of teachers who try to make
students aware of consumerism, commercialism and media literacy.
``Focus groups just shouldn't be done during taxpayer time.''
</P>
<P>
   David Walsh, president of the National Institute of Media and
the Family, a nonprofit group based in Minnesota, agreed.
``Whenever we cross the line of allowing commercial enterprises to
do their work during the school day on school time, I think it
raises questions,'' he said. ``The challenge here is, where do you
draw the line?''
</P>
<P>
   In October, the National Association of State Boards of
Education tried to draw the line by passing a set of principles to
help guide schools as they enter such partnerships. Among the eight
principles is the statement: ``Selling or providing access to a
captive audience in the classroom for commercial purposes is
exploitation and a violation of the public trust.''

 MONTCLAIR: public trust.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   State boards are free to set their own policies, and some did
with advent of Channel One, a company that provides free
televisions and broadcasts programs _ and commercials _ into
classrooms. Many school officials said they were not aware of the
national association's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it has dawned on product researchers that schools are
an ideal place to do their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to the realization in the corporate sector
that the education marketplace offers tremendous potential to sell
products and to gain access to the youth market, and through that
to the adult market,'' said Robert Reynolds, president of Education
Market Resources, a Kansas-based research company founded six years
ago that matches schools with corporate research projects. Its
clients include Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., Kellogg Co. and
Nabisco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds took care to distinguish between the companies
themselves and the firms that do research for them. ``Most
companies to this day do not think they can go into schools, and in
most cases they cannot,'' he said. ``If McDonalds was to approach
schools, a lot of people would perceive them as exploiting the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers convert their work into ``an educational
process'' for the children, Reynolds said, and they do not mention
which companies they are doing research for. In one recent project
for Nike, he said, his researchers gave children disposable cameras
and asked them to take pictures of their favorite place to hang
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids these days love the feeling of empowerment,'' he said.
``And we are empowering them, but we are doing it in a proper
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Lalley, a planning director at the Leo Burnett Co., a
Chicago-based advertising agency, said her agency had also begun
running focus groups inside schools in recent years. Less than a
year ago, Ms. Lalley said, the company created a special unit,
called KidLeo, to focus on marketing for children.
</P>
<P>
   At Watchung School about half the parents did not sign
permission slips, so their children do not participate in the
market research. A handful of those parents said they did not
approve of the program, and one wrote Mrs. Miragliotta to protest.
</P>
<P>
   That parent, John C. Fisher, called the focus groups blatant
commercialism. ``I think it's exploitative,'' Fisher said. He is a
vice president for HBO Downtown Productions, whose parent company,
Time Warner Inc., competes with Nickelodeon's parent, Viacom Inc.
Partly because of that potential conflict, Fisher would not allow
his children to take part in the research. But also he said, ``I
don't think this is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan J. Stohr, head of Watchung's School Review, a parent
advisory board, said that so far, the Noggin partnership had been a
positive experience. ``I would be very cautious of anything that
took away from curriculum time,'' said Ms. Stohr, who has two
children at the school. ``But this really hasn't. Beyond that, I
think exposure to this type of thing can be very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the students participating, 7-year-old Katherine
Carpenter, said she thought the Noggin projects ``look fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And Noggin executives said that their mission was simply to do
research to provide a better, more appealing educational channel
for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have programming that is highly appropriate for
children,'' said Tom Ascheim, general manager for Noggin. ``Our
mission is to serve kids' natural urge to learn. And we want to do
that by creating a place where learning is driven by them.''

   VIRUS FAILS TO BOLSTER COMPANIES THAT FIGHT IT
</P>
<P>
   Reports of a widespread new computer virus could once be counted
on to give a lift to the stock prices of companies that develop
software vaccinations. But publicity surrounding the Melissa virus
last week did not nudge the shares of most companies at all.
</P>
<P>
   The market for anti-virus software, which is installed on about
75 percent of business computers, is becoming saturated, which
means few people will rush out and buy the software. In addition,
for giant American players like Symantec and Network Associates,
anti-virus software is just one of several products, meaning that
the potential revenue opportunities from battling a new virus are
diluted across a broad product line.
</P>
<P>
   NPR VENTURE IS SEEN AS A THREAT
</P>
<P>
   The United States' public radio stations are coming under new
pressure from National Public Radio to behave more like commercial
stations. NPR, which provides a significant portion of daily
broadcasts for many public stations, recently struck a deal with
its largest affiliate to develop an online network. Some local
stations see that as a threat that could siphon listeners from
their broadcasts. Compounding the stations' worries is an Oct. 1
deadline, when NPR will begin charging stations for its programming
based on a station's audience size instead of its operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   HIDDEN COSTS OF ONLINE SHOPPING
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be developing clicker shock as retailers lure
customers with promises of low prices up front, which are often
offset by high back-end charges for shipping. E-commerce sites say
their motives are not duplicitous, citing technological hurdles and
their unwillingness to bog down shoppers by asking too early for
data that determine shipping costs.

<P>
   EX-MAYOR REPACKAGING COLUMNS
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Edward Koch of New York is seizing the opportunity
to needle the current occupant of City Hall with the publication of
a collection of newspaper columns titled ``Giuliani, Nasty Man.''
The book will include about 20 columns that appeared in The New
York Daily News and The New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   REVAMPING INTERNET'S NAME GAME
</P>
<P>
   Faced with mounting disputes about Internet addresses and
complaints from trademark holders, a U.N. agency is completing a
proposal for bringing order to the chaotic assignment of addresses
in cyberspace. Current rules have led to trademark disputes, such
as the one involving pokey.org. Prema Toy, which holds the
trademarks to the well-known Gumby and Pokey bendable toys, tried
to seize the domain name last year, even though it was registered
to a teen-ager in Pennsylvania. The proposal will also deal with
speculators who stockpile addresses with hopes of selling them
later.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions, which assigns Internet addresses, purged
18,000 registrations that it suspected were held by speculators.
</P>
<P>
   David Talbott, the editor and founder of the online magazine
Salon, has persuaded the owner of the Internet address
www.salon.com to sell the name. Talbott is counting on the Internet
address, a national advertising campaign, a newly designed site and
a larger staff to help attract more visitors.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. PATENT OFFICE IN TRANSITION
</P>
<P>
   The Patent and Trademark Office is in transition after the
resignation late last year of its commissioner, Bruce Lehman. The
agency's acting commissioner, Todd Dickinson, seems eager to smooth
over relations with often vocal independent inventor groups.

<P>
   Religious leaders around the country used their Easter morning
sermons Sunday to condemn the hostilities in Yugoslavia and lead
prayers for the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians who have
been driven from their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In many churches, they made no distinctions in ascribing blame
for the conflict, chastising the Serbian regime for its repressive
tactics and NATO allies for its bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Columba Episcopal Church in Northwest Washington, the
Rev. James M. Donald wove events in the Balkans into a message
about the need to look inward to achieve peace and salvation,
rather than blaming someone else for the lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   For so many people, he said, ``the solution to our problems is
to get rid of them,'' he said, offering as examples ``gated
communities'' and ``a small dose of ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   But his apparent criticism was not limited to Slobodan
Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, who has been blamed for the
systematic removal of the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp rebuke of NATO's strategy to bomb Serbian leaders
into submission, Donald questioned those who think that using
``great arsenals to escalate the violence incrementally somehow
makes things better.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 4,500 people at a morning service at St.
Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, Cardinal John O'Connor also
criticized both sides. Last Wednesday, he and the seven other
American Cardinals wrote to President Clinton and Milosevic, asking
them to halt military actions during Holy Week, a plea that was
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot bring peace by driving hundreds of thousands of
people into misery, refugees, many now starving, suffering horribly
with no homes, with many members of their family ill with no place
to go,'' O'Connor told his congregants. ``We cannot find peace this
way, not peace with justice. Nor can we find peace and justice
simply through bombs. Life does not come from killing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Episcopal All Saints Church in Pasadena, Calif., the Rev.
Ed Bacon, who has been strongly critical of NATO actions in recent
sermons, drew direct aim at the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   After prayers that were dedicated to Kosovo refugees and to the
three captured American soldiers in Serbia, and special donations
for Kosovo refugees were collected, he lashed out at U.S. policy in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been deeply disturbed by what I consider nothing more
than propaganda and deception when the leaders of the United States
have justified our bombing campaigns as the only alternative to
`standing by and doing nothing in the face of ethnic cleansing,'''
Bacon told his congregation. ``Whenever bombing is couched as the
only alternative a nation has, implicit in that bombing is a tacit
admission that the leaders have run out of ideas and they have
become complicit with the oldest, the least creative, and the most
destructive and evil solution for human conflict, making war.''
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners were encouraged to write their thoughts about the
conflict on a message board outside the church so they could be
sent to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering the sermon at Harvard University's Memorial Church,
the Rev. Peter J. Gomes drew a parallel between death and suffering
in the Balkans and the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually heard someone ask, `Isn't it a pity that Kosovo
will spoil Easter this year?''' Gomes said. ``And the point of view
was not so much that Easter would be spoiled for the poor Kosovars,
but that this image of death, destruction and violence would spoil
our Easter, our images of Easter quiet and tranquility. That  &UR; we &LR; 
would be disturbed by the sounds and sights of an imperfect
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are quite used to the sounds and sights of an imperfect
world, you and I,'' he added. ``We are realists. We know that death
and suffering are real.''
</P>
<P>
   At one of the largest Presbyterian churches in the country, the
Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, the Rev. Steve Bacon used
events in Kosovo as a backdrop to pose timeless questions about
good, evil and the roles played by God and Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   He urged faith, even when atrocities cause the most faithful to
question whether there is a God, and if there is, how such evil can
persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evil seems to have run amok, and we feel powerless to do
anything,'' he said. ``The way it seems in our world is that Jesus
is missing. We affirm that Jesus conquered evil and yet the
situation in Kosovo is such an evidence of rampant evil in our
society, today, that it causes us to even wonder if the
resurrection was true. And what I wanted to affirm is that it is
true. Even in the midst of evil, we confirm that evil is ultimately
overcome and God will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was Palm Sunday for Orthodox churches, followers
of which include Serbs, their leaders delivered highly partisan
messages, bowing not at all to the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Filing into the St. George Serbian Church in Schererville, Ind.
_ one of four Serbian churches in northwestern Indiana _
parishoners talked in hushed tones about the NATO bombing and lit
beeswax candles in the church vestibule to commemorate friends and
relatives in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Very Rev. George Lazich, the church pastor, offered comfort
with a sermon about the troubled history of the Serbs and said the
news media were not fairly reporting the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bow down before the suffering of Jesus Christ,'' he said. ``If
God is with us, than no one can defeat us. No one can hurt us. We
survived the long subjugation of the Turks. We will survive this,
if we are faithful to God. Do not worry. But do pray.''

   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ At the bus station Sunday morning,
nervous people with suitcases were skipping out on Montenegro,
convinced that soon there would be bloodshed in this mountainous
Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, which consists of Montenegro and
the far larger republic of Serbia, has blasted open a chasm of
suspicion and resentment in this tiny republic of about 640,000
people. They are split between supporters of an elected government
that wants to embrace Western Europe and supporters of Serbia's
Slobodan Milosevic, who is defiantly waging war against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of military targets inside Montenegro, which NATO
halted four days ago as it accelerated the pace of strikes inside
Serbia, has handed Milosevic's supporters a resonant battle cry. At
the same time, it has badly undermined the arguments of
Montenegro's moderate leadership that good things come when you
cozy up to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hate here now and I think there will be civil war.
There are two sides that disagree about everything,'' said Samira
Sukolica, a Muslim woman who with her children and grandchildren
was voting with her feet, abandoning Montenegro by bus for the
safety of neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bosnia, which was convulsed by war from 1992 to 1995, this
republic is a soup of different ethnic groups _ Montenegrin, Serb,
Muslim, Albanian and Croat. Once started, as everywhere in the
Balkans, ethnic violence in this republic could spin out of control
as it did in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The fear voiced by people packing outbound buses Sunday morning
has been echoed by the State Department. It said last week that
Washington was ``highly concerned'' that Milosevic would provoke
violence in Montenegro in order to give the estimated 12,000
Yugoslav troops based here an excuse to take over an elected
government that has declared itself neutral in the conflict over
Kosovo. Late last week Milosevic replaced the commander of those
troops with Gen. Milorad Obradovic, believed to be a nationalist
hardliner.
</P>
<P>
   Any such takeover, however, would likely provoke a fight from
the estimated 8,000 police in Montenegro who are loyal to Milo
Djukanovic, the young Montenegrin president who has been trying for
a year and a half to ease this republic out of the crushing embrace
of Milosevic _ whom Djukanovic knows well as his erstwhile
political patron. Milosevic's crushing embrace. His government is
walking a dangerous tightrope, trying to prove to the West that it
is opposed to dictatorship in Serbia but also trying to avoid a
direct challenge to the Yugoslav Army. That army has heavy weapons;
the local police do not.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday night, Djukanovic, who has told friends
in Belgrade that he was not alerted by the West that NATO would
bomb military facilities in his republic the very first night of
the air campaign, complained angrily that NATO's action had made
his position ``much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard, very hard to speak and work for a democratic and
pro-European policy,'' said Djukanovic. ``NATO bombs have allowed
Mr. Milosevic to create a new division in the Yugoslav political
scene. Patriots are those who support his policies and anyone who
criticizes him is a traitor. In Montenegro, pro-Milosevic forces
are becoming much more aggressive''
</P>
<P>
   Police loyal to Djukanovic were out in force Sunday night as
Milosevic's supporters put on a huge rock concert in the capital's
central square. It was an event that mimicked regime-staged
concerts in Belgrade where in the past week Serbs have gathered to
sneer at the United States and the NATO bombing and to voice their
support for Milosevic's war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must help our Serbian brothers against the NATO attack,''
said one of the placards that waved above a crowd that was by far
the largest gathering in this republic since NATO bombs started to
fall 12 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in Montenegro stopped after what Djukanovic
described as his furious complaints to Western diplomats that NATO
was destabilizing its best friend in Yugoslavia. He said that the
absence of falling bombs and cruise missiles in the republic in the
past four days had eased tensions only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing has really made a horrible mess for this
republic,'' said Milka Tadic, general manager of Monitor, an
independent weekly. ``Djukanovic was put in this horrible political
situation of being bombed by his allies. It gave the nationalists
and the regular people of this country who are very confused a
perfect reason to say that this government does not want to defend
itself from outside attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday night's concert, Milosevic's men did their best to
make political hay out of Djukanovic's woes.
</P>
<P>
   Girls in skin-tight pants writhed on stage as a singer named
Dejan Peresic, who earlier in the day had been planning the
evening's entertainment in meetings at the headquarters of the
pro-Milosevic party, led a crowd of more than 20,000 in chants
about how Montenegro and Serbia must be united against NATO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The two republics have been allied since 1918, when Montenegro
joined Yugoslavia. Serbs and Montenegrins share the Eastern
Orthodox religion and an aggrieved history of underdog fights
against the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman empires.
</P>
<P>
   Vlado Asanin, editor of the pro-Milosevic newspaper Dan, warned
obliquely that there would be violent trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most terrible sins is to give up the brotherhood of
Montenegrins and Serbs,'' the editor said. ``In coming days, we
will have a chance to clear up all our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the concert's pro-Serb message clearly resonated with much
of the crowd, it was not overwhelmingly persuasive, particularly
with young people who attended perhaps more out of boredom than
political conviction and said they wanted a future free of war and
economic isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Montenegro to make contact with Europe,'' said Lidja
Mejlevic, 25, a graduate student in economics. ``If that means
saying goodbye to Serbia and to Mr. Milosevic, then I say
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the past two years, Montenegro hardly seemed interested in
making contact with Europe. Paramilitary forces from this republic
participated in wars in Croatia and Bosnia and have been linked to
war crimes. But Djukanovic, 37, a one-time disciple of Milosevic,
has defiantly broken that military link with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Besides refusing to take sides in the Kosovo conflict,
Montenegro has taken in an estimated 35,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees for the next-door province of Serbia. The refugees say
they are nervous to be in this republic, with its traditional ties
to Serbia, but so far there are no reports of their widespread
mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Djukanovic government has also refused to honor Milosevic's
decree of martial law in Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Army has not been
allowed to take over state-owned television.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic said that his police force, whose elite troopers were
stationed around his office Sunday night in bulletproof vest,
battle helmets and carrying automatic weapons, was capable of
dealing with the Yugoslav Army. But he said he hoped that it would
not come to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the Army is sensible enough not to fall for Mr.
Milosevic's manipulation,'' he said. ``But I have no illusions as
long as he is in the political life of Yugoslavia.''

TODAY 
Let's go. Batter up. We're taking the afternoon, and most of the
evening, off. For the Dodgers, this is the first of 54 games on
KTLA this season. Most years, 54 would be about it. But there's
another 80 (double last year) on Fox Sports West 2. Then there'll
probably be another dozen on Fox Channel 11 (Saturdays), Fox Sports
Net (Thursdays) and ESPN (Sundays and Wednesdays). Think of it this
way _ if Rupert's Dodgers aren't on TV, it's news. Major League
Baseball openers: Arizona at Dodgers, Channel 5, 1 p.m.;
Philadelphia at Atlanta, TBS, ESPN, 1 p.m.; Montreal at Pittsburgh
or Milwaukee at St. Louis, ESPN, 4 p.m.; Chicago White Sox at
Seattle, WGN, ESPN, 7:30 p.m. 
TUESDAY 
And coming in a day later after some extra batting practice, Sammy
Sosa. Major League Baseball openers: Chicago Cubs at Houston, WGN,
5 p.m.; Cleveland at Angels, Channel 9, 7 p.m. 
WEDNESDAY 
At least once a year, there's some knucklehead who calls to ask
about this listing: ``Your schedule says the Lakers are playing the
Kings. Is that a hockey game or basketball game?'' OK, this time
the Lakers are playing the NBA team in Sacramento, although usually
the Lakers face the local hockey team. But those games aren't too
exciting. The Kings' Stephane Fiset always gets called for
goaltending. Lakers at Kings, Channel 9, 7:30 p.m. 
THURSDAY 
Jack Nicklaus, missing the Masters for the first time in his career
because of hip replacement surgery, isn't sure where he'll be today
when Mark O'Meara begins his title defense. But Nicklaus knows he
doesn't have the heart to be a spectator. ``I'm not going to sit
around and watch a golf tournament,'' he said. ``I have never done
it. Why would I do it now? I think I'm going fishing or
something.'' Or go to the party over at Gary McCord's house. The
Masters first round, USA Network, 1 p.m., repeated at 9 p.m. (USA
also has the second round Friday at 1 p.m. with a 9 p.m. repeat;
CBS has the third and final rounds Saturday at 12:30 p.m. and
Sunday at 1 p.m. live) 
FRIDAY 
It's the Lakers against the Timberwolves. Any confusion about this
one? Lakers vs. Minnesota, Fox Sports West, 7:30 p.m. 
SATURDAY 
Last Halloween night, Prince Naseem Hamed was asked to perform a
trick for his treat _ outlast Wayne McCullough in a 12-round
decision before HBO's cameras. This time, taking no chances like
what happened to Lennox Lewis on his last trip across the pond, the
world featherweight champ makes his 12th title defense in
Manchester, England. And if there's any funny judging, they'll hear
about it from Jim Lampley, who continues to have the most credible
hairpiece in sports broadcasting today. Boxing: Prince Naseem Hamed
vs. Paul Ingle, HBO, 11:15 p.m. (tape delayed) 
SUNDAY 
The Sonics-Fall-And-Go-Boom bring their 4-11 road record to the
Forum for a nationally televised event that should turn out
differently from the last time these two met in the Emerald City.
There's no place like home. Seattle at Lakers, Channel 4, 2:30
p.m.

intervention in Yugoslavia on domestic politics should be mindful
of the prediction of Robert Strauss, a former Democratic Party
chairman, in March of 1991. ``I will admit that today it looks
somewhere between unlikely and impossible that a Democrat will win
the presidency,'' Strauss said in a common refrain at the time.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush, of course, was basking in the afterglow of the
Persian Gulf war. Big name Democrats were beginning to back out of
the 1992 race for the White House, leaving only Bill Clinton and a
few others who were considered sacrificial lambs.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, clearly, turned out to be that finding political
advantage in matters of war and peace is often fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   With that caveat in mind, the surprising twist is that while
many Republicans and even Democrats say his Kosovo policy is in
shambles, Clinton may be scoring some political points.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of polls showing that foreign policy is one of
the few remaining issues where people trust Republicans more than
Democrats, Clinton may benefit from the history of Americans
rallying around their commander in chief. That may hold true even
if the public was skeptical of the intervention in the first place.
The Yugoslavia conflict has also given Clinton a platform to appear
presidential _ and to change the subject from his personal
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to Clinton's commanding position is that
Republicans are deeply fractured. About half the Republican
presidential contenders have espoused an isolationist view that the
United States should not play any role in Yugoslavia, while the
other half said Clinton did the right thing. And while many have
faulted the administration's strategy as weak and flawed,
Republicans have been cautious about not appearing unpatriotic, and
thus some have refrained from attacking the president while
American lives are endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, argued that
the conflict has enhanced Clinton's political standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, including myself, disagreed with the idea of
going into Yugoslavia but now that we're in it, that's it and my
view is, support him,'' Danforth said in an interview.
``Republicans have not had a clear voice. And the president has had
a clear voice. This certainly gets everybody's mind off his past
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being helped by the constant showing of the pictures of
refugees from Kosovo and these wretched people and stories of the
ethnic cleansing,'' Danforth continued. ``Most people would say,
`What are we supposed to do? Nothing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a presidential scholar at Princeton University,
said the conflict ``has been sort of a sorbet for the presidency.''
``People have stopped talking about how he's feckless and has no
spine. Maybe he's got too much spine at the moment.'' While
``impeachment fractured so neatly on party lines,'' he said, the
Kosovo crisis ``produces so many fissures,'' especially among
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Academics and strategists also remarked that Clinton appears
decisive when contrasted with the Republican who is leading in the
polls for the nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Bush has
been derided by some of his rivals for taking a rather vague stand
on Kosovo. His main point has been, ``I just don't see the exit
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Austin last week, Bush defended his position.
``My attitude is I said the president had a lot more information
than I had to make a decision of whether to commit troops.''
Dismissing the critics, he added, ``I could give any statement and
there are people who would criticize me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Any short-term boost for Clinton could change overnight if
disaster strikes, such as American deaths. And any assessment must
await the final outcome of the airwar, how the refugees are
resettled and, of course, the fate of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And despite their own differences, many Republicans persist in
attacking Clinton and the Democrats for following a flawed policy
that they say has only exacerbated the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is as much consensus as you ever get in a major party
that this administration has let things drift,'' said Steve Forbes,
the publishing magnate who is running for the Republican
presidential nomination and who backed the initial dispatch of
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate who opposed the airstrikes, Patrick Buchanan, the
conservative columnist, said foreign policy matters like Kosovo
could haunt the Democrats in 2000. ``I believe that if Clinton does
not extricate us from the Balkans, the Balkans will be an issue in
the campaign of 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the
Democratic Party, argued that it was a mistake for Republicans to
try to score points. ``People are going to be turned off by
political opportunism over Kosovo,'' he said. ``Politically,
there's nervousness now. Everybody can play Monday morning
quarterback about when you get tough. But you have to get tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The political impact for presidential candidates may not be in
what precise position they take but in how they navigate such a
complicated and emotional issue. Mike Murhpy, a Republican
strategist, said that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., could appear
forceful for his advocacy of ground troops _ even though he knows
that option is not politically popular. By contrast, he said, Bush
risks appearing meek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence from Austin is troubling,'' Murphy said. ``And I
think they're starting to feel that reverberating through the
presidential echo chamber. You expect to see courage and leadership
at a time like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no evidence that voters are paying close
attention to what every prospective president says about Kosovo. If
anything, in the post-Cold War era, where decisions about American
engagement lack the clarity of democracy versus communism, people
probably feel less connected to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Gulf war, despite its relative popularity, was a
distant memory by the time the 1996 elections rolled around, and
voters were more concerned about closer-to-home matters like jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last week or so, Ismer Mjeku has managed to call his
uncle in Pristina several times to find out just how much life has
deteriorated for the ethnic Albanians who have yet to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Food, his uncle says, is perilously low. Dozens of people huddle
in tiny apartments without electricity, afraid to venture outside.
And always, always, staccato bursts of gunfire reverberate in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, that connection to the outside world _ which is
already unusual because most of Pristina's telecommunications
network has either been destroyed or disabled _ may be severed. In
days, maybe hours, Mjeku's uncle plans to join the exodus of
refugees streaming out of Kosovo, partly because he can no longer
trust the Serbian neighbor with whom he has shared a phone line for
many, many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be friends, but the Serbian guy has changed a
lot, and now he's complaining because all the time the phone is
busy,'' said Mjeku, a Bronx businessman. ``So my uncle is afraid
that this guy is going to turn them in. He tells me, `You don't
understand how afraid we are.'''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Mjeku's uncle is one of a precious few coming from
inside Kosovo in the wake of the Serbian government's order last
week to expel foreign journalists and humanitarian agencies. And
tossed together, these accounts offer a more human, more
microscopic view of the struggles of daily life in the eye of a
war.
</P>
<P>
   Given their second-hand nature, these stories may well be
impossible to confirm independently, for now. But at the least,
they seem to corroborate, and add texture to, the countless
testimonials about a widespread sense of fear, paralysis and
helplessness from ethnic Albanian refugees now stacking up in
Albania and Macedonia .
</P>
<P>
   In better days, Pristina, the provincial capital, was the
epitome of a small, bustling Balkan city, with drab high-rise
buildings, small houses with red-tiled roofs, vibrant outdoor
cafes. Now, though, parts of Pristina now resemble a ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   Running water remains available in some neighborhoods, but
several buildings have been charred or destroyed. Many
Albanian-owned stores have been looted. Acrid smoke blankets the
area.
</P>
<P>
   During the daylight hours, a few brave souls, usually older
women, do occasionally dart outside, running to the few state-owned
stores that remain open. On Friday, for instance, cigarettes were
available for the first time in a week, and in one neighborhood
where Kosovar leader Ibrahim Rugova lived, a few children even
played ball outside, according to a Agence France Presse dispatch
from Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Pristina is dark and eerily still. There is no
electricity after 6 p.m. or so, and those in hiding usually remain
in the dark. A few, though, light small candles while closing the
curtains and covering the windows with blankets to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine that you have a city full of life and lights,''
said Isuf Hajrizi, the managing editor of Illyria, an
Albanian-American newspaper based in the Bronx. ``Then picture that
everything goes dark, with smoke and explosions and flames. It's
like Dante's Inferno within 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Hajrizi last spoke to someone in Pristina on Friday: a family
that was hiding in a basement, and had a cellular phone. No one had
slept or changed clothes for days. Food was running out. And no one
had the faintest clue as to what was happening even one block away,
or if they would hear the dreaded knock on the door from Serbian
troops.
</P>
<P>
   According to several secondhand accounts, Serbian troops who do
stumble upon an ethnic Albanian family typically give the family as
little as five minutes to leave their home. Some troops have
demanded money as well, with the going rate now about $600 for a
human life, said Fred Abrahams, the Kosovo researcher at Human
Rights Watch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some families can't afford that figure. So they hide in one
place, or move from apartment to apartment, neighborhood to
neighborhood
</P>
<P>
   And yet, some families are also staying behind because they feel
that it is the right thing to do. Kosovo has two million residents
when there is no war, 90 percent of whom are ethnic Albanian. It is
the poorest and least developed part of what used to be Yugoslavia,
but it is also a proud place, filled with people who have long
embraced the struggle for autonomous rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is dangerous to stay, but Albanians are making a statement,
that this is where they belong,'' said one Albanian-American who
has been touch in the last few days with relatives in Pristina,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But invariably, more and more people leave. More than 35,000
ethnic Albanians have now fled from the city since the NATO
airstrikes began, and the wait for a train ticket out of Pristina
is now two or three days, according to several reports. Ethnic
Serbians are departing, too, bound for Belgrade or other parts of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Kosovo's other cities and towns remains
sketchy. But some rural areas appear to be a wasteland, with
destroyed crops, burning haystacks and unclaimed livestock
wandering through the fields, according to an Albanian-American who
talked with a friend on Saturday who was still hiding in a rural
area.
</P>
<P>
   Such accounts, however, are becoming more faint.
</P>
<P>
   Contacting Kosovars via phone or electronic mail has become next
to impossible, leaving cellular or satellite phones as the only
means of communication to penetrate the region's interior. But
those cellular phones, presumably, are running low on batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is changing from hour to hour, minute to
minute,'' said Elez Biberaj, chief of the Voice of America's
Albanian Service, in Washington. ``But Friday was my last contact
with a living human being; I've unable to get through to anybody
since. You don't know how frustrating that is, not to have one
contact in Kosovo.''

KAREEM GIVES WILT THE HOOK _ 15 YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some of the
interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los Angeles
sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from the book
``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles Sports
History'' in parenthesis, if applicable):
</P>
<P>
   April 5, 1984: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar passes Wilt Chamberlain on
the NBA career points list with his 31,420th point against Utah in
a game before 18,359 in Las Vegas. It comes on a familiar 14-foot,
right-handed sky hook, off a pass from Magic Johnson. (57)
</P>
<P>
   April 6, 1996: Dodgers' Chan Ho Park is the first Korean-born to
win a major-league game when he pitches four scoreless innings in
relief to beat the Chicago Cubs 3-1. He makes his major-league
debut almost exactly two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   April 7, 1989: Dodgers general manager Al Campanis makes his
ill-fated remarks about African-Americans on ABC's ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   April 8, 1974: Dodgers left-hander Al Downing throws it, and
Braves star Hank Aaron hits it _ career home run 715 in Atlanta.
Remember the sight of Dodgers left fielder Bill Buckner scrambling
up the left-field fence trying to chase it down?
</P>
<P>
   April 9, 1981: The Dodgers call on rookie Fernando Valenzuela to
pitch on opening day when Jerry Reuss is injured. The 20-year-old
rookie comes through with a 2-0 win over Houston _ and
Fernandomania is born. Five weeks later, he'll be 8-0 with four
shutouts and a 0.50 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   April 10, 1962: Dodger Stadium, costing $18 million, is opened
to the Dodgers. They lose 6-3 to Cincinnati in front of 52,564 in
the stadium's debut. The Los Angeles Angels played their first game
there seven days later and remained tenants until 1965. When the
Angels played there, it was referred to as Chavez Ravine. Did you
know: It was designed by architect Emil Praeger to be expandable to
85,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   April 10, 1982: ``The Miracle On Manchester'': The Kings come
back from a third-period 5-0 deficit to thump the defending Stanley
Cup champion and Wayne Gretzky-led Edmonton Oilers 6-5 in overtime,
winning Game 3 of their best-of-five opening-round series at the
Forum. Steve Bozek's backhander with five seconds left ties it in
regulation; Daryl Evans' 30-foot slapshot in 2:35 of OT wins it.
The Kings go on to win the series in five games. (48)
</P>
<P>
   April 11, 1961: In their first regular-season game in the major
leagues, the Los Angeles Angels take a 7-2 win in Baltimore. Eli
Grba goes the distance for the win against Milt Pappas. Ted
Kluszewski homers twice _ a two-run homer in the first inning and a
three-run homer in the second.
</P>
<P>
   April 11, 1990: In Mark Langston's first start with the Angels,
he combines with Mike Witt on a 1-0 no-hitter against Seattle at
Anaheim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Birthdays: Tuesday: Former Angels pitcher Bert Blyleven, age 48,
and ``Brian's Song'' co-star Billy Dee Williams (62). Sunday:
Boston Red Sox and former Cleveland High star pitcher Bret
Saberhagen (35).

specialities are required. Men who served in radio and
communications units, for instance, are being ordered to report for
duty, some Serbs say. Wartime military courts have been established
to court-martial those who do not report to their units
immediately, with prison terms for draft-dodging can range from one
to 20 years. Official Serbian state television has shown glowing

rarely simple. Between those deaths lies a tangled web of history,
friendships and enmities, of war and routine business that were

   EDUC-PARTNERS (Montclair, N.J.) _ On a frigid March morning, 35
second graders squirmed with delight in the Watchung School
auditorium at the prospect of receiving a disposable camera and a
creative assignment: recording their lives and tastes in
photographs and writing. The homework was not assigned by teachers
at this public elementary school just 15 miles west of New York
City. Instead, the assignment, handed out to some 250 children at
the school, came from researchers for Noggin, a new educational
channel that has formed a special partnership with Watchung. In
exchange for $7,100, Noggin can go into the school once a week from
now until June to run focus groups with some 250 children who
turned in parent permission slips. For Rita Miragliotta, Watchung's
principal, the partnership has been a boon, helping ease a budget
crunch. But for others in the education world, which has seen an
explosion of corporate suitors, deals like the Watchung-Noggin
partnership are things to be avoided, as they blur the line
separating schools from supermarkets.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mark Rogers is not sure how it began, his peculiar
and abiding fascination with nests. Maybe, he said, it had
something to do with where he grew up, on the edge of a Virginia
apple orchard that his grandfather owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time in trees,'' Rogers explained.
</P>
<P>
   He saw many nests there. He came to see even more in his
thoughts. He made nest jewelry, entwining gold and silver wires
into pendants shaped like nests. He built nest furniture,
encircling chairs and beds with twigs and vines.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a prelude to something bolder: nest art. An arguably
arcane occupation, that turned out to be his ticket to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   For the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday, Rogers has
been allotted a patch of the South Lawn to set up one of his most
ambitious creations, a ring of slender logs that measures 9 feet
high and 25 feet across, with triangular portals.
</P>
<P>
   It is an apt companion to the motifs of Easter and themes of
spring. No doubt hundreds of children will flutter through it,
treating it as an outsize oddity, an all-natural romper room.
</P>
<P>
   To Rogers, it is more. ``It's a visual metaphor,'' he said last
week as he put the finishing touches on it in a sloped meadow near
his home in a rural, mountainous band of Virginia about 260 miles
southwest of Washington. He mentioned nurture, community, the
circle of life.
</P>
<P>
   Then he dug even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about this last night,'' he said. ``What is it
I'm really trying to say? Kosovo. Think of all the conflicts in the
world. Here I am, living in the United States and having a great
life.''
</P>
<P>
   His gaze, like his thoughts, meandered. ``So here's a symbol
that I, as an artist, by the grace of God and the blessings of
Chance or Providence, can put on the nation's doorstep. I do it
humbly. It's only sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of them, coalescing into something that looks like a
Jurassic holdover _ a pterodactyl's bassinet. Rogers, 28, designed
it so it could be pulled apart for transport to Washington in two
moving vans, then put back together. He built it over three months
in the meadow, part of a nature conservancy in Radford, Va.,
affiliated with Radford University, where he is pursuing a
bachelor's in fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Reed-thin and rumpled, with a lone divot of beard in the valley
between his lower lip and chin, he lives about 25 miles from the
university, in a cottage without plumbing in Floyd County, where
the staple crop is granola and the Summer of Love never really
chilled. His former girlfriend and their 5-year-old son, Jade
Forest, are just up the gravel road.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was reared on the other side of Virginia, in Winchester,
90 miles northwest of Washington. His father taught high school
there, his mother assisted an orthodontist. Two older brothers,
weaned on the same exhortations to financial success as he was,
became an accountant and a plastics researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he had already begun to crave a different kind of
identity when, as a teen-ager, he met and became a friend of the
owner of a used-book store in town, a man who told stories about
his past in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco and
recommended the novels of Herman Hesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was paradigm shifting,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of high school in the 11th grade and headed west,
working alternately as an organic farmer, a cook and a carpenter
before circling back and settling in Floyd County six years ago.
Boulder, Colo., was the cradle of the first nest, a small gift he
sent to a girlfriend who had gone to India, a way to remind her of
the cozy home they had shared.
</P>
<P>
   As he made nest baskets and nest centerpieces for tables, he
realized that he had latched onto an especially universal, beloved
symbol. ``There are no nest haters out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dreamed large, inspired by the environmental art of Christo,
who put skirts on islands and sweaters on trees. In 1995, for an
event on the Mall in Washington that celebrated Earth Day, he
erected his first giant nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came in and meditated,'' he remembered. ``Some had
tears in their eyes. There was this lawyer who had an actual
spiritual experience inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged and emboldened, Rogers called the White House and
asked for the organizers of the Easter party, which, he knew,
supplemented the egg roll with various arts and crafts. Then he
made his pitch: What about a nest or two big enough for a child to
sit in, an irresistibly twiggy photo opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   They said yes, and he provided that _ and only that _ for four
years, until now, until the Great Nest of Life. To pay for it, he
coaxed $13,000 from a foundation at Radford University and the
Student Government Association there. To promote it, he introduced
himself and his ideas to the school's top officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He made appointments,'' said Charlie Brouwer, an associate
professor in the art department, which is giving Rogers three
credits in advanced sculpture for the nest. ``He's serious.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to branch out. He has an idea for a piece that involves
barbed wire, a video of cows and a disembodied voice asking, ``May
I take your order?'' It's a commentary on fast food, or maybe the
consumption of flesh. He is still working it out.
</P>
<P>
   He has another vision, of a gantlet of hay and a highway. It's a
statement on exurban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, ``I'm caught in a nest niche,'' he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   He sighed. ``I don't want to be pigeonholed,'' he said. ``You
know: Nest Guy.''

WORLD'S ONLY KURDISH TV STATION MAY BE SHUT DOWN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Every night in the turbulent Kurdish provinces of
eastern Turkey, thousands of families gather before their
television sets to watch Med-TV, the world's only Kurdish-language
station.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kurds say they enjoy the station's mix of news,
entertainment and political commentary. But the Turkish authorities
say it is fomenting terror, and in a case that crystallizes the
Kurdish conflict, they are waging an intense campaign to have it
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Their campaign may be on the verge of success. Officials in
Britain, from which the station broadcasts, have suspended its
license and are expected to decide later this month whether to shut
it permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders believe that closing the station will help end
the Kurdish insurgency, which has cost more than 30,000 lives over
the last 14 years. Station managers say it will be a step toward
destroying Kurdish identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds are an ancient Middle Eastern people whose traditional
homeland lies in what is now eastern Turkey, northern Iraq and
adjacent portions of Iran and Syria. They number as many as 30
million, living not only in the Middle East area but in a worldwide
diaspora, and are sometimes described as the world's largest
stateless minority. They claim descent from the ancient Medes, and
it is after the Medes that Med-TV was named when it began
broadcasting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Although the station claims 16 million viewers in 70 countries,
its greatest impact is probably in eastern Turkey. That region has
been convulsed by separatist war, and the Turkish authorities
believe that anything that encourages Kurds to think of themselves
as a people distinct from Turks is inherently subversive.
</P>
<P>
   Most Kurdish organizations are banned in Turkey. There are no
Kurdish schools or language courses. In this climate, the very
existence of Med-TV is a symbol of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   At several points over the last few years, Turkish officials
have sought to limit the station's influence, either by jamming its
signal or restricting the use of satellite dishes in Kurdish
provinces. Now they may have their best chance to silence it.
</P>
<P>
   Med-TV has regularly featured leaders of the rebel Kurdistan
Workers Party, including Abdullah Ocalan, the party's top leader,
who was captured by Turkish agents in February and is now facing a
trial that could lead to his execution. After Ocalan's capture,
several of his supporters appeared on the station and urged Kurds
everywhere to attack Turkish targets.
</P>
<P>
   These statements led the Independent Television Commission,
which is charged with regulating British-based broadcasters, to
suspend Med-TV's license for three weeks beginning March 22. The
commission is now deciding whether to make the suspension
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Med-TV carried programs which included material that we felt
was inciting violence and crime,'' said Guy Phelps, a spokesman for
the commission. ``This is a station that has had problems with
impartiality in the past, and we have made a number of
interventions with them. This is certainly the most serious one.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of Med-TV is Hikmet Tabak, a Kurd from eastern
Turkey who was imprisoned at the age of 18 for separatist
activities and spent 11 years in Turkish jails. On the wall of his
Regent Street office is a poster of a Kurdish child with the
caption: ``Med-TV is my eyes, ears and tongue. I don't want to be
silenced any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Tabak, 37, acknowledged that the station had
broadcast appeals for anti-Turkish violence. But he said he
regretted the broadcasts and had fired the employees responsible
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally, and everyone in our TV station, would favor an
independent Kurdistan,'' Tabak said. ``We don't support any
particular organization, but we want Kurds to be united.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked his opinion of the Kurdistan Workers Party, which the
Turkish government describes as terrorist, he replied: ``We don't
look at it the way they look at it. I look at it as a Kurdish
organization on the Kurdish side.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabak said the rebels did not finance Med-TV directly, but
encouraged their supporters in Europe to make the donations that
were its main source of income.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials consider Med-TV an arm of the guerrilla
movement. ``This station has consistently instigated and encouraged
terror,'' said a senior official who insisted on anonymity.
``Lately it has gone a step further and named certain categories of
civilians and public officials to be killed. This is a crime
anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has traditionally interpreted television regulations
loosely, which is why Med-TV chose to base itself here, although
most of its programs are produced in Belgium. But station managers
are already seeking alternative bases in case their station is
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely not without options,'' Tabak said.
``Whatever happens, Kurds will not stay without television.''

 Visa Employs Artful Overstatement to Dominate Industry
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Visa: ``It's everywhere you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard is accepted in just as many places, incidentally, but
most people don't know it.
</P>
<P>
   Through decades of savvy advertising _ including the liberal use
of rhetorical overstatement _ Visa has marketed its way into
consumers' minds and wallets more successfully than any other
payment card.
</P>
<P>
   The Foster City association has convinced a majority of
Americans that Visa offers better services and is accepted at more
places than MasterCard, although the differences between the two _
even Visa admits _ are negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two cards are virtually interchangeable, 59 percent
of consumers consider Visa the best overall card, compared to 21
percent for MasterCard, according to Visa. (American Express and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Discover card came in with 9 percent
and 8 percent respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and individuals charged $610 billion on Visa credit
and debit cards in 1998, which is half of the country's total
spending on plastic. According to the Nilson Report newsletter,
Visa's transaction volume is double that of No.2-ranked MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like BetaMax and VHS _ it's not the (better) technology
that wins, it's the one that's first in peoples' minds,'' said Alan
Brew, a principal with the brand-consulting firm Addison.
</P>
<P>
   While Visa's marketing has been successful, some bumps have
surfaced recently.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's image could be tarnished by &LR;   &LR; two major trials expected
to run back to back next spring that accuse Visa and MasterCard of
anti-competitive business practices. One suit was filed by the
Department of Justice and the other by retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Visa's strong name was also responsible for the
defection of its biggest member, Citigroup, earlier this year. New
York's Citigroup said it will use MasterCard as its exclusive card
marketer in the future so it can get out of Visa's shadow and
strengthen the Citibank name.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic landscape has undergone radical change since the
mid-1980s, when payment cards were much more evenly matched than
they are today. (American Express is known for its charge cards,
which must be paid off every month. Visa and MasterCard, which act
as marketers for member banks, promote credit cards that charge
interest on longer-term financing.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, 35 percent of cardholders believed Visa was accepted by
more merchants than any other card, while MasterCard and American
Express each racked up 28 percent. Today, 68 percent of card users
believe Visa is the most widely accepted, versus 23 percent for
MasterCard and 6 percent for American Express, according to Visa
research.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts say Visa pulled ahead by creating a clear
message that resonates with consumers and delivering it
consistently over time.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's famous tag line, ``It's everywhere you want to be,'' was
introduced in 1985 to reinforce the idea that Visa is the only card
people need because it is so widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
   A hefty budget backs up this message. Visa spent $225.8 million
on ads last year in the United States alone, according to
Competitive Media Reporting, and about $50 million on sponsorships
ranging from the San Francisco Symphony to the Daytona 500,
estimates the newsletter IEG Sponsorship Report.
</P>
<P>
   Visa also wins kudos from marketing experts for working with the
same advertising agency, New York's BBDO Worldwide, and even using
the same announcer, for well over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a questionable side to Visa's marketing success.
Since Visa is not accepted at every single point of sale, its core
advertising message is not strictly accurate. By contrast, some
MasterCard ads are more up front, noting that MasterCard is
accepted ``almost everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Visa also employs an advertising tactic that, while accurate on
a factual level, leaves consumers with the false impression that
its acceptance is superior to MasterCard's.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Visa strikes deals with a few high-profile events
like the Olympics to take only Visa cards, and then touts its
exclusive relationship in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Other Visa ads profile shops and restaurants that accept Visa
but not American Express. (American Express is, in fact, accepted
by fewer venues than either MasterCard or Visa.)
</P>
<P>
   While the ads are correct, strictly speaking, consumers
``extrapolate from the examples we use that Visa has far broader
acceptance (than MasterCard), although the difference in the number
of places we're accepted is really negligible,'' said Becky Saeger,
Visa's executive vice president of brand marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing gap in terms of perceptions of acceptance is
driven by that (message), absolutely,'' said Saeger.
</P>
<P>
   Visa executives are pleased with the effectiveness of their
strategy. ``Visa has proven itself one of the great brand names in
the history of commerce,'' said Michael Beindorf, executive vice
president of the Visa brand. ``The constant barrage _ the Olympics,
the NFL and others _ contributes to the collective perception that
Visa's acceptance is superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Visa's competitors declined to comment directly on Visa's
strategy of extrapolation.
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Einhorn, who creates MasterCard ads for McCann Erickson
North America, said, ``MasterCard is not the kind of brand that
would in any way stretch the truth. I think it would be
inconsistent with the brand, which is built on understanding and
empathy'' with customers.
</P>
<P>
   A MasterCard spokesman said executives were unavailable to
comment last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Wasserman, an American Express spokeswoman, said Visa's
strategy is limited. ``Visa's message of ubiquity only goes so far
because it just says `We're there,''' she said. ``Our message says,
`We're there for you and (will) help you in the following ways.'''
</P>
<P>
   The trials scheduled for next year could give consumers a
different view of Visa. Retailers led by heavy hitters like
Wal-Mart and Sears claim Visa and MasterCard are forcing them to
accept debit cards and charging the merchants exorbitant fees to
process the cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has accused Visa and MasterCard of using
illegal means to squash competition. For example, Justice charges,
both associations restrict their bank members from offering cards
through American Express or other card companies.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and MasterCard have denied wrongdoing in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   While bad publicity can always damage a brand, Brew believes
that from a consumer standpoint, Visa is largely untouchable.
``Once a particular name is established in peoples' minds, unless
another product is profoundly better, people will stick with what
they've got,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Visa spokesman Kelly Presta said Visa ``works in consumers' best
interest and we believe we will prevail'' in both suits.
</P>
<P>
   From a public-relations standpoint, ``Consumers will always look
to the relationship they have had with Visa, which is an
overwhelmingly positive one,'' Presta said.

ARCADES BATTLING TO STAY IN THE GAME  
 BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Steve Yee lurched the steering wheel wildly to the right and then
back to the left, careening the powerful race car on a twisting
ride over the streets of San Francisco at 155 mph.
</P>
<P>
   He was racing against two opponents: his 11-year-old son, Chris,
and an unseen driver named Yogis, who was located somewhere in Los
Angeles. And for three minutes, Yee forgot he was sitting in a
Redwood City arcade playing with a new online video game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, am I sweating,'' Yee said after emerging from a world of
roaring engines and pounding music. ``It makes you forget about the
real world. It's so real after a while. It really gets your heart
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Yee had just played San Francisco Rush the Rock, Alcatraz
Edition, an arcade game linked by a high-speed line to 34 like it
in other California arcades.
</P>
<P>
   The game, which lets several players in different locations
compete against one another, is a test of a new strategy by Atari
Games Corp. of Milpitas to keep arcade players like Yee dropping
those quarters and tokens in the slots. If the California networked
games, which have just started, prove successful, Atari will roll
out network arcade games nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times for the ``coin-op'' game industry, which
has been fast losing ground to at-home video console and computer
games as they increase in popularity and sophistication.
Coin-operated video game-makers are turning to networked games and
simulators to build on the major advantage they still hold over
home games _ the social experience.
</P>
<P>
   Coin-operated video games, once a staple in every mall and
convenience store, have dwindled from about 1 million in 1990 to
620,000 in 1997. One analyst says the industry has plungedinto a
``coin-op depression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The out-of-home entertainment industry is faced with
significant in-home competition from cable, Internet and video
console games,'' said John Latta, president of research firm 4th
Wave Inc. of Alexandria, Va. ``There is still a place for coin-op
in street locations, but the era of the arcade in the mall is
rapidly fading.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of U.S. home games _ especially video console games _ are
skyrocketing and are projected to hit about $7 billion this year,
according to the trade group Interactive Digital Software
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The huge success of the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 game
consoles and the growing use of home computers have made video and
computer games the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment
industry, which includes records, movies and books.
</P>
<P>
   Home games, unlike arcades, don't require a constant flow of
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the N64, you get to play more games,'' said Ryan Lui, 10,
of Daly City, after taking a spin on San Francisco Rush the Rock at
Redwood City's Malibu Grand Prix, part of a chain of entertainment
centers offering miniature golf, midget racing cars and batting
cages in addition to coin-op games. Lui lost to two Southern
California drivers, identified on screen by the names Antichrist
and Jah Jah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The powerful home video game consoles like PlayStation and
Nintendo 64 are offering a huge amount of play value for a fixed
amount of money,'' said analyst John Taylor of Arcadia Investment
Corp. ``It has pulled some of the core customers out of the
arcades.''
</P>
<P>
   As the market has shrunk, arcade gamemakers have consolidated.
In the United States, Bally, Williams, Midway and Atari have become
one through mergers. That makes Atari Games of Milpitas the last
major domestic coin-op gamemaker, going up against competitors
Sega, Namco, Capcom and Konami, all of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Atari now is the arcade division of video game software-maker
Midway Games Inc., which last week forecast that earnings for the
second half of fiscal year 1999, ending June 30, will be lower than
last year partly due to the weak market for coin-operated games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Midway's coin-op game revenue was down 25 percent from
the year before while home game sales were up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coin-op games used to have a clear edge in graphics and game
play over their home-bound relatives, but that gap is rapidly
closing, if not already gone, because of advances in technology for
both PCs and game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  For example, the new Sega Dreamcast, a 128-bit video game
console due to hit the United States this fall, has games in the
works that employ the same graphics technology used in its arcade
games, giving more realistic movements to game characters.
</P>
<P>
   So arcade gamemakers are banking on their remaining advantages
to draw players out of the home _ ambience and socialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids still want a place to go to hang out,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Atari Games _ a descendant of the company that made the
pioneer video arcade game Pong _ hopes that its new arcade network
concept will bring back players.
</P>
<P>
   The networked game, San Francisco Rush the Rock, has a screen,
gas pedal, driver's seat and a steering wheel that simulates the
bumps and grinds of a real race, said Mark Stephen Pierce, Atari
senior vice president of coin-operated products.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that can't be rivaled with a Nintendo joy pad
in your hand sitting across from your coffee table,'' Pierce said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rush games are part of what Atari calls WaveNet, a network
of machines planted in 35 locations in the Bay Area and Los
Angeles. Networking allows real-time head-to-head races and
tournament play, with high scores from around the state posted on
the screens.
</P>
<P>
   The game is popular at Redwood City's Malibu Grand Prix, said
Joni Kelly, marketing director for the entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more interesting experience than you get sitting at
home geeking in front of your computer,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen players interviewed said they generally had fun playing
the game, though only a few cared that they were playing against
rivals in other parts of the state. One liked it for a low-tech
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than the other driving games because it has a
clutch,'' said Tong-Ba Nguyen, 16, of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Atari plans to roll out a new networked shooting game called
War, which employs cameras and small video screens to show the
images of the competitors. A player in Oakland, for example, can
see the face of a player in Anaheim whom he is trying to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Sega also is testing a networked driving game called Daytona
II in six spots in other parts of the country, but none are in the
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Stone, president and COO of Sega Enterprises Inc. USA,
believes that arcade videos are not becoming extinct, but are
undergoing a transformation that will make them appeal to a broader
audience rather than the typical 14-year-old boy who is the core
arcade customer.
</P>
<P>
   Sega, which pulls in about $2 billion a year worldwide from
coin-operated games, has found success with simulation video arcade
games, such as a bass fishing game that is popular in the
southeastern United States, Stone said. One of the hottest arcade
games nationally, made by a small Chicago firm, simulates a golf
tournament and posts the best player scores from all locations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although smaller, stand-alone mall arcades are disappearing,
they are being replaced by family oriented entertainment centers on
a larger scale than attractions like Malibu Grand Prix. The larger
centers are supposed to become destinations for food, drinks and
other forms of entertainment in addition to video games, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One local example is the new Sony Metreon, a giant 350,000-foot
complex with theaters, restaurants, shops and interactive games,
scheduled to open June 16 in downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, Sega has opened or is building eight Sega
GameWorks entertainment centers in cities like Detroit, Miami and
Chicago, Stone said. Designed in partnership with director Steven
Spielberg, each Sega GameWorks offers a full-service restaurant, a
bar, music, virtual-reality attractions and games.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  And other entertainment centers like DisneyQuest, ESPN Zone
and Dave &AMP; Busters that are cropping up around the country will
help coin-op video games survive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people like to think we're a dying breed, but we're
not,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Coin-op games act as a kind of off-Broadway venue for the
industry. Gamemakers debut games to the public in arcades to
promote the home video version.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting-game genre typified by games like Mortal Kombat and
Street Fighter was launched in arcades in the early '90s, creating
enough of a buzz to spur successful home sales as they moved to
video consoles and even to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent example is Atari's original San Francisco Rush
arcade game, which sold about 12,000 units, Pierce said. Atari's
parent, Midway, then turned it into successful PlayStation and
Nintendo 64 titles.
</P>
<P>
   But Latta is more pessimistic about the future because there are
fewer new arcade game titles offered as developers shift their
attention to the more lucrative and faster-growing home market.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He contends that the coin-op industry's survival is partly
dependent on arcade gamemakers moving away from their old game plan
of creating one game per box. An arcade game station sells for
between $2,000 and $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an out-of-date business model and what I describe as a
coffin-based industry,'' Latta said. ``What other form of media
comes in the shape of a coffin and that is all one can do with it,
play one title? Even a VCR can play multiple titles with different
tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Arcade gamemakers should use PC-based architecture so that game
boxes are reusable, can play more than one game and can be easily
updated with new titles, Latta said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  One Japanese company, Midwest Amusement Corp., in February
announced plans to market a new line of arcade games that use
Compaq Pentium II computers. The machines, which can play multiple
games and be updated with new titles from a remote spot through a
server located in the arcade, are due to roll out in the United
States later this year. Pierce, though, dismissed Latta as someone
who has been tapped as an evangelist for Intel Corp.'s new, more
powerful Pentium III chip.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, who has worked in video-arcade game production since its
Ms. Pacman and Asteroids heyday in the early 1980s, has seen
predictions of the industry's doom come and go before. There seems
to be no shortage of 14-year-old boys, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge growth industry like the Internet,'' Pierce
said. But ``the reason we're still in coin-op is it's profitable.
The thing that's wonderful about the arcade business is it's
brutally honest. Either your stuff makes money or it doesn't.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 NEW WAYS TO BLOCK VIRUSES ON YOUR PC
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of last week's swift outbreak of a computer e-mail
virus, antivirus-maker Network Associates Inc. will launch several
new services today that automate virus detection.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates also plans to release new programs later this
week specifically designed to reject the type of attack that
allowed the virus called Melissa to clog thousands of electronic
mail servers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melissa showed how malicious code can threaten
communications,'' said Zachary Nelson, general manager and vice
president of the Santa Clara company that makes the McAfee
antivirus software. ``Imagine what hackers can do to e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, programmed to enter a computer by e-mail and send
itself out to the first 50 e-mail addresses it found in a Microsoft
Outlook address book, infected more than 100,000 computers and
overloaded several company and government systems.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial surge, computer security experts stopped the
spread of Melissa early last week and totally stamped it out by the
end of the week. Federal authorities on Thursday arrested a New
Jersey man suspected of writing the virus.
</P>
<P>
   But an automated virus detection system could have stopped the
spread of Melissa sooner, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Most systems now require some human intervention when a
previously unknown virus is found. In the case of Melissa, which
spread quickly by reproducing itself automatically, the response
was slow because new antivirus software updates had to be installed
before a system was immune, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new products and services the company will announce include
programs that can automatically quarantine a suspected virus and
send it back to Network Associates to be diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Another program called ``Virtual Sting'' is activated when
computer hackers manage to penetrate a company's computer defenses.
The program diverts hackers into a false data network. While the
hacker roots around in those files, system administrators have time
to trace the source of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the new products were developed with several
companies, including Microsoft Corp., Sun Microsystems, Novell, and
VeriSign Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Melissa attack, Network Associates already had
been planning to release its new products today just before the
Oakland Athletics home opener at the Network Associates Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Now in Melissa's wake, other antivirus-makers were scrambling to
develop similar new defenses. Network Associates' rival Symantec
Corp. of Sunnyvale and IBM also reportedly were working on systems
to speed up virus detection and cures.
</P>
<P>
   Internet connections were the most frequent point of computer
virus or hacker attack for 57 percent of companies surveyed last
month by the Computer Security Institute, a San Francisco trade
association.
</P>
<P>
   Theft of proprietary data cost the 163 companies surveyed about
$1.67 million in 1998, while virus attacks cost an average $55,000
in financial losses, according to the survey, which was done in
conjunction with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results and the Melissa virus should serve as a
wake-up call for businesses that are relying more on the Internet
for communications and revenues, but aren't sufficiently prepared
to protect their internal computer networks from intruders,
security experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That virus is just a small part of the total corporate crime
problem that's getting worse and worse as we transition to
electronic commerce and a digital economy,'' said Marketta Silvera,
CEO and founder of Pilot Network Services, an Alameda computer
security firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their (hackers') techniques have become more sophisticated, so
there's no single software package that can defend corporations
against cyber crime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers have started using more advanced techniques like ``stack
smashing,'' or sending e-mail messages that are larger than company
systems are programmed to accept, Silvera said. Stack smashing
causes a computer crash and creates a way into the network.
</P>
<P>
   Another method is called ``packet fragmentation,'' or bits of
e-mail messages that sent separately are benign but once assembled
inside a network can cause damage, Silvera said.

TEAMS LEAVE, BUT FORUM WILL FIGHT ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lakers and Kings are abandoning the Forum for
the new, glitzy Staples Center after this season, leaving the
Inglewood venue with less-mainstream attractions and countless
memories.
</P>
<P>
   The monumental move has raised a question for Los Angeles'
small, but devoted core of boxing fans: What will become of Forum
Boxing?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum's ``Fight Night,'' one of the most consistent series
of boxing matches in the nation, will continue to stage cards at
the Forum, the Pond and other venues at least as long as Jerry Buss
owns the building. And, so far, he hasn't indicated that he's
selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, Jerry is a boxing fan,'' said John Jackson, head of Forum
Boxing. ``Two, it provides events for the building (around 20 per
year). And, to some degree, he made a commitment a long time ago to
have professional boxing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's living up to that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, boxing was huge at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s and early '70s, a golden era for boxing in Los
Angeles, fighters such as Ruben Olivares and Bobby Chacon drew
crowds as large as 18,000 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fight Night crowds average around 3,500 in part because of
longterm television contracts with Fox Sports West and Channel 9 _
fans are choosing to watch for free from home _ and the fact that
fighters the caliber of Olivares and Chacon do most of their work
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Forum Boxing doesn't lose money, Jackson said, but it certainly
doesn't make much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough,'' Jackson said. ``We have a very good
television situation and we sell season seats, though. Our fans,
our regular fans are part of why we can have some measure of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``... And we sell sponsorships. Our sponsors have been with us
for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forum also promotes its own fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he has either a contract or a working relationship
with at least 15 fighters, including WBA junior featherweight
champion Nestor Garza, WBO junior featherweight champ Marco Antonio
Barrera and featherweight contender Juan Manuel Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   However, things were much better only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum had in its stable former junior flyweight champion
Humberto ``Chiquita'' Gonzalez, whose wars with Michael Carbajal
are unforgettable; IBF flyweight champ Mark Johnson, one of the
best pound-for-pound fighters in the world; and Barrera, who at one
time looked as if he would become a star.
</P>
<P>
   And then it all changed: Gonzalez retired, Johnson bolted for
another promoter and Barrera lost a few fights and has had to
rebuild his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum was left with several very good fighters but not the
starpower that warrants spending the money it takes to stage a
major event and draw the interest of major cable TV companies like
HBO, a Gonzalez-Carbajal-caliber event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it hasn't hurt. Obviously, it has,'' said Jackson,
who now is negotiating to get Barrera and Marquez major
championship fights. `` ... But I think we're at a point where we
were just before '95, on the brink of doing the big show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barrera has won his (WBO) title back. Barrera versus
(sensational WBC junior featherweight champ Erik) Morales, for
instance, would be a major fight that could take place at the
Forum.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Forum will continue to do what it has done
since the modern version of Forum Boxing was established in 1982:
stage 20-plus cards a year, usually on Monday nights, and help
produce solid fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to maintain its fan base, its television partners
and its sponsors, and, who knows, perhaps convince a few people to
give Fight Night a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take great pride in the fact that we've had very few shows
that haven't been competitive,'' Jackson said. ``Jerry didn't just
want to have boxing, he wanted to have competitive boxing, to put
on good shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pretty much done that. That's really our major goal:
Make fights that are entertaining for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   More Forum Boxing: An estimated 700-800 fans at each show are
Senate Seat holders, fans who own seats for all events in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Lakers and Kings are moving and the Senate Seats
will be discontinued, many prime seats will open up for Forum
Boxing and other events.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may help us,'' Jackson said. ``Obviously, the Senate
Seats are premium seats. When (Senate Seat holders) are gone, there
will be better seats for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my guess is that a lot of those people (Senate Seat
holders who attend boxing events) will still be in attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   Forum Boxing tickets break down as follows: $75, $60 and $45 for
floor seats; $35, $22 and $15 for loge-level seats. The seats that
will open up when Senate Seats are discontinued will sell for
between $22 and $35.
</P>
<P>
   More Jackson: Jackson is a very busy guy.
</P>
<P>
   He will retain his duties as head of Forum Boxing and has been
hired as John Robinson's offensive coordinator with the Nevada-Las
Vegas football program.
</P>
<P>
   How will he pull it off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Jerry and John have kind of allowed me to set a schedule
that allows me to be present in both places,'' Jackson said. ``With
the phone and the fax, I'm really never gone from either job. It's
not going to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do (as many as) eight fights in Vegas anyway. That takes
care of two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Good idea: In the wake of the March 13 Evander Holyfield-Lennox
Lewis debacle, the National Association of Boxing Commissions will
consider at its annual meeting in July the establishment of a
``championship pool'' of judges, from which judges for all major
title fights would be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to include only the best judges and referees in each
state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also set uniform fees, as well as travel and
lodging expenses for judges and referees, and require them to
attend annual seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would keep promoters and sanctioning bodies at arm's
length from fighters,'' association president Gregory Sirb of
Pennsylvania told the Chicago Tribune. ``It would ensure that
officials' salaries do not depend on who promotes and sanctions
fights and that the best officials are working when the world is
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Nevada: The Nevada Athletic Commission will
consider promoter Bob Arum's request for open scoring at its April
23 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Arum would like to see open scoring used for the May 8 bout
between Morales and Wayne McCullough. And then, if it goes well, he
wants to use it for the Oscar De La Hoya-Oba Carr fight on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: The Boxing Writers Association of America will
recognize Lewis as the undisputed champion at its annual awards
dinner on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis beat Holyfield decisively, but the bout was scored a
draw....
</P>
<P>
   Main Events, which promotes heavyweight Jeremy Williams of Long
Beach, is pushing for a bout against Ike Ibeabuchi, who is coming
off an impressive knockout of Chris Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has fine skills and a lot of power but one of the worst
chins in boxing. Still, Williams is confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike can't beat me,'' Williams said. ``There's no way he can
beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Main Events says that Ibeabuchi is asking for too much money for
the fight....
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas will be back in the ring in July, when he
defends his IBF junior middleweight championship against either
Bronco McKart or Keith Mullings on HBO. Either matchup would be
interesting because McKart and Mullings are very capable fighters.

 _ SF CHRON   Should Vaccine Research for HIV Merit a Corporate Tax Break? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, the saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the drug industry works on the opposite logic.
</P>
<P>
   When deciding where to invest their research cash, drug execs
know they can get the best returns by developing remedies that
require patients to take regular pills or injections.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it makes far less economic sense for them to
develop new vaccines _ which are inherently one-shot deals _ even
though society might benefit more from such preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
   To give drug and biotech firms a greater incentive to develop
vaccines, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, recently
introduced a bill that would provide a 30 percent tax credit for
efforts to ward off diseases that kill more than 1 million people a
year worldwide. The only ones that qualify, according to her staff,
are HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, all companies are eligible for a 20 percent R&AMP;D tax
credit, regardless of whether they're designing better mousetraps,
faster computers or life-saving drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's proposal would increase this credit by 50 percent for
research on these specified vaccines. It also would allow companies
that lose money _ as do most biotech startups _ to pass some of the
credit through to their investors. This presumably would attract
more investors, who could apply the write-off to their own
corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's bill, The Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act, is
supported by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the International
AIDS Vaccine Coalition and the Global Health Council among others.
Senator John Kerry, D-Mass., is poised to introduce companion
legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's idea has obvious merit _ and drawbacks. The notion of
rewarding prevention makes eminent sense. But this break is
narrowly targeted to just three diseases. And one of those three,
HIV, already received millions in direct government support last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A new tax break might, as Pelosi hopes, motivate private firms
to begin TB and malaria vaccine programs, which they haven't done
so far. But the only immediate beneficiaries of Pelosi's proposal
would be the four corporations already developing HIV vaccines.
They include VaxGen, a biotech startup in South San Francisco, and
Chiron, the biotech giant in Emeryville.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BIOSCOPE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  As members of Congress weigh Pelosi's measure, they will have to
ask whether she is opening a Pandora's pork barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Don Rath, tax director at Chiron, said expanded tax credits for
specific R&AMP;D projects ``would be a novelty.''
</P>
<P>
   But probably not for long. If one interest group, in this case
the AIDS lobby, wins a sweeter R&AMP;D tax credit, other constituencies
surely will make impassioned pleas for their own research causes.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Inoculate this: &LR;  Still, vaccination seems to be in the air in
Washington, D.C. While Pelosi was floating her tax-credit bill, the
Insti tute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences,
was finishing a three-year study on the economics of the U.S.
vaccine business.
</P>
<P>
   The full report should be up on the Academy's Web site today
 &LR; (www.nas.edu).  &LR; But Dr. Robert Lawrence, a professor at Johns
Hopkins University and chairman of the vaccine study group, briefed
me on its findings.
</P>
<P>
   First, a bit about the study group. Ever since 1863, when
President Lincoln established the Academy, small teams of NAS
scientists have volunteered their time to study topics of public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's group had a specific charge: to look at the
infectious diseases that afflict Americans; to assess how much it
might cost _ and how long it might take _ to develop a vaccine
against each infection; and then to calculate where private
companies and U.S. society would get the most bang for every buck
invested in vaccine research.
</P>
<P>
   After evaluating hundreds of vaccine candidates, the NAS
committee ranked them into four groups, from most cost-effective to
most expensive, in terms of lives saved per dollar invested in
research.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Lawrence's list bears no resemblance to Pelosi's vaccine
favorites. The NAS recommends some fairly pedestrian efforts, such
as development of a multiyear flu vaccine aimed at kids. It not
only would keep kids healthy and prevent parents from losing time
at work, a new flu shot also would stop kids from infecting their
grandparents, for whom the flu can be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of BIOSCOPE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  How could Pelosi and the NAS be on opposite pages of the vaccine
book? The NAS panel, you see, was ordered to focus on infections
that kill Americans. Malaria and TB, though deadly in the Third
World, fell beyond this purview. The panel excluded an AIDS vaccine
from their list because it already was receiving so much government
research support, Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, on the other hand, focused entirely on diseases that are
big international killers. And she does represent San Francisco,
where AIDS looms as public health enemy No.1.
</P>
<P>
   If Pelosi and the NAS committee joined forces, they'd have a
stronger argument for a bill to spur development of a wide range of
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   The moral being, perhaps, that an an ounce of investment in
vaccine research should be worth a ton of tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sth  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; THE REST OF THE STORY: San Francisco attorney Gary Gray was
mystified by one line in my column last week about DNA
``fingerprints.'' I mentioned how DNA tests are used to identify
victims whose bodies were burned beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Gray could understand how forensics experts might extract DNA
samples from charred remains. But where would they get a genetic
sample from a ``missing and presumed dead'' person for comparison?
</P>
<P>
   My genetic forensics expert, Sean Walsh of Perkin-Elmer Corp. in
Foster City, said it's a cinch _ provided that investigators have a
hunch as to the victim's identity.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, they look for a comb, toothbrush or other
personal item that can yield a hair follicle or saliva residue _
enough DNA to make a positive match against the sample from the
victim's body.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said this technique was used to identify bodies charred
beyond recognition in the TWA flight 800 disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But if investigators came across a burned corpse and had no clue
as to its identity, well, then DNA tests wouldn't be of much help.

   WASHINGTON _ The 24 Apache helicopter gunships and the
long-range rockets that President Clinton has ordered to Albania,
combined with 8,000 NATO troops dispatched to aid refugees there,
form the backbone of what could quickly turn into the vanguard of
an invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist this is not their plan and that,
at most, these troops would be sent into Kosovo to escort ethnic
Albanians back to their homes once hostilities ceased.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches, these officials say, are Balkans bound because Gen.
Wesley Clark, the NATO military commander, wants a potent,
all-weather tank-killing weapon to bolster an air campaign that has
been stymied by fog, rain and political constraints.
</P>
<P>
   But the helicopters mark an important threshold in the 12-day
allied operation. These are Army weapons flown by pilots wearing
Army green. And while the long-range Army rockets may not be in
Kosovo, their mission will be to attack hostile air defenses, and
possibly other targets, deep behind Serbian lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are combat troops and they'll have no problem whatsoever
switching to a combat role if such an order is given,'' said Lt.
Gen. William Carter III, a retired chief of staff of southern NATO
forces who helped direct the allied operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Senior congressional officials notified Sunday echoed that
sentiment. ``If they want to call them part of the air campaign,
fine, but they're a ground support unit,'' said one senior
congressional aide. ``We are clearly moving toward a ground war in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a senior NATO official in Brussels said the
fact that the United States wanted to send Apaches and rocket
batteries operated by U.S. Army troops from Germany ``raises some
interesting questions about their position not to use ground
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's why: The Apaches add a deadly new dimension to a NATO
air campaign that has failed to deter the forces of President
Slobodan Milosevic from expelling tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians from the besieged province, and has been hampered in
destroying the military machine waging this war.
</P>
<P>
   If dispatched in combat, which still needs concurrence from
NATO's political leaders on Monday and a second approval from
Clinton, the Apaches would streak into Kosovo at night hugging the
earth at speeds of over 150 mph, running lights off.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, peering through night-vision goggles, pilots
would lock on targets identified from surveillance planes or an
unmanned reconnaissance drone called the Predator. Each helicopter
can fire up to 16 laser-guided Hellfire missiles from more than
three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Two types of ground-to-ground rockets, with ranges up to 100
miles, would blast a path through Serbia's formidable air defenses
for the helicopters, which typically hunt in packs of eight, and
blast a separate route out.
</P>
<P>
   Except for dense fog, the Apaches can fly in the foulest
weather. But flying closer to the ground than any piloted warplane
also makes the helicopters much more vulnerable to automatic weapon
ground fire or short-range shoulder-fired missiles.

<P>
   Even as NATO forces press the war against Yugoslavia, there are
Serbs across the United States fighting deportation on the ground
that they do not want to be returned home to face conscription into
a military engaged in an ethnic purge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as the Serbian province of Kosovo endures violent
upheaval, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
fleeing, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service is
pressing ahead with deportation cases for Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Serbs say that they are not always getting a
sympathetic ear from judges, with some implying that the men are
shirkers for trying to avoid military service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ridiculous to think that we might send someone back to
Yugoslavia who is immediately going to be part of the military
machine there,'' said Donald R. Sherinian, an immigration lawyer in
Lake Forest, Calif., who has a Serbian client who faces a hearing
on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service will not say how many cases are pending,
but in 1998, it granted asylum to 524 people from Yugoslavia, 49
percent of the requests. In addition, Richard L. Kenney, a
spokesman for the immigration courts, said that in 1998, it handled
453 cases of people from Yugoslavia, some of which may have
included more than one person. Of those, asylum was granted in 156
cases, denied in 127, and the other cases were closed in other
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to survive,'' said Vlora Jakupi, an Albanian from
Kosovo who is six months pregnant. Her husband, Valdet, has been in
the Elizabeth Detention Facility in Elizabeth, N.J., for a month
after they arrived with fake passports. Mrs. Jakupi was held
overnight but released because she is pregnant. She is living with
her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyer, Claude L. Maratea, said Jakupi had a hearing with
an immigration officer on Thursday to establish whether he had
``credible fear'' of the consequences of returning.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jakupi got word Friday that most of her relatives had fled
to Albania or Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agency will not comment on individual cases.
Last June, the Justice Department issued a one-year order giving
anyone from Kosovo the right to stay in this country for a year
because of conditions at home, said Barbara Francis, a spokeswoman
for the INS. But it does not cover anyone who arrived after it was
issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to have a credible story and we have to determine
who they are,'' said Ms. Francis, acknowledging that refugees often
get out with just the clothes on their back and no documents.
``Asylum is granted on a case-by-case basis, story by story.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs seeking asylum feel particularly vulnerable because the
United States is part of a force attacking their country. If they
go back, not only are they likely to be drafted, said Mark S.
Kocol, a Chicago immigration lawyer who is defending five young
Serbian men, but they will probably be singled out because they are
coming from America.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. guidelines, countries have the right to call up their
citizens for the army, and facing such a draft is not sufficient
grounds for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions are if an asylum seeker faces capital
punishment if he is deported and convicted of draft evasion or if
he would have to join a military known for human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration courts, run by the Justice Department's
Executive Office for Immigration Review, demand that each asylum
seeker prove that he will be drafted. While there have been
widespread press reports of Yugoslavian conscription, most of the
men fighting deportation do not have individual notices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Serbs said most of their clients had been
here for some time and were seeking permission to stay. But some of
the Kosovo Albanians were caught trying to enter the country
without proper documents and are in detention.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond P. D'Uva, an immigration lawyer, said a 19-year-old
client from Kosovo was denied asylum on March 19, just days before
the bombing started. His two younger siblings were not jailed
because they are minors.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client is distraught because he has no way of
finding out what happened to the rest of his family. ``Reports from
his town, Mitrovica, say all the Albanian inhabitants are gone,''
said D'Uva.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kosovo refugee in detention in Elizabeth, Afrim
Karaqica, 34, tried to enter the United States with a false
passport last December, hoping to get his wife and three daughters
in later, said his lawyer, Victor V. Yee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened to my family,'' Karaqica said in a
statement. ``I'm safe here, but I can't eat or sleep because I
think about them all the time. I came to the U.S. to survive, but
the INS arrested me.''

<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. _ During recess one recent morning, 35 second
graders squirmed with glee in the Watchung School auditorium at the
prospect of receiving their own disposable cameras and a creative
assignment: recording their lives and tastes through photographs
and words.
</P>
<P>
   The homework _ filling out a 27-page booklet called ``My All
About Me Journal'' _ was not handed out by teachers at this public
elementary school in the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the assignment, given to some 250 Watchung students,
came from researchers for Noggin, a new educational channel that
forged a special partnership with the school earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for $7,100, which the school has put toward buying
30 classroom word processors, Noggin can go into the school one
morning a week from January until June to run 30-minute focus
groups with students. The researchers may also observe the children
in class or have them do an assignment. The purpose, in the words
of one Noggin researcher, is to find out ``what sparks kids these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is nothing new about partnerships between schools
looking for money and businesses looking to corner the youth
market, companies like Noggin have taken the relationship to a new
level, using children as captive, if willing, subjects of market
research during the school day. Hard numbers do not exist, but
product research companies and advertising agencies say they have
signed up dozens of schools in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics think focus groups are out of place in schools, but
the partnerships are proliferating nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   At Cumberland Elementary School in Lansing, Mich., students have
taken time, occasionally class time, to participate in several
focus groups in each of the past four years. The students took
taste tests and answered opinion polls, earning from $2,000 to
$4,000 a year for the school.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's, a Catholic elementary school in Shawnee Mission,
Kan., has received about $1,000 this year for allowing students to
take part in Internet panels in which they answer questions over
the school computer. The school uses the money for extras like ice
cream parties or the petty-cash fund.
</P>
<P>
   And in Lynnfield, Mass., students at Our Lady of Assumption
elementary school spent two days last week taste-testing cereal and
answering an opinion poll that included questions about where they
got their news (Television? Radio? Their parents?) and what
television shows they liked.
</P>
<P>
   The principal, Martha Marie Pooler, compared the cereal
taste-test, for which the school received $600, to conducting a
science-class experiment. ``It's a learning experience,'' she said.
``They had to read, they had to look, they had to compare.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the partners to these deals _ companies,
school officials, teachers, parents and children _ are happy with
them. ``Our budget has been very tight in the past few years,''
said Rita Miragliotta, the Watchung School principal, who sought
parent and teacher approval before accepting Noggin's offer. ``If
we want extras, we have to be creative about ways to raise money.
And the children really seem to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the heads of other schools doing focus groups, Mrs.
Miragliotta says the deal with Noggin has been a boon. The new
channel, a joint venture of Nickelodeon and the Children's
Television Workshop, is a 24-hour, commercial-free educational
channel whose revenues come from subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Watchung students usually participate during recess. And the
children, Mrs. Miragliotta said, are learning some analytical
thinking _ and even computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   In-school focus groups are just one instance of the growing
corporate presence in public and private education. In recent
years, about 100 school districts have accepted profit-making
companies as sponsors or advertisers, according to the Education
Commission of the States, a Denver-based nonprofit group that
studies education issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Eanes Independent School District in Austin, Texas, sold
exclusive vending rights to Coca-Cola for $350,000 a year. For
selling similar rights to Pepsico, the Jefferson County School
District near Denver received $2.1 million over seven years, plus
$48,000 a year in scholarships. And New York City and Colorado
Springs now sell ad space on school buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increased level of sophistication with how
corporations are approaching schools,'' said the development
director of a New York City private school, who spoke on the
condition that he not be named out of concern that he would
jeopardize potential partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of paid polling in school is raising some criticism,
even among those who consider focus groups less offensive than
outright marketing to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that there should be some places left, like
school, where the kids are not targeted,'' said Marcie Wyant, a
consumer-science teacher at the Boynton Middle School in Ithaca,
N.Y., and one of a growing number of teachers who try to make
students aware of consumerism, commercialism and media literacy.
``Focus groups just shouldn't be done during taxpayer time.''
</P>
<P>
   David Walsh, president of the National Institute of Media and
the Family, a nonprofit group based in Minnesota, agreed.
``Whenever we cross the line of allowing commercial enterprises to
do their work during the school day on school time, I think it
raises questions,'' he said. ``The challenge here is, where do you
draw the line?''
</P>
<P>
   In October, the National Association of State Boards of
Education tried to draw the line by passing a set of principles to
help guide schools as they enter such partnerships. Among the eight
principles is the statement: ``Selling or providing access to a
captive audience in the classroom for commercial purposes is
exploitation and a violation of the public trust.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   State boards are free to set their own policies, and some did
with advent of Channel One, a company that provides free
televisions and broadcasts programs _ and commercials _ into
classrooms. Many school officials said they were not aware of the
national association's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it has dawned on product researchers that schools are
an ideal place to do their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to the realization in the corporate sector
that the education marketplace offers tremendous potential to sell
products and to gain access to the youth market, and through that
to the adult market,'' said Robert Reynolds, president of Education
Market Resources, a Kansas-based research company founded six years
ago that matches schools with corporate research projects. Its
clients include Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., Kellogg Co. and
Nabisco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds took care to distinguish between the companies
themselves and the firms that do research for them. ``Most
companies to this day do not think they can go into schools, and in
most cases they cannot,'' he said. ``If McDonalds was to approach
schools, a lot of people would perceive them as exploiting the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers convert their work into ``an educational
process'' for the children, Reynolds said, and they do not mention
which companies they are doing research for. In one recent project
for Nike, he said, his researchers gave children disposable cameras
and asked them to take pictures of their favorite place to hang
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids these days love the feeling of empowerment,'' he said.
``And we are empowering them, but we are doing it in a proper
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Lalley, a planning director at the Leo Burnett Co., a
Chicago-based advertising agency, said her agency had also begun
running focus groups inside schools in recent years. Less than a
year ago, Ms. Lalley said, the company created a special unit,
called KidLeo, to focus on marketing for children.
</P>
<P>
   At Watchung School about half the parents did not sign
permission slips, so their children do not participate in the
market research. A handful of those parents said they did not
approve of the program, and one wrote Mrs. Miragliotta to protest.
</P>
<P>
   That parent, John C. Fisher, called the focus groups blatant
commercialism. ``I think it's exploitative,'' Fisher said. He is a
vice president for HBO Downtown Productions, whose parent company,
Time Warner Inc., competes with Nickelodeon's parent, Viacom Inc.
Partly because of that potential conflict, Fisher would not allow
his children to take part in the research. But also he said, ``I
don't think this is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan J. Stohr, head of Watchung's School Review, a parent
advisory board, said that so far, the Noggin partnership had been a
positive experience. ``I would be very cautious of anything that
took away from curriculum time,'' said Ms. Stohr, who has two
children at the school. ``But this really hasn't. Beyond that, I
think exposure to this type of thing can be very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the students participating, 7-year-old Katherine
Carpenter, said she thought the Noggin projects ``look fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And Noggin executives said that their mission was simply to do
research to provide a better, more appealing educational channel
for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have programming that is highly appropriate for
children,'' said Tom Ascheim, general manager for Noggin. ``Our
mission is to serve kids' natural urge to learn. And we want to do
that by creating a place where learning is driven by them.''

PALESTINIANS TOLD TO SHUT THREE JERUSALEM OFFICES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Majed Khass, the Israel bureau chief of the
Palestinian Authority's news agency, carries press credentials
issued by the Israeli government press office.
</P>
<P>
   For four years he has worked unhindered from his main office in
the Israeli Arab town of Nazareth, adding a branch in East
Jerusalem two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Israeli plainclothes officers went to the East
Jerusalem bureau to serve notice that an order to close the office
was pending because it was operating illegally. Khass was given 12
days to contest the order.
</P>
<P>
   The warning to the Palestinian News Agency, known as Wafa,
followed an announcement last week by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that three Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem would be
closed. Netanyahu charged that they were run by the Palestinian
Authority in violation of Israeli sovereignty over the city.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Israeli-Palestinian agreements and Israeli law, the
authority can operate only in the regions of Palestinian self-rule
and may not maintain offices in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians contend that East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in
the 1967 Arab-Israel war, is the capital of a future Palestinian
state, while Israel asserts that it will forever remain part of its
own indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
   Two other offices received warnings Sunday: a prisoners' aid
group known as the Prisoners Club, which is run by the mainstream
Fatah movement of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the
Arab Muslim-Christian Committee, an interfaith office that
Netanyahu said served as the authority's bureau of Christian
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Israeli election approaching, the move against the
three offices has been interpreted by some Israeli commentators and
many Palestinians as a campaign ploy _ an attempt by Netanyahu to
show voters that he stands firm on control of all Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this office is illegal, why did they allow me to work as
Wafa bureau chief in Israel for four years?'' said Khass, noting
that no action had been taken against his Nazareth office.
``Netanyahu obviously wants to win extreme right-wing votes at the
expense of the Palestinians.''

 &HT;    REFUGEE AID BEGINS ARRIVING AS U.S. DEPLOYS HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS
TO ALBANIA

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania International relief aid began arriving here
Sunday as the United States announced it will send 24 Apache combat
helicopters and 2,000 troops for use against Serb targets in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches, expected to arrive in Albania in about a week, are
close-range gunships that will allow NATO to directly attack Serb
tanks and troops from beneath the blanket of clouds that has
protected them from other warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to deploy the helicopters came as bad weather
cleared in the region, allowing NATO to step up air attacks Sunday
night on targets in Yugoslavia, including the capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of Kosovar refugees in the region swelled beyond
360,000, the United States announced it will provide temporary
shelter for up to 20,000 ethnic Albanian refugees until they can
return home under international protection.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was announced on how quickly refugees might begin
arriving in the United States, or where they might go.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said they could be sent to the
U.S. Marine base in Guantanamo, Cuba thousands of Haitian refugees
were temporarily lodged several years ago or to military facilities
in the U.S. possession of Guam in the Pacific. Guam has been used
as a temporary holding facility for large numbers of Kurdish
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Various European nations said they will also take in as many as
100,000 other refugees who have fled Serb aggression in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Apaches can be flown in combat, both the North
Atlantic Council, NATO's political arm, and President Clinton would
have to sign off on their use.
</P>
<P>
   Apaches are the U.S. Army's most advanced helicopter for
supporting ground attacks against armored foes. Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said, however, that the planned deployment does not
presage the use of ground forces in Kosovo. Rather, he said, the
Apaches were ``a logical expansion'' of the ongoing air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give us the capability to get up close and personal to
the Milosevic armor units in Kosovo,'' Bacon said, making reference
to Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia.
``This will help NATO do more to kill armored forces quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches are being dispatched from a U.S. military base in
Germany and would fly out of Albania, which borders Kosovo. Bacon
said U.S. troops will man 18 battlefield rocket launchers that also
will be sent to Albania to protect the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   From Albania, the launchers could lob multiple missiles _ each
can disperse up to 950 bomblets across a wide area _ onto
practically any place in Kosovo, where Serbs have mounted a
widespread offensive against the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The exploding bomblets would typically blast an area moments
before the arrival of Apaches to reduce the threat of ground fire
against the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache flies low and fast and uses computerized targeting
systems to help it knock out tanks with armor-piercing laser-guided
Hellfire missiles, which can strike targets up to three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes hammered troops and military support positions
across the Yugoslav state of Serbia Sunday night for a 12th
straight day.
</P>
<P>
   NATO strikes earlier Sunday destroyed a heating plant, a large
fuel storage facility and a petroleum processing plant outside of
Belgrade, NATO officials reported from alliance headquarters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, ethnic Albanians continued pouring out of Kosovo,
testimony to the ongoing bloodshed and destruction there.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that
by midday Sunday some 360,000 Kosovar Albanians had fled the
country since NATO air strikes began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimated that up to 300,000 more had been forced from
their homes and were on the move inside Kosovo, pressing toward the
bordering republics of Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR estimated that there were 204,000 refugees in Albania,
115,000 in Macedonia and 33,000 in Montenegro as of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While food and tents have started to arrive, difficult logistics
in Albania continued to frustrate relief workers. The country's
primitive road system is at near gridlock. Thousands of trucks and
cars carrying refugees and reporters jam roads already congested
with vehicles carrying supplies, soldiers and aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tirana airport, forklifts were flown in to unload
backed-up aid flights. Planes there normally are unloaded by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Near northern Albanian town of Kukes, a team of 130 former
Italian army officers began setting up a tent city while French and
Albanian helicopters began flying in supplies. Nevertheless, most
food, clothing and shelter still must go on trucks that must endure
a harrowing seven-hour trek up narrow mountain roads to the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, some planes that flew in with relief supplies flew
out with refugees aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats have expressed grave worries about the influx
of refugees into Albania and Macedonia, two very fragile
democracies that risk being destabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing international effort, aid officials here
nevertheless expressed concern about meeting the immediate needs of
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is bad, but the aid organizations are gearing up
now,'' said Zakaria Kawi, an official at the Tirana office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ``The greatest need is for
food that can be eaten immediately. We're seeing people who have
been walking for long distances and are very hungry. The next issue
is getting them shelter.''

</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
had deployed monitors in Kosovo before the air strikes began, also
is stepping up its efforts in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Maisonneuve, a Canadian, has been assigned to lead the
organization's effort in Albania to gather information about the
refugee crisis and to begin interviewing ethnic Albanians about
their experiences in Kosovo. Their reports may be used to build a
case that Serb forces are committing war crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of refugees have reported that they have been forced at
gunpoint from their homes by masked Serb police, paramilitary and
soldiers and ordered to march to the border. The refugees also
report that many civilians have been executed. Because no
international monitors or reporters remain in Kosovo, there is no
way to verify these allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian officials deny that civilians have been mistreated
and have invited the ethnic Albanians to return. Despite the offer,
there have been no reports of refugees returning to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Maisonneuve, who heads the OSCE's verification monitors in
Kosovo's Prizren district, said his team of 70 would fan out across
Albania to take stock of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   After being briefed on conditions here Sunday afternoon, he said
it appeared that the aid organizations had been unprepared for the
huge flood of refugees. ``The organizations were caught
flat-footed,'' he said. ``But there's a great deal of aid coming in
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, appearing on NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' program, denied that the United States and NATO had
failed to anticipate the size of the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we did a great deal of pre-positioning,'' she
said. ``We were prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the 50th anniversary of the 19-member North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, forged between Western Europe and the United
States in the opening months of the Cold War as a buttress against
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization was not set up to deal with the happy
situations in life,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea. If the
alliance can succeed in ``bringing peace to Kosovo and stopping the
oppression,'' Shea said, ``that will be a perfectly happy
substitute for a birthday party.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials conceded, though, that 12 days of air strikes had
hurt, but not halted, the Serb offensive in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a cricket match,'' said NATO air commodore David
Wilby. ``We are really having to press hard against Serbian
military and police units.''

RESCUE CREWS HUNT FOR SURVIVORS OF DEADLY TORNADO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTON, La. _ Emergency crews searched on Sunday through the
rubble left by a tornado that devastated this small town on
Saturday, while survivors remembered the dead and injured at Easter
services.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, the authorities reported finding no more bodies,
leaving the death toll at six, with more than 100 people injured
and 200 forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Eight twisters were reported in northwestern Louisiana on
Saturday afternoon. But the one that hit Benton, about 10 miles
north of Shreveport, did by far the most damage, practically
destroying two mobile-home parks and a subdivision and causing the
only deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials blocked two of the three affected
residential areas on Sunday afternoon, allowing those who lived
there to enter only to check on the damage.
</P>
<P>
   At one mobile-home park, called Haymeadow, homes were splintered
and twisted unrecognizably.
</P>
<P>
   The skies were heavy with heat and humidity, and residents were
still without power in several parts of town. Power lines knocked
down by the high winds and flying debris were being replaced as
quickly as possible by Southwestern Electric Power Co., while other
emergency crews removed rubble and debris.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this town of 2,500 huddled together, but many
refused to speak with reporters. Shock was visible on the faces of
many.
</P>
<P>
   Church services with special Easter sermons were held, and
worshippers gathered to pay tribute to those who had lost their
lives and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Power was on in downtown Benton, so convenience and grocery
stores continued operating.
</P>
<P>
   A couple from Canada, who refused to give their names, took
refuge in their trailer when the storms hit. The woman said they
hooked the trailer down and prayed that it would be heavy enough to
withstand the winds.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHAT'S PAST IS PAST; WILL SAMMY HIT 71?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Where have you gone, Donnie Mattingly? Gone and
forgotten? New York does not turn its lonely eyes to you. New York
might not even remember you.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees open their fourth season a.m. (After Mattingly),
the absence of his name represents a remarkable development. Here
was the most revered member of the Yankees in years, and no one
talks about him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Two other developments are responsible: First, the Yankees have
won the World Series in two of the three Mattinglyless years _
their absence from the World Series matched his tenure with them
(1982-95) _ and second, his replacement, Tino Martinez, has
replaced him in run production and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   In his three seasons with the Yankees, Martinez has hit 97 home
runs and driven in 381 runs. In no three-year stretch did Mattingly
reach those totals, though he came very close and hit for a
significantly higher average. But Martinez's play and personality
have made him one of the team's most popular players.
</P>
<P>
   So, out of sight and out of mind it is for Mattingly as the
Yankees get set for what already has been a more tumultuous time
off the field than they had all of last season. General Manager
Brian Cashman soared through last season unscathed but this year
started badly _ in the owner's eyes _ when he lost salary
arbitration cases to Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was that mix-up over batting practice for Darryl
Strawberry one day in spring training when George Steinbrenner
ordered Cashman back to Tampa. Now there is the flap over Hideki
Irabu and the starting pitcher for Wednesday's game in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   A fat toad, Steinbrenner called Irabu last week. It was his most
picturesque pronouncement about a player in years and instantly
took its place with ``He looked scared stiff'' (Jim Beattie), ``He
spit the bit'' (Ken Clay), ``Mike Griffin has fooled us long
enough,'' ``We've seen enough of Tucker Ashford'' and ``Columbus,
here I come'' (Dennis Rasmussen).
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday, Steinbrenner played down the
Irabu brush fire and said Don Zimmer, the interim manager, can use
any pitcher he wants Wednesday. The owner was at his horse farm in
Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being with my horses,'' he said pleasantly. ``I can
communicate with them, and they can't communicate with you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees open in Oakland Monday night, the Mets play
their season opener in Florida Monday afternoon. This season, maybe
not even all of it, could determine the future of the Mets'
manager, Bobby Valentine, who has managed more games than any other
current manager without managing a post-season game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets spent Steinbrenner-like money to make the playoffs this
season, but they don't look as good in the glare of sunlight as
they did under the darkened skies of winter.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitching rotation that was their strength last
season suddenly looked vulnerable to the Mets' brain trust, and
there was last-minute scrambling to find another starter or two.
Bobby Bonilla and Rickey Henderson are not of an age or level of
play where a team bases its season on their production.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds, with the acquisition of Denny Neagle and
Greg Vaughn, seem to have made more imaginative moves and could
contend with the Mets and some others for the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Where moves are concerned, though, two of the most debated of
the off season will be on display in the same game Monday. In the
most attractive opener (which ESPN will televise to all but New
York and three other cities), Kevin Brown will pitch for the
Dodgers and Randy Johnson will oppose him for the Diamondbacks.
They pitched against each other six months ago in the playoffs when
they worked for other teams.
</P>
<P>
   But now their matchup is more intriguing because they epitomize
the excesses of the winter, Brown signing with Los Angeles for $105
million over seven years, Johnson with Arizona for half that amount
for four years.
</P>
<P>
   When the Diamondbacks opened last season against Colorado, they
were playing the first game of their existence. When the Dodgers
opened against St. Louis last season, Mark McGwire hit a grand slam
against Ramon Martinez in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew McGwire would hit an incredible 69 more home runs? Who
knew Sammy Sosa, who had never hit more than 40 home runs in a
season, would hit 66? Who knew what a magnificent show the two
would stage?
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone is asking if they can do it again. Now everyone is
asking if baseball will be able to perform an encore that will
match the Mark and Sammy Show in scintillation. No one, however,
should be disappointed if McGwire, Sosa and baseball fail to write
the sequel. Some seasons are special and aren't meant to be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Some careers are special, too. Talking of someone being out of
sight and out of mind, whoever thinks about Hank Aaron these days?
He is to be remembered this week because baseball will have a gala
celebration of the 25th anniversary of his 715th home run Thursday
night in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the accident of timing, though, Aaron would continue
to be ignored despite being one of the greatest players of all
time. Aaron's eclipse of Babe Ruth's career home run record did not
condemn Ruth to the trash bin of forgotten feats. Maybe the
anniversary will trigger a surge of renewed interest in the man who
should never be forgotten. &QL;

   KUKES, Albania _ Kosovo refugees are spread across the stony
hillsides here after days of agonizingly slow, terror-stricken
flight from Serbian forces, sleeping in the open or under the thin
shelter of plastic sheets stretched over their farm carts.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of human waste mixes with the smoke from their cooking
fires and the dust kicked up by the tractors on which they fled.
Many have not had food or water for days and stare silently,
haunted maybe by the memory of being hounded from their homes or
simply numbed by the physical exhaustion and psychological
emptiness of a life on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Their ordeal is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tears in their eyes when they cross the border
because they think it's all over,'' said Dorian Vienneau, one of
the observers from the Organization for Cooperation and Security in
Europe stationed at the Morini border crossing that is the main
transit point between Kosovo and Albania. ``They don't know they
are facing another nightmare, the nightmare of being a refugee,
with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The realization hasn't dawned on them that they have just
arrived in the poorest country in Europe,'' he said. ``There's a
higher standard of living in Kosovo. The roads are intact, they
collect the garbage, the telephones work.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees and other humanitarian aid
groups have been caught totally unprepared for what Albania on
Sunday called the ``biblical deluge'' of refugees from the Serbian
campaign to drive hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo, where they had constituted about 90 percent of the
population of some 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter of a million people have poured into the remote
mountains of northern Albania in the past eight days. Some 166,200
had arrived here by Sunday morning, and they kept crossing at the
rate of about 1,500 an hour throughout the day and into the night,
meaning 19,417 more arrivals by 8 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   In the even more primitive districts to the northwest, another
35,000 have arrived. Most walk on a road _ a path really _ across
the border where the danger of mines means that they mostly leave
vehicles behind. Another 140,000 have arrived in Macedonia and
Montenegro. And the numbers keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you one thing, the Serbs are a lot better organized
than we are,'' said Vienneau, looking at the line of haggard people
at the border stretching more than 20 miles back into Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   What is making things worse is that Albania has virtually no
resources or infrastructure. As a relief worker noted Saturday
night, one problem in bringing in relief supplies is that there is
apparently only one forklift in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies of plastic sheeting, the most basic of emergency
supplies, are running out here. Food is getting low in this
ramshackle town where every building is filled with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   This area is incredibly isolated, linked to the rest of Albania
by a single, twisting mountain road. Aid workers say their first
priority is to move people out of here to the capital, Tirana,
where they can be better housed and fed in emergency camps. The
Albanian government has mobilized battered buses and trucks to
carry people down the road, a six-hour journey in the best of
times, longer in the mud created by the rainy, cloudy weather that
has hampered NATO's airstrikes and made the refugees' existence
even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But more refugees keep coming and there are not enough buses and
trucks. Taxi drivers are charging 300 German marks _ the equivalent
of about $170 _ to go to Pristina. There were a few signs of
humanitarian aid arriving Sunday, but it was a mere trickle in the
face of the tidal wave of human misery coming across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, a tent city has sprung up near a power plant along
the crumbling road between Kukes and the border. The tents were
struck by about 100 Italian volunteers, normally mobilized for
disasters in their own country, under he direction of the Italian
Department of Civil Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Pisa Fire Department, Giuseppe Romano, and four
other strapping Italian firemen are directing the camp, which they
said would have about 500 tents, medical facilities and a field
kitchen run by the Red Cross. Late Sunday afternoon, a rich aroma
of tomato sauce was already wafting over the tents.
</P>
<P>
   Romano said the tents would be a transit area holding people
after they crossed the border and before they could get
transportation out of the mountains. He said it could serve about
3,000 people _ two hours' worth of refugees coming across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Italian and Albanian military helicopters flew nine loads of
food and supplies into the wild mountain area of the northwest on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers on Sunday handed out bottled water at the border
crossing for the first time _ many of the refugees are dehydrated,
which can be fatal _ along with apples and oranges. The last few
days they had been giving out only concentrated emergency vegetable
protein bars from Norway, called BP-5, resembling sticks of
plastic, and tiny jars of Gerber's peach baby food.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors of the World, a French volunteer medical aid group, set
up 15 tents for shelter on the muddy hillside next to the border
post on Sunday with another tent neatly stocked with packages of
medicine and cots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people coming here are traumatized,'' said Antoine
Pierce, one of the French doctors. ``Some are injured, some have
seen people killed in front of them, a husband killed in front of a
wife, three children in front of a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs, they are killing just for pleasure, the pleasure of
seeing Albanian blood,'' he went on. ``The people are already
leaving. We don't see young men; they are keeping them there. Some
regions are more barbarian than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do mostly emergency first aid here,'' he said. ``A
little surgery. If a person has a piece of mortar in him, we can
pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the refugees keep coming, with NATO estimating more than
300,000 people on the move inside Kosovo and much of its capital of
Pristina emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Hysni Ymera, 49, arrived with his family in the cart behind the
tractor he drove. His village, Suarek Supin, had been shelled, he
said. It was only some 20 miles from the border, but the journey
took 55 hours ``because there were so many cars and trucks on the
road.''

DEFECTOR TELLS OF SOVIET AND CHINESE GERM WEAPONS  
(EXCLUSIVE)
</HEADLINE>
  (Previously slugged CHINA-GERM-WEAPONS) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD and JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most senior defector from the Soviet germ-warfare program
says in a new book that Soviet officials concluded that China had
suffered a serious accident at one of its secret plants for
developing biological weapons, causing two major epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   The book also reports that Soviet researchers tried to turn HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, into a weapon and that even as the last
Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev, pursued peace openings with
the West, he ordered a vast expansion of the deadly effort to turn
germs and viruses into weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The defector, Kanatjan Alibekov, now known as Ken Alibek, says
in the book that as deputy director of a top branch of the Soviet
program, he knew of the disaster in China because he saw secret
Soviet intelligence reports twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   Spy satellites peering down at China found what seemed to be a
large biological-weapons laboratory and plant near a remote site
for testing nuclear warheads, he wrote. Intelligence agents then
found evidence that two epidemics of hemorrhagic fever swept the
region in the late 1980s. The area had never previously known such
diseases, which cause profuse bleeding and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analysts,'' Alibek said, ``concluded that they were caused
by an accident in a lab where Chinese scientists were weaponizing
viral diseases.'' Viral scourges that cause intense bleeding
include Marburg fever and the dreaded Ebola virus. Both are endemic
to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   China has signed a 1972 treaty banning biological weapons.
During World War II it became one of the few modern countries to
experience their horrors when Japanese attackers sowed epidemics
there, killing thousands of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies have long suspected that China
harbors a biological-weapons program. Early in 1993, shortly after
Alibek fled to the United States, the outgoing Bush administration
accused Beijing of having an active germ-warfare effort, which it
has denied. The United States unilaterally ended its own
germ-weapons program in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return
several telephone calls seeking comment, and an American expert who
tracks germ intelligence said he did not know of any such epidemics
in China.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation is one of several in Alibek's new book,
``Biohazard,'' which was written with a journalist, Stephen
Handelman, and is being published by Random House this week. It was
made available to The New York Times in advance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials who know what Alibek said in secret
debriefings after his defection in 1992 give his new account
considerable credence. They have called him highly believable about
the subjects he knows firsthand, like the Soviet biological-weapons
program from 1975 to 1992, when he served as one of Moscow's top
germ warriors. He is less reliable, they say, on political and
military issues that he knows secondhand.
</P>
<P>
   The book asserts that Gorbachev, in his ``characteristic
scrawl,'' signed a five-year plan for 1985 to 1990 that ordered the
most ambitious effort ever for the development of deadly germs and
viruses, including smallpox, as weapons. In 1980, world health
authorities declared the ancient scourge eradicated from all human
populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gorbachev's Five-Year Plan _ and his generous funding, which
would amount to over $1 billion by the end of the decade _ allowed
us to catch up'' with the American biological weapons program,
which was making great strides, Alibek writes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, as Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika reform
campaigns were in full swing and the Russians and Americans were
negotiating new arms-control treaties, officials ``at the highest
levels,'' Alibek said, ordered the arming of giant SS-18
intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at New York, Los Angeles,
Seattle and Chicago with anthrax and other deadly germs.
</P>
<P>
   The secret move came as Soviet leaders publicly waged a peace
offensive. In his book ``Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country
and the World'' (Harper &AMP; Row, 1987), Gorbachev argued that for
decades Western experts had falsely accused Moscow of weapon
horrors and that the real engine of the arms race was the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted through his office in Moscow, Gorbachev sidestepped
Alibek's charges and questions about the germ program. His
spokesman said that Gorbachev did not know Alibek, and that there
was ``no sense in getting involved in an endless process of
commenting.''
</P>
<P>
   William C. Patrick III, a key figure in the United States'
former germ-warfare program who helped debrief Alibek after his
defection in 1992, said many of the book's assertions were
consistent with what Alibek had told U.S. officials in secret
sessions at the time. He called the information Alibek had provided
``critical'' to Washington's understanding of the Soviet program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laid it all out for the first time,'' Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the book's new disclosures are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Moscow mastered the art of rearranging genes to make harmful
microbes even more potent and harder to counteract. Anthrax, a top
biological warfare agent that causes high fever and death, was
genetically altered, he says, to resist five kinds of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   _ The top-secret program obtained a sample of HIV, the AIDS
virus, from the United States in 1985 and tried unsuccessfully to
turn the slow killer into a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   _ A senior military official told him that the Soviet Union had
waged germ warfare in Afghanistan from planes, spraying armed
rebels with glanders in an unsuccessful bid to subdue them.
Glanders is a chronic bacterial disease of horses that can be
highly lethal in humans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under a top-secret project known as Bonfire, Soviet scientists
in 1989 discovered ``a new class of weapons'' _ now called
bioregulators _ that could ``damage the nervous system, alter
moods, trigger psychological changes and even kill.'' The KGB
secret police agency was particularly interested in them because
they ``could not be traced by pathologists.'' A Soviet program
called Flute worked on germs and other agents that could be used
mainly for political assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   _ While directing about half of the Soviet biological-warfare
work force, he says, he discovered that an abandoned factory in
Kazakhstan where he and his childhood friends had played after
school had once made noxious germs meant to kill enemy crops and
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Alibek, a Kazakh by birth, says the Soviet state
devoted a considerable part of its treasury to readying deadly
germs for war. At its peak in the late 1980s, he writes, the
program had 60,000 employees working at scores of sites throughout
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans had just two specialists in anthrax,'' he wrote
of his observations during his first tour of U.S. sites as part of
a Soviet-American inspection agreement in 1991. ``We had two
thousand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen of the 40 institutes that were part of
Biopreparat, the civilian cover group that Alibek helped run, were
used ``exclusively'' for offensive agents and weapons for the
military, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After he fled Russia and took up residence in the United States,
Alibek says, he was approached by intermediaries of emissaries of
several countries that courted him for his deadly expertise,
including South Korea, France and Israel. The work for which he was
to be hired was defensive, the intermediaries said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 people who used to work in the Soviet germ-warfare
program now work in the United States in nonweapons work, he
writes. It is impossible to know how many have been recruited
overseas. But there is no doubt, he adds, ``that their expertise
has been attracting bidders,'' including countries unfriendly to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The germ warriors staying behind apparently can be dangerous as
well. He said he had recently received a disconcerting flier from a
Moscow-based company, Bioeffekt Ltd. ``It offered, by mail order,
three genetically engineered strains of tularemia,'' Alibek said.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, spread by a highly infectious germ, causes chills,
fever, muscle aches, fatigue and pneumonialike symptoms, and can be
fatal. The altered bacteria, he said, reportedly have new genes
that increase the disease's virulence. The flier, Alibek said,
boasted that the germs were produced by ``technology unknown
outside Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Alibek has said he decided to speak out publicly to fight the
spread of biological weapons and to seek absolution for having made
them.
</P>
<P>
   He described himself as once a ``staunch patriot'' who believed
until his tour of U.S. biological sites while still a Soviet
official that the United States had not unilaterally renounced
offensive germ-weapons programs in 1969 as President Nixon had
asserted. He said he had decided to write about the weapons program
that was for decades one of Moscow's deepest secrets.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO moved Sunday to assume responsibility
for the hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees, announcing that
it would begin the first massive airlift of its 50-year history to
bring in supplies and take out almost 100,000 people to temporary
shelter in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of what has become a two-front conflict between
NATO and Yugoslavia, the allies sought to take advantage of a break
in the weather by stepping up the bombardment. The pace of allied
air assaults on Yugoslavia has dramatically increased in the last
few days after an initial phase in which only 15 percent of the
military flights were actual bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
   With the flood of refugees exceeding 350,000 since the bombing
began, according to U.N. figures, NATO mounted emergency relief
efforts in Macedonia and Albania, where the tide of hungry and
desperate refugees has overwhelmed aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance was sending 6,000 to 8,000 troops into Albania to
help with refugees there and redirecting the 10,000 soldiers in
Macedonia that had been intended for a peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo. The allies also planned to ferry refugees out on relief
planes and other aircraft. Of the 100,000 total, the United States
planned to take in about 20,000, but planned to house them in Guam
or Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, temporarily, not in the continental United
States. The rest were destined for temporary camps in Turkey and
other European countries in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee crisis has become inextricably woven into the
allies' military strategy after NATO failed to predict the ferocity
of the Yugoslav drive through Kosovo and committed itself to weeks
of bombing and no ground forces, a plan that leaves no room for
dealing with the Yugoslav forces that are reported to be driving
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, charged this
weekend that the flood of refugees was part of a deliberate
strategy by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to destabilize
the Balkans and tie down the allied governments by having them deal
with humanitarian, not military, issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a calculated, deliberate, arranged, preplanned
humanitarian catastrophe,'' Clark told a small group of reporters
on Saturday at the alliance's military headquarters. ``It serves
two purposes. Not only does it change the demographics in Kosovo,
but it helps to destabilize Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO's eventual goal is to return the refugees to
Kosovo, the prospects for doing so in the near future are bleak.
NATO acknowledges that its air campaign has had little effect in
stemming the Yugoslav effort to evict ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's military goal, NATO officials said, is to do so
much damage to the Yugoslav military and to institutions propping
up the Milosevic regime that Belgrade will ultimately agree to a
political settlement for Kosovo or, at least, withdraw its military
forces from the province so that the refugees can return under NATO
protection.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's protracted timetable, however, means that hundreds of
thousands of refugees must be taken care of in the meantime, and it
was this escalating problem that preoccupied the alliance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea announced that Germany had
agreed to temporarily resettle 40,000 of the refugees. The United
States has promised to accept 20,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the refugees might be kept at Guam,
Guantanamo Bay or some other location not in the continental United
States. The United States maintains a Marine camp at Guantanamo
Bay, which is on Cuba, that has been used in the past as a
detention center. Turkey will also accept 20,000. Norway will take
6,000, and Canada and Greece each will resettle 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that 80,000 refugees were expelled from Kosovo on
Saturday, but other organizations, including the U.N. high
commission for refugees, said the number was much smaller, about
18,000. According to the U.N. body, about 350,000 of the 1.8
million ethnic Albanians have fled across the borders of Albania
and Macedonia since March 24, when the bombing began. Another
60,000 refugees were trapped in a ``no man's land'' in southern
Kosovo, near Albania and Macedonia; many of them have been without
food for two days, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that it will be difficult for U.N. refugee workers
to cope with the situation, NATO offered Sunday to take the lead in
coordinating the humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is sending 6,000 to 8,000 troops into Albania to
help with the mass of refugees there. The NATO commander in
Macedonia, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson of Britain, has been
ordered to mount the refugee assistance effort there. Jackson is
the commander of 10,000 troops in Macedonia that had originally
been intended for a peackeeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's force plans to build tent cities for refugees, three
of which are already partly operational. The ultimate goal is
provide accommodations for 20,000 refugees. So far, 3,500 refugees
are living in these tent cities.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the flow of refugees, Macedonia had closed its
border. But Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
flew to Skopje, Macedonia, on Saturday and urged Macedonia to
reopen its border, which it did.
</P>
<P>
   To help take the pressure off of Macedonia, members of the NATO
alliance have agreed to resettle nearly 100,000 on a temporary
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Transporting the refugees is likely to be a daunting and complex
task. Some of the refugees will be flown out on cargo planes that
have delivered relief supplies. Since some cargo planes are not
configured for passengers, some passenger planes will also have to
be flown in.

   Some European diplomats, however, questioned the feasibility of
the plan. Emma Bonino, the European commissioner for humanitarian
affairs, told a press conference in Brussels Sunday that taking
refugees to Europe and North America would merely assist Milosevic
with his campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' and break up families.
She said that camps for the refugees should be established in the
Balkans and nearby central European nations.

   Albania, already groaning under the weight of refugees, has

   Though NATO has conducted 11 days of bombing raids, the
alliance's air war is, in a sense, just beginning to get under way.
NATO's air forces have been relatively small and have encountered
both bad weather and restraints on what sorts of missions military
pilots may fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said, for example, that it launched 2,700 air
missions during the first nine days of the campaign, but that is a
small fraction of the combat flights carried out during a
comparable period of the 1991 Persian Gulf war. And of the 2,700
mission, only 15 per cent of them were bombing strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, NATO is expanding its force and attacking a
broader range of targets, including the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request from Clark, the Pentagon announced
Sunday that it was dispatching 24 of the U.S. Army's Apache attack
helicopters and 18 surface-to-surface rocket launchers to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets, which will include longer-range missiles, would be
used to attack air defenses so that Apache helicopters, armed with
anti-tank Hellfire missiles, could fly into Kosovo to seek out and
destroy Yugoslav armor and military vehicles. About 2,000 Army
troops will be sent to Albania to operate, maintain and protect the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a week or longer to get the weapons to Albania, the
Pentagon said. They will not be used until the North Atlantic
Council, the political arm of NATO, formally agrees, and President
Clinton provides final approval.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Army helicopters in Kosovo would technically
puncture the Clinton administration's promise not to employ ground
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said, however, that it preferred to think of the
Army helicopters and ground-based rockets as an extension of the
air campaign. It also insisted that the Army units being sent to
Albania were not the opening wedge of a larger invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure and simple an expansion of the air operation,''
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Also fulfilling a request of Clark, the United States has
ordered the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to the Adriatic Sea
and dispatched 13 F-117s to Europe, essentially doubling the number
of ``stealth'' fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's decision last week to broaden its target list has
already had an effect. Early Sunday morning, cruise missiles struck
Belgrade for a second night, hitting several locations.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said that NATO had hit a thermal power plant,
which supplies heat and hot water to many of the city's residents.
The NATO military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby, insisted
the alliance had attacked a nearby fuel storage site, but offered
no further explanation or details.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also said it hit an ammunition factory, an oil refinery and
a bridge during its evening raids. Yugoslavia said that three
civilians were killed in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the clouds and rain that have bedeviled the NATO air campaign
began to lift, military officials said the bombardment over the
next few days would be particularly intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are geared up to make the absolute most of the break in the
weather, and you will see us press home our attacks,'' Wilby said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces, however, have been pressing their attack and
were moving into position for a final assault against the Kosovo
Liberation Army near the Albanian border. Albanian news
organizations said the Yugoslavs had used two Mig planes to attack
the village of Popova, though this could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials also offered new information Sunday about Ibrahim
Rugova, the ethnic Albanian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the alliance had received reports from associates of
Rugova indicating that Yugoslav soldiers had moved into the
Albanian leader's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no freedom of movement but has to report to the local
police station several times a day,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Shea said, the alliance had information that Yugoslav
officials had altered Rugova's call for a halt to violence in
Kosovo in a taped television message. As edited by Yugoslav
authorities, the message suggested Rugova was opposed to NATO
bombing. Recent pictures televised in Belgrade of a meeting between
Milosevic and Rugova were more than a year old, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   On another development, a Western official said there was
evidence that the three American soldiers now being detained in
Yugoslavia were kidnapped by Yugoslav special forces who crossed
into Macedonia and took the Americans out.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has also toughened its stance about what sort of
peace settlement it will seek in the region. Increasingly,
officials no longer talk about returning to the formula worked out
at the Rambouillet Castle in France in which Kosovo Albanians would
be given maximum autonomy as part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   That formula was accepted by the Albanians but rejected by
Belgrade, which then launched its campaign of ethnic cleansing.
Instead, there is increasing discussion of a possible NATO
protectorate, an entity whose existence would be guaranteed by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces might even escort the refugees back to Kosovo
without a peace agreement with Belgrade under this plan, though
such details have not been agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of an acceptable solution relying on Rambouillet is
increasingly remote,'' a senior Western official said.

EDITORIAL: A VISIT BY CHINA'S PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 5:
</P>
<P>
   Too often in the past six years, the Clinton administration has
let its pursuit of diplomatic engagement with China take precedence
over other important American interests, like defending human
rights and protecting sensitive military secrets. The visit this
week of China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, should be used to
encourage a more exacting approach.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Zhu's visit, which begins Tuesday in Los Angeles
and moves on to Washington later in the week, should be conducive
to a sober exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
   China strongly opposes NATO's airstrikes on Serbia. Washington
is challenging Beijing's human rights record at U.N. meetings in
Geneva. Meanwhile, efforts to finalize agreement on China's
admission to the World Trade Organization, once planned as the
visit's centerpiece, have hit a snag over Beijing's reluctance to
open some of its markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration should use the Washington segment of
the trip for a candid discussion of current differences. The White
House ought to make clear that its actions in Geneva come in
response to Beijing's crackdown on dissent, which began after
President Clinton visited China last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The administration should explain American policy on Kosovo and
dispel Chinese fears that a precedent is being set for future
international military intervention in Tibet or other Chinese
regions troubled by ethnic strife. Zhu, as China's most powerful
economic official, might be able to help bridge the remaining
differences over Chinese membership in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu has established himself as China's most powerful economic
reformer, guiding programs to sell off or close down money-losing
state companies, shrink government ministries and divest the army
of its business empire. These reforms have been slowed by the Asian
economic crisis, but Zhu seems determined to see them through. He
has also been a relatively moderate voice on political issues,
though his interest and his influence in this area are not as
great.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever his personal inclinations, Zhu is part of a Chinese
leadership that suppresses peaceful political expression and
worries some of its neighbors with its belligerent rhetoric and
provocative military activities. China's government is also
suspected of stealing America's nuclear weapons secrets and
illegally funneling money into the 1996 Democratic presidential
campaign. The administration must clearly convey strong American
concerns about all of these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu is a lively and articulate personality, far more at ease
with Western audiences than other Chinese leaders. He has a
well-earned reputation for speaking clearly, without diplomatic
evasion. Administration officials who meet with him should be
equally direct.

COMMENTARY: THE QUIET NOISEMAKER
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a New Year's Eve episode of the '50s program
``Candid Camera,'' the interviewer Allen Funt went into a Times
Square novelty shop and asked for a noisemaker that was not too
loud. Before long, the unsuspecting salesman was earnestly pitching
him ``the quietest noisemaker on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the NATO strategy in the Serbian war: light up the
television skies with nighttime explosions, but exercise restraint
_ fighting to win would be much too noisy.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of this feckless approach was in the glorious pictorial
of the destruction of the Interior Ministry in downtown Belgrade.
Our cruise missile caused a great blaze at one o'clock in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   What determined the choice of target and time of attack? Not the
weather, nor the danger of anti-aircraft defenses _ the two reasons
most often given for our ineffectual jabs. Cruise missiles are
impervious to both.
</P>
<P>
   The target site was chosen because it symbolized
``infrastructure.'' We knew the building's occupants, forewarned,
had been evacuated a week before. The post-midnight time was chosen
to make doubly certain that nobody directing the sweep to make
Kosovo Albanian-rein was on hand to be killed, and that flames
would show up vividly against the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   That was a propaganda mission. Its target was not so much the
Serbian population, but the watching world _ to offset the pictures
of refugees in misery by showing that a fierce NATO was really
letting the war criminals have it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Third Way in foreign policy. One way remembers the
Munich analogy, and aims to stop Milosevic in Kosovo lest internal
aggression become the way of the world. The opposite way remembers
Vietnam and avoids quagmires at all cost.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of Europe, followed by Clinton, have chosen the
Third Way: neither to stop nor to ignore the aggressor, but to
punish evildoing in a low-risk manner. NATO's military mission is
to lose honorably while making the winner pay a cost. Thus do we
establish the principle of collective insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is better equipped to sell this than Bill Clinton. He
believes he knows something that the idealists and the hawks and
the Never Again set do not know: the American public will no longer
sustain a war with casualties. Who wants to die for the credibility
of NATO? Unless the U.S. fleet is sunk as at Pearl Harbor, avoid
the use of infantry.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that lifelong insight and supported by polls that
bolster it, he does what he does best: he positions himself at the
head of public opinion's slow-walking parade. But he knows the
public needs a sense of sacrifice, an illusion of moral
righteousness, to go with its abdication of global responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Clinton's rhetoric about the need to stand up to a new
Hitler; his condemnation of near-genocide; his history lesson that
two World Wars started in this region; his solemn warning that
Milosevic will be held responsible for the lives of captured
Americans; his hint that Kosovo can now no longer be ruled by
Serbia; his call for patience in ``staying the course.'' By all
this he assumes the posture of resolve.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact he is, in Churchill's phrase, ``resolved to be
irresolute.'' The course we are staying is not to defeat the
Serbian expulsion of a million human beings, but merely to
``diminish the capacity'' of Milosevic to do what he has already
shown himself to be quite capable of having done.
</P>
<P>
   We'll make him pay, Clinton assures us; you just wait, he'll be
sorry. Rollback is not promised but modified payback is; to assuage
our conscience, we'll make the victor feel some of his victims'
pain. But the hesitancy that seeps from such conscience, as another
Hamlet said, makes cowards of us all. One of these days, Slobo (and
Saddam) may lay hands on a half-stolen Russian nuclear missile _
and that's the end of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps our president awaits some change in popular opinion to
give him cover for military action beyond telegenic punitive air
strikes. If revelations of horror make that happen; if safely
silent presidential candidates urge rollback; if the NATO's
anniversary in Washington pushes him forward _ then we may
celebrate leadership from the man who now still seeks his quiet
noisemaker.  &QL;

NETS COACH IS THE KING; HIS LEGIONS WIN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Don Casey was standing outside the visitors' locker
room at the FleetCenter on Sunday, basking in the considerable
afterglow of the New Jersey Nets' third straight victory and sixth
impressive performance in a row, when Stephon Marbury walked by,
smiled and called his coach ``the king.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, the Nets' interim coach since John Calipari was dismissed
on March 15, laughed it off and continued answering questions from
the news media when Kendall Gill approached, smiled and yelled
excitedly, ``The king and his court!''
</P>
<P>
   Though their references to Casey were made in humorous ways,
Marbury and Gill meant what they said: Casey is the king, and the
Nets _ 91-79 winners over the Boston Celtics on Sunday _ like where
he is leading them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his nickname, the king,'' said Gill, who tied a league
record with 11 steals in Saturday's victory over Miami, and then
made seven more steals against the Celtics. ``When he came in as
the coach, he said, `I'm the man, and I'm the king.' That's why we
call him the king now.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and the fact that Casey, 61, has the Nets (8-24) playing
some of the best basketball in the Eastern Conference. Sunday's
rout of the Celtics, a game the Nets led from horn to horn and by
as many as 18 points, was the latest in a string of games in which
the Nets have played as if reborn.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory followed victories over Miami and Atlanta and
close losses to Orlando, Cleveland and Indiana. As was the case
Saturday against Miami, the Nets beat Boston (10-21) with
outstanding defense that was sparked by the rejuvenated Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Roaming the perimeter like a roving linebacker in football, Gill
seemed to get his hands on everything. He slapped balls away from
unsuspecting dribblers and anticipated and intercepted crosscourt
passes. With 26 steals in his last four games, Gill is now the
league's leader, with 2.38 per game. He was ranked 11th only two
games ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the defense that we play, that just opens up everything
for me,'' said Gill, who also scored 19 points. ``I can cheat. I
can go on rotations. I can anticipate. That's why it's so easy for
me now. I want to be a defensive specialist and a ball hawker.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill had plenty of help from his suddenly defensive-minded
teammates. Kerry Kittles, playing inspired for one of the few times
this season, had four steals and 13 points, and the Nets forced
Boston into 23 turnovers. Even Keith Van Horn, rarely praised for
his defense, stripped the ball from a couple of Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're one of the best slapdown-steals teams in the league,''
said Boston coach Rick Pitino, whose team has lost 16 of its last
20 games. ``They are also one of the fastest teams. That's a unique
quality to have, because those types of hands, stripping at a
basketball, can deflate you, because it not only takes away two
points for you, but it leads off the steal to two points for their
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who waged a nice one-on-one battle with Antoine Walker
(32 points), led the Nets with 25 points. Though he made just
6-of-19 field goals, he hit all 13 of his foul shots to boost his
string of consecutive free throws made to 44, dating back six
games. He needs 11 more to tie Sam Cassell's franchise record of
55.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' swarming perimeter defense powered their running game,
and they outscored the up-tempo Celtics by 20-6 in fast-break
points. Marbury led most of the breaks, tossing pinpoint passes, to
finish with eight assists and 20 points in proving far superior to
Kenny Anderson (13 points, three assists) in the matchup of
legendary New York City and Georgia Tech point guards.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury crushed Anderson on one fascinating spin move and layup
that gave the Nets an 83-68 lead with eight minutes left. Moments
later, Gill pilfered the ball one last time and finished with a
two-handed dunk to complete a 10-0 run that buried the Celtics for
good.
</P>
<P>
   A noteworthy performance was also turned in by Jamie Feick. In
attempting to fill the void left by Jayson Williams, who broke his
right leg three games ago, Feick grabbed 12 rebounds and gave the
Nets a semblance of toughness in the paint. When referred to as a
``poor man's Jayson Williams'' by a reporter, Feick replied: ``Poor
man's Jayson Williams? How about a poor man's Charles Oakley? It
don't matter. Either one of them is a great comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Casey's stock is growing as fast as Feick's. Before
Saturday's victory over Miami, the Heat television network referred
to him as ``the captain of the Titanic.'' Now his rank has risen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I declared myself the king at the last meeting,'' Casey said.
``Jayson was the prince. The rest of them are like serfs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Van Horn. ``As long as we win,'' he said,
``I'll be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And Casey will be king.

SPORTS COLUMN: DON ZIMMER, AN OLD PRO WHO DOESN'T NEED THE JOB  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He uncapped the vial and dug out his morning
dosage. The pills clattered on the desk, like dice on a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never took a pill in my life till three years ago,'' Don
Zimmer muttered Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he suffered a serious beaning, but that was in his
youth. This is old age, an arthritic knee just scoped out in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all crippled up,'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   He should be going at half pace, reposing in the dugout,
whispering advice like Yoda on half pension. Instead, he is
managing the Yankees until Joe Torre comes back, or George
Steinbrenner fires him, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer does not need the job. He made that abundantly clear over
the weekend in one of the most stirring speeches ever delivered in
a major league dugout, a mixture of Patrick Henry saying, ``Give me
liberty or give me death,'' and Johnny Paycheck singing, ``Take
this job and shove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer emphatically does not want to be the manager, but as long
as he is the manager, he is going to act like the manager. Zimmer
flat-out refused what he thought was an ultimatum to rush Hideki
Irabu back into the rotation. If George doesn't like it, well,
tough.
</P>
<P>
   The salty old dog seems to have made his point. From afar, as of
Sunday, Steinbrenner was saying it was all a failure to
communicate. Like most bullies, Steinbrenner responds best to a
thump in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've ever heard is, `Do it the way you want,' '' Zimmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre hired him for his blunt honesty, before they ever had a
chance to be close friends. Now Torre is recuperating from surgery
for prostate cancer, and has named Zimmer the interim manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he said to me was, `I won't come back too
early,''' Zimmer said Sunday. ``I said, `Don't do it.' I'm walking
like a cripple myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer wishes his pal could come back sooner rather than later.
The old boy blustered, ``Heck, I'll put him on my back and carry
him.''
</P>
<P>
   At 68, Zimmer has been talking about retirement after this, his
51st season in baseball. Then last Thursday, Irabu failed to cover
first base and incurred the wrath of George, who called Irabu a fat
toad, ugly words spoken in anger.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer had to watch the team be delayed for 90 minutes while
Steinbrenner deliberated Irabu's fate. It was vintage George, back
to the bad old days when he would banish the elderly general
manager, Gabe Paul, to the hotel room after the Yankees lost a big
game. Only now the victim was a foreigner, isolated by language and
custom, and George came down on him with hobnailed boots.
</P>
<P>
   With Irabu grounded in Florida, Zimmer did what any manager
would do. He came up with Plan B, naming Ramiro Mendoza as
Wednesday's pitcher. Steinbrenner, having apologized, decently, to
Irabu for his crude words, now suggested Irabu could pitch
Wednesday, and added that he was Irabu's only true friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing would've been said if he didn't come in there ranting
and raving,'' Zimmer blurted Saturday, and commented about
Steinbrenner's newly formed friendship with Irabu: ``I think that
stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Zimmer went back to his hotel room and saw
the red light blinking. Was it a message from George?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very possible,'' Zimmer said. ``I can't say I didn't expect
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was a message from his wife, who was driving north
from their home in Florida to New York, a trouper of a baseball
wife, as she has been for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning Zimmer spoke by telephone with Torre, who is
recovering at his home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe said, `How do you feel?,' not sarcastically at all, but as
if he understood,'' Zimmer recounted. ``I said, `I feel good.' And
Joe said, `It's good that you feel good.' ''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the ball park, Irabu asked to speak with Zimmer and his
teammates, a gesture straight out of Japanese culture, in which
people are trained to be responsible to the group. Zimmer could
relate to that. He played in Japan near the end of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Zimmer said of his days there. ``I didn't know
what was going on. Norm Larker was the other American, and they
gave us an interpreter, but he wouldn't repeat what we said because
the Japanese are so polite, so Norm ran him off. He ran off three
of them. The last month we didn't have an interpreter at all. It's
rough, but I don't have a problem with Irabu. I never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's apology probably won't appease the ballplayers, who
don't have much tolerance for distractions or shoddy play. But Joe
Girardi said something gracious, and Zimmer said: ``This stuff is
over. Let's go play some ball.''

</P>
<P>
   _ The weather improved slightly for the 12th day of bombing,
allowing NATO to widen its attacks on Yugoslavia's civilian and
military infrastructure, including the destruction of a thermal
heating plant near Belgrade's center and the police academy in a
nearby suburb. The official Yugoslav media said that, in Serbia as
a whole, at least four civilians had been killed and 17 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces were moving into position for a final assault
against the Kosovo Liberation Army near the Albanian border.
Reports from Albanian news organizations, which could not be
independently confirmed, said the Yugoslavs had used two Mig planes
to attack the village of Popova.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, charged
that the flood of refugees was part of a deliberate strategy by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to destabilize the Balkans
and tie down allied governments.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United States ordered the aircraft carrier Theodore
Roosevelt to the Adriatic Sea and dispatched 13 F-117s to Europe,
essentially doubling the number of ``stealth'' fighters.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon said that over the next week, it would send 24
Apache attack helicopters, 18 surface-to-surface rocket launchers,
and 2,000 Army troops to operate them to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REFUGEES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ With refugees gathered by the tens of thousands in impromptu
camps along border areas of Macedonia and Albania, death, disease
and desperation are becoming commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO nations agreed to temporarily accept almost 100,000 of
the refugees. Germany said it will take 40,000; the United States
and Turkey, 20,000 each; Norway, 6,000, and Canada, Greece and
Austria, 5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO began emergency relief efforts in Macedonia, which has an
estimated 131,000 refugees, and Albania, with an estimated 190,000.
The efforts included building tent cities and bringing in food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of the 10,000 refugees blocked on the Macedonian border
at Blace were taken by bus to Stenkovec, in northern Macedonia, the
U.N. refugees agency said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROTESTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ In Athens, Greece, 6,000 people demonstrated against NATO
strikes in Yugoslavia, police said. Some threw red paint and gas
bombs at the French, Italian, British and U.S. Embassies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRISONERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ A Yugoslav Cabinet minister, Milan Bozic, said on American
television that the three soldiers would not be put on trial and
would be freed when NATO stops bombing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Responding to calls by some politicians to put Russia's
economy on a military footing so it can wield more influence in
Kosovo and other world affairs, the Russian foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, said his country must support the combat readiness of its
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Montenegro, President Milo Djukanovic, who has been quietly
trying to separate his small Yugoslavian republic from its much
larger neighbor state, Serbia, for more than a year, said that
NATO's actions have made his position ``much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DIPLOMACY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ The European Union warned Milosevic that he would be held
accountable for the ``Yugoslav campaign of ethnic cleansing'' in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pope John Paul II, before an Easter crowd of more than 30,000
people in St. Peter's Square, called for the creation of a
``humanitarian corridor'' to bring urgent relief to refugees.

MASTERS ADDS OBSTACLES TO POWER PLAYERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the world's best players prepare for Thursday's opening round
of the Masters, one topic is even hotter than David Duval, who
claimed his fourth victory of the year Sunday by getting birdies on
three of the last six holes at the BellSouth Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters, one of the game's most tradition-bound tournaments,
beefed up its defenses against the power game preferred by so many
of the players by making major course changes at Augusta National
Golf Club during the off season. Four holes have been remolded _
No. 2, No. 11, No. 15 and No. 17 _ and a second cut of rough has
been grown for the first time ever, measuring 1] inches, putting an
even greater emphasis on accuracy off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready to hear compliments, complaints and caustic comments
from players all week. But after Tiger Woods broke the course
record two years ago with his brilliant 18-under-par 272, it was
probably only a matter of time until something like this happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of changes over the years,'' said Hootie
Johnson, the Masters chairman, after the changes were announced.
``But yes, part of our reasoning or rationale for these changes is
that these young men are hitting the ball a lot longer. I think
these changes will hold up for the foreseeable future. The record
that Tiger broke stood for 32 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While the changes are not only about Tiger-proofing the course,
his record may stand for some time. The alterations, the most
dramatic at Augusta in 50 years, will probably make the scores a
little higher and the finishing holes even more nerve-racking,
requiring more accuracy off the tee and longer irons into the
greens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a prevailing thought that lengthening the course
and adding rough may favor long hitters like Woods and Duval even
more. Take No. 17, perhaps the most crucial change because it is
one of the finishing holes that could determine the winner. The tee
at the par-4, 425-yard hole has been moved back 25 yards, putting
the huge Eisenhower tree, 200 yards from the tee, back into play. A
short hitter will have trouble clearing the tree with a drive down
the left side, and the narrower driving area leaves less room for
error. Meanwhile, a long hitter like Woods can clear the tree with
a controlled draw tee shot, still leaving him with a short iron to
the green.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III, one of the game's long hitters, thinks too much
may have been made of the changes and their impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything they do to make it harder is better for the
long hitter,'' Love said. ``It is amazing that the last maybe three
years, people have gotten into the changes in the golf course.
Well, they have changed it every year since the tournament started.
It is a course that has always evolved. When you shut a course down
for the whole summer, what are you going to do? You are going to
fix things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walk through the clubhouse sometime and look at old pictures
of the holes the way they were when it was black-and-white film.
It's amazing. Not a hole on that course hasn't changed somehow. We
are not going to change the way we play. The greens are still going
to be the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, managing the greens at Augusta remains the key to
victory. The first challenge is to place the ball in the proper
area on the course's lightning-quick, undulating putting surfaces.
Then you still have to make putts once you get there.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters always has been a tournament where precision and
patience are rewarded, because the slope and speed of the greens is
so severe. Learning the nuances of the course remains critical.
Fuzzy Zoeller is the last player to win the Masters in his first
attempt (1979), and it has taken past champions an average of six
attempts before their first victory. Phil Mickelson said recently
that the Masters is the only tournament in which he can ever
remember lining up a medium-range putt and intentionally aiming to
miss. The slope of the green was so severe that the chance of
making the putt was extremely slim and aiming at the hole meant
taking the likely chance that the ball would race 40 feet past the
cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that, lining up a putt and trying to miss,'' Mickelson
said. ``It seems you only encounter those kinds of situations at
the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Augusta has always had its unique greens, the wide
fairways, lack of rough and perfectly manicured grass have allowed
players to get away with errant tee shots, unlike at the U. S.
Open, where a trip into the six-inch rough is often equal to a
one-stroke penalty. The fairways at Augusta are the widest that PGA
Tour players encounter. In 1998, the players in the Masters field
hit the fairways 83.9 percent of the time, compared with 69.6
percent during tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the rough at Augusta this year will have an impact,
but how much? On the one hand, only the most errant drives will
venture into the rough, and it is still short enough to allow
players to hit quality shots from it. On any shot from the rough,
however, it will be harder to spin the ball and stop it on the
slick greens.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the new rough, Ben Crenshaw, a two-time Masters
champion, put his thumb and his index finger less than an inch
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that course, even if you grow the grass that much, it will
have an impact,'' Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are predicting that the tournament's average score
this year will climb one and a half to two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will require more accuracy off the tee, and the greens will
still putt like linoleum,'' said Stephen Kay, a golf course
architect from Westchester County, N.Y., who has visited Augusta.
``It will definitely be more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   So be ready for a Masters with a slightly different feel. There
has always been a sameness to the Masters. It has always been
staged on the same magnificent golf course. It always concludes on
the second weekend of April. The winner is always adorned with a
green jacket, one of golf's most cherished possessions.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's winner will have overcome some new obstacles on
the path to victory. ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Love said.
``But who doesn't look forward to the Masters?'' &QL;

TRAINER BAFFERT TO FIELD TWO FOR KENTUCKY DERBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Bob Baffert plans a double-barreled assault on
Kentucky Derby history.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Baffert's General Challenge and Prime Timber
finished 1-2 in the Santa Anita Derby, the trainer said both came
out of the race in good shape and and indicated they'll be his only
representatives at Churchill Downs on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Did we say ``only''?
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who will shoot for an unprecedented third straight
Kentucky Derby victory, had left open the possibility he'd expand
his roster for America's greatest horse race by running one of his
star fillies or one of his less-proven colts.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday he ruled out the filly Excellent Meeting (``I know
she can't beat General Challenge'') and left just a slim chance for
Silverbulletday (``I don't want to throw her to the wolves''),
although both dominated their own sex in out-of-state races over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   They'll settle for the Kentucky Oaks _ the fillies' Derby _ on
April 30.
</P>
<P>
   And Baffert said Finder's Gold, an allowance-race winner
Saturday, and Straight Man, coming off his first defeat, will wait
for more suitable spots.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? General Challenge, a 3{-length winner of the Santa
Anita Derby, and Prime Timber, second with excuses, would join
Eastern-based Vicar as the Kentucky Derby favorites if the race
were held today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're two really good horses,'' Baffert said. ``They're the
kind of horses you want to go to the Derby with.''
</P>
<P>
   Among horseplayers, the question now is whether General
Challenge, ridden by Hall of Famer Gary Stevens, or Prime Timber,
with red-hot David Flores, is the West's strongest 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge has won four of five starts and was
untouchable Saturday. But he had less seasoning as a 2-year-old _
winning a maiden sprint in his only start _ than the vast majority
of Kentucky Derby winners. And he'll be shooting for the first
Derby victory by a gelding since 1929 (Clyde Van Dusen) and by a
California-bred since '62 (Decidedly).
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber looked good in the stretch in the Santa Anita
Derby, passing horses who should have benefited from a slow early
pace. And after needing treatment Friday on a bruised left hind
foot, he lost his right hind shoe early in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky he doesn't have two bruised feet,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   As for other prominent Santa Anita Derby horses:
</P>
<P>
   _Desert Hero (third) might run in the April 24 Derby Trial at
Churchill Downs, then the Derby and/or the May 15 Preakness,
trainer Richard Mandella said.
</P>
<P>
   _Charismatic (fourth) will go in the Derby or the April 18
Lexington Stakes at Keeneland for D. Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   _Capsized (sixth), who escaped serious injury when his left
front shoe bent and nearly came off, won't go to the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   _No plans were announced for Honest Lady (seventh), the only
filly in the Santa Anita race, but the Derby would seem to be out.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE PAST IS A DRAG ON IVERSON'S FUTURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of people are pulling for Allen Iverson to make it. The
women who kept a vigil in a Virginia courtroom during his 1993
trial. The former governor of Virginia who granted Iverson clemency
after he served four months in prison. The university and the coach
who accepted Iverson when other schools backed away. Even a growing
number of bored-to-tears members of the news media who feel that
the National Basketball Association should drop its Victorian
pretenses and embrace Iverson as the league's new messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, everyone seems to see Iverson's future except
Iverson, who appears trapped in an invisible cage that keeps him
pointed to his past.
</P>
<P>
   In January the 76ers gave Iverson a six-year contract extension
worth $70.9 million. Iverson reportedly has a $50 million multiyear
deal with Reebok that also features stock.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 76ers, trying to make the playoffs for the first
time since 1991, are slipping out of contention for the final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Iverson, enjoying his best
season, keeps turning the ball over. He didn't accompany the team
to Toronto for Sunday's game against the Raptors but stayed in
Philadelphia, ostensibly to get treatment for a strained and
severely bruised right quadriceps. And maybe to get an attitude
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Iverson and Coach Larry Brown got into a heated
exchange after Brown benched his 23-year-old star, who had shot 0
for 7, in the first quarter of a game against Cleveland. When Brown
told Iverson to go back into the game two minutes into the second
quarter, Iverson reportedly said, ``It's about time you put me back
in,'' while also using a profanity. Brown called him back to the
bench, and Iverson sat out the rest of an 85-80 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask a guy to go in the game, they go in the game,'' Brown
said at the time. ``I ask them to go out, they go out. That's the
way I coach. I'm the coach and I have the right to play a guy or
not play a guy. I've got to find out who's ready to play and who
wants to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not refer to Iverson by name, but said: ``I think
mature guys who care about their teams step up. I don't think we
have that maturity yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Brown said that Iverson said he was too injured to go
back into the game Friday night. Brown said they agreed that
Iverson would skip the trip to Toronto to get treatment for his
leg. ``The biggest disappointment is, it was a big game, a game we
really needed,'' Brown said. ``Do I like getting yelled at every
game? Absolutely not. But that's him. I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is symptomatic of the up-and-down nature of Iverson's life.
Last week he said: ``I have to play hurt. I can't sit out and watch
us lose.'' On Friday he said he would sit out ``two, three weeks or
whatever is necessary until I get to 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, however, an appreciative Iverson credited Brown with
steering his talent in the right direction. ``He's teaching me the
pro game,'' Iverson said. ``I didn't know anything about playing on
the professional level.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on Friday he and Brown were feuding. ``There was some
misunderstanding, a miscommunication, but I'm not going to get into
that,'' Iverson said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Brown and Iverson were at each other's throats.
Iverson promised to ``remember everything come contract time.''
Funny how money changes things. After signing the contract
extension, Iverson said he and Brown had put their differences
behind them. ``I just had to mature,'' Iverson said.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's inconsistencies are understandable; events have
happened so rapidly. Consider the arc of his life in the last six
years: in 1993 Iverson was convicted for his role in a brawl in a
bowling alley when he was 17. He was sentenced to five years in
prison, served four months and was granted clemency by L. Douglas
Wilder, then the Virginia governor. (The conviction was later
overturned.) Iverson attended Georgetown and played for John
Thompson, was named Big East rookie of the year, was an
all-American his sophomore year then became the first player taken
in the draft. Now, in his third season, Iverson may be the best
guard in the NBA. He is leading the league in scoring at 27.4
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled among these acts has been a spate of brushes with the
law: charges of illegal handgun possession and marijuana
possession, and lending his car to friends who were picked up on
drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Where is this career going? You can envision Iverson as a
35-year-old veteran reflecting on how he overcame events. Or you
can see him suffering one foolish slip too many.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson wants to ``keep it real'': the old community with its
mix of crime and punishment, hard times and good times. All of
that, however, is being overtaken by a life of ease, which is also
very real: fame; adulation; estates; luxury cars; medical care for
his sister, who suffers from seizures, security for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson is real enough; what the 76ers need him to become
is authentic.

FOR ZIMMER AND YANKS, IT'S PLAY BALL _ PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The New York Yankees hurriedly buried their
spring-training skeletons on Sunday before rushing off to Oakland
for Monday night's season opener. The Yankees' owner, George
Steinbrenner, insisted that the interim manager, Don Zimmer, was
autonomous; Hideki Irabu apologized to his teammates before
Sunday's workout, and Zimmer concluded the meeting by saying it was
time to play ball and win some games.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrations and bothersome issues of camp will be forgotten
if the Yankees perform even remotely as well as they did in 1998,
when they won a record 125 games overall and their 24th World
Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   If they establish a sizable lead in the standing, then Irabu can
laugh over the new moniker _ fat toad _ given to him by
Steinbrenner, and Zimmer will gladly return a successful team into
the hands of Joe Torre once Torre comes back from prostate cancer
in May or June.
</P>
<P>
   But the skeletons are there, below the surface, and the thinly
layered respite that opening day allows will quickly blow away if
the Yankees start slowly _ and, as Zimmer acknowledged Sunday, the
Yankees have not played well in the last days of spring training,
with their lineup loaded with regulars. Including their 8-4 loss to
the Dodgers here Sunday, the Yankees finished their exhibition
schedule with a 14-19 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to mean something to us is to get out there and
start winning ball games, starting Monday,'' Steinbrenner said in a
telephone interview from his farm in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Zimmer criticized Steinbrenner for his role in the
handling of Irabu in recent days, and for published comments
attributed to the Yankees' owner _ including a remark Steinbrenner
made about hoping Irabu would start against Oakland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who called him a fat pig, or a fat plum?'' Zimmer said
Saturday, referring to Steinbrenner's angry criticism of Irabu on
Thursday. ``Me? Who called him that? Who started it all? Nothing
would've been said if he didn't come in there ranting and raving.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Steinbrenner said he was not at odds with Zimmer as a
result of Zimmer's comments, and insisted that Zimmer would run the
team. ``He has no pressure on what to do,'' said Steinbrenner, who
added that he felt the meaning of two of his published comments was
twisted.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to start Ramiro Mendoza instead of Irabu on
Wednesday, Steinbrenner said, ``is the call of the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Period,'' he said. ``Exclamation. I've given him the players
and it's his job from that point on, whether it's Torre or Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't critical of Zimmer. He said, `I'll quit, I'm too
old.' I can't make up his mind for him. He has no pressure from us.
It's different from Joe, Zim is in a tough spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer's critical comments have to be taken in their context,
Steinbrenner believes: ``I think in the heat of the moment, Zim
just lost control. I chalk it up as zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer left multiple messages for Steinbrenner on Saturday
before speaking with reporters, but was unsuccessful in reaching
his boss. The message light on the telephone in his hotel room was
lighted late Saturday, and Zimmer assumed Steinbrenner had called _
but the message was from Zimmer's wife, Soot. Zimmer said Sunday
that he still had not spoken with Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``No news is good news, I guess,'' Zimmer said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu arrived here Saturday night, two days after the rest of
his teammates, still sorting through the mess he created when he
failed to cover first base in his last two starts of spring
training. He met with Steinbrenner, as did his agent, who told the
owner specifically of a personal issue that is bothering Irabu,
``something of a confidential nature,'' Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, through his interpreter, George Rose, Irabu
apologized to Zimmer and asked if he could address his teammates
collectively. Zimmer gave him the go-ahead, and with Irabu standing
at his side, Rose read a three-page statement that began, ``On the
last day of spring training, I caused a lot of trouble for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu acknowledged that he ``may have lost the trust of my
teammates and coaches during the many recent events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's natural that there is a lot of unease in the
locker room, too. Due to these recent events, there are a lot of
winds blowing around me. By that, once the season begins I'm not
sure what will happen and I don't know what type of winds will blow
my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu went on to explain that he used the two days in Florida to
contemplate what he needed to do. ``I've come to a conclusion: I
need to think about my responsibility, and what I need to do to
improve from here on out,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   When Irabu was finished, the veteran Joe Girardi offered some
sort of words of support, and then Zimmer said: ``Let's go play
ball. Let's get it over with and play baseball.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees worked out, Irabu practiced covering first base in a
drill designed by the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre, and Irabu
later said he was not upset that Mendoza would start Wednesday in
his place. Zimmer and General Manager Brian Cashman and several
players talked about how it was time to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu's mea culpa drew impatient grimaces from some
teammates. The words will be meaningless to many of them if Irabu
does not work harder, get in shape and win. The front-office peace
agreed upon Sunday almost surely will be jeopardized if the Yankees
play poorly at the season's outset and do not live up to
expectations. The Yankees' incredible 1998 season catapulted them
into the history books. Now, as they start the 1999 season, it will
hang on them. Winning early and often is imperative.

 &HT;    Augusta, here comes Duval
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No doubt about it. It's time for the PGA Tour to
change its advertising slogan. The David Duval factor has become
that huge.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the public relations. Forget that every golf swing is
created equal. Just toss away all the old footage and go with:
``This Guy Is Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, Augusta National, and it's a wonder nobody asked
Duval on Sunday what he's going to serve for next year's Champions
Dinner at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed as though the world's No. 1 player could not
further cement his case as the Masters favorite, Duval gathered a
few more electoral votes Sunday at the TPC at Sugarloaf, winning
the BellSouth Classic by two shots. Former Georgia Tech teammate
Stewart Cink was second.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Duval needed a dose of good luck at the finish and some
help from his self-destructing colleagues, but the result was just
as mind-boggling:
</P>
<P>
   _ It was Duval's fourth victory of the year. He ended at
18-under-par 270 with a final-round 67.
</P>
<P>
   _ It was his second in a row, following up a huge victory in the
Players Championship last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ It was his 11th victory in his past 34 events.
</P>
<P>
   _ It broke his PGA Tour single-season money record, pushing the
1999 total to $2,598,300. Last year he needed the entire season to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   _ It served as a decent performance in his first week as,
officially, the world's No. 1 player.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, nobody has touched such a streak. Jack
Nicklaus won 10 of 33 events in 1972-73.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not routine,'' said Duval in the interview area after
earning $450,000. ``I was nervous at the end. It never will be
(routine). Any time you have a chance to win, you get a little
jumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a little jumpy would have been understandable.
Thinking he needed a birdie at the 18th hole and unaware that Cink
had just bogeyed the 17th to fall to 16-under and two shots behind,
Duval went for the par-5 with his second shot. Then, instead of
aiming long to a safer spot, Duval went with a 2-iron from 230
yards. The ball landed short, rolled back toward the pond and
somehow stayed dry. From there, he chipped to three feet, missed
the putt and made par. ``I hit a pretty good shot, about where I
was aiming at,'' Duval said. ``I was surprised when the ball was a
yard short of the green. I was surprised when it didn't bounce up
on the green. Then I was more surprised it didn't come back into
the water. I was very lucky, very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning later of Duval's good fortune, Cink, who plays
regularly at Sugarloaf, said, ``I didn't know that. Hey, some times
when the breaks are going your way, it's destiny, I guess. He had a
pretty good break. I've never seen a ball do that since I've been
playing golf here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cink already had hit his layup shot on the 18th before
Duval's lipped-out 3-footer for birdie, he said eagle would not
have been an option, unless allowed to tee up a driver from 266
yards into the wind.
</P>
<P>
   A disappointed Cink earned $270,000 for second place on a
closing 70, but had company in the blown-opportunities department.
Tour rookie Rory Sabbatini tied for third with John Huston at
15-under. Sabbatini lost his chance by double-bogeying the 17th and
then hitting into the water for bogey at the 18th. Huston also
stumbled, bogeying the 16th and double-bogeying the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of events behind him, Duval said, ``I don't know if they
got bad breaks or if they hit poor shots or what it was. I got a
fortunate break on the last hole. There's no doubt about it. Other
than that, I hung around and just made a few birdies here and
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia player Franklin Langham of Peachtree City tied
for fifth at 14-under with 54-hole co-leader Mike Weir to earn
$95,000.
</P>
<P>
   For a two-week period, Duval could not imagine a more satisfying
development. The TPC happened in his hometown. The BellSouth is
where he owned the 54-hole lead as a Georgia Tech player, then
allowed serious chances to slip away in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   And now, he heads to the Masters. Last year he was a runner-up.
This week he'll be the obvious favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my head is where it needs to be,'' Duval said. ``I
think my golf swing and game is where it needs to be. I think it's
a good spot for me now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 12 days of allied air attacks against
Yugoslavia, military experts say the lack of detailed, after-action
reports _ routinely provided in past conflicts _ have made it
impossible to assess the allies' claim that they are steadily
dismantling Belgrade's war-making powers.
</P>
<P>
   In briefings at the Pentagon and at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, senior officials have refused to say exactly how many
attack missions have been launched; how many of those missions have
been completed despite the bad weather; how many bombs have been
dropped; or what, precisely, the bombs have hit.
</P>
<P>
   Such statistical summaries were provided on a near-daily basis
in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, even under an information policy that
journalists criticized at the time for being overly restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   In briefings over the past 12 days, allied officials have
instead used vague characterizations of progress, saying, for
instance, that they are ``degrading and disrupting'' the Yugoslav
forces and having ``a debilitating impact on their ability to
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   But they have repeatedly declined to specify what percentage of
Yugoslav weapons or forces have been destroyed. And citing cloudy
weather, they have released far fewer pictures than usual of the
damage inflicted . Without such pictures, it is unclear how they
are measuring their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Assertions of military progress have come under doubt given the
accelerated pace of ethnic cleansing by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.
At the current rate, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea has said, within two
more weeks the province could be emptied of the ethnic Albanians
the allies are trying to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the chief Pentagon spokesman, acknowledged that
``we are taking a more conservative approach than we have in the
past'' to the release of information. But he said the new secrecy
was necessary to protect the safety of allied forces. ``We know the
Serbs are watching us closely,'' he said. ``We are saying as little
as possible that could be used in defending against our sorties.''
</P>
<P>
   While attributing some of the new restrictions to the
particulars of this conflict, Bacon also suggested that a more
enduring precedent was being set. He said that the defense
secretary, William Cohen, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Hugh Shelton, have worried for several years that the
Pentagon had grown too open in discussing the conduct of wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, General Shelton and Secretary Cohen think we need to
change the culture of the Pentagon, and make people more alert to
the dangers that can flow from being too generous _ or you could
say profligate or lax _ with operational details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced information flow has been greeted skeptically among
military analysts and reporters. Some have wondered whether it is
meant to mask the lack of progress in a conflict slowed by bad
weather and fear of casualties. Others, including senior veterans
of the Persian Gulf War, merely express puzzlement over a policy
they say could be much more forthcoming without endangering allied
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more information that could be provided that
would in no way compromise security or safety and would provide a
better picture to the public of what's going on,'' said former
Marine Gen. Richard Neal, who conducted the daily briefings in
Riyadh during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting anything from those folks. There's a
concerted effort at withholding information, or maybe I shouldn't
say withholding it _ just not providing it. ''
</P>
<P>
   Neal, who also oversaw combat operations in the Persian Gulf, is
now a military analyst for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon dismissed as ``balderdash'' the suggestion that the new
policy was aimed at disguising problems in the field. ``We've been
very careful not to overplay success or to underplay success,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether more there would be more details released if the
war was going better, Bacon said: ``That's certainly true _ no,
that's not true. What's true is there'd be more information if the
weather was going better. We don't have particularly good imagery
to show what we're accomplishing on the ground because the
weather's been lousy. When the weather gets better, we'll release
more pictures.''

 &HT;    SCLC to bring police brutality to forefront
 &HT;    By Julie B. Hairston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership
Conference is launching a nationwide effort to raise awareness of
police brutality and to curb it.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sunday evening forum, a group of civil rights leaders heard
personal accounts from local residents about their experiences. The
group included former District of Columbia congressional
representative Walter Fauntroy, Washington, D.C., talk show host
Joe Madison, attorney and former Atlanta City Councilwoman Elaine
McGruder, SCLC President Martin Luther King III and SCLC General
Counsel Roxanne J. Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move into the new millennium, we are going to have to
mobilize all over this land and see to it that police receive human
relations training,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Fauntroy said 25,000 people rallied in Washington, D.C.,
Saturday to protest what he called ``an epidemic of violence
directed by police all over this country'' at blacks and other
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience of about 50 people in the King Center
auditorium that SCLC President King would be holding similar forums
in other cities to bring attention to incidents of police brutality
and misconduct and generate discussion about how to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   The panel heard from local residents who related incidents of
alleged police misconduct in Gwinnett and Clayton counties.
</P>
<P>
   Douglasville, Ga. attorney Lucinda Perry related the story of
her client, who was approached by Gwinnett County, Ga. police just
after he had dropped off his six-year-old son with a baby-sitter.
As his child watched from the baby-sitter's window, Perry said,
police held a pistol to the back of her client's neck while he
knelt in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Perry is representing her client in a lawsuit against the
Gwinnett County Police Department asking for punitive damages of
$1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton County, Ga. resident Shelby Poole told the panel how he
was thrown to the pavement and arrested while sitting with his
daughter in their family van in a grocery story parking lot while
his wife went inside for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Poole said police had mistakenly believed he was in the midst of
a kidnapping and treated him as though he were armed, which he was
not, and dangerous, even though he made no move to resist them.
Officers even knocked his daughter unconscious when she tried to
intervene in the fracas, Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that you can be doing all you know how to do in
complying and it won't make any difference,'' Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists characterized police brutality and misconduct as
the greatest civil rights challenge of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that if my father was still alive...he would be
in the forefront of this movement,'' King said.

 WASHINGTON: more pictures.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated by Washington and Brussels, some analysts have turned
to British officials who have offered slightly more detail. ``I do
agree they've had a less restrictive standard,'' Bacon said of the
British.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Pentagon officials have been more forthcoming than
those at NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday, for instance, Bacon estimated the
allies had flown 2,700 mission in the first nine days of the war
and that about 15 percent had been combat missions. NATO officials
had repeatedly refused to disclose such figures, which portray a
campaign far more modest than the one conducted during the Persian
Gulf War. In that conflict, as many as 3,000 missions a day were
flown.
</P>
<P>
   The following examples illustrate the tenor of recent military
briefings by NATO and American officials:
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Pentagon briefing on March 26, following the second day
of the war, Bacon said a ``large'' allied air force was continuing
the attack and that ``we're making it clear with missiles and bombs
that every day we are working to degrade and diminish his military
capability.'' As examples, Bacon said allied forces had attacked
``a large ammunition dump,'' a ``fuel supply depot,'' a ``number of
special police headquarters,'' and ``some other military targets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bacon declined to identify the number or types of aircraft
that had been involved in the attack, or to elaborate on the
military sites that had been targeted. ``The target was a target of
opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to quantify a measure of progress, Bacon said, ``I don't
think I'll get into the grading business at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also declined to say what the allies achieved during a
previous daylight attack. If the Yugoslavian forces ``haven't
figured out what happened to them during the day, I don't think I
want to explain it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ At the NATO briefing in Brussels on Friday, Air Commodore
David Wilby said that despite bad weather, allied forces were
``hitting the full spectrum of targets'' and that the attacks were
``degrading and disrupting'' the Yugoslavians' ability to deploy
tanks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby, a British officer assigned to NATO, showed pictures of
bomb damage at two Yugoslavian airfields, an army base and a
bridge, saying the damage showed ``our very real and significant
campaign to disrupt and degrade Serbian ability to deploy
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But reporters asked what percentages of various Serbian defenses
had been destroyed. ``I don't want to talk percentages,'' Wilby
said, insisting the campaign has ``systematically been addressing
all the elements'' and that the attacks ``are being very
successful.'' When the clouds cleared, he said, pictures would
follow. ``I, for one, will be very, very grateful because it will
get me off this hook that I'm wriggling on day after day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Pentagon briefing on Saturday, officials displayed
charts asserting that the Yugoslavs' ability to communicate with
their troops ``continues to be degraded'' and that army and police
units are ``starting to take losses in personnel and equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Navy Capt. Stephan R. Pietropaoli, who was conducting the
briefing, said the clouds kept him from being able to list the
number or type of targets destroyed. ``We do not have good imagery
back,'' he said. ``We know the things that we've tried to hit.''
Asked if he could provide any specifics at all, Pietropaoli said,
``I wish I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same briefing, Bacon was asked how he could be sure
the losses are occurring without the photographic evidence. ``We
monitor press reports'' and ``other sources of information,'' Bacon
said. But ``in terms of numbers, numbers of either tanks or APCs''
_ armored personnel carriers _ ``or artillery pieces or people, we
do not have right now good measurements of that that we could give
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The briefings come in vivid contrast to those &UR;  &LR; of the Persian
Gulf War. On February 11, 1991, for instance, allied officials
disclosed they had flown 3,000 missions, including 200 against the
Iraqi Republican guard. They said those attacks had destroyed five
Scud missile launchers and brought to 200 the number of Iraqi
aircraft shelters destroyed during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the Persian Gulf briefings were rich in specificity,
reporters complained about being confined to ``pools'' with
military escorts and being forced to submit reports to review by
military censors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trying to tighten the general Pentagon culture,
which he said had relaxed after the Cold War, Bacon cited three
other reasons for the new secrecy. One, he said, the Yugoslavs have
a ``much more organized, more sophisticated military intelligence
machine than Iraq had.''
</P>
<P>
   Two, the proliferation of all-news networks _ and especially the
rise of the Internet _ makes every disclosure instanteously
available throughout the world. ( Bacon said that the Pentagon's
website had experienced a ten-fold increase in the number of hits
from Yugoslavia.) Three, Bacon said ``we have been very careful
about letting NATO speak'' since the operation is under the command
of the 19-country alliance. (The chief of the NATO command,
however, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, is an American who ultimately
reports to the Pentagon.)
</P>
<P>
   In describing the dangers of loose lips, Bacon cited a story in
The Washington Post last week, quoting ``a senior U.S. official''
saying President Clinton supported an attack on the Interior
Ministry in downtown Belgrade _ giving the Serbs advance warning of
an attack that followed three days later. As a result, he said,
``the attack may have been less effective.'' While giving out fewer
details in briefings, Bacon said the Pentagon had accomodated
reporters in other ways. During this conflict, for instance, a
reporter was allowed on a B-52 on a bombing flight for the first
time..
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts agree, of course, that combat plans should not
be disclosed before the combat occurs. But some have criticized
NATO and Pentagon briefers for their reticence in describing
attacks after their completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO briefers just keeping coming out with things that
sound like spin _ `we're severely degrading their ability to do
this or that, but we can't tell you what,''' said John Hillen, a
senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   Hillen, a former Army captain who fought in a tank battle in the
Persian Gulf War, said the vague details may be an attempt to make
the air campaign seem more successful than it has been. ``There's
not much good news to report _ it's as simple as that,'' he said.
``It's mostly political.'' Perry Smith, a retired Air Force general
who flew 180 combat missions in Vietnam, disagreed with the notion
that the allies were trying to disguise bad news. ``I think the
bombing is actually going pretty well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, who is now an analyst for NBC News, said the Pentagon
could be much more open without compromising security. ``The enemy
is not going to gain any advantage by disclosing what happened a
half-hour ago or yesterday,'' said. ``They should be more
forthcoming.''

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ For David Clark, an MIT computer scientist,
research is like ``an expedition into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   With the faculty and students at the Laboratory of Computer
Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Clark, one of
the lab's top managers, is about to embark on just such a journey _
one meant to liberate computing from the PC-centric world it has
occupied for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, scientists here plan to introduce Oxygen, an
ambitious $40 million, five-year research project that is being
financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA, the Pentagon's research arm. The objective is as broad as it
is audacious: to reinvent all facets of information technology,
from chips and software to computers and networks. And in the
Oxygenated future, a desktop computer would be largely beside the
point.
</P>
<P>
   In this digital new world, a person could know if a colleague
working elsewhere was reachable at her desk, because sensory-based
computers in the wall would know. A handheld point-and-click
pointing device could be used to remotely command every household
appliance to do its bidding. And instead of typing on keyboards or
stabbing at a screen with a stylus, a person would simply tell any
computer what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least such concepts are the vision. In reality, the Oxygen
project, Clark said, must walk the exceedingly thin line between an
unrealistically futuristic ``Star Trek'' notion of computing and an
overly timid short-armed reach for the easily attainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to quantum tunnel from `It's too soon' to `It's too
late,''' he said. ``You've got to have guts.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to dismiss such talk, were it not for the
Laboratory of Computer Science's track record over the last three
and a half decades. True, it has simmered at a lower publicity
temperature than its bubbly academic sister, the MIT Media
Laboratory. But since its creation in 1964, the LCS, as it is
known, has been associated with many of the most important
developments in computing.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's many historic fruits include word-processing and
spreadsheet software. And though it was invented elsewhere by
Robert Metcalfe, Ethernet, the standard architecture of today's PC
networks, was subsequently refined during the 1970s as Metcalfe
wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   It may be an MIT effort predating the lab by a year _ Project
MAC, set in motion by a $2 million DARPA grant in 1963 _ that
offers the best model for a project like Oxygen and the impact it
could conceivably have on the next generation of computing.
</P>
<P>
   It was Project MAC, after all, that redefined the computing
world by making it possible for many users to simultaneously share
a single computer. From Project MAC sprang innovations like an
early e-mail system and the concept of shared information
utilities, the forerunners of today's online communities and even
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Project Oxygen, which will be formally kicked off at the
laboratory's 35th anniversary next week, is the brainchild of the
lab's director, Michael Dertouzous, a computer scientist whose own
career traces to his days working on Project MAC as an MIT student.
Intent on putting people first, Dertouzous is determined to chart
an information technology future in which computers recede into the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to liberate ourselves from the tyranny of `going to
the computer,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, seen as a proof-of-concept testbed for technologies that
others might turn into actual products, will be based on several
components that the lab is already developing.
</P>
<P>
   The first will be called Handy 21 and will be a portable device
with a small screen, a video camera, a Global Positioning System
receiver and a powerful computer. Combining the functions of a
cellular telephone, two-way data radio, television set, beeper,
handheld computer and intelligent remote-control pointing device,
the Handy 21 will rely heavily on advanced voice-recognition
technologies that have been developed at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition _ the ability for machines to understand
spoken instructions _ is a vital part of the Oxygen project. A
group led by the MIT speech researcher Victor Zue has developed an
approach significantly different from that now being pursued by
most others in the speech-recognition field.
</P>
<P>
   Zue's Spoken Language Systems group has developed systems with
powerful speech-recognition capabilities _ in large part because
they focus on relatively narrow subject areas, like the weather,
airline reservations or local traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confess that I don't know how to build HAL,'' Zue
said, referring to the computer in ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' with
the complete conversational repertory of an eerily dispassionate
human being.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the Spoken Language Systems research group is to
achieve a limited, though seemingly conversational, voice input
system by stitching together many different recognition systems
with vocabularies based on narrowly defined subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Zue cites three factors making voice recognition more important
as a computer interface: Computers are becoming increasingly
mobile; people love to talk, and the shrinking size of computers is
making the conventional keyboard a large and ungainly component.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the design effort will revolve around the idea of
delegating tasks to machines. For example, Zue said that instead of
merely inquiring of the Oxygen system when a plane is scheduled to
arrive at the airport, the user, planning to meet the flight, might
also give this command: ``Call me half an hour before Flight 116
lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Handy 21, the Oxygen system will be based on another
building-block computer that the researchers call Enviro 21. These
devices, which would be powerful versions of the Handy 21 system,
would be embedded in office walls, car trunks or basements at home.
The systems would have extensive sensor networks meant to enable
them to monitor the state of the environment _ knowing whether an
office door is open, for example, or if the car trunk is unlocked
or the basement sump pump is operating.
</P>
<P>
   And besides merely sensing a situation, the Enviro 21 would have
the intelligence to instruct mechanical systems to close the door,
lock the trunk or reset the pump. Or by the same token, if an
office door is open, a distant colleague might infer that the
occupant would not mind being interrupted with a phone call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both the Handy 21 and the Enviro 21 will be based on a processor
chip design developed by Anant Agarwal, a computer architect at the
lab. Working with IBM, Agarwal's group is now designing a processor
architecture known as Raw. Unlike earlier chip designs which are
based on predetermined instruction sets, Raw processors subject
even the most minute, or ``raw,'' circuitry of the processor to
customization by software designers.
</P>
<P>
   Raw is a gamble, because it would be harder to program than
conventional processors. But it might have a huge payoff if the
design proves workable, by offering markedly faster data processing
and the potential for large numbers of the chips to be custom
programmed to work in powerful concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our experiments will be high risk, and they will
fail,'' Dertouzous conceded. ``But there is also low-hanging
fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Oxygen is the clearest example yet in a new direction in
federal financing of information technology research patterned
after previous research projects that upset the dominant computing
assumptions of their day. A notable example from the past is
Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about investing in long-term, high-risk
research,'' Tom Kalil, President Clinton's special assistant on
economic policy, said of Oxygen. ``What's motivating this is our
understanding of the impact of government investment in information
technology research in the 1960s and 1970s. Innovations from that
investment are driving the economy today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration,'' he said, ``really wants the research
community to invest in the future and swing for the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides speech recognition and Handy 21 and Enviro 21, the other
basic technology component of Oxygen would be a computer network
capable of linking the other systems together and also connecting
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With these, as well the underlying software that supports the
basic technologies, Dertouzous hopes that Project Oxygen can lead
to computing systems that bring a meaningful increase in human
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overarching goal,'' he said, ``is to enable people to do
more by doing less.''

 &HT;    Braves' Opening Day revives memories
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's more than the sense of equality that
distinguishes baseball's Opening Day, when every team is tied for
first and anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Day also taps into the memory of each person who has
ever donned a baseball uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Opening Day in the big leagues is not a whole lot
different than Opening Day was in Little League,'' Braves pitcher
Tom Glavine said. `` You're excited about the start of the season.
The only difference is here, you're doing it at the ultimate level.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Little League, the feeling is much the same, but you're
dreaming about doing it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off his second Cy Young season, Glavine will revisit that
dream at 4:10 p.m. , when he faces the Philadelphia Phillies and
right-hander Curt Schilling as the Braves open the 1999 season at
Turner Field. First baseman Andres Galarraga, undergoing cancer
treatments, will throw out a first pitch from his West Palm Beach
home via the matrix board.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Braves will pick up the chase for an unprecedented
eighth consecutive division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go,'' Manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone, an All-Star acquired from Cincinnati, will start at
second base. Right fielder Brian Jordan, acquired from St. Louis,
returns to his adopted hometown, where he once played for the
Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm home,'' Jordan said. ``It's a good feeling. I get to sleep
in my own bed, wake up to my kids jumping on my head in the
morning.It's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is. It's Opening Day.

FINANCIAL AID BARGAINING DRIVES ADMISSIONS FRENZY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Md., N.J., Minn.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Unannounced, the man marched into Ellen Frishberg's
office at Johns Hopkins University last year and identified himself
as the father of a high school senior who had been accepted for
admission and had not sought financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to negotiate the price,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frishberg, the director of student financial services,
remembers being taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You obviously want my son here,'' he said. ``So let's talk
about the tuition price.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuition is not negotiable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am,'' the father insisted, ``everything is negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a relatively uncomplicated process, college recruitment
among prestigious institutions is turning brazen.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of applicants across the country await their
acceptance letters and confirmation of financial aid over the next
few weeks, college officials say more of them than ever will shop
their offers around or try to improve them with the institutions
that have accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a trend that began earlier this decade, some
colleges and universities will sweeten their offers, if it means
beating competitors to a highly prized student.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new consumerism out there, a new frenzy,'' said
Renee Gernand, an official at the College Board, a nonprofit group
in Manhattan that analyzes admissions procedures. ``Everybody is
trying to determine where they can get the best deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities have always competed for the best high
school students with offers of grants, loans and other inducements
that are sometimes based on need and sometimes on merit.
</P>
<P>
   But bargaining has become a new element of the courtship,
prompting some admissions experts to compare it to shopping for a
used car.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the competitive efforts benefit the winners at the
expense of needier students, many of whom are from minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the rationale at colleges where that is occurring, officials
contend, is that better students enhance the reputation of the
institution, which helps attract more alumni contributions and,
ultimately, better students in future freshman classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, colleges and universities think of student aid
as a strategic part of enrollment management and revenue
planning,'' said Michael S. McPherson, president of Macalester
College in St. Paul and co-author of ``The Student Aid Game''
(Princeton University Press, 1998). ``It used to be, providing aid
was a charitable operation. Now, it's investment, like brand
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the bargaining trend is mostly anecdotal and, for
now, rather skimpy. Ms. Frishberg could not recall any other parent
making such bold demands as the father who barged in on her,
insisting on a deal he did not get.
</P>
<P>
   But she and officials at other colleges, as well as many high
school counselors, agreed that with tuition costs soaring, more
parents each year were inquiring about better aid packages,
assisted in many cases by a new cottage industry of college
admissions consultants who help parents shop around.
</P>
<P>
   Two events earlier this decade provided a stimulus for many
colleges to increase their bidding for better students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a Justice Department investigation put an end to a
decades-long collaboration by 23 elite private institutions,
including all the Ivy League colleges, of comparing aid packages
offered to students who had been accepted by more than one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges maintained that by eliminating the competition,
students could make a final choice for reasons other than aid and
the institution could build up reserves for more needy students.
The government viewed it as price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Congress eliminated home equity as a family
asset in determining eligibility for Federal aid. In effect, that
liberalized the definition of need, allowing colleges more
flexibility in aid packages.
</P>
<P>
   But some colleges did not stop there in the competition. Some,
including Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which had not
been one of the collaborating institutions, began encouraging their
most desirable applicants to bring back offers from other colleges
so that Mellon could surpass them, match them or at least improve
upon its initial offers.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, 745 students accepted by Mellon, who were also
accepted by other colleges, asked Mellon to respond to another
college's offer. Michael Steidel, the director of admissions, said
Mellon responded to 464 of these students by improving their
original aid packages by an average of $3,000, and 249 students
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe competition among schools is healthy,'' Steidel
said. ``We are trying to encourage dialogue, and we have set aside
the dough to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges now compete by offering new kinds of merit
awards. Boston College created Presidential Scholarships, which
include summer service programs in New York, Paris and other
cities, for students who are also considering prestige schools like
Harvard, Yale and Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Lay, the dean of enrollment at Boston College, said a
typical freshman class of 2,200 would include 15 who had turned
down other colleges to accept the scholarship. Plans are under way
to expand the number to 20 each year.
</P>
<P>
   Lay said one current freshman turned down Harvard, Georgetown,
Brown and Dartmouth to accept Boston College's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be competitive,'' he said, ``but we don't want
money to be the No. 1 feature.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Kaplan is a stockbroker by day, managing money for wealthy
clients who gamble their fortunes in regulated markets. But his off
time is spent on a new and controversial investment game in which
he and two partners have wagered tens of thousands of dollars on
catchy words and names that they hope to resell as valuable
Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Though often labeled hijackers, pirates or extortionists,
``cybersquatters'' is the most common term for investors who
stockpile Internet addresses derived from popular words, titles or
celebrities' names.
</P>
<P>
   For an investment of just $70, they can secure two-year rights
to an address. In return, they can reap handsome rewards from
companies eager to protect products or trademarks. Sometimes the
buyer is an individual with a compelling interest in using a
specific word or name in a World Wide Web site's address.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan says he and his colleagues are simply creative investors,
speculators who stake perfectly legal claims in the
rough-and-tumble land rush in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But their investments may soon become a lot riskier. Faced with
mounting disputes about Internet addresses and complaints from
trademark holders, a U.N. agency is completing a proposal for
bringing order to the chaotic assignment of addresses in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or
WIPO, is drafting new rules for registering domain names, as
Internet addresses are known. It will submit its recommendations to
the nonprofit corporation established last year by the Commerce
Department to take over administration of the Internet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A top priority of that nonprofit, the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, is to introduce competition into the
business of registering top-level domains, which is now handled by
Network Solutions Inc. under an exclusive government contract.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, the interim chairwoman of the corporation, said
she expected her group would adopt rules on cybersquatting before
authorizing any new top-level domains, the categories of Internet
addresses denoted by suffixes like .com, .edu, and .net.
</P>
<P>
   Internet addresses can be valuable enough to attract speculators
because most choice names within existing top-level domains are
already claimed. But in trying to accommodate both special
interests and international trademark laws, the proposals raise as
many questions as they answer.
</P>
<P>
   And those who would tame the Internet are finding that for every
new winner, there is almost certainly a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vocal critics of the WIPO draft proposal has been
A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami and
a member of the agency's advisory board on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Froomkin says the consequences of the proposed rules could go
far beyond the intended crackdown on cybersquatters. Unless the
proposals are revised, he warns, the Internet will end up with a
legal system that could stifle free expression and enable
governments and corporate interests to intimidate individuals into
relinquishing addresses to which they have rightful claims.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, he says, enforcement would be a bureaucratic
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has proposed, for example, that when people register
names in any top-level domain, they must agree to a procedure
permitting anyone anywhere to challenge that registration at any
time. The disputes would be settled by arbitration, but the outcome
might depend on any number of international trademark laws. And
whoever loses could be liable for all legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Froomkin and others say that the plan would let companies engage
in reverse domain hijacking, claiming any address that contains or
suggests their names or trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a policy could, for instance, hurt people like Chris Van
Allen, a Pennsylvanian teen-ager whose father registered pokey.org,
an address that reflected Chris' nickname, Pokey, as a present for
his twelfth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Prema Toy Co., which holds the trademarks to the well-known
Gumby and Pokey bendable toys, last year tried to seize the domain
name, even though the boy had no content related to the toys on his
page. Prema eventually dropped its claim.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed U.N. rules also raise questions of free-speech
rights. Is it a violation of free-speech rights to prevent someone
from using the name of a politician, government official or
corporation in the address of a Web site that criticizes or
parodies its namesake? One trend among cybersquatters has been
securing addresses based on trademarks with the addition of the
word ``sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies often buy up such names to keep them out of the hands
of critics and disgruntled former employees.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Gurry, legal counsel for WIPO, said he intended to make
significant revisions to the draft proposal before its submission
later this month. He said he anticipated that the final proposal
would define squatters more narrowly and would not give a trademark
owner the right to make a claim just because a domain includes its
name or a variation of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot interest in differentiation of commercial and
noncommercial domains,'' Gurry said last month in Washington, where
the panel he heads was holding the last in a series of
international public hearings on the draft proposal. ``Another
evolution that we see is limiting the mandatory administrative
dispute resolutions procedure to cases of cybersquatting.''
</P>
<P>
   He defined cybersquatting as ``repeated cases of targeting in
bad faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Other claims, like standard trademark disputes or cases
involving different companies with the same names, would still be
resolved in traditional courts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also require prepayment of domain
registration fees, to deter squatters who register names and then
try to resell them before the bills come due.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Even modified rules could leave speculators like Kaplan
operating in a gray area. He and his partners, Eric Stuerken and
Richard Presig, have pooled some $40,000 and paid for all their
domain names. He also said that some names they registered are no
more than catchy words that people starting new businesses might
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure arbitrage,'' Kaplan said. ``It's a free market
that they put out there.'' Still, he admits, he and his partners
seek unclaimed names of celebrities or groups.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he saw Glenn Rifkin, the co-author of a book
called ``Radical Marketing,'' promote it on CNBC in January. Rifkin
had already applied for the name radicalmarketing.com, but did so
through an Internet service provider, rather than applying directly
to the central registry.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan made his application directly and got the name. When
Rifkin discovered that the address was taken, he tracked Kaplan to
a Long Island brokerage firm, HD Brous &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan insists that he and his partners have not _ at least yet
_ tried to track down potential buyers of the names they have
purchased, like barrydiller.com.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean they are not for sale. Rifkin says Kaplan
and his partners offered to sell him the name for ``five figures''
after he tracked them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They quite aggressively tried to sell me the name, having
three different people phone me,'' Rifkin said, ``one in particular
saying outright that I'd be surprised at how much information they
knew about me, including the fact that I had access to the kind of
cash I'd need to buy the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Furious, but left with few options, Rifkin instead registered
the domain name radmarketing.com.

   TIRANA, Albania _ From a distance, the truth in Kosovo is
simple. Serbs, emboldened or maddened by NATO bombings, are on a
rampage that has caused nearly a quarter of the ethnic Albanian
population of the southern Serbian province to flee.
</P>
<P>
   But close up, life is rarely that simple. The story of Suva
Reka, one small town amid hundreds caught up in the chaos and
horror of Kosovo, has more layers. Suva Reka is a place where
neighbors say the richest man in town, who had rented his houses to
international monitors of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, was executed by the Serbian police at his
front door along with most of his family, four days after the
foreigners were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a place where a Serbian car-parts salesman was
killed two days before the bombing began, a killing that might have
helped ignite Suva Reka's explosion of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Between those deaths lies a tangled web of history, friendships
and enmities, of war and routine business that were echoed all over
Kosovo. And those are the minutiae of life _ and death _ that are
drowned out by the clashing statements of Washington and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy unfolding in Kosovo is not just the human suffering,
so obvious in the faces of hundreds of thousands of refugees. There
is also confusion over what is really happening. Kosovo is in a
torrent of pain and panic, fueled by fear, long memories, burning
houses, machine-gun fire and rumors. There are many accounts of
atrocities that cannot be verified and may never be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of Zenel and Florije Bytyci, two schoolteachers who
are married and have three children, have been indelibly altered. A
father who donned women's clothing to escape Serbian detection as
he fled. A demure teen-age daughter who became a vegetarian the day
she began working underground in a field hospital of the rebel
army, and saw her first flesh wounds. A mother who heard the
explosion of the mosque and was convinced the world was coming to
an end. A son whose first thought, as the tractor they were packed
into by the dozens to make their extraordinary escape rumbled down
the road, was of his schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   As the tractor pulled away from burning houses, Azdren Bytyci,
16, turned to his mother and exclaimed in panic: ``Mama! I forgot
my classroom notes and all my diplomas!''
</P>
<P>
   The family arrived at the Albanian border last Monday, walking
six miles after the tractor into which they were crammed had broken
down.
</P>
<P>
   They had spent seven days in their neighbor's apartment in the
center of town, 13 people packed into three rooms, afraid to go
out, spending the long hours waiting, making and receiving phone
calls, trying to find out what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Florije Bytyci, a 38-year-old school librarian, is _ unlike her
husband, Zenel, 45 _ a native of Suva Reka, a town of 60,000, and
knows everybody there.
</P>
<P>
   She made and took the calls. ``We women did the phone talking,''
she said. ``We were afraid the police listened in on the
conversations of the men.'' It was Florije who received what she
believed was the last phone call of Sedat Berisha, the wealthy
landlord of the foreign monitors in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the first NATO bombs fell, he called about noon,
his voice shaking, asking whether a lot of police officers were in
the center of town, whether it would be safe to try to flee that
way. She replied that the whole area was crawling with soldiers,
paramilitary and policemen. He hung up.
</P>
<P>
   She said she heard from a family friend late the next day that
Sedat Berisha, his three brothers and most of their families had
been executed a few yards from their house.
</P>
<P>
   A Berisha cousin, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
watched the Serb police shoot Berisha, his three brothers and two
other cousins from his window, a few feet from Berisha's house,
sometime between noon and 1 p.m. that day, March 26. He said he
believed the others, men, women and children, were taken around the
back and shot, but said he could not see what happened to them from
his window.
</P>
<P>
   What he did see, he described slowly and methodically, drawing a
map of the building complex where it took place. ``They fired at
them, just like that, with automatic weapons,'' he said. ``Then
they set fire to the houses. It was over in 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that after they left, burning wood fell on the bodies on
the ground, setting some bodies on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they left, I wanted to go out and drag the bodies into
the house so the dogs couldn't get at them,'' he said. ``But I was
too afraid. We thought there could be snipers.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next two days hiding in the house with 10 other
family members. The police came to his door the next day, seized
his brother and made him kneel while the rest of the family begged
for his life. The cousin said he recognized one of Serbian
officers, an old acquaintance, and said he believed that is why the
officer took 1,000 German marks from him and told him to get in his
car and go.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the death of Bogdan Lazic, a Serb, a car-parts
salesman and a remote acquaintance, came even closer into the home
of the Bytycis. He was killed on Monday March 22, at his shop.
Quietly, quickly, the streets and cafes nearby emptied before the
police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Bytycis' close friend Sedat Haxha, whose apartment they
shared, did not disappear quickly enough. He was arrested with a
few others as suspects and sent to a Serbian police station in
Prizren for interrogation. Haxha, a physical-education instructor,
was released the same night and made it home safely.
</P>
<P>
   Revealing an ironclad loyalty to his side, Haxha suggested that
ethnic Albanians should be ruled out as suspects. ``The Serbs
killed him themselves, as a provocation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Suva Reka, spread out in camps throughout Tirana,
recount at least three different massacres that they say took place
in the days after the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees say they were told of bodies burning in a
schoolyard, others say they know for a fact that the police dumped
dozens of bodies in black garbage bags in front of a downtown
supermarket. Others talk about seven people killed downtown a few
hours after Lazic was killed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is the killings of the Berisha family and Lazic that seem
to have the most resonance, perhaps because they followed a long
cycle of similar killings and vicious counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have happened,'' Rufus Dawkins, the foreign monitor
who rented the Berisha house last fall, said of the Berisha
family's execution. He had only heard, third-hand, that the
buildings had been looted, then burned. He had had to leave
computers and other equipment behind when he evacuated on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins, a retired Army officer from Texas, was gone when the
Berishas were reported killed.
</P>
<P>
   But in his months of mediating between Serbian forces and ethnic
Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, he investigated
killings by Serbs, and also by the KLA. ``It was on both sides,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question, especially in the minds of those from
Suva Reka, that the most immediate motive for the killing of
Berisha and his family was their connection with the foreign
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from all over Kosovo have reported that local employees
and landlords for the 1,400 foreign monitors have been beaten and
robbed, that their houses have been burned and that some have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the NATO air strikes seem to have goaded President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the Serbs' leader, into
unleashing the frenzy of brutality that has driven hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians to flee. But people who have worked
in Suva Reka and its surrounding villages, where fighting and the
killing of civilians have been intense for the last year, also
detect a pattern that seems to have escalated beyond all reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we kept seeing was a break-down in what was already poor
discipline,'' said Henry Bolt, a human-rights monitor who worked
the Suva Reka region until his evacuation in late March. He was
referring to the Serbian forces' tendency to ``overreact'' and
avenge a KLA killing of a Serb by slaughtering a few, or several,
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees these days describe the Serbian military as an
all-powerful killing machine. But Bolt, a British policeman,
portrayed them _ at least until his evacuation _ as scared and
undisciplined, patrolling KLA-infiltrated areas around Suva Reka
like ``cornered rats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is being carried out in Kosovo today is Belgrade's
policy,'' he said, ``but the policy works because the police feel
the way they do.''

   WASHINGTON _ The United States will take in up to 20,000
Albanian refugees who have been driven from their homes in Kosovo
by the Yugoslavs, a State Department official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that a
formal announcement of the total and the places where the refugees
would be taken would be made later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said that the
places where the refugees would be taken had not yet been decided,
but a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the American base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Guam had been
selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to relocate refugees permanently in U.S.
territory,'' Bacon said, but to create the conditions for the
refugees from Kosovo to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who appeared on the NBC
News program ``Meet the Press,'' said that the United States would
take in a portion of the refugees from Kosovo ``in order to share
the burden'' with European nations.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, she said, have been expelled from their country,
some of them in locked trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for them not to be too far away from Kosovo,
so that they would be able to return,'' she said. ``But we do think
it's important for the U.S. to share the burden in this.''
</P>
<P>
   In another aspect of the American effort to help the refugees,
the administration said Sunday in a formal notification to Congress
that ``at a minimum, 1,000'' U.S. troops would be sent to Albania
and Macedonia to augment the NATO forces dealing with humanitarian
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, senior Clinton administration officials said that the
United States would have to consider accepting some of the
refugees, partly to encourage reluctant European nations to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that any Albanian refugees might remain wards
of the United States and the European countries indefinitely
because the Yugoslavs were intent on keeping them out of their
homeland in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   American relief agencies pressed the administration to admit
some refugees. Robert Carey, vice president for resettlement for
the International Rescue Committee in New York, has said: ``The
U.S. has traditionally offered refuge, and we have the resources to
offer refuge. We have to say that this is at least being offered by
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we like it or not, the United States sets an example
that is followed by other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has imposed a ceiling of 78,000 on the number of
refugees who can be admitted to the United States from all nations
this year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service
said that 25,000 of those slots had been set aside for refugees
from the Balkans. Of that, 9,300 had been set aside for refugees
from Yugoslavia and its former republics.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said last week that while it would be
difficult to persuade Congress to raise the ceiling for refugees,
the administration could admit several thousand Kosovo Albanians to
the United States by cutting the number of refugees admitted from
other parts of the world.

 &HT;    Fan will make his pitch in court
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Sterling Lapinski settled into his seat at Turner
Field on a pleasant summer evening in July 1997, he expected to
watch the Atlanta Braves and drink some cold beers with his buddies
from work. Then the unthinkable happened.
</P>
<P>
   As Lapinski talked to a waitress in the top of the fifth inning
about his next beer, New York Mets catcher Todd Pratt swung and
missed a Tom Glavine fastball. His bat slipped out of his hands and
sailed 100 feet into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who was looking away, turned back toward the field
after hearing warning shouts from the crowd. Pratt's bat slammed
into his forehead. With blood gushing from his nose and in
excruciating pain, he was taken to Crawford Long Hospital, where
doctors told him the bat had shattered his skull, crushed his sinus
cavity and torn the lining of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain was far and away the worst I've ever had in my
life,'' said Lapinski, 29, then a Southern Co. electricity broker.
Doctors told Lapinski that if he hadn't turned toward the field _
and had instead been struck in the side of his head _ he would not
have made it to the hospital alive.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Pratt flung his bat into the stands
that game, and it wasn't the last time, either. During each of
Pratt's first three trips to the plate, his bat slipped out of his
hand and sailed into the stands. Only Lapinski, struck during
Pratt's second at bat, was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Mets first baseman John Olerud passed up a bat to him after he
was hit and the Braves later mailed him an autographed picture of
Chipper Jones, Lapinski said. But that has done little to make him
forgive and forget.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski has turned from spectator to plaintiff, filing a
federal lawsuit against the Mets ballclub and its owners, Sterling
Doubleday Enterprises, seeking compensatory damages for his medical
bills and for his pain and suffering. He is now appealing a ruling
last fall by a federal judge in Atlanta who dismissed the lawsuit,
relying partly on prior baseball-injury court decisions that said
to grant spectators the right to sue ballclubs would change the way
the game is played and viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski was sitting on the 14th row behind the Mets dugout on
the third base side at the July 11, 1997, game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole incident was ridiculous,'' he said. ``Everybody who
was sitting in the stadium that night knew (Pratt) wasn't playing
up to professional standards. For him to throw three bats in the
stands and for the Mets not do anything about it is
reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who now lives in Houston, said he still feels the
effects of his injury. Parts of the top of his head are numb, his
forehead often begins itching or aches and he has a deadened sense
of smell. Doctors say there is a risk that mucus could seep into
his sinus cavity, swelling it and causing seizures, even blindness.
Lapinski said he also has an ear-to-ear scar across the top of his
head that will be easy to see if he goes bald.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview after the game, Pratt said the bat
slipped because he must have been trying to swing too hard and the
night was hot and humid. ``I guess I didn't have enough pine tar on
the bat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets ballclub, represented by the Atlanta law firm of Alston
&AMP; Bird, responded in court motions that a fan, by voluntarily
entering a ballpark as a spectator, knowingly accepts the risks and
hazards that come with watching the game, including bats and balls
sent flying into the crowd. The Mets also contended that Lapinski
failed to exercise ordinary care by ignoring the game while Pratt
was at bat.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lapinski took offense at the Mets' criticism
that he was looking away from the field. ``I would hardly say I was
being negligent,'' he said. ``If it's required behavior for fans to
keep their eyes on the field at all times, then they shouldn't be
selling beer and other products while the game is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing legal arguments from both parties, U.S. District
Judge Jack Camp sided with the Mets, dismissing the lawsuit in a
ruling last fall. Lapinski is now asking the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta to reinstate the case.
</P>
<P>
   In court motions filed last month, Lapinski's lawyer, Bill
deGolian, said spectators assume the risk of getting hit by
baseballs _ but not by bats that slip out of players' hands. He
noted that the back side of Lapinski's ticket stub makes no mention
of bats, stating: ``Management will not be responsible for injuries
to persons struck by batted or thrown balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets sold by major league teams mention bats this season. The
stubs say that spectators assume ``all risk and danger incidental
to the game of baseball ... including the danger of being injured
by thrown bats and thrown or batted balls.''
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit supporting Lapinski's case, Mike Marshall, the
former major league relief pitcher who holds a doctorate in
exercise physiology, testified it is ``extraordinarily rare'' for a
player to fling his bat into the stands. Bats that slip out of
player's hands typically land in the field of play, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who played 21 years, said he has ``never seen or heard
of'' a baseball player throwing his bat into the stands three times
in one game. For Pratt to let this happen ``is clear evidence that
he was handling his bat in a manner inconsistent with what is
taught and expected of a professional baseball player,'' Marshall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Records from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's
national injury information clearinghouse indicate that the chance
of a baseball fan getting seriously injured at a professional game
is highly unlikely. Most injuries occur in recreational games,
according to the clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves do not keep records of how often spectators are hit
by bats or balls, said Jim Schultz, the team's director of public
relations. ``Serious injuries are very rare but can happen and are
a concern of ours,'' he said. ``We are prepared to deal with
situations like that as best as we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, courts have resisted granting spectators the
right to sue baseball teams for injuries sustained while attending
games.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1986 case involving a woman struck by a foul ball at a Los
Angeles Dodgers game, for example, the California Court of Appeals
said that a ruling in the woman's favor could affect the way the
game is played and enjoyed by millions.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing this plaintiff and others like her to recover
damages from the ballclub, the court said, baseball stadium owners
would be forced to do one of two things: place all spectator areas
behind screens, reducing the quality of everyone's view and
preventing players from reaching into the stands to catch foul
balls; or continue the status quo and hike up ticket prices to
cover the cost of compensating injured patrons, meaning many fans
could not afford to go
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, neither alternative is acceptable,'' the court said,
dismissing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Camp, a federal judge in Atlanta appointed to the bench in 1988
by President Reagan, based his dismissal of Lapinski's lawsuit
largely on a Georgia Court of Appeals decision handed down in 1949.
The lawsuit was filed by a spectator injured by a wildly thrown
baseball at a game in Thomasville.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, the court said that a spectator who chooses or
accepts a seat in an unprotected portion of the grandstand
``voluntarily assumes the risks inherent in such a position.'' The
court said it reviewed numerous cases involving spectators
``injured by foul balls, flying bats and other like missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lapinski attempted to draw a distinction between injuries
by balls and by bats, Camp said he could find no legal basis for
one.
</P>
<P>
   But Lapinski's lawyer is asking the federal appeals court to
take notice of a 1938 California case _ one that involved a thrown
bat, not a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Martha Ratcliff was injured by being hit with a
bat that had slipped out of the hands of a player during a Pacific
Coast League game in San Diego. Ratcliff's lawsuit was allowed to
go to trial, and she won a $2,000 verdict against the San Diego
Baseball Club. The California Court of Appeals upheld the verdict,
saying that reasonable care should have been taken to guard against
these types of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   If Lapinski can get the case to trial, deGolian said he would
like to present as Exhibit A Pratt's interview with a New York
cable TV program, Pennant Chase, after the game, during which the
catcher joked about the three times his bat sailed into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Pratt stepped up to the plate for his fourth at bat,
in which he held onto the bat and grounded out, fans at Turner
Field were booing him vociferously. ``Some of the guys were busting
my chops,'' Pratt said of his teammates, who told him the hammer
throw at the 1996 Olympic Games happened in Atlanta the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   About the boos, Pratt said, ``I'm lucky it wasn't in
Philadelphia. It wasn't like I meant it. I apologize to the fans in
Atlanta. But, hey, hang loose.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before Kevin Brown or Randy Johnson throw a blur
this afternoon from the Dodger Stadium mound, a red-headed
left-hander will deliver the ceremonial first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as he calls it, a calculated lob.
</P>
<P>
   The honor? This begins his 50th season with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   His emotions?
</P>
<P>
   ``My first honest feeling is one of tremendous gratitude,'' he
said. ``Meaning that I got a job I've dreamt of having, I got it at
a very young age and then I was given the opportunity to have it
for so long you have to be so thankful. I'll stand out there and
thank God for giving me all this. I didn't do anything to deserve
it. It just came my way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing, which is normal, you think of 50 years as a
major milestone in anything, so you think of your own mortality.
I've been given this great opportunity _ I don't know how much
longer I'll be allowed to have it. But I'll try to do the best I
can for as long as I have.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no ego involved. If anything, it's a humbling
experience. After all, here I was a kid who played high school
ball, college ball, semipro ball _ and I won't be able to reach
home plate on the fly from the mound. I'll be on the grass, trying
to lob it in and get out of there. It's the law of gravity catching
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravity won't keep 50,000-plus Dodgers fans in their seats for
this one. Here's to you, Vin Scully ...
</P>
<P>
   _And to Dick Enberg. Across town on Tuesday night, the former
team broadcaster will throw out the first pitch at the Angels
opener....
</P>
<P>
   _The next big-league squad headed to Cuba for an exhibition? Try
the Angels. Figure it out. ESPN (owned by Disney, which owns the
Angels) didn't completely televise that game last Sunday between
the Cuban national team and Baltimore Orioles to be nice guys. If
Peter Angelos stands to gain by connecting with Cuban players,
there will be two dozen other owners waiting in line with their
passports....
</P>
<P>
   _Florida Marlins pitcher Livan Hernandez was doing an interview
recently when John Wooden appeared on a nearby TV set. Hernandez
asked who Wooden was.
</P>
<P>
   After he was told, Hernandez said: ``Oh. I thought he was a
golfer.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   _We're now convinced Jim Harrick couldn't have made that
accounting mistake on his expense report at UCLA _ because he
probably couldn't even decide which credit card to use to pay the
bill....
</P>
<P>
   _University of Rhode Island prez Bob Carothers, after the Lizard
of Westwood's flip-flop flap on finally taking the Georgia job that
paid him almost twice his previous salary, told the Providence
Journal:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me from the beginning that money is not the
issue (in leaving URI). I truly believe that UCLA sticks in his
craw. That he can't get over what happened to him there. That, yes,
he made some mistakes, but they weren't hanging offenses. And he
wants to win big and prove to them that they made a mistake.'' ...

   Beauty is in the eye of the bedazzled, writes Skip Bayless of

have hinted McNown will be theirs.
</P>
<P>
   To which Bayless pleads: ``(That is) the absolute worst thing
the Bears could do.... McNown simply doesn't have the arm or
stature to lead a mediocre team out of the fog now blanketing
Unknown Soldier Field. Please don't let (personnel director) Mark
Hatley convince new coach Dick Jauron, late of the Jaguars, that
McNown is the next Mark Brunell. No, he's little more than a nice,
exciting college quarterback. McNown would be fine as a
second-round flier, but please, not at too-valuable No. 7.''

   BLACE, Macedonia _ Every few minutes stretcher-bearers struggled
through the crowd Sunday, slipping and falling on their way up the
muddy slope in their haste to get another patient to the medical
tent. Others charged the hill with children in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the very few who were allowed through the police
cordon. Macedonian soldiers and police in riot gear have formed a
human barrier around the thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees
camping here on a small patch of land at the border, beating back
anyone who tries to pass.
</P>
<P>
   As the tide of refugees has swelled the miserable crowd to
30,000, conditions have deteriorated alarmingly. Death and disease
are becoming commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies said 11 people died Friday night, and another 14
died Saturday night _ mostly the old and very young _ many of them
suffering from exposure. Local journalists reported that several
babies had been born in the camp too, and that one of the mothers
died in childbirth Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis and pneumonia are already raging through the sprawling
camp, where people are sleeping in the open under the rain, or
beneath makeshift shelters of blankets and plastic. There are no
toilets, and people have been using the nearby river for washing
and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   [Stephen Tomlin, a vice president of the International Medical
Corps said: ``When you have a large number of people and the
sanitation is poor, there is a high risk of diarrhea and disease.
And with children, measles. The priority now is water and
sanitation. Water must be piped in quickly because of
dehydration.''
</P>
<P>
   [Tomlin said that even with the cold weather, diarrhea and the
resulting dehydration are big problems and that preventing these
problems must take priority now. People had been rationed a few
liters of water a day. This will not be enough, Tomlin said.)
</P>
<P>
   International aid agencies have been barred from working in the
camp for several days now, apparently to discourage more refugees
from coming here, though the government has not given its reason.
And the local Red Cross, which is permitted to enter, is not
prepared to handle an emergency situation of this scope.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of thousands of people camped on the hillside and
across the fields is a messy and noisy jumble. Smoke drifts from
hundreds of fires. Men squat beside their plastic shelters, and
others crush together around the single white tent registering
refugees. The occasional person who tries to slip out is shoved
back hard by police officers or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing sense of desperation in the sodden
encampment. Many refugees appear to be in severe shock from their
ordeal in Kosovo. Expelled at gunpoint and herded into railroad
cars, many of the refugees have arrived with only the clothes they
were wearing.
</P>
<P>
   One family held up a huge sign made out of cardboard. They had
written the simple message in English: ``Help.''
</P>
<P>
   More are trapped on the other side of the border, unable to pass
since Macedonian authorities effectively closed the border. A long
trail of cars snaked back up the road into the embattled province
on Sunday. Many refugees have abandoned their cars and stand massed
by the immigration booths waiting to come through.
</P>
<P>
   They face Macedonian police, who on Friday used batons to keep
the crowd back. The Macedonian government denies closing the
border, but is adamant that it cannot absorb any more refugees for
reasons of both economic and political stability.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old mechanic, Gazmend Kumnova, said his aunt died
three days ago on the Serbian side of the border. ``It was
impossible to get food to them,'' he said. ``It was only when she
died that they let the family through,'' he said. They buried her
the next day in the nearby Macedonian capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   With the foreign aid organizations barred from the camp, local
aid workers have been driving into the camp on tractors, laden with
food and drink. They stop at intervals and throw provisions into
the crowd in random fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid organizations have a single overflowing medical tent
alongside the camp to care for the sick. Patients, mostly old
people unable to move on their own, lie and sit around on the
ground outside.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have begun transferring refugees to other camps,
piling them into buses in haphazard fashion. One busload was taken
to the refugee camp of Ragushe.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by wire fencing and guarded by Macedonian police, the
refugees are confused and fearful. ``We thought we were moving away
from an aggressor and we find something very similar to the Serb
police,'' said Hazen Dakaj, a 52-year-old refugee. He stood by the
wire fence, greeting family members stuck inside the camp.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos of boarding the buses in the middle of the night,
three of the 14 members of his family had been separated and lost.
``They brought us in buses here when they saw people dying. They
did not care if we were together or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Macedonia's reluctance to take in the refugees,
NATO and other countries Sunday were gearing up to take over
responsibility for them. The United States, Canada, Turkey,
Germany, Norway and Austria have pledged to take in 101,000
refugees among them.
</P>
<P>
   Flights began to arrive with supplies for the refugees Sunday
and flew out the first few loads of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, just down the road from the border, NATO troops were
constructing a large transit camp with military tents and showers.
The NATO camp was in stark contrast to the chaos by the border, and
the first refugees were being moved there Sunday night. The
refugees will be given food and water, medical treatment and
washing facilities while they are registered and will then be sent
on, either to other camps or abroad.

FOR LEITER, A NEW SORT OF MEMORY IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In rapid-fire fashion, Al Leiter rattles off important
dates in his life:
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 26, 1997: The night Leiter started the seventh game of the
World Series for the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   May 11, 1996: The day Leiter tossed a no-hitter here.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 16, 1987: Leiter's major-league debut with the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 22, 1988: ``The day my father died,'' Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 26, 1991: His wedding.
</P>
<P>
   March 25, 1995, and Sept. 29, 1997: The birth dates of his
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 23, 1993: On his 28th birthday, Leiter pitched for the Blue
Jays in Game 6 of the World Series, which Joe Carter ended with a
championship-winning home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few salient moments in all of our lifetimes,''
Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 33-year-old left-hander will be able to add April
5, 1999, to his list. It will be the first opening-day start of
Leiter's 13-season major-league career. And the appearance before a
sold-out crowd of 41,166 will be his first on the mound at Pro
Player Stadium since that seventh game of the 1997 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another special date,'' Leiter said during the New York Mets'
final preseason workout here on Sunday afternoon. ``And also
because a lot of good things happened to me here.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the first no-hitter in Marlins history, which Leiter
completed with a strikeout of Colorado's Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a fastball away, 94 miles per hour,'' Leiter said. ``They
said I was throwing harder in the ninth than I had in any of the
first three innings that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Game 7 start remains Leiter's fondest memory, not
only of his two seasons with the Marlins, but of his baseball
career. To Leiter, it wasn't just the game to which he traces his
transformation from a hard-throwing left-hander into a pitcher who
dared to change speeds and throw to the outside part of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game, to date, goes down as the most important moment of
my life,'' Leiter said. ``Any kid who dreams of playing baseball
dreams of that moment. It's Game 7 and I pitched in it _ and I
pitched well _ and we won in 11 innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Three and a half months later, Leiter was traded to the Mets as
part of the Marlins' off-season salary purge. Leiter followed that
with his best year in the majors: a career-high 17 victories
against just six defeats, a career-best 2.47 ERA. But his two
appearances against the Marlins came in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That last start in Pro Player Stadium ``is certainly what's
going to make it exciting,'' Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Not only knowing that it's my first time here since
that Game 7, but that there will be a packed house for opening day,
adding to the butterflies and excitement of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure, Leiter, who signed a four-year, $32
million contract this off-season, is expected to be the ace of a
staff for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has been concerned about his performance after going 0-4
with a 5.84 ERA this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to snowball, to not be as focused, and when
April is over, to be 1-4 with a 5-something ERA,'' Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leiter tried to play down his importance on a team that
has considerably revamped its offense, only to see it still
tinkering with its starting rotation through the final weeks of the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contract will not and has not affected me in the least,''
Leiter said. ``If there is a pressure, it's just to try to repeat
what I did last year.''

THE DEVILS IMPALE THE RANGERS SEASON THAT NEVER WAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils swept the season
series from the New York Rangers for the first time in the history
of the rivalry, winning Sunday by 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils didn't want to talk about their fifth victory in
as many meetings this season, and most pretended they were unaware
that the last time they lost to the Rangers was 14 games ago. That
streak is the longest by either club since the rivalry began in the
1982-83 season, the Devils' first in New Jersey after moving here
from Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' said Ken Daneyko, the Devils defenseman who has
been with the team since 1983, ``is that we've focused on the fact
they have had our number in the playoffs and it's gratifying to see
they won't be in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers eliminated the Devils the past two times they met in
the playoffs. Knowing that the Rangers are on the verge of missing
the playoffs for the second season in a row is a relief for the
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers (31-35-10) trail Boston and Buffalo by nine points
in the race for the final two playoff berths in the Eastern
Conference. The Rangers, who have only six games remaining, have
lost two straight and are 2-5-2 in the past nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it matters is that we beat them tonight, and it won't
matter until we play them again,'' coach Robbie Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils earned a little more credibility from Rangers' fans
this season by dominating the Blue Shirts. They outscored the
Rangers by 20-7 in the five-game series and outshot them by
144-128.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur earned each of the five victories against the
Rangers. He showed glimpses of brilliance Sunday afternoon in the
third period when he denied Wayne Gretzky on three attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way we're playing,'' Ftorek said about his team's
seven-game unbeaten streak (4-0-3), the longest unbeaten streak in
the league. ``We're playing pretty well. I don't see us doing
things I don't like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils (42-22-11) dictated the flow of the game from the
outset. When the Rangers tried to take liberties with Bobby Holik,
Krzysztof Oliwa, the Devils' pugilist, stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no business whatsoever to do what they did to Bobby
Holik,'' Oliwa said about Chris Tamer's attack on Holik. Tamer was
given a major penalty and a game misconduct. ``We can't have them
go after our best players. We're going into the playoffs in two
weeks and they are not.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Rangers' season was even pointed out to them by a
fan sitting behind their bench with a banner that had the Rangers'
logo but read ``New York Golfers,'' signifying the Rangers'
likelihood of hitting the links instead of competing in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Devils dominating the Rangers for the past two seasons
_ the last time the Rangers beat the Devils was Jan. 12, 1997 _
Rangers fans are starting to be less visible at Continental Arena.
But the tension of the rivalry is still evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we play them, there is a lot of emotion,'' said
Brendan Morrison, the Devils rookie center. ``They're a team
struggling and frustrated and we're better. This is my first year,
but I sense the huge rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1994, the Devils won it in
1995, and the Devils have been better than the Rangers in the
regular season in recent years. The Devils are on the verge of
capturing their third-straight division title and they have a young
team that can make them one of the league's elite teams for the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   From Brodeur in goal to the last player on the fourth line and
the special teams, the Devils were superior Sunday afternoon. They
scored the first two goals and were never in serious trouble, even
during the Rangers' four manpower advantages. The Devils' penalty
killers were so efficient that they yielded only one shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were efficient when they had the man advantage, with
Petr Sykora and Vadim Sharifijanov scoring on the power play. Jason
Arnott and Sergei Nemchinov scored the other goals for the Devils,
while Brian Leetch scored the lone goal for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The victory put the Devils nine points ahead of the Penguins and
the Flyers in the Atlantic Division. They are two points behind
Ottawa for first place in the Eastern Conference.

KNICKS' BEST CHANCE TO WIN EXITS WITH THEIR POISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ On their current flammable path, the New York
Knicks will soon need the kind of warning found on the bottom of
aerosol cans.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure, near heat, the contents of this team continue to
erupt and endanger any chances these players have of winning when a
game gets tense, the officials irritate them and their indignant
attitudes get the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again at the most inopportune moment on Sunday. Here
they were, playing another rival on the road, in the kind of game
they have to prove they are capable of winning. Finally, after
trying to trump the Indiana Pacers' runs with runs of their own
throughout the game, the Knicks had pulled within a hair of Indiana
at the start of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But center Chris Dudley, like a long list of Knicks before him,
could not help himself. Feeling slighted by a foul called on him,
Dudley turned and angrily slammed the ball to the floor. Having
flunked hand-eye coordination, he failed to catch it on the rise,
and the ball bounced away, catching the attention of an official,
who gave him a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the momentum the Pacers needed. The Knicks did not
need a wild-eyed performance by Reggie Miller to undo them as the
Pacers turned a 4-point game into a 108-95 victory on Sunday at
Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a lack of poise nor Patrick Ewing was going to beat the
Pacers, as the Knicks did on Tuesday. Instead of a 37-point effort
by Ewing, which gave the Knicks a victory that night, the center
moved awkwardly on a sore Achilles' tendon Sunday and hit just five
of 15 shots for 16 points, while Rik Smits scored 22 points in 21
minutes for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Once Dudley lost his poise, the floodgates were opened. And out
came a flurry of senseless fouls by Chris Childs to go with a
flustered defensive effort by the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to catch the ball on the rise when I slammed it,
but I missed,'' Dudley said. ``I probably wouldn't have gotten the
technical. I shouldn't have responded that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley's response led to other acts of silliness that left the
Knicks (18-15) with a 4-11 road record. The game got away quickly.
In the first four minutes of the fourth quarter, a four-point game
was turned around by a 14-6 run by Indiana. The Pacers, in the
penalty bonus just four minutes into the fourth, hit 12 of 14 free
throws to close out the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone had their way with us,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. ``We have to learn how to play with more poise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have rarely maintained their cool this season. Last
week three Knicks were fined for their part in altercations against
the Lakers on Sunday and the Pacers on Tuesday. At least the Knicks
had a partner to their madness last week when Indiana's Jalen Rose
and Ewing scuffled. That time, Rose was ejected. This time, the
Pacers did not feed the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell started in place of an injured Larry Johnson,
who gallantly came off the bench when Marcus Camby could not play
because of a strained groin. Then there was Ewing, sore but
unwilling to blame his injury for his shooting troubles. ``There's
no excuse,'' Ewing said. ``We just got frustrated and let the game
get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was never theirs to have. The Knicks were chasing the
Pacers throughout. Down by 11 in the first quarter, a temporarily
hot Allan Houston cut the deficit to two points midway through the
second. But poor perimeter defense, which allowed the Pacers to hit
nine of 18 3-pointers for the game, helped Indiana go on a 14-6 run
to end the first half. The Pacers led by 53-41 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   This spurt and sputter habit by the Knicks was a common thread
on Sunday. Other patterns were noticeable, too. With Sprewell on
the floor, Houston either disappeared by his side or was placed on
the bench. At one point in the first half, the Knicks were minus-19
with Sprewell on the floor. And Houston scored the bulk of his 16
points with Sprewell on the bench in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Sprewell came out of his shell and came up
with 16 points while Houston took just one shot. The mix the Knicks
were looking for when they obtained Sprewell has not panned out
yet.
</P>
<P>
   The edge they had in mind when they traded Charles Oakley for
Camby has not materialized, either. One reason the deal was made
was to find a foil for the Pacers' Antonio Davis. As an injured
bystander, Camby, who has failed to reveal an aggressive nature,
did not have a chance to prove anything. Unencumbered for most of
the day, Davis turned in a 14-point, 11-rebound effort.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone in Pacer yellow who wanted to managed to produce against
the Knicks. The Pacers shot 52.5 percent, only the third team to
top 50 percent against the Knicks this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if losing hurts enough on this team,'' Childs
said. ``We continue to do the same things that lead to losing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Childs spoke, there was laughter in a corner of the locker
room. One moment the Knicks are incensed, the next moment they are
carefree. Either way, they have a habit of showing the wrong
emotion at the most inappropriate moment.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 24 Apache helicopter gunships and the
long-range rockets that President Clinton has ordered to Albania,
combined with 8,000 NATO troops dispatched to aid refugees there,
could quickly be turned into the vanguard of an invasion force if
the order to do so came.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist that this is not their plan and
that at most, those troops would be sent into Kosovo to escort
ethnic Albanians back to their homes once hostilities ceased.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches, these officials say, are bound for the Balkans
because Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO military commander, wants a
potent, all-weather tank-killing weapon to bolster an air campaign
that has been stymied by fog, rain and political constraints.
</P>
<P>
   But even at this early stage, the helicopters mark an important
symbolic threshold in the 12-day allied operation. They are Army
weapons flown by pilots wearing Army green, accompanied by a small
contingent of armored infantry. And while the long-range Army
rockets may not be in Kosovo, their mission will be to attack
hostile air defenses, and possibly other targets, deep behind
Serbian lines.
</P>
<P>
   The much larger NATO relief force also will be well armed, and
the mere prospect of deployment with the Apaches has caused some
concern on Capitol Hill, where Congress is on recess.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the deployment, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said on
CNN's ``Late Edition,'' ``I really don't believe we ought to commit
ground troops to this operation. I don't believe we have given the
air war the kind of opportunity to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more blunt. ``They are combat troops, and they'll
have no problem whatsoever switching to a combat role if such an
order is given,'' said Lt. Gen. William Carter III, a retired chief
of staff of southern NATO forces, who helped direct the allied
operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior congressional official, among those notified Sunday
about the Apache contingent, said: ``If they want to call them part
of the air campaign, fine, but they're a ground support unit. We
are clearly moving toward a ground war in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a senior NATO official in Brussels said the fact that
the United States wanted to send Apaches and rocket batteries
operated by U.S. Army troops from Germany ``raises some interesting
questions about their position not to use ground forces.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's why: The Apaches add a deadly new dimension to a NATO
air campaign that has failed to deter the forces of President
Slobodan Milosevic from expelling tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians from the besieged province and has been hampered in
destroying his military forces.
</P>
<P>
   If dispatched in combat _ a move that still needs concurrence
from NATO's political leaders on Monday and a second approval from
Clinton _ the Apaches would streak into Kosovo at night hugging the
earth at speeds of more than 150 mph, their running lights off.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, peering through night vision goggles, pilots
could lock on to targets identified from surveillance planes or by
an unmanned reconnaissance drone called the Predator. Each
helicopter can fire up to 16 laser-guided Hellfire missiles from
more than three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Except for dense fog, the Apaches can fly in the foulest
weather. But flying closer to the ground than any piloted warplane
makes the helicopters much more vulnerable to automatic weapon
ground fire or short-range shoulder-fired missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the growing number of lawmakers who support the use of
allied ground forces as a way to protect the ethnic Albanians waved
off those risks as a symptom of an overly cautious campaign doomed
to failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem with our strategy is that it has been very
low-risk, but we're getting a higher and higher probability that
we're going to lose the war by pursuing low-risk tactics,`` said
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Western officials have discussed a plan under
which NATO troops would escort tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians back into Kosovo after Serbian forces there had been
routed by weeks of allied bombing.
</P>
<P>
   While not confirming such a plan, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Sunday that Milosevic's goal to drive out the
Kosovars would not be the last word in the crisis. ``Even if he
feels that he has succeeded by expelling everybody, that is not the
way that this is going to end,'' Ms. Albright said on NBC's ``Meet
the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   The troops moving into Albania now are still too few and too
lightly armed to guarantee the safety of ethnic Albanians returning
home or to fight their way in to establish an enclave for them.
American commanders from Clark on down would want a much larger
complement of American armored forces and attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But the forces soon to enter Albania will lay down a fundamental
structure for fuel and other supplies, communications, intelligence
and command operations that could be quickly expanded to adapt to a
larger force.

TABOOS (WINDOW ROCK) At the beginning of this century, being a
Navajo was a lot easier than it is today, traditionalists say. One
hundred years ago, Navajo life evolved around an understanding of
one's place in the universe and one's conduct was governed by
adherence to hundreds _ if not thousands _ of taboos, that had been
passed on from one generation to another throughout most of the
millenium. But as this century ends, Navajo leaders and
traditionalists are saying that the tribe may be facing its
greatest crisis ever - as more and more young Navajos set out on
life with little or no knowledge of the taboos and traditions that
are needed to lead a harmonious life. By BILL DONOVAN. Story will

TESTS (undated) It's a good thing Arizona students get a spring
break, because many of them return to school this month to face a
full plate of tests. To the alphabet soup mix of Stan9, SAT, ACT,

students can add AIMS _ Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards _
which debuts later this month throughout the state. By KELLY

QUAYLECAM (undated) Former Vice President Dan Quayle is running for
president, but don't expect to see him working rope lines in Iowa
or attending living room coffees in New Hampshire until later this
month. Republican primary voters who hope to meet with Quayle _ and
virtually every other GOP candidate for president _ will have to
pay an admission cost, usually $1,000. As the first deadline for
filing the first set of campaign finance reports in the 2000
presidential race approached Wednesday, Quayle was crisscrossing
the country in search of contributions from big donors. At the same
time, his aides were hard at work beefing up a grass-roots donor
list to help him mine smaller donations. By KRIS MAYES. Story will

DACKSYEAR2 (PHOENIX ) Year 2 of the Arizona Diamondbacks is upon us
with fresh faces in the lineup and a new focus in the community.
It's all about baseball. Talk about your radical departure from the
frenzied buildup to Opening Day 1998. The Diamondbacks open their
season today in Los Angeles against the Dodgers in the marquee
pitching matchup of the day: Arizona's Randy Johnson, who signed a
$52.4 million, four year deal in November, against Los Angeles'
Kevin Brown, who became baseball's richest player 12 days later
when he signed a $105 million, seven-year deal. The same two teams
return here next Monday for the home opener at Bank One Ballpark.

three people to death Sunday inside the apartment. Andrew Parks,
37, and his sister, Shelly Parks, 33, died in the living room of

INDIA'S COALITION IS TEETERING AS EX-ACTRESS PUSHES DEMANDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ India's governing Hindu nationalist party is facing
a political showdown with its largest coalition partner, a very
public test of wills that has much of the nation speculating about
whether the year-old government is about to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee defiantly declared Sunday
that he would welcome a no-confidence motion in Parliament, calling
it an opportunity for his Bharatiya Janata Party to prove that if
old allies desert the ship of state, new ones will come aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to face a trial of strength in the house,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is an odd union of ill-fitting parts. It has held
power with a thin majority, dependent on the 18 votes of a state
party from Tamil Nadu run by a mercurial former actress,
Jayalalitha Jayaram.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Jayalalitha, as she is known, made three
demands of the government: dismiss Defense Secretary George
Fernandes, reinstate the ousted naval chief, Adm. Vishnu Bhagwat,
and set up a parliamentary committee to investigate charges of
corruption that Bhagwat has made against his former boss,
Fernandes.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has refused to give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try our patience for too long, we will throw out the
driver and run the train ourselves,'' Ms. Jayaram said at a news
conference Sunday. She predicted ``exciting days ahead,'' but also
said that the prime minister would be given ``reasonable time'' to
satisfy her ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyant Ms. Jayaram is no stranger to corruption charges
herself. She faces trial in several alleged scams that stem from
her term as Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister, from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   When she was arrested in 1996, press reports said that among the
treasures found at her residence were 64 pounds of diamond-studded
gold jewelry, thousands of saris, 750 pairs of shoes, 91 designer
watches and 19 automobiles. Three weeks ago, she was accused of
beating her former accountant with a high-heeled shoe and then
forcing him to sign papers that confessed full responsibility for
her income tax problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her legal problems, she commands the loyalty of her
party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham. On Saturday,
the party's general council unanimously gave her power to form
``new alliances depending on the evolving political situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jayaram is prone to political tantrums, and much doubt has
been expressed about the grave concern she shows for the defense
secretary's job performance.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, her demands have involved more personal matters:
the charges filed against her, which the government recently
transferred to a court she finds more amenable, and the charges she
would like to see filed against her longtime nemesis, Tamil Nadu's
chief minister, Muthuvel Karunanidhi.
</P>
<P>
   Her current threats might be considered as the bombast of a
limelight addict except for a March 29 reception given in Ms.
Jayaram's honor in New Delhi. Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the
Congress Party _ the Hindu nationalists' main opponent _ was among
the guests.
</P>
<P>
   The two women spent less than 10 minutes together, drinking tea.
But the mere fact of their public chat made the front pages. ``We
are old friends,'' Mrs. Gandhi said, which was news in itself.
Conjecture began about a budding alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress outperformed the Hindu nationalists in state
elections last November, there has been talk that Mrs. Gandhi might
try to take power.
</P>
<P>
   What argues against that possibility, however, is the fact that
Congress would find itself in the same situation as the Hindu
Nationalists, sewing patches on an easily frayed coalition.
</P>
<P>
   One Congress insider said Sunday: ``Our aim is not to take over
the government just yet. Our aim is to keep the government on
tenterhooks.''

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The New York Yankees open the 1999 season Monday
night against the Oakland Athletics. Roger Clemens, baseball's only
five-time Cy Young award winner, will make his regular-season debut
as a starter for the Yankees, strolling purposefully to the mound
sometime after 10:35 Eastern time, modern baseball's John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duke seemed bigger than life, then so, too, does the
36-year-old Clemens: Raised in Texas, he is 6 feet 4 inches, 230
pounds with a wagon-size chest. More than that, he has been the
type of pitcher who could almost single-handedly haul a team into a
pennant race. He ranks 10th all-time in strikeouts (3,153) and has
led the league in earned run average six times, second only to
Lefty Grove's nine. As he enters his 16th major league season,
Clemens has 233 victories, the most among active pitchers. Now he
is pitching for a team that won a record 125 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wayne, legends follow the man known as the Rocket.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
`He Was So Focused' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haselman, the Boston catcher for Clemens on Sept. 18, 1996,
when Clemens was short of Cy Young's Boston record for victories
and shutouts:
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing Detroit in Tiger Stadium, and he was so
focused _ he was trying to catch Cy Young for career victories and
shutouts. He had a 2-0 or 3-0 lead and was striking out a bunch of
people. He went up into the clubhouse between innings and never
really knew how many strikeouts he had. I didn't know, either,
until a coach told me after the eighth inning that he had 19
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided not to tell him he had 19, so he could go out there
and concentrate on what we were trying to do. He finished with 20
strikeouts, the game was over, and I walked out to the mound and I
said, `You know what you just did, right?' He was all fired up and
he goes, `Yeah, we just tied Cy Young in wins,' or something like
that. I said, `You struck out 20.' He didn't know _ he genuinely
didn't know. He was so focused, and it's incredible to think he had
no idea he had just tied his own major league record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always includes his catchers on his successes, talks about
`We did this,' or `We did that.' We all know it's his talent out
there throwing the ball. Anybody could be catching him.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman, Clemens' 20th strikeout victim that night:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great forkball that night, and threw the ball where
he wanted to. It was one of the few times when, as a hitter, you
really didn't feel like you had much of a chance. I think everybody
in the lineup felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late in the game, people were listening to their radios in the
stands, and you could hear the enthusiasm of the fans picking up
with every strikeout. When I came up, I knew he had 19. I didn't
know what the record was. I didn't want to be the 20th. Truthfully,
I was just trying to not strike out. I chased a forkball.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`He Knows Himself' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mel Queen, Clemens' pitching coach in Toronto:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game he started with us when I'm the pitching coach,
I'm down in the bullpen and Roger isn't around. I waited; no Roger,
no Roger. It's a 7:05 p.m. start, and here he comes, about five
minutes of seven. He got into his routine, threw about 24 warm-up
pitches and he was ready. When he got on the mound in the bullpen,
the first pitch he threw was as hard as he threw in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early last year, Roger was about 5-6 with about a 3.80 era
Behind home plate, they put up a marquee: Clemens versus whoever
was pitching that night for the other team. I said, `Roger, look at
that up there.' He looked up and stared a little bit and he said,
`That's embarrassing. That's not Roger Clemens and you're not going
to see that anymore.' He won 15 games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real big thing about Roger is he's got a feel for
baseball: He knows what he wants to do _ if he wants to make the
ball move a certain way, he just turns his hand a little bit and
makes an adjustment. He knows himself extremely well. If you tell
him he's doing something wrong, he'll make the adjustment on the
very next pitch, and he doesn't fall back into making the same
mistake.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cris Carpenter, a pitcher with the Blue Jays who grew up in
Manchester, N.H., following Clemens' career with the Red Sox. He
was pitching in the minor leagues when Clemens made his first start
in Fenway Park for the Blue Jays on July 12, 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched that day for Syracuse. At the end of an inning, I'd
run in to watch on the clubhouse television. I phoned home after
the game, and my father said, `Did you see what Roger did?' He
didn't even want to talk about my game. Roger returning to Fenway
Park wearing a Yankees hat will be the game of the year. The fans
will be more upset seeing him in a New York uniform than when he
pitched for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``After the All-Star break last year, I charted Roger's starts
because I pitched after him. Some games he dominated big leaguers
the way I did in Little League when kids would go back to the bench
crying. Roger's velocity on his 125th pitch was the same as his
first pitch.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Big Tex Got Him' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton, a reliever who was a teammate of Clemens' in
Boston and is again with the Yankees. Like Clemens, Stanton is a
Texan who grew up in the shadow of Nolan Ryan _ who was Clemens
before Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger told us this story about a game he pitched against Ryan
early in his career. Nolan Ryan was still with Texas, and
apparently Nolan had a burr under his saddle that day _ he had hit
somebody, and he had knocked somebody else down on his rear end.
Then Nolan buzzed Jim Rice's tower _ just flat knocked him on his
back. Usually, no one said a whole lot when Nolan did something
like that, and it was pretty quiet in the Boston dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Rocket was fired up, and he yelled at Nolan, `All right,
you want to play that, we'll play that!' Nolan was standing on the
hill like Nolan always did, playing with the dirt with his feet,
looking down _ and then Nolan looked up and looked right at the
Rocket in the dugout. Right at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger is saying, `All right, you . . . you . . . you . . .'
And his voice just kind of trailed off. Roger said he went from
screaming at the top of his lungs to sitting down like a whupped
puppy dog. Roger just kind of melted in his shoes; Big Tex got
him.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Fletcher, a catcher who worked with Clemens last year in
Toronto:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a start at home last year where he was struggling to
get close calls from the plate ump. So, Roger called me out to the
mound. He was a bit flustered since most of the calls were going
the hitters' way. I got out there and he said, `Just wait here a
second, until the ump comes out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The ump came out to tell us to hurry up and Roger said to the
ump: `I know some of those hitters up there have some pretty good
credentials, but if you want to talk credentials I've got some
pretty good ones to toss around too. We can take a look at the back
of my bubble gum card if you want.' I was like, `Yeah! That's
telling him.''' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`He'd Be Sweating' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morgan, who managed the Red Sox when Clemens was there, and
was coaching in the Fenway Park bullpen on April 29, 1986, when
Clemens first broke the strikeout record:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Chuck Cottier, the Seattle manager, and he
said before the game, `You can't believe how these guys are
striking out this year. We can't get a hit. It was kind of a cold
night, and Roger mostly overpowered them with a fastball _ that was
the night he struck out 20. He had great control. There were times
when Tony Pena would put down his glove, and he would hit it, 92-93
miles an hour. He had an unhittable slider when he was young _ it
was like lead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran a lot _ he and Al Nipper used to do a lot of running
along the Charles River. You could see his work ethic in the
clubhouse; he'd be sweating and all red from the exercise.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Cloninger, the Yankees' bullpen coach, who accompanied
Clemens to his last start in Clearwater, Fla., last Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``After he was through pitching, he put on his shorts and his
running shoes. On our drive out to Clearwater, he asked us to
measure off three miles from the Yankees complex, so he could get
the distance. On our way back, we pulled off the highway three
miles out, and we waited till he crossed the street, and he ran in.
I was joking with Joe Girardi _ `Do we have to come to a complete
stop, or does he just jump out?' Pretty amazing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`He's Big and Mean' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fischer, formerly pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox,
for whom Clemens pitched from 1984 to 1996:
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him grow from a 21-year-old pitcher to what he is
today in size and stamina. He was lean and he was mean, now he's
big and mean. I always used to use his work ethic as a guideline;
you never knew where you were going to find him. He used to run the
streets of Boston. He had had some arm problems one year, and he
got knocked out in the first inning of one game at Fenway, and so
he went and got his wife Debi out of the stands, took a bag of
balls out of the clubhouse and went to a nearby high school field.
He warmed up _ she was catching him at first _ and then he threw
about 100 pitches into the backstop, and she would pick them up. He
made sure he got his work in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston should've never let him get away _ you don't let guys
like that leave an organization. He's like Williams, Yaz, guys like
that. If he pitches like he did the last two years, and the Yankees
hit like they did last year and play defense like they did, he
could be the next 30-game winner this year.'' &QL;

IT'S ABOUT TIME TO HOLD RANGERS TO COWBOYS' STANDARDS OF SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A rumor circulated last week about a media
rights deal connecting Tom Hicks with Jerry Jones.
Cowboys-Rangers-Stars would certainly be an interesting package for
a regional sports cable network ... right, Mr. Hicks?
</P>
<P>
   Ever notice how the rich and powerful seem to be clannish? In
time, they always find each other.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing to it,'' Jones said of the rumor. ``But I admire Tom
Hicks. At some point, there might be something we would be talking
about. There is a common interest on several fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that common interest is more prevalent than perhaps
Jones realizes, even if there is never a business deal between the
two.
</P>
<P>
   You see it with the Hicks-owned Stars.
</P>
<P>
   More to the present, you see it with the Hicks-owned Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys became under Jones' ownership is exactly what
Hicks expects from his baseball team in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1999, the Rangers have officially joined the big boys of
baseball business. And 28 years later, a Valley Ranch-type winning
environment has finally taken root in Arlington. At the moment,
it's just the environment. There are no Valley Ranch-like skins on
the wall at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the atmosphere, the demands, and the expectations
have been combined with a financial commitment from Hicks. If the
Rangers don't eventually become the best, Hicks will start asking
hard questions about why he's providing the cash he's more than
willing to spend.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning of the 1999 season opener in Arlington, I bring
this up as a reason to proclaim the obvious:
</P>
<P>
   It's about damn time.
</P>
<P>
   Face it:
</P>
<P>
   The reputation of the Rangers has been awful for way too long.
The organization had become the Switzerland of professional sports
_ nice people who never joined the fight.
</P>
<P>
   One probably true theory is that the Rangers never had to make a
total commitment to winning. Just be competitive; just run Nolan
Ryan out there for a few years; just act like you want to win, and
the fans will come, be it the old ballyard or the new one. Money
could be made by ownership without high-stakes risk.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I had more than my share of disagreements with
the late Bob Short, Brad Corbett, the late Eddie Chiles and then
the George W. Bush group. But these were good people who had their
own ideas about owning the local baseball team. It was also their
money.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, over the years, I've heard as much criticism of the
Fort Worth-Dallas media for failing to demand the same standards
for the Rangers as the Cowboys. There's truth in that.
</P>
<P>
   But then Hicks took over. What should have been a given all
along has now become the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   A $75 million payroll, seventh highest in baseball, is only part
of the story. Hicks, of course, was willing to go another $12
million a year if Randy Johnson had signed.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has never outlined what he expects from the Rangers this
season, or what expectations general manager Doug Melvin and
manager Johnny Oates must meet.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the World Series? Making the World Series by winning the
pennant? Or just advancing past the first round of the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see how the year plays out,'' Hicks did say. ``Over the
course of a season, factors become involved that can have a
positive or negative influence on expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers couldn't land Randy Johnson or Roger Clemens,
despite a huge effort, it left the pitching rotation very light in
overall talent. And that rotation was, for the most part, a large
disappointment in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point during this season, rotation help will arrive
via a trade. Other than that, however, details are sketchy here on
opening day at The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hicks took over, the foundation for winning finally arrived
in Arlington, many will say 27 years late. Regardless, it's here.
</P>
<P>
   The time will come when a Randy Johnson-type will want to play
in Arlington because Arlington is where you win. Or Roger Clemens
will shun the Yankees to stay in Texas, because Texas is where you
win.
</P>
<P>
   But last winter was too early. The Hicks' campaign had only just
begun. His expectations are no different from the Jerry Jones
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Be the best.
</P>
<P>
   At least it's a start. And better now than never.

PALMEIRO RETURNING TO SENDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rafael Palmeiro's knee injury is perfect,
exactly what the Rangers wanted. For $45 million, they deserve at
least that.
</P>
<P>
   They probably even planned it that way in one of their sinister
vice presidents' meetings. It sets the scene perfectly for Opening
Day ...
</P>
<P>
   A sunny afternoon at The Ballpark in Arlington has turned dark.
Spring thunderstorms rumble in the distance and lightning splits
the sky. The hard-fought affair is going to the ninth inning, the
Rangers trailing 4-2, but 46,000 fans still cling to one last hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers call on Matt Anderson, 6-foot-4, 22 years old and
throwing 96 mph. He blows away Juan Gonzalez on three pitches. Ivan
Rodriguez goes down swinging. Hope fades, but Todd Zeile bloops a
single to left. Lee Stevens takes a fastball on the hip.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Kelly is called back to the dugout ...
</P>
<P>
   ... Cue the music ...
</P>
<P>
   Copeland's ``Fanfare for the Common Man'' or Wagner's ``Ride of
the Valkyries'' perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the dugout he emerges, limping slowly and painfully
to the plate, the great matador going out to face the bull, only
with a bat instead of a cape.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson starts firing fastballs, and Palmeiro keeps fouling
them off. The radar gun clicks ... 96, 97, 98, 99. The count goes
full and finally, the baseball hurtles toward the plate at 100 mph.
There is that sweet swing and a deafening crash ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long drive to right!!!'' Eric Nadel screams into the
microphone, ``That ball is deep! Way back! Headed for the 501 sign!
That ball is ... history!!''
</P>
<P>
   The prodigal son has returned. The brown-eyed handsome man is
rounding third and heading for home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a pretty neat story,'' Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Surely that's the only way Palmeiro could return to Texas after
his exile in Baltimore, a long-awaited arrival that ends the great
debate over what happened one winter evening five years ago when
the Rangers let him get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm coming home, definitely,'' Palmeiro said.
``Not that Baltimore wasn't a good place; I can't forget those five
years. Those five years were awesome; the whole experience was
good. But this is home. I also think the way this team is headed,
these \Rnext\S five years will be as good or better.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the knee injury is not good. This is not the way
Palmeiro wanted to return; he has taken too much pride in going out
there every day and producing.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a danger of pushing too hard and too fast in the
hopes of a Kirk Gibson-like scenario on Opening Day, ``The
Natural'' getting off his deathbed with a bullet in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's correct,'' Palmeiro said. ``They should expect
more than what they have been getting. I expect to do more than
what he did. But a lot of it was he was hurt. That took away from
his game. But ... I feel I should do more. I will do more.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rangers fans may not realize is they could be getting a
Hall of Fame player back. Nolan Ryan is the first to wear the
Rangers cap into Cooperstown, but the possibility exists that
Palmeiro could be the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' Palmeiro said. ``Some people have started to
realize it. I don't think many people have noticed it, but people
who know baseball are starting to realize it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has labored in relative obscurity behind the shadow of Mark
McGwire, Mo Vaughn, Frank Thomas and others. But he has 314 homers,
1,975 hits and 1,079 RBI. In two seasons, his numbers should be
equal to Orlando Cepeda, who is being inducted to the Hall of Fame
this year. In five seasons, if the health remains as it always has
been, he should be approaching 3,000 hits and 500 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player,'' outfielder Juan Gonzalez said. ``We all
know what he can do, good average, great power. He's going to make
us a much better offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said baseball people understand the kind of career he
has had, ``but I don't think the fans do. The fans are interested
in the really big names like \RKen\S Griffey, Gonzalez and
\RAlbert\S Belle, guys in the news. But that's OK. I don't have a
problem with that. They deserve everything they get as far as
publicity or notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first-base position in the American League is the toughest
in all of baseball. You've got guys like Frank Thomas, who has won
a couple of MVPs; Mo Vaughn, who was the most valuable player; Mark
McGwire, who was here for a bunch of years; Jim Thome; Tino
Martinez; guys like that. You're talking about the most-productive
players in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has been that, too. Rangers fans have not forgotten,
and they eagerly await what is to come from their brown-eyed
handsome man.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect Opening Day scenario is there.

   KUKES, Albania _ Kosovo refugees are spread across the stony
hillsides here after days of agonizingly slow, terror-stricken
flight from Serbian forces, sleeping in the open or under the thin
shelter of plastic sheets stretched over their farm carts.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of human waste mixes with the smoke from their cooking
fires and the dust kicked up by the tractors on which they fled.
Many have not had food or water for days and stare silently,
haunted by the memory of being hounded from their homes or simply
numbed by the physical exhaustion and psychological emptiness of a
life on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Their ordeal is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tears in their eyes when they cross the border
because they think it's all over,'' said Dorian Vienneau, one of
the observers from the Organization for Cooperation and Security in
Europe stationed at the Morini border crossing that is the main
transit point between Kosovo and Albania. ``They don't know they
are facing another nightmare, the nightmare of being a refugee,
with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The realization hasn't dawned on them that they have just
arrived in the poorest country in Europe,'' he said. ``There's a
higher standard of living in Kosovo. The roads are intact, they
collect the garbage, the telephones work.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other relief
organizations have been caught unprepared for what Albania on
Sunday called the ``biblical deluge'' of refugees from the Serbian
campaign to drive hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo, where they had constituted about 90 percent of the
population of 1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter of a million people have poured into the
remote, impoverished mountains of northern Albania in the past
eight days. Some 166,200 had arrived here by Sunday morning, and
they kept crossing at the rate of about 1,500 an hour throughout
the day and into the night, meaning 19,417 more arrivals by 8
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   In the even more primitive districts to the northwest, another
35,000 have arrived. Most walk on a road _ a path really _ across
the border where the danger of mines means that they mostly leave
vehicles behind. Another 140,000 have arrived in Macedonia and
Montenegro. And the numbers keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   What is making things worse is that Albania has virtually no
supplies, equipment or trained personnel to help them. As a relief
worker noted Saturday night, one problem in bringing in relief
supplies is that there is apparently only one forklift in the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic sheeting, the most basic of emergency supplies, is
running out here. Food is getting low in this ramshackle town where
every building is filled with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   This area is extremely isolated, linked to the rest of Albania
by a single, twisting mountain road. Aid workers say their first
priority is to move people out of here to the capital, Tirana,
where they can be better housed and fed in emergency camps.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government has mobilized battered buses and trucks
to carry people down the road, a six-hour journey in the best of
times, longer in the mud created by the rainy, cloudy weather that
has hampered NATO's airstrikes and made the refugees' existence
even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But more refugees keep coming and there are not enough buses and
trucks. Taxi drivers are charging 300 German marks _ about $170 _
to go to Tirana. There were a few signs of humanitarian aid
arriving Sunday, but it was a mere trickle in the face of the tidal
wave of human misery coming across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, a tent city has sprung up near an electric plant
along the crumbling road between Kukes and the border. The tents
were struck by about 100 Italian volunteers, normally mobilized for
disasters in their own country, under the direction of the Italian
Department of Civil Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Pisa Fire Department, Giuseppe Romano, and four
other strapping Italian firemen, are directing the camp, which they
said would have about 500 tents, medical facilities and a field
kitchen run by the Red Cross. Late Sunday afternoon, a rich aroma
of tomato sauce was already wafting over the tents.
</P>
<P>
   Romano, who was called back from vacation on Good Friday, said
the tents would be a transit area holding people after they cross
the border and before they can get transportation out of the
mountains. He said it could serve about 3,000 people _ two hours'
worth of refugees coming across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Italian and and Albanian military helicopters flew nine loads of
food and supplies into the wild mountain area of the northwest on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers Sunday handed out bottled water at the border
crossing for the first time _ many of the refugees are dehydrated,
which can be fatal _ along with apples and oranges. The last few
days they had only been giving out concentrated emergency vegetable
protein bars from Norway, called BP-5, resembling sticks of
plastic, and tiny jars of Gerber's peach baby food.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors of the World, a French volunteer medical aid group, set
up 15 tents for shelter on the muddy hillside next to the border
post Sunday with another tent neatly stocked with packages of
medicine and cots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people coming here are traumatized,'' said Antoine
Pierce, one of the French doctors. ``Some are injured, some have
seen people killed in front of them, a husband killed in front of a
wife, three children in front of a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs, they are killing just for pleasure, the pleasure of
seeing Albanian blood,'' he went on. ``The people are already
leaving. We don't see young men, they are keeping them there. Some
regions are more barbarian than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do mostly emergency first aid here,'' he said. ``A
little surgery. If a person has a piece of mortar in him, we can
pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the refugees keep coming, with NATO estimating more than
300,000 people on the move inside Kosovo and much of its capital of
Pristina emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Hysni Ymera, 49, arrived driving a tractor that pulled a cart
with his family in it. His village, Suarek Supin, had been shelled,
he said. It was only some 20 miles from the border, but the journey
took 55 hours ``because there were so many cars and trucks on the
road.''

MCGWIRE'S HOME RUNS SENT A SURGE OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The power of Mark McGwire's music is
electric, like 1,000 volts suddenly surging through the body.
</P>
<P>
   The moment starts with a sellout crowd at Busch Stadium tense
with anticipation, a rhythmic clap flowing through the stands. All
eyes are on the batter's box where a 6-foot-5, 250-pound redhead
with bulging biceps stands poised, his bat lethally circling above
him.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, a pitcher nervously twitches as he stares intently
at the target 60 feet, six inches away. The victim could be Dennis
Reyes or Steve Trachsel, Mike Morgan or Carl Pavano. There were so
many of them that none will stand out through the passage of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he summons enough nerve to throw, and the bat flashes
violently. There is a clap of thunder, and the ball rockets deep
toward left, totally devoid of suspense. You know it immediately.
Blink and you'll miss it. McGwire has just hit another home run and
the jolt of thrilling, stunning awe is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   It happened 70 times last year when McGwire came to bat and
another 66 times with Sammy Sosa in one breathtaking season when
baseball's most hallowed record came crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, it was more than two extremely talented hitters chasing
a statistic. It was a nation falling in love with a game and its
heroes again, and the reaffirmation that baseball always has and
will always be our national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I'll always remember and what I'm most proud of
is people writing me letters or coming up to me and telling me
their story of what the summer meant to them,'' McGwire said. ``It
was really unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can possibly forget the 1998 season? The likes of it may
never be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a fairy tale ... more exciting than the World
Series,'' Cardinals Hall of Famer Stan Musial said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspense began in spring training. McGwire hit 58 home runs
the season before, and speculation was rampant about the
possibility of breaking Roger Maris' single-season home run. Then
came four home runs in the first four games, and McGwire's life
will never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   His competition was supposed to be Ken Griffey Jr., but the best
all-around player in baseball would finish with a mere 56 as a
peripheral participant in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sosa came from almost nowhere by hitting 20 home runs in
June. Suddenly, McGwire was not alone. It was now a two-man race,
and the home runs kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   In August, doubt crept in. McGwire seemed to be unraveling. He
complained about the constant attention, and after his 46th home
run broke a drought of 29 at-bats, he snapped at reporters in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit worrying about me,'' McGwire barked. ``There are more
important things to worry about than Mark McGwire hitting home
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst suggested McGwire couldn't stand the pressure. But
it would be proved in September that nothing was further from the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sosa seemed to re-energize him. Sosa not only accepted
the media attention but embraced it and reveled in it. His
ever-present smile and the trademark salute he offered to fans,
teammates and his mother were magnetic. He made people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, following Sosa's example, finally accepted the
attention as well and learned not to let it bother him. The
home-run chase regained momentum. When he hit his 50th on Aug. 20,
he was willing to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my second wind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The count was at 59 entering the Labor Day weekend, when the
Cardinals started a five-game homestand with the Cincinnati Reds
and the Cubs. The national media descended upon St. Louis to see
history made, and McGwire did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   He hit No. 60 off Reyes and the Reds on Saturday. No. 61 came
against Morgan and the Cubs on Labor Day, a 430-foot blast that
crashed against the windows of the Stadium Club in upper left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sept. 8, McGwire smashed a line drive down the
left-field line off Trachsel and watched it disappear just above
the wall. As Busch Stadium exploded in unrestrained joy and as
McGwire jogged around the bases accepting congratulations from
teammates and opponents, Maris' name was erased from the record
book.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't finished. Sosa had 58 and the record still needed
defending.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa would actually take the lead, for less than an hour. On
Sept. 25, with three games left in the season, Sosa hit his 66th
against the Astros in Houston. He was one up until, 45 minutes
later, McGwire hit his 66th against Montreal's Shayne Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Then came those mind-boggling final two games at sold-out Busch
Stadium. The games didn't matter. Both teams were out of the
playoff hunt. All eyes were squarely on McGwire, just to see if he
could hit one out.
</P>
<P>
   He responded triumphantly, perhaps the greatest individual
performance under pressure ever witnessed in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Reggie Jackson rivaled it by hitting five home runs in the
World Series, or Joe DiMaggio by hitting in 56 consecutive games,
or Christy Mathewson by throwing three shutouts in a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   What is known is McGwire ended the season with a flourish
unimaginable by hitting four home runs in the final two days, the
last one coming on his final swing of the season off Pavano.
</P>
<P>
   The final count was 70 and a game had lived like it never lived
before.

MO IS THE NEW KID IN TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Michael Eisner, the big cheese at Disney, visited
the Anaheim Angels' camp earlier this spring and met the company's
new, $80 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Eisner, the CEO of the corporation
that owns the Angels and Mickey Mouse, laid eyes on Mo Vaughn. The
slugging first baseman not only is supposed to be the club's ticket
to the top of the American League West, but also is evidence that
Disney is serious about winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, finally, people realized we are not going to do a
short-term thing,'' Eisner said. ``We are a long-term player in
sports. We want to be competitive, but we want to be fiscally
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn represents the competitive part of the equation. The
Angels signed the free agent to an eight-year, $80 million contract
to fortify the lineup and show the team that has a propensity for
September collapses how to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of players here who know how to play the game,''
Vaughn said. ``I just want to develop the attitude to win and be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiscally responsible part, however, keeps the Angels from
being prohibitive favorites to return to the playoffs for the first
time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, the best starting pitcher on the free-agent
market, had eliminated the Rangers from his list of prospective
teams. He had an offer from the Arizona Diamondbacks, but was
waiting for a final bid from the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   If they had matched the Diamondbacks offer, he probably would
have taken it. But it never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely close to going to the Angels,'' Johnson told
Baseball Weekly. ``I was waiting for a final offer, and it seemed
like it was taking forever while they were waiting to hear from
corporate ownership. I understand why the Angels had to go to the
top corporate level, but I figured that if this is what it's like
now, what happens in July when we need a player for the pennant
race and they can't get an answer?''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been in the pennant race the past two seasons,
but collapsed down the stretch both times. In 1997, they blew a big
lead, and the Seattle Mariners won the division. Last season, the
Rangers won the West by taking all five games between the two teams
in the final two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was given a lot of money to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just his presence alone has changed the way we're going to
look at things,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``When you've got
someone the stature of Mo Vaughn saying you've got to pick it up,
it means a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the presence of the hulking, imposing Vaughn in
the Angels' clubhouse sends the signal that upper management cares
about winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always come to spring training excited, but it's a little
different this season with Mo,'' right fielder Tim Salmon said.
``We've had a chance to win before, but all the ingredients are
there this year. We really haven't had a superstar in a while. We
were looking for someone to give us that little push, and he does
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much of a push remains to be seen. The man brought in
to teach the team how to win has been in the playoffs just once, in
1995 with the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   However, he clearly gives the Angels a formidable lineup.
Vaughn, who batted .337 with 40 homers and 115 runs batted in last
season, is joined by Darin Erstad (.296, 19 homers), Jim Edmonds
(.307, 25 homers), Salmon (.300, 26 homers), and Garrett Anderson
(.294).
</P>
<P>
   ``This was always one of the scariest teams to play against
because of the kind of talent they had,'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the lineup is, the Angels aren't likely to win the
division by outslugging the defending champs. The Rangers countered
the Vaughn move by signing Rafael Palmeiro _ who outpowered Vaughn
last year with 43 homers and 121 RBI _ to go with a nucleus of Juan
Gonzalez, Rusty Greer and Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners also can slug with the Angels, with their
lineup of Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez, Jay
Buhner and David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how you can count Seattle out with the firepower
they have,'' Erstad said. ``They've got a heck of a lineup. I
really think there's going to be four teams beating each other up
this year. Oakland's going to have a pretty salty lineup
themselves. They're going to score a lot of runs. There's going to
be a lot of great battles all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The war should be decided by the same thing that usually decides
these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll all come down to pitching,'' Angels right-hander Ken
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels upgraded their rotation by signing a free agent, but
it was Tim Belcher and not Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is a solid major-league pitcher, capable of going deep
into games and giving his high-powered offense a chance to win.
That's also the description of Mark Clark, the Rangers' free-agent
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible the Angels will trade one of their surplus
outfielders _ they have Erstad, Edmonds, Salmon and Anderson for
three positions _ for pitching, but for now the rotation is Chuck
Finley, Hill, Belcher, Omar Olivares and Steve Sparks. That looks a
lot like the Rangers' starting staff of Rick Helling, Aaron Sele,
Clark, John Burkett and Mike Morgan or Esteban Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Vaughn signing, the two teams remain similar in
talent. Perhaps it will come down to an intangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to, from day one, feel like we're going to win this
whole thing,'' Vaughn said. ``This game is nothing but attitude.
When you get to this level, everybody's talented. This team has to
have an attitude.''

REALITY BYTES BRING COMPUTER BASEBALL TO LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Have I ever told you how much I hate
rotisserie baseball?
</P>
<P>
   The wheeling, the dealing, the much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In rotisserie baseball, I am told, Tony Womack is actually
considered a valuable major-league player. (Insert guffaws here.)
Colorado Rockies pitchers are said to have a pact with Satan.
</P>
<P>
   But boys will always be boys, and so I have found another
baseball addiction. Late at night, while the rotisserie geeks are
studying WHIP ratios and scanning box scores for Jose Canseco's
stolen bases, I am being transported to Fenway Park, to Turner
Field or, most often, to Johnny Oates' dugout seat at The Ballpark
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   We play Diamond Mind Baseball. We play by computer. We have a
league of 24 teams, linked by E-mail and stretching from Hawaii to
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   We will be glad to sit down and talk to you about our league, if
you have an hour or two or 10. As we like to put it, we are a
friendly, simple group ... 24 teams ... 24 managers ... 24
impending divorces.
</P>
<P>
   We have a pretentious name, The Baseball League in Arlington. We
have a web site _ www.startext.net/homes/lebreton. We are not
affiliated with the Rangers in any way, though if they want to
throw a lavish annual banquet for us, I'd like to order the roast
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   As League Czar, I have appointed myself for life. If my team,
the Arlington Daily Gnus, chokes in the playoffs one more time,
that gives me about six months, give or take a few Jerry DiPoto
relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Mind is not the prettiest game on the market. It's not
one of those Nintendo or Sega abominations. Diamond Mind is a
text-only game. It is accurate, almost to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   All the managerial decisions are there _ whether to pull John
Burkett in the fourth inning or let him suffer, whether to order
Tom Goodwin to bunt or let him flail away.
</P>
<P>
   We drafted our teams. We named them. We gave them web sites. We
talk about them incessantly. We are sick men.
</P>
<P>
   Or are we?
</P>
<P>
   My earliest recollection is going directly from a rattle to dice
baseball. Girls had Barbies; guys had APBA and Strat-O-Matic. In
later years, I even took my APBA baseball boards to Vietnam. When I
married, my dowry included my Strat-O-Matic cards.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and I were never ones to gather for weekly
poker-fests. We played APBA baseball. We formed leagues. We tried
to be the dice version of Earl Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   When I worked at ``The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans, our
office pennant race was turned askew one night when Bugs Bergeron,
the 350-pound copy boy, traded Carl Yastrzemski to a contender for
two Whoppers and a ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the same season, one of the league's best teams was sent
into a tailspin when the manager's dog ate Amos Otis.
</P>
<P>
   It all changed in the late 1980s, when Tom Tippett of Lexington,
Mass., brought dice baseball to the home computer. Now, Amos Otis
can't be eaten, but I am worried about Vladimir Guerrero and this
Melissa virus.
</P>
<P>
   I have never had the heart to go up to shortstop Royce Clayton
and ask him to mix in a base on balls every now and then because it
would be ``good for the Daily Gnus'' next season. But I am on
record as asking Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, in the middle
of a news conference, for an update on pitcher Pat Hentgen's sore
right arm.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got an hour, or two, I'll tell you about the Arlington
Daily Gnus' chances of knocking off the favored Cumberland
Hillbillies this season.
</P>
<P>
   As League Czar, I'll even put you on our waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   It's long. Boys will always be boys.

   U.S. TO SEND CHOPPERS TO ALBANIA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By BENNETT ROTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon said Sunday that it expects to send 24
Apache helicopters along with 2,000 support soldiers to Albania to
buttress an air campaign in Kosovo that has been hampered by poor
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Yugoslav official claimed that the three U.S.
soldiers captured last week _ including one from Huntsville _ were
being treated well and would not be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said the low-flying Apache
helicopters would enable NATO forces to hit Serb military
operations that have eluded the higher flying aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But Bacon said the deployment of the attack helicopters was not
a precursor to a ground campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure and simple an expansion of the air operation,''
said Bacon. ``It's to give us the tank killing capability that the
bad weather has denied us. It will give us the capability to get up
closer and personal to the Milosevic armor of units in Kosovo, and
to do a more effective job at eliminating or neutralizing the
forces on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the attack helicopters would be backed up by
personnel and weapons, including the Multiple Launch Rocket
Systems, as well as short-and medium-range missiles that can take
out Yugoslav air defenses throughout Kosovo where ethnic Albanian
refugees have been forced out by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   The flat-bellied Apache helicopter, made by McDonnell Douglas,
is the Army's primary attack helicopter and was used widely in the
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon acknowledged that sending in the helicopters posed certain
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, close-in engagement is by definition riskier than
more distant engagement. But the army is trained to cope with
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000 soldiers who will accompany the helicopters include a
support battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, a military
police company, a signal company, military intelligence and
aviation maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers and helicopters are based in Germany and will be
sent to Albania, a move that Bacon said should take seven to 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Pentagon spokesman said that final decision to use
the helicopters and rocket launchers hinges on the approval of NATO
and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials said they had no new information on the
three soldiers captured last week in Macedonia, a Yugoslav official
said on ABC's This Week that the men will be treated well and will
not be put on trial. The soldiers include Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21,
of Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure the American public that there will be no problem
with them,'' said Milan Bozic, the deputy mayor of Belgrade and a
minister without portfolio in the Yugoslavian government.
</P>
<P>
   Bozic said that reports that the men will be tried were false
and a result of the ``malevolent communication from some media on
the west.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they will not be tried and they will be back in
their homes as soon as this stupidity stops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Clinton administration officials continued to say
they were not considering ground troops, a number of lawmakers said
Sunday that was the only option to beat Serb leader Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Meet the Press, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said that
the White House should not rule out ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the options must be there, if for no other reason, than to
send a very clear signal to your tyrant opponent here, Mr.
Milosevic, that this is not a scaled thing, we'll do a little
bombing and then we won't do a little more,'' said Hagel.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., criticized the Clinton
administration for not moving more forcefully in Kosovo and sending
in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem with out strategy is that it has been very
low risk, but we're getting a higher and higher probability that
we're going to lose the war by pursing a low risk strategy,'' he
said on This Week.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla, disagreed, saying the United States
risked further weakening of its defense system by getting involved
in a protracted war which he claimed did not have strategic
significance to this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be in Kosovo, we should not have been in
Bosnia,'' said Inhofe on Meet the Press. ``All of thse deployments
are just making it much more dangerous for us and for our military
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe said the United States should announce a May 1 deadline
for withdrawing its forces and let the European nations in NATO
continue the military campaign by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One top Clinton administration official said that a ground war
would extract too high a human price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting village to village, there would be thousands of
casualties,'' said Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser on CBS' Face the Nation. ``We do not believe it is
necessary to achieve our objectives.''

FRENZIED BIRTH MARKED RANGERS' LONE STAR ARRIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Frank Howard was standing in the outfield at
Al Lang Field late this spring, armed only with a fungo bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays had just defeated the Rangers in an exhibition
game, but there was still work to be done, so Howard was in right,
shagging as Tampa Bay players took extra batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   No glove, understand, only a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Baseballs would roll to a stop, Howard would stroll over, pick
them up and fungo them to another Rays coach behind a screen at
second base.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. planes attacking targets in Yugoslavia were as
accurate with their bombs as Howard is with a fungo bat, the war
there would already be over.
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed. Howard has always been a dangerous
man with a bat in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Stop the tape right there.
</P>
<P>
   Rewind 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, push the ``play'' button.
</P>
<P>
   Sit back and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   It is April 21, 1972, a cool spring evening at a hastily
restructured minor-league baseball park bearing a brand new name:
Arlington Stadium. If you look closely, you can probably see the
new name painted over the old one. So much for Turnpike Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days of John Bocabella, and Don Kessinger, Bobby
Grich and Don Larsen (yes, he also passed through as a Dallas-Fort
Worth Spur). There's a new sheriff in town.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Ted Williams, and he's there with a new team, a
ragged, makeshift band of castoffs on the run from the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   They also have a brand new name.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bunch of guys from a lot of different
organizations,'' Rangers' pitching coach Dick Bosman remembered.
``Most of us had never been on a winning team. We didn't know how
to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we had a guy on the team who knew what being a
professional was. He was like a big brother to most of us, and he
taught us how to be big leaguers, how to play and behave with
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Howard.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1972 season had been delayed by the first (but unfortunately
not last) players' strike in baseball history, and the Rangers had
opened with a five-game road trip. By the time they saw their new
home, they were already sinking at 1-4, a portent of things to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Bosman had started the opening game against California's Andy
Messersmith in Anaheim and lost 1-0. He would also start the home
opener against Angels' left-hander Clyde Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember a lot of chaos that night,'' Bosman said. ``We
were all basically coming to Texas for the first time. Guys were
settling into new places to live. I was nervous, starting the first
game and all.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Bosman's wife, Pam, kept her mouth shut when she felt
her first labor pain that afternoon. She didn't want to upset Dick
any more than he already was. She went right on with her plans to
attend the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd pitched a couple of presidential openers in Washington,''
Bosman said, ``but this was special, with the franchise moving to a
new area and hoping to catch on with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember we weren't sold out, not by a longshot.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the starting pitcher, Bosman wasn't with his
teammates when they were introduced and presented with new Stetson
hats as they lined up along the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one later, though,'' he said. ``I still have it. Just
had it rebuilt by Cavender's a couple of months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard says he doesn't remember much about that game, though he
is reminded now and then by folks like me that he hit a home run in
his first at-bat, the first dinger ever hit at Arlington Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``A two-iron over the center-field fence into the face of a
pretty stiff wind,'' is how Bosman remembers it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I felt bad about was that I was pretty much done as
a player by the time I got to Texas,'' Howard said. ``I couldn't
play any more. But I've always loved coming back to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew it was going to work there if they could just get it
going and build a farm system. I just did what I could to help
young guys like Jeff Burroughs, Joe Lovitto and Toby Harrah get
over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they, too, are names from the past. Burroughs' son was
drafted last summer. Lovitto continues his courageous fight against
cancer and Harrah is a Reds' minor-league coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bosman won that night. Paul Lindblad, who is in an assisted
living home with Alzheimer's, got the save. Dave Nelson also
homered, and Lenny Randle had three hits and drove in four runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, back in the clubhouse behind the
center-field fence, Bosman got a call from the team doctor, who had
been sitting with Pam. She'd held off as long as she could.
Daughter Michelle, who will turn 27 this month, was about to make
her long-awaited debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers beat the Angels, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   It was April 21, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you were there.

FIVE YEARS AFTER SUICIDE, COBAIN STILL HAILED AS VOICE OF
GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Five years after his death, Kurt Cobain is being
hailed as the most important rock musician of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Credited with reviving rock at a time when it had become tame
and predictable, Nirvana's lead singer and guitarist galvanized a
generation of listeners with his raw, abrasive songs and
soul-searing lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April 1994, at age 27, the troubled musician injected a
large dose of heroin and killed himself with a shotgun at his home
here.
</P>
<P>
   Though others, notably Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, also were
influential during the alternative-rock boom of the early 1990s,
Cobain _ a man at war with himself _ is most often credited as the
voice of a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Kurt's death, in the alternative field, there really
hasn't been an icon, a person who speaks for a generation,'' said
Phil Manning, program director at Seattle modern-rock and
alternative station KNDD-FM.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people have gravitated to hip-hop artists as
their icons. ... A lot of their music is more rebellious than the
alternative music of today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevermind,'' Nirvana's breakthrough 1991 album, last month
reached an important milestone, climbing to 10 million in certified
U.S. sales. The achievement earned the group a Diamond Award, newly
created by the Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   In its March issue, Guitar World named Cobain ``artist of the
decade.'' The rock magazine's list of the top 20 albums of the '90s
begins with ``Nevermind,'' released after the group leaped from
Seattle's Sub Pop label to DGC Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, (the Cobain legend) gets exponentially bigger,''
said Jeff Gilbert, an editor for Guitar World.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Jim Morrison of the Doors, who just keeps getting
more and more popular. I think that's exactly what's going to
happen with Nirvana. It hasn't even peaked. There's some road to
travel yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing that view is Charles Cross, editor of Seattle magazine
The Rocket and author of ``The Will of Instinct: The Biography of
Kurt Cobain,'' due next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any doubt, Kurt is the most important rock musician of
not just the '90s, but of the most current generation,'' Cross
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been dead for five years and yet no one else has been as
charismatic or come as close to capturing the public's attention as
much as he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobain had difficulty understanding the media's obsession with
his life. ``I never realized that my private life would be such an
issue,'' said the musician, who just wanted to write and play
music.
</P>
<P>
   On the album ``In Utero,'' he sang: ``Teenage angst has paid off
well/ Now I'm bored and old.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobain, raised in blue-collar Aberdeen, Wash., was found dead
the morning of April 8, 1994. Invesigators later determined that
Cobain probably had killed himself on April 5, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His body was discovered by an electrician at the home he shared
with his toddler daughter, Frances Bean, and wife Courtney Love,
who was in Los Angeles at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Love and and Cobain's mother, Wendy O'Connor, had feared the
musician was suicidal after leaving a drug-treatment facility and
buying a shotgun. Earlier that year, Cobain had overdosed while on
tour in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fans responded to Cobain's death with grief and anguish. A
tribute was quickly organized two days later on April 10, 1994, at
the Seattle Center. Under gray skies, the crowd of young fans
listened to a taped message from Love, who also read parts of
Cobain's suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt the excitement ... for too many years now,''
Love read from the note in an anguished voice. Despite a police
report that ruled Cobain's death a suicide, Tom Grant, a private
investigator hired by Love to search for her husband after he was
reported missing following his drug treatment, began talking about
a conspiracy to conceal the real cause of the rock star's death.
</P>
<P>
   Believing Cobain was murdered, Grant began spreading his bizarre
theories through the media, gaining his widest exposure through the
film, ``Kurt and Courtney.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cross, author of the upcoming Cobain biography, believes
there is no reason to reopen the investigation into the rock star's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the research I've done, the forensic evidence is very
clear that it was suicide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the conspiracy theories come from the fact that
emotionally people have a hard time dealing with Kurt's death. It's
the emotional loss, not the scientific facts, that make people want
to believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after five years, those who were close to Cobain have
difficulty talking about the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-bandmate Krist Novoselic, who has since formed another band,
Sweet 75, could not be reached this week. A spokesperson said
Novoselic was finding it hard to talk about what he once described
as ``the worst year of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Guitar World managed to wrest a few words out of former
Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil, who talks about Cobain in the
magazine's March issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit everyone hard,'' Thayil said about Cobain's death.
</P>
<P>
   The garage and greenhouse where Cobain's body was found was torn
down a couple of years ago when Love restored the three-story,
1902-vintage mansion she shared with him. Love, often disturbed by
the young fans who still come to tiny Viretta Park next door to pay
homage to Cobain, eventually sold the home and moved to Los Angeles
with her daughter to pursue her music and movie career.
</P>
<P>
   Love was recently on tour with Marilyn Manson with her band Hole
and has appeared in such movies as ``The People vs. Larry Flynt''
and the new ``200 Cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fifth anniversary of Cobain's death isn't being
commemorated publicly, KNDD is planning a full day of programming
devoted to Nirvana, which included drummer Dave Grohl, now with the
Foo Fighters, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the lyrics that Kurt wrote were about death, about
isolation and vacancy,'' KNDD program director Manning said. ``I
don't hear lyrics like that anymore. I don't hear anybody's lives
bleeding out in a song anymore. It's all sugary pop songs.''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO alliance offered Sunday to assume
responsibility for the hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees,
announcing that it would coordinate an airlift by its member
nations to bring in supplies and take out almost 100,000 people to
temporary shelter on American and European territory.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of what has become a two-front conflict between
NATO and Yugoslavia, the allies sought to take advantage of a break
in the weather by stepping up the bombardment that is only just
beginning to inflict serious damage in the Serbian heartland.
Allied spokesmen said the pace of air assaults would dramatically
increase in coming days following an initial phase in which only 15
percent of the military flights were actual bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
   With the flood of refugees now exceeding 350,000 since the
bombing began March 24, &UR;  &LR; according to U.N. figures, NATO mounted
emergency relief efforts in Macedonia and Albania, where the tide
of hungry and desperate refugees has overwhelmed aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance was sending 6,000 to 8,000 troops into Albania to
help with refugees there and redirecting the 10,000 soldiers in
Macedonia who had been intended for a peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo. Of the refugees who will be brought by the allies, the
United States planned to take in about 20,000, but to house them in
Guam or Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, temporarily, not in the continental
United States. The rest were destined for temporary camps in
Germany, Turkey and other European countries in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   On the 50th anniversary of the founding of NATO, the refugee
crisis has become inextricably woven into the allies' military
strategy after NATO failed to predict the ferocity of the Yugoslav
drive through Kosovo and committed itself to weeks of bombing and
no ground forces. The battle plan is intended to limit allied
casualties, but prolongs the fight against Yugoslav forces and with
it, the plight of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, charged this
weekend that the flood of refugees was part of a deliberate
strategy by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to
destabilize the Balkans and force the allied governments to deal
with humanitarian instead of military issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a calculated, deliberate, arranged, preplanned
humanitarian catastrophe,'' he told a small group of reporters on
Saturday at the alliance's military headquarters in Brussels. ``It
serves two purposes. Not only does it change the demographics in
Kosovo, but it helps to destabilize Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO's eventual goal is to return the refugees to
Kosovo, the prospects for doing so in the near future are bleak.
NATO acknowledges that its air campaign has had little effect in
stemming the Yugoslav effort to evict ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's military goal, NATO officials said, is to do so
much damage to the Yugoslav military and to institutions propping
up the Milosevic government that Belgrade will ultimately agree to
a political settlement for Kosovo or, at least, withdraw its
military forces from the province so that the refugees can return
under NATO protection.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's protracted timetable, however, means that hundreds of
thousands of refugees must be taken care of in the meantime, and it
was this escalating problem that preoccupied the alliance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea announced that Germany had agreed to
temporarily resettle 40,000 of the refugees. In addition to the
United States' commitment, Turkey will accept 20,000, Norway will
take 6,000, and Canada and Greece each will take 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   As refugees streamed out of Kosovo by the tens of thousands, it
has been impossible to make an exact count. But everyone agrees
that the problem is immense. According to the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees, about 350,000 of Kosovo's 1.8 million
ethnic Albanians have fled across the borders of Albania and
Macedonia since the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   NATO puts the number a bit higher, at about 374,000. Another
60,000 refugees were trapped in a ``no man's land'' in southern
Kosovo, near Albania and Macedonia, many of whom have been without
food for two days, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. body had asked NATO to help by airlifting supplies,
setting up refugee camps and resettling refugees. On Sunday, NATO
offered to take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 6,000 to 8,000 troops the alliance is sending
into Albania, the NATO commander in Macedonia, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael
Jackson of Britain, has been ordered to mount a refugee assistance
effort there with his 10,000 troops. On Sunday, he had his soldiers
rushing food and water to the refugees near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's force plans to build tent cities for refugees, three
of which are already partly operational. The ultimate goal is
provide accommodations for 20,000 refugees. So far, 3,500 refugees
are living in these tent cities.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the flow of refugees, Macedonia had closed its
border. But Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
flew to Skopje, Macedonia, on Saturday and urged Macedonia to
reopen its border, which it did.
</P>
<P>
   To help take the pressure off of Macedonia, members of the NATO
alliance have agreed to resettle nearly 100,000 on a temporary
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Transporting the refugees is likely to be a daunting and complex
task. Some of the refugees will be flown out on cargo planes that
have delivered relief supplies. Since some cargo planes are not
configured for passengers, some passenger planes will also have to
be flown in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some European diplomats, however, questioned the feasibility of
the plan. Emma Bonino, the European commissioner for humanitarian
affairs, told a press conference in Brussels Sunday that taking
refugees to Europe and North America would merely assist Milosevic
with his campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' and break up families.
She said that camps for the refugees should be established in the
Balkans and nearby central European nations.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, already groaning under the weight of refugees, has
offered to help Macedonia by accepting even more.
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO has conducted 11 days of bombing raids, the
alliance's air war is, in a sense, just beginning to get under way.
NATO's air forces have been relatively small and have encountered
both bad weather and restraints on what sorts of missions military
pilots may fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said, for example, that it launched 2,700 air
missions during the first nine days of the campaign, but that is a
small fraction of the combat flights carried out during a
comparable period of the 1991 Persian Gulf war. And of the 2,700
mission, only 15 per cent of them were bombing strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, NATO is expanding its force and attacking a
broader range of targets, including the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request from Clark, the Pentagon announced
Sunday that it was dispatching 24 of the U.S. Army's Apache attack
helicopters and 18 surface-to-surface rocket launchers to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets, which will include longer-range missiles, would be
used to attack air defenses so that Apache helicopters, armed with
anti-tank Hellfire missiles, could fly into Kosovo to seek out and
destroy Yugoslav armor and military vehicles. About 2,000 Army
troops will be sent to Albania to operate, maintain and protect the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a week or longer to get the weapons to Albania, the
Pentagon said. They will not be used until the North Atlantic
Council, the political arm of NATO, formally agrees, and President
Clinton provides final approval.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Army helicopters in Kosovo would technically
puncture the Clinton administration's promise not to employ ground
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said, however, that it preferred to think of the
Army helicopters and ground-based rockets as an extension of the
air campaign. It also insisted that the Army units being sent to
Albania were not the opening wedge of a larger invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure and simple an expansion of the air operation,''
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Also fulfilling a request of Clark, the United States has
ordered the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to the Adriatic Sea
and dispatched 13 F-117s to Europe, essentially doubling the number
of ``stealth'' fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's decision last week to broaden its target list has
already had an effect. Early Sunday morning, cruise missiles struck
Belgrade for a second night, hitting several locations.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said that NATO had hit a thermal power plant,
which supplies heat and hot water to many of the city's residents.
The NATO military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby, insisted
the alliance had attacked a nearby fuel storage site, but offered
no further explanation or details.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also said it hit an ammunition factory, an oil refinery and
a bridge during its evening raids. Yugoslavia said that three
civilians were killed in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the clouds and rain that have bedeviled the NATO air campaign
began to lift, military officials said the bombardment over the
next few days would be particularly intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are geared up to make the absolute most of the break in the
weather, and you will see us press home our attacks,'' Wilby said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces, however, have been pressing their attack and
were moving into position for a final assault against the Kosovo
Liberation Army near the Albanian border. Albanian news
organizations said the Yugoslavs had used two Mig planes to attack
the village of Popova, though this could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials also offered new information Sunday about Ibrahim
Rugova, the ethnic Albanian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the alliance had received reports from associates of
Rugova indicating that Yugoslav soldiers had moved into the
Albanian leader's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no freedom of movement but has to report to the local
police station several times a day,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Shea said, the alliance had information that Yugoslav
officials had altered Rugova's call for a halt to violence in
Kosovo in a taped television message. As edited by Yugoslav
authorities, the message suggested Rugova was opposed to NATO
bombing. Recent pictures televised in Belgrade of a meeting between
Milosevic and Rugova were more than a year old, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   On another development, a Western official said there was
evidence that the three American soldiers now being detained in
Yugoslavia were kidnapped by Yugoslav special forces who crossed
into Macedonia and took the Americans out.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has also toughened its stance about what sort of
peace settlement it will seek in the region. Increasingly,
officials no longer talk about returning to the formula worked out
at the Rambouillet Castle in France in which Kosovo Albanians would
be given maximum autonomy as part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   That formula was accepted by the Albanians but rejected by
Belgrade, which then launched its campaign of ethnic cleansing.
Instead, there is increasing discussion of a possible NATO
protectorate, an entity whose existence would be guaranteed by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces might even escort the refugees back to Kosovo
without a peace agreement with Belgrade under this plan, though
such details have not been agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of an acceptable solution relying on Rambouillet is
increasingly remote,'' a senior Western official said.

ONE GOTTI LAWYER DOES NOT FIT MOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sarita Kedia does not fit the public image of a mob
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   She is a soft-spoken young woman in a field where many of the
legendary figures have been middle-aged peacocks whose strutting
displays made them seem as intimidating as their clients. Nor did
she acquire her street smarts in such standard mob-lawyer locales
as Flatbush or Bensonhurst. She was bred in the deep South, whose
courtly folkways she had to grapple with as an immigrant from
India.
</P>
<P>
   But at just 28 years old, Ms. Kedia has earned her place on the
incongruously matched trio that is representing John A. Gotti, the
son of John J. Gotti. The younger Gotti, who is accused of assuming
his jailed father's command of the Gambino crime family, goes on
trial on Tuesday on charges of racketeering, extortion and
loan-sharking that could put him in prison for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia had to fight for her place on Gotti's legal team.
Gotti was cool to her at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's used to discussing business with men,'' Ms. Kedia said.
``I'm not one of the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Shargel, Ms. Kedia's boss and mentor, tells how Gotti
would telephone his office from jail and the secretary would ask,
``Would you like to speak to Miss Kedia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would uniformly say, `No,''' Shargel recalled. ``In a nice
way, but `No, thank you.' It's gotten from that to he almost never
asks for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia (pronounced KED-eeya) won Gotti's respect by
persistently visiting him at the Westchester County Jail in
Valhalla when he was there for nine months and writing the legal
papers that won his release on bail last October. (Gotti, though,
decided last week that during the trial he would prefer to avoid
the $5,000 a week cost of private guards, one condition of his $10
million bail, and requested that he be placed behind bars again. He
is expected to surrender Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia also argued successfully that her client should not
have a trial where the juror's names would be kept confidential.
Such an anonymous jury, Ms. Kedia said, would have heightened the
courtroom's sense of menace and made a presumption of innocence
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview last week outside Ms. Kedia's office,
Gotti, sometimes known as Junior, was glad to confer his full
blessings on his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm ever in a pinch, she's the one I want next to me,''
Gotti said. ``She's super-talented, she's sincere and she's an
angel.''
</P>
<P>
   With women assuming a major presence in other fields of law, it
is likely Ms. Kedia will in the not-too-distant future be joined by
a fairly substantial sisterhood representing organized-crime
clients. Susan Necheles has represented Venero Mangano, an
imprisoned mobster known as Benny Eggs. Prosecutors in mob cases
are increasingly women, including Carol Sipperly and Marjorie
Miller, who are leading the prosecution of Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Shargel and Gotti's second lawyer, Bruce Cutler, whose
bodybuilder's physique, silken suits and swashbuckling courtroom
style more easily fit the mob-lawyer mold, will be doing most of
the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Kedia will fortify them with what Gotti's other lawyers say
is her mastery of the case's facts, her eye for pivotal issues and
her passion for the defense of her client. She acknowledges that
she may may be helpful with female jurors, who may conclude that if
Ms. Kedia can feel comfortable sitting next to Gotti, he may not be
as fearsome as the government has painted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce is someone who is a working man's lawyer,'' she said.
``He relates to the working man and makes a juror feels he's one of
them. I describe Gerry as an intellectual _ someone who has a
unique ability to explain things to a jury and make a jury
understand his point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think of myself as a young Gerry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia is a couple of inches over five feet with long dark
hair and a genial style that can conceal the forceful lawyer
underneath. One prosecutorial adversary, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, described her as ``a straight shooter and a very good
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Shargel said that ``what she possesses that sets her apart from
other lawyers her age is a remarkable degree of self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that self-confidence is a sine qua non of being a
good defense lawyer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia is, after all, a woman who has gone paragliding off a
14,000 foot peak in Aspen, clambered up the rugged cliffs of the
Shawangunk Mountains with her husband, Geoffrey Goldberg, and run
40 to 50 miles a week training for the New York City Marathon.
Goldberg, whom she married last May in a ceremony performed by a
rabbi and a Hindu priest, is a 31-year-old former marine who saw
combat in the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with John Gotti, in other words, is a comparative piece
of cake.

FELICIA MAGRUDER, 93, WRITER AND FORMER COUNTESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo., Conn., Ill., Calif.)  (Eds: Difference in spelling of Countess Gizycka and Count Gizycki
is cq.) 
(lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Felicia Gizycka Magruder, an American heiress who was kidnapped
as a child by her father, a continental count, died on Feb. 26 at
the Regency retirement community in Laramie, Wyo. She was 93 and
moved to Laramie from New Canaan, Conn., in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Magruder was the former Countess Felicia Gizycka, the only
daughter of the Chicago-born newspaper heiress Eleanor Medill
Patterson and Count Josef Gizycki, a fortune-hunting scion of a
noble Polish family. Ms. Patterson, who eventually divorced the
count, was a granddaughter of Joseph Medill, the founder of The
Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   The little Countess Felicia, as the newspapers later called her,
was born in 1905 in Blansko in what is now the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, when Felicia was a golden-haired, blue-eyed toddler,
The New York Times reported that she had been ``kidnapped in London
by the count,'' who ``is thought to be either in Vienna or St.
Petersburg and has concealed the child.'' The Times said that
earlier ``the countess ran away from him with her child one night
after a violent quarrel.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing custody struggle led President-elect William Howard
Taft to intervene with Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in whose realm
the Gizycki family estates were located. In December 1908, Taft
wrote the czar pointing out Felicia's mother's connection to Russia
and saying that the count had put the kidnapped toddler in a
convent in Russia. Taft asked the czar to ``make such order to
Count Gizycki as shall seem to your majesty equitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The czar commanded the count to return Felicia to her mother,
and when that happened, as one Patterson biographer has written,
``they caught the first train for Germany and from there took the
first steamship to America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Forest, Ill. became their home. Mrs. Magruder's mother also
bought a ranch in Wyoming, and there, as The Laramie Daily
Boomerang reported in its obituary of Mrs. Magruder, an able young
journalist named Drew Pearson ``came out to court Felicia.''
</P>
<P>
   But things did not go smoothly, and the teen-age countess
``caught a train to San Diego, where she took an assumed name and
supported herself as a waitress.'' In a 1939 interview she said,
``I tell you, I was good'' as a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could swing a mean tray,'' she added. ``I always wanted to
make my own way in life _ it gives one a nice feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Pearson caught up with her. He is said to have made
her a practical offer: ``Look, you're only 18. Marry me now and in
three years, if you don't love me, you can leave and start your
life all over again.'' Their marriage began in 1925, produced a
daughter, Ellen, and was ended in divorce by Mrs. Pearson after
three years.
</P>
<P>
   But what years they were, with the promising Pearson, who was
not yet the mighty syndicated columnist he later became, taking his
young wife to China and beyond, while he polished his journalistic
skills.
</P>
<P>
   In later years she wrote for American magazines and newspapers,
lived in New York and elsewhere, and wrote novels and short
stories. In her 1939 novel ``Flower of Smoke,'' the
Austrian-American heroine says, ``Make your own peace, no matter
what.''
</P>
<P>
   After living for years in New Canaan she moved to Wyoming, where
she had relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1934 marriage to an Englishman, Dudley de Lavigne, ended in
divorce. Her 1958 marriage to John Kennedy Magruder, a landscape
architect and a director of the Alcoholics Anonymous Men's Home in
Alexandria, Va., also ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Pearson Arnold of San
Diego; three grandsons, Joe and Drew Arnold of Laramie and George
Arnold of Evanston, Wyo.; a granddaughter, and eight
great-grandchildren.

   If you lived in Brooklyn about 40 years ago, there was only one
place to buy dessert. That was Ebinger's, a chain of bakeshops that
dotted the borough. It didn't matter when you went, it was crowded.
Ebinger's was famous for its blackout cakes, which were made with
pure butter, high-quality chocolate, real eggs and all the best
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   It was my routine to pick up a blackout cake for my
mother-in-law on most weekends. One of my friends had been looking
into franchising businesses and he asked me to inquire the next
time I went to Ebinger's whether they were franchised.
</P>
<P>
   When my mother-in-law was due for her treat, I headed over to
Ebinger's in Park Slope, packed as usual with customers being
served by the little gray-haired ladies who worked behind the
counter. I ordered my cake, and while the clerk was wrapping it, I
asked her if she knew if Ebinger's was franchised. She looked
around the store, leaned over the counter and confided, ``No, I
think they're Jewish.''

NGUYEN'S ROAD TO THE NFL IS LONGER THAN MOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen is asked as much
about his life story as he is about the skills that are leading him
toward the NFL. It is easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, his parents and five brothers and sisters were among
the last to escape Saigon before North Vietnamese military forces
swallowed the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Nguyens knew America was a place where they could begin new
lives, but getting to the United States was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   First came the voyage on a crowded boat that hit a rock and
nearly sank in a vicious storm off the coast of Thailand. Then came
the refugee camp in Arkansas, a place Ho and Tammy Nguyen and the
five children called home for months before settling in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The sadness of being forced from their homeland was soon
countered by the excitement of the birth of a sixth child, Dat. Ho
and Tammy hoped he would be a doctor or lawyer or even a fisherman,
as Ho was.
</P>
<P>
   But their son picked up Texas' love for football. His passion
for the sport led Nguyen (pronounced WIN) to a breathtaking career
as a linebacker for Texas A&AMP;M, a school that has produced some of
the best linebackers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost 25 years after his family came to America, Nguyen is
about to add a new chapter to its remarkable story.
</P>
<P>
   This month, he is expected to become the first player of
Vietnamese descent to be picked in the NFL draft when it is held
April 17 and 18. If he goes on to make a team _ and some scouts
believe he can earn a starting job as early as next season _ Nguyen
would be only the fourth player of Asian decent in the nearly
100-year history of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize how special this moment is for me and my family,''
Nguyen said recently. ``My family has always told me to look
forward, not back. But I was definitely inspired by what they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is a muscular 234 pounds, but in the NFL there are
kickers who weigh more. Still, his playmaking ability intrigues
league personnel officials. Four scouts and two general managers
said in recent interviews that they believe Nguyen could be
selected late in the second round or early in the third. Only a
year ago, Nguyen would have been lucky to get a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen's ascent in the minds of NFL scouts began during his
senior year with the Aggies, one in which he earned the Lombardi
Award as the best of this season's linebackers and linemen.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 11.3 tackles a game and became the Aggies' career
leading tackler, passing stars like Ed Simonini and Johnny Holland.
Those numbers attracted scouts, and what they discovered was a
tornado in cleats, a player who would wipe out blockers twice his
size and sniff out a play before it developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whoever gets him will get one of the best playmakers
of the draft,'' Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Saints are so interested in both his potential
on the field and his classy demeanor off it that late last month
the team's owner, Tom Benson, invited Nguyen to stay with him at
his ranch house in San Antonio for two days.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire team owner and the son of immigrants went
hunting together. ``Isn't America great?'' Nguyen joked.
</P>
<P>
   His size appears to be his only drawback. Nguyen is 5 feet 11
inches, and most linebackers in the NFL are well over 6 feet. Not
only that, Nguyen will often have to go against offensive linemen
who outweigh him by almost 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went against guys bigger than me in college,'' Nguyen said,
``and I did pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   To Nguyen's advantage, he is coming into the league at a time
when many teams are succeeding with shorter linebackers. In last
year's draft, two linebackers barely 6 feet tall, Takeo Spikes and
Anthony Simmons, were taken 13th and 15th over all.
</P>
<P>
   The door was opened for them by the success of undersize
linebackers like Atlanta's Jessie Tuggle (5-11, 230), Miami's Zach
Thomas (5-10, 230), Dallas' Dexter Coakley (5-10, 220) and
Tennessee's Joe Bowden (5-11, 224).
</P>
<P>
   But Nguyen worries less about how his size will affect his NFL
career, and more about how his race will.
</P>
<P>
   Asians have probably been the most underrepresented ethnic group
in American football. (There are prominent NFL players, such as San
Diego linebacker Junior Seau and Dallas tackle Mark Tuinei, of
native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander descent.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the NFL, the first Asian draft pick was kicker John
Lee, who was born in Seoul, South Korea, and was selected in the
second round by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1986. The second was
offensive lineman Eugene Chung, a Korean-American picked in the
first round by the New England Patriots in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The first Asian to play professional football was a running back
named Walter Achiu, a Chinese-American who played on the 1927
Dayton Triangles.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is concerned that he will face taunts from other players,
or even fans, because of his race. ``I wonder if I will go through
the kind of racism that African-American players went through when
they first came into the league,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His concern about racism comes from experience. It goes back to
his youth, when he watched his parents fight prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The Nguyens were among nearly 18,000 Vietnamese who came to
America in the first half of the 1970s, according to the Census
Bureau. Some headed for the Gulf Coast because, like Ho, they could
make a good living fishing the waters off Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Nguyens eventually moved to a small coastal town called
Fulton. They had no money and spoke almost no English, but with the
help of other immigrant families, they were able to survive, then
build their own fishing boat and even begin a shrimping business.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they, like other Asian families, were not entirely welcome
in the fishing community. The immigrants often faced threats and
even had some of their fishing boats vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen was teased because of his skin color and Asian features.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely had an effect on me, the prejudice I faced,''
he said. ``It hurt, but it made me tougher.''

 UNDATED: me tougher. '' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Football helped keep Nguyen from becoming bitter. He loved the
camaraderie and discipline the sport provided, and the physical
play of football hooked him more than the finesse of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen starred on defense for Rockport-Fulton High School,
making 188 tackles his senior year and leading his team to the
Class 3A playoffs. He was named the best defensive player in South
Texas and was so popular in school that he inspired his own cheer:
``Go, Fight, Nguyen!''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen's parents never completely understood the sport he played
so well _ they would ask if he scored touchdowns or made tackles.
But colleges knew exactly what he did on the field. Nguyen received
many scholarship offers, but the choice came down to Texas A&AMP;M or
Michigan; he picked the Aggies because of the tradition of their
defense and the closeness to home.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen became the first player to lead the Aggies in tackles as
a freshman. He would become the first player since Simonini
(1973-75) to lead the team in tackles for three straight years. His
career total of 517 broke the school record of Holland, a two-time
all-American who had 455.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen earned the nickname Double Digit Dat because it was
routine for him to get 12, 15 or even 20 tackles in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply the best playmaker I have ever had,'' coach R.C.
Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   Since fall is a busy fishing season, Nguyen's parents rarely got
to see him play in high school or college. But when the draft
comes, and Nguyen is watching television, nervously waiting to see
what team is going to select him, Nguyen's parents will be by his
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be the first people I thank,'' Nguyen said. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Christians celebrated the ancient holiday of Easter last
weekend and Jews the even older Passover, Sikhs gathered by the
thousands in New Jersey to begin a commemoration of the relatively
new anniversary _ only 300 years _ of Khalsa, the concept at the
core of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 people poured into the Meadowlands Exposition Center
in Secaucus, N.J., on Saturday for what was billed as the first
international Sikh convention. The daylong event was part academic
convocation, part political rally and part performance with songs,
skits and a tae kwon do demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   It was the prelude to a month of Khalsa events with parades and
religious ceremonies in Manhattan, Washington, San Francisco and
Los Angeles. On April 14, Vaisakhi, the beginning of the Sikh new
year, will be observed with prayer services in gudwaras, or Sikh
churches, everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Khalsa marks the establishment of formal structure in the
religion. On March 30, 1699, in Punjab, India, Guru Gobind, the
10th and last in a line of holy gurus, ended the concentration of
leadership in one human and established the order of Khalsa,
baptized Sikhs, who were to be guided by the holy scripture, known
as the Adi Granth, and who were to follow precepts of belief,
behavior and dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been anything like this before,'' Rajnarind
Kaur, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, declared about the convention as
she sold T-shirts bearing Sikh symbols. ``To get highly
distinguished speakers all together at one time like this is
amazing, and this is a once in a lifetime chance for all these
people to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. I.J. Singh, a professor of dentistry at New York University,
marveled at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to the United States in 1960, there were two Sikhs
in Manhattan and one was me,'' he said. ``Then I went to Oregon,
where I was the only one. Now, I am seeing so many familiar faces
that I can't find my friends here.''
</P>
<P>
   The denomination, the world's fifth largest, has grown in the
West, with 175,000 adherents in the United States and 225,000 in
Canada. According to the American region of the World Sikh Council,
co-sponsor of the convention with a Sikh congregation in Glen Rock,
N.J., there are about 75,000 Sikhs in the New York metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   Still there is a yearning, reflected from the podium and from
the audience, for the homeland, Punjab, which became part of India
at the end of British rule in 1947. Since then, animosity and
violence have prevailed between Hindus and Sikhs there, coming to a
head when the government raided Sikhism's most sacred site, the
Golden Temple at Amritsar, in 1984. In retaliation, Sikh bodyguards
assassinated Prime Minister Indira Ghandi, and in retribution,
Sikhs say, thousands of them were massacred.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion centered on what Sikhs maintain is their
right to establish their own nation there. It was in Punjab in 1469
that the first guru, Nanak, who had rejected the Hinduism of his
family and then his adopted Islam, disappeared while bathing in a
river. Three days later he returned, claiming to have encountered
God and received guidance to start a new tradition. In contrast to
Hinduism, Sikhism has no caste system and insists that everyone is
equal, no matter what their gender or economic status.
</P>
<P>
   Harjit Singh, a lawyer from London, told the audience: ``Sikhism
is no longer purely a religion. It is a distinctive community. The
Jews finally returned to their promised land, and we will, too. But
it won't take one-tenth as long.''
</P>
<P>
   While some American Sikhs have returned to Punjab to celebrate
the anniversary of Khalsa, Amanyit Singh Buttar, one of two Sikhs
in Vernon, Conn., and a member of its Board of Education, said: ``I
am a hard-liner. I will only go when my people have their own
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Supinder Singh of Lodi, N.J., who owns a gas station, said he
and his wife, Jasbir Kaur, fled Punjab in 1985 after bloodshed
there. ``We had to go underground, the police raided our homes and
our temple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing proudly to his children, Jagdeep, 6, Harsharan, 5 and
Jujjhar, 3, Singh said, ``I want them to know what country we came
from, what our religion is, and how Khalsa was created. I worry
about what they are teaching them in school and about TV they
watch. They must know both cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Sikh men adopt the surname Singh, meaning lion, and most
women Kaur, which means princess.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gurmit Singh Chilana, a gynecologist at St. Joseph's Medical
Center in Paterson, N.J., and his wife, Dr. Bhupinber Kaur Chilana,
a dentist, were also at the convention to teach their four
children, who range in age from 4 to 14, about Khalsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to see how many people like them there are,''
Chilana said, looking at the crowds dressed in the distinctive
tunic and pants worn by women and the turbans worn by men. ``In the
whole school where they go, there are only two Sikh families.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his obligations, he said, is the education of his
neighbors. His 7-year-old son, Jagjot, was teased in school and
called a girl because of his turban and the length of his hair,
which his religion forbids him to cut. ``So I went to his class and
told them about our identity,'' Chilana said. ``Since then there
has been no problem.''

POLITICAL MEMO: IN NEW YORK STATE, LATE BUDGETS HAVE NO EFFECT ON
RE-ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, through fiscal feast or famine, there
have been two sure things in Albany. Members of the New York
Legislature will nearly always win re-election. And the state
budget will be late _ sometimes maddeningly so. Don't think they
aren't related.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the annual bellyaching about their failure to pass a
budget by the April 1 deadline, the lawmakers know it is unlikely
to damage them at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, in a resounding testament to the benefits of
incumbency in the Legislature, no lawmaker lost a bid for another
term. For these 211 politicians, the conclusion is obvious: Their
bosses _ the people _ will not punish them for conduct that might
get the average hired hand a pink slip.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the stonewalling, grandstanding and squabbling over the
$70 billion budget. The Legislature seems so nonchalant that it met
last Tuesday, less than 48 hours before the deadline, made a token
effort to break the impasse and then went on vacation until April
12.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude stems in part from the Legislature's confidence
that it can prevent an immediate backlash by joining Gov. George E.
Pataki in adopting an emergency spending bill to keep the
government running and avoid service disruptions like state workers
missing paychecks or closed motor vehicle offices.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the late budget becomes an abstract concept. ``It
doesn't cost us anything,'' said Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer, a
Manhattan Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   What does cost legislators is the ire of influential interest
groups, which care far more about the budget's final shape than the
delays in shaping it. From unions to hospital coalitions to
business groups, they want the officials they support to fight hard
for their concerns. In Albany, fighting hard often means digging in
one's heels.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure from these lobbyists, in other words, heightens the
delays. The more protracted the battle, the more elected officials
can show off their fierce advocacy. And with power divided in
Albany between the two major parties, one bloc's obstinacy quickly
slows the process.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers do not respond to interest groups, that could hurt
on Election Day, for the groups play an important role in
mobilizing voters and filling campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest groups are becoming more organized and more
persistent,'' said Sen. Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican from
Westchester County. ``To a large degree, they are driving this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that state officials are insensitive to the impact of
late budgets. They concede that the state's credit rating suffers,
requiring it to pay tens of millions of dollars more annually in
interest; that some school districts, nonprofit groups and others
have to get short-term loans because of the temporary shortfall in
state aid, and that the delays feed public cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawmakers also understand that the powers of incumbency
in Albany will help them overcome bad feelings about the budget.
That is particularly true in upstate New York, where residents tend
to focus more on the delays than people in the New York City area
do.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few decades ago, a late budget would have been
inconceivable in Albany. The most basic reason for the change is
that after the governor and lawmakers began missing the deadline,
they discovered that they generally survived politically.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a late budget means elected officials are stumbling at
perhaps their most vital job, and they are always wary that the
public may rise up one day and say, ``Enough!''

LIONEL BART, SONGWRITER, DIES AT 68  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lionel Bart, the composer, lyricist and playwright best known
for the musical ``Oliver!,'' died on Saturday in Hammersmith
Hospital in London, his longtime hometown. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bart was frustrated in his efforts to repeat his early
success with ``Oliver!,'' the play based on Charles Dickens' 1838
novel ``Oliver Twist'' was a huge hit. It was welcomed by
theatergoers in London in 1960, on Broadway two years later and in
repeated revivals, including one currently running in Birmingham,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Bart wrote the music, lyrics and book for ``Oliver!'' The show
has been applauded for its simple melodies and catchy lyrics; the
British critic Benedict Nightingale has called it ``infinitely
hummable.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the show's songs became popular standards, including
``As Long as He Needs Me'' and ``Consider Yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The original London production of ``Oliver!'' ran for 2,618
performances and was one of the most successful musicals in London
stage history. Bart became instrumental in restoring luster to
Britain's musical theater in an era when American musicals had won
primacy in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver!'' was a huge success in the United States. But when it
opened in 1963 at the Imperial Theater in New York, Howard Taubman
gave it a mixed review in The New York Times, saying parts of it
had ``natural sweetness'' and ``style and quality,'' but ``too
often it settles for stridency, smoke, easy laughs and facile
show-business razzmatazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart won a Tony Award for the show's music and lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver!'' was made into a 1968 British film that won Oscars
for best picture, director (Carol Reed), art direction and scoring,
and in two other categories, along with a special prize for its
choreography. In The Times, however, Vincent Canby was less than
enthusiastic. He said the Dickens material was ``overwhelmed by
this kind of big song-and-dance show,'' and he found that Bart's
songs interrupted the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Bart also wrote songs for rock and pop singers
and he wrote the theme for the 1963 James Bond movie ``From Russia
With Love.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time in the 1960s he had glamorous friends and acquired
homes in New York, Malibu, Tangier and elsewhere. But The Sunday
Telegraph reported in Sunday's issue that ``following a string of
less well-received shows, `Blitz!' (1962) and `Maggie May' (1964)
and the total failure of `Twang!' in 1965, he began a decline into
alcohol and drug problems, which lasted for much of the 70s and
80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Also during the 1960s Bart misguidedly signed away his rights to
``Oliver!'' and other properties, partly to finance ``Twang!''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1986 interview he said, ``If I hadn't pretended to be such
a genius child, I would have paid more attention.'' He filed for
bankruptcy in 1972 after a run of bad luck with stage ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Bart was the son of an tailor in the blue-collar East End
section of London. He studied art on scholarship and worked for a
time as a graphic artist.
</P>
<P>
   He received no formal musical training, but made his way to the
top of the stage musical world by the time he was around 30.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote lyrics for the stage show ``Lock Up Your Daughters,''
which opened in 1959 in London, and he wrote the music and lyrics
for the stage show ``Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be,'' which opened
in 1960 in London and ran for two years.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to create ``Oliver!,'' but he confessed later that it
came close to not being performed. ``Originally, everyone turned it
down,'' he recalled. ``They thought it was too morbid or too risky
with all those kids and a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   At his death Bart, who is survived by two sisters, was working
toward reviving ``La Strada,'' his unsuccessful 1960s musical based
on the Fellini film.

R.C. BENITEZ, WHO SAVED CREW OF SINKING, BURNING SUBMARINE, DIES AT
81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Rafael C. Benitez, who directed an extraordinary
rescue operation when his submarine caught fire in one of the first
American undersea spy missions of the cold car, died March 6 in
Easton, Md. Admiral Benitez, who saw his submarine sink but lost
only one of his 77 crew members, was 81.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, 1949, Benitez, then a commander, guided his diesel
submarine, the Cochino, out of the harbor in Portsmouth, England.
</P>
<P>
   The Cochino and another submarine, the Tusk, were ostensibly on
a cold-water training mission. But they had snorkels that allowed
them to spend long periods underwater, largely invisible to an
enemy, and they carried electronic gear designed to detect far-off
radio signals.
</P>
<P>
   The two submarines were, in fact, the vanguard of an American
intelligence operation. Their crews hoped to eavesdrop on
communications that revealed the testing of submarine-launched
Soviet missiles that might soon carry nuclear warheads, said
``Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine
Espionage'' (Public Affairs, 1998) by Sherry Sontag and Christopher
Drew, with Annette Lawrence Drew.
</P>
<P>
   The Cochino was submerged in waters above the Arctic Circle, 125
to 150 miles off the Soviet port of Murmansk, on Aug. 25 when one
of its 4,000-pound batteries caught fire, emitting hydrogen gas and
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   High winds and 16-foot waves prevented the Tusk from drawing
alongside, leaving Benitez to oversee the firefighting while trying
to save his men from toxic gases. He ordered the Cochino to surface
and had dozens of crew members lash themselves to the deck rails
with ropes while others fought the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the winds were about to tear the ropes, he stacked 60
sailors in a pyramid on his open bridge, which was designed to hold
seven men. He gave his jacket and shoes to lightly clad seamen. The
executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Richard M. Wright, tried to force open
the battery compartment where the fire began, but was severely
burned.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Philo, a civilian sonar expert, rode on a raft to the
Tusk to report on conditions on the Cochino, but was knocked
unconscious when the raft turned over. Philo was pulled aboard the
Tusk, but a wave pitched him and 11 others overboard. He was among
six lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez followed the Tusk to calmer waters, all the time trying
to bolster his men's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   During the night, the Tusk could finally approach, and the
Cochino's crew _ including Wright _ dashed to the sister submarine
on a plank that tottered as the two subs rode the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez was the only man left aboard the Cochino. He shouted,
``I'm not abandoning ship.'' But the Cochino began to list
severely, leaving him no choice. He crossed to the Tusk seconds
before the plank shattered. Two minutes later, 15 hours after the
fire had erupted, the Cochino sank in 950 feet of water, 100 miles
off the coast of Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The Tusk took the Cochino's crew to Hammerfest, Norway, for
medical treatment. In reporting the loss of the Cochino, the Navy
said it had been on a ``routine cruise outside of Norwegian
territorial waters.'' But on Sept. 20, 1949, the Soviet publication
Red Fleet said that the Cochino had been ``not far from Murmansk''
and suggested that it was seeking military information. On Sept.
23, President Harry S. Truman, confirming the fears that had
prompted Benitez's mission, announced that the Soviet Union had
detonated its first nuclear device.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Celestino Benitez, a native of Juncos, P.R., graduated
from the U. S. Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1939. In World War II
he weathered depth-charge attacks aboard submarines and was awarded
the Silver Star and Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1949, he graduated from Georgetown Law School. He was
chief of the U. S. naval mission to Cuba from 1952 to 1954 and
commanded the destroyer Waldron from 1955 to 1957. After retiring
from the Navy in 1959, he was Pan American World Airways' vice
president for Latin America, taught international law and was
associate dean at the University of Miami Law School and dean of
the university's Graduate School of International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Nancy, of Easton; a son, John, of
Denver; two daughters, Cristina Benitez of Chicago and Peg Evans of
Miami; three sisters, Susana Lacy, Isabelle McCartney and Martha
Ables, all of Miami, and three grandsons.

PELLEGRINO, PIONEER IN SPORT OF BALLOONING, DEAD AT 82
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Pellegrino, who became so skystruck growing up in the
Lindbergh era that he devoted his life to aviation and pursued his
interest back to the very dawn of manned flight, died on March 26
at a hospital near his home in Newtown, Pa. He was 82 and had been
a founder of the Balloon Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhattan who grew up on Long Island, Pellegrino was
hardly the only child of the 1920s to be captivated by Charles
Lindbergh's solo flight to Paris. Others managed to outgrow their
fascination. Pellegrino, who haunted Roosevelt Field and thrilled
to the sight of the Graf Zeppelin, did not.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, an Italian immigrant with old-world notions about
careers, persuaded him to study business at New York University and
get a job on Wall Street. But he soon bolted, taking a 75 percent
pay cut to join the Army Air Corps in the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to fly in a World War I Jenny, Pellegrino earned his
pilot's rating, but a ruptured eardrum kept him out of combat. He
spent World War II training military air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he joined the forerunner of the Federal Aviation
Administration, working as an air traffic controller in
Philadelphia and eventually becoming tower chief at the North
Philadelphia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   His job qualified him to fly in the cockpits of commercial
aircraft, and in time he earned pilot ratings for numerous aircraft
and even acquired his own small plane. But a newspaper article
about ballooning took him in new directions and put him in the
forefront of sports ballooning in America.
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrino took his first flight in 1952 and before long had
become a mainstay of the Balloon Club of America, a grandiosely
named group of Philadelphia enthusiasts who flew gas balloons very
much like the one that had made the first manned flight, in France
in 1783.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the club, Pellegrino was in the thick of the
sport's development. But his stint as a technical adviser for the
balloon sequences in the 1956 movie ``Around the World in 80 Days''
was a low-altitude task. For even the most spectacular scenes
aloft, the balloon was suspended from a crane.
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrino eventually became a balloon pilot examiner for the
FAA and validated ballooning records for the National Aeronautic
Association, the American arm of the sport of aviation's
Paris-based world governing body, the International Aeronautical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   When the American organization sought to form a balloon
division, Pellegrino played a key role in creating the Balloon
Federation of America in 1961. The Philadelphia group and the
Balloon Flyers of Akron, the only other such club in the country,
were the federation's initial members. Pellegrino was its first
president. The balloon federation is now made up of about 100 clubs
across the country and more than 4,000 individual members, almost
none of whom fly gas balloons.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because the hazards of hydrogen, a flammable gas,
have led to prohibitive insurance costs; partly because the inert
alternative, helium, is so expensive that a single flight can cost
several thousand dollars; but mainly because of the development of
hot-air balloons fueled by propane.
</P>
<P>
   When hot-air ballooning was perfected by Ed Yost in the '60s,
gas-balloon purists turned up their noses. But largely through the
efforts of Pellegrino, the International Aeronautical Association
eventually recognized it as a legitimate competitive category. He
became the first American delegate to the association's ballooning
committee and, later, its first American president.
</P>
<P>
   For Pellegrino, attending annual meetings in Paris had an added
attraction: the opportunity to go ballooning in Europe, something
he did with great regularity and enthusiasm after becoming the
first American to pilot a balloon across the Alps, in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Known mainly as a ballooning official, Pellegrino had his
moments aloft, notably in 1959 when he and a friend, seeking a
distance record, took off from Denver. High winds thwarted the
record, but when their balloon knocked out the power lines to
Colorado Springs during a night landing, they had the satisfaction
of watching from the air as the entire city went dark.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the FAA in 1976, Pellegrino gave up
ballooning, studied art in New York and turned out abstract
paintings while indulging a long-time subsidiary interest in fast
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrino, who was divorced, is survived by a son, Peter Jr.,
of Fogelsville, Pa.

COMMENTARY: THE RUSSIAN WAY OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Russia pleads with the International Monetary Fund for money
to keep it from defaulting on its international debts, the
country's government seems to believe that an IMF seal of approval
will lead to a resumption of the flow of private capital into the
country. Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why private investors should be hesitant, consider
the case of Yukos, Russia's second-largest oil producer, which is
run by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a well-connected Russian oligarch.
</P>
<P>
   The tale is a complex one, in which paper is shuffled as rapidly
as aces in a game of three-card monte, in which judges with no
apparent jurisdiction issue rulings, and in which oil is sold for
absurdly low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The losers are investors in the three oil companies that Yukos
controls, known as Yuganskneftegaz, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft.
Once those were hot stocks; now they are all but unsalable. An
investment of $3,000 at the end of 1996, divided equally among the
three, would have grown to more than $11,000 by the following
August. Now it is worth about $150, down 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   World oil prices are depressed, and Russia's economy is in
crisis. But those factors are not enough to account for the decline
in share prices, in which one subsidiary that produces oil worth $2
billion a year now is valued at about $22 million. The price has
tumbled as it became clear that the shareholders would not benefit
from the sale of that oil.
</P>
<P>
   This has happened despite Russian laws that purport to provide
protection for minority investors by giving them representation on
corporate boards and the right to veto deals smacking of conflict
of interest.
</P>
<P>
   At shareholder meetings of the three subsidiaries last month,
plans were approved to allow Yukos to buy oil from the subsidiaries
for three years at $1.50 a barrel, about a tenth of the world oil
price. Those meetings also approved issuing huge quantities of
shares to unnamed investors in return for promissory notes issued
by other Yukos subsidiaries. That will dilute the rights of other
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the Russian laws giving rights to minority
holders? Groups of such owners had vowed to defeat the proposals,
but they were barred from voting. A judge had ruled that since the
minority holders all planned to vote the same way, they must be in
league with one another and therefore in violation of antitrust
laws because they had not registered as such. The minority
shareholders were not invited to the hearing that led to the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders managed to get another judge to rule that they
could vote at one of the meetings. But his ruling was simply
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky claims the whole fight is about Western investors
who have illegally acted in concert and are trying to block good
management, but the investors say that the Yukos actions are
appalling even by Russia's low standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can believe that anyone would be so blatantly crude,''
complains Michael Hunter, the president of Dart Management and a
director of one of the subsidiaries, adding that Dart
underestimated the level of corruption when it made its
investments.
</P>
<P>
   John Papesh of Misoli Enterprises, an affiliate of Dart, argues
that ``This brazen asset grab takes the violation of Russian law
and international standards of corporate governance to a new low.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Russian government does nothing to protect the
shareholders, it will send a clear message. But even an honest
government cannot protect investors without help.
</P>
<P>
   The Yukos tactics are reminiscent of the fight for control of
the Erie Railroad in 1867 and 1868. Cornelius Vanderbilt tried to
buy a majority of the stock, only to find that directors led by Jay
Gould were printing more shares. Both sides got judges to issue
rulings, amid suspicions of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Gould could not enter New York except on Sunday,
when the custom of the time barred people from being arrested. The
minority shareholders, most of them from England, were treated
badly.
</P>
<P>
   None of that kept the United States from becoming the world's
premier economy. Along the way such abuses led to the rise of J.P.
Morgan, whose early power came from the fact that English investors
trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia is ever to become an economic success story, its oil
will play an important role. But before that happens, a Russian
Morgan _ someone who understands Russian capitalism and earns the
trust of overseas investors _ will have to come along to assure
that a dollar invested is not sure to become a dollar stolen. The
Yukos affair shows Russia is a long way from that goal.

STUDY SEES ACID-RAIN THREAT BEYOND NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., W.Va., Tenn., Calif., Md., Va., N.C.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, scientists have viewed the Adirondack
Mountains in New York, where hundreds of lakes and streams can no
longer sustain life because of chronically high acidity, as the
region that suffers the most from acid precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has
proposed legislation that would reduce the airborne pollutants _
sulfur and nitrogen _ that cause acid precipitation. But he has
found minimal support in Congress, where some members think the
problem remains confined to New York and its neighbors, and others
believe that the government has done enough to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new federal report may provide important ammunition for
New York's fight. The report, a comprehensive survey of recent
research, concludes that despite important strides in reducing air
pollution, acid precipitation remains a serious problem in the
Adirondacks and is a growing threat in the southern Appalachians,
Colorado's Front Range and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   New York officials and environmentalists say the report will
help broaden political support for Moynihan's legislation, breaking
down the regionalism that has stymied such measures in the past.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no member of Congress from south of New York has offered
to co-sponsor the bill. But environmentalists say that will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not New York against everyone else anymore,'' said Rep.
John Sweeney, a Republican who represents part of the Adirondacks
and is a sponsor, with Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-Utica, of the
House version of Moynihan's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of such legislation, including utility companies,
contend that existing laws are having an effect and just need more
time to work. Coal-burning power plants concentrated in the Ohio
River Valley are a major source of nitrogen and sulfur pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Congress adopted amendments to the Clean Air Act that
were intended to see that by the next decade, coal-fired power
plants and other industries had cut their sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide emissions by half. Last year, the federal government
also ordered 22 states in the East and Midwest to reduce emissions
of nitrogen oxide, mainly during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These policies are going to get you where Moynihan's bill will
get you,'' said John Kinsman, manager for atmosphere science with
the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of
shareholder-owned electricity utilities. The group has not taken a
public position on Moynihan's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Acid precipitation occurs when sulfur or nitrogen, which drift
eastward on the prevailing winds, mix with moisture in the
atmosphere to form sulfuric or nitric acid and fall as acid rain,
snow or fog. Dry nitrogen and sulfur pollution also turn to acid
when deposited in waterways or mixed with moisture in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal report was produced by the National Acidic
Precipitation Assessment Program, a consortium of agencies that
includes the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Although the
report has been available on the Internet, it has not been printed
or widely distributed yet. Officials expect to release bound copies
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal report provides much good news about the 1990
amendments, saying that they have effectively and relatively
inexpensively reduced sulfur emissions and acid precipitation in
much of the country. For that reason, the report may also be used
by opponents of Moynihan's bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also issues numerous warnings about the observed
and theoretical effects of continued acid rain. And though it does
not break new scientific ground, it provides evidence from recent
research that acid precipitation is more complex and more
intractable than had been thought 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ High elevation forests in the Colorado Front Range, the
Allegheny Mountains in West Virginia, the Great Smoky Mountains in
Tennessee and the San Gabriel Mountains near Los Angeles are
saturated or close to saturated with nitrogen. (Excess nitrogen can
seep from saturated soils into nearby streams and lakes, causing
them to become more acidic.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chesapeake Bay is suffering from excess nitrogen, some of
it from air pollution, which is causing algae blooms that suffocate
other life forms.
</P>
<P>
   _ High-elevation lakes and streams in the Sierra Nevada, the
Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountains may be on the verge of
suffering chronically high acidity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many waterways in the Adirondacks are becoming more acidic
even as sulfur deposits decline. The environmental agency has
projected that by 2040, about half the region's 2,800 lakes and
ponds will be too acidic to sustain much life.
</P>
<P>
   Although it offers no concrete solutions, the report concludes
that further reductions in sulfur and nitrogen pollution may be
necessary to protect those sensitive regions. ``If the rates of
deposition of both sulfur and nitrogen are not reduced further,
they will continue to degrade forests, lakes and streams,'' a news
release accompanying the report says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many scientists who study acid rain say the report offers strong
arguments for Moynihan's bill.

   ``It's been the near consensus of scientists that the Clean Air
Act amendments haven't gone far enough,'' said Jack Cosby, a
professor in the University of Virginia's Department of
Environmental Science.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with draft copies of the federal report and their own
studies, New York environmental groups have joined forces with
organizations like Trout Unlimited in Virginia, West Virginia,
Tennessee and North Carolina to lobby Congress to pass Moynihan's
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a weird way, this has been good for New York,'' said John
Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, an environmental
group. ``It bears out the warning that we issued more than 10 years
ago: that the Adirondacks are the canary in the coal mines. We're
dying first, but that doesn't mean everybody else is immune.''

US MILITARY COMMITMENT IN BALKANS EXPANDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pentagon officials Sunday expanded the US military
commitment in the Balkans but denied it was a step toward
dispatching ground soldiers to Kosovo, calling the deployment of
2,000 support troops to neighboring Albania a logical broadening of
the allied airstrike campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made hours before a series of explosions,
centered near the international airport, shook Belgrade early
Monday. They appeared to signal the start of fresh NATO aerial
bombing of Yugoslavia, which saw its army headquarters and oil
refineries targeted the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the rising Balkans refugee crisis, the United States
declared that it would help temporarily house 20,000 of the 350,000
ethnic Albanians who have fled Kosovo since March 24, most of them
by bus and on foot, many of them stripped of their identification
papers and without any money.
</P>
<P>
   As the US involvement deepened, the fate of three American
soldiers taken captive by Yugoslav forces remained unclear. Serbian
officials sent mixed messages, with one saying the POWs could stand
trial and the other saying they would be released unharmed _ and
untried _ at the conflict's end.
</P>
<P>
   The new soldiers ordered in Sunday are expected to support a
group of 24 Apache helicopters in the mission just across the
border from Kosovo, where NATO warplane attacks on Yugoslav ground
forces had been hindered by bad weather. The shift in military
hardware will give NATO ``greater precision, all-weather
capability, day or night,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the moves were ``absolutely not'' a sign that ground
troops would soon be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The US offer of shelter was made with the expectation that the
Kosovars will eventually return home, said Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, a childhood migrant from Europe's military
and ideological conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have to go back, otherwise there are no people in
Kosovo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the refugees were not likely to be
sheltered in the continental United States, but might instead be
airlifted to US facilities in Guam. Another possible relocation
site is the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, where thousands of
Haitian immigrants once were sheltered, said Senator Joseph R.
Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   About 55,000 ethnic Albanians are backed up at the border of
Macedonia, where the government Saturday announced it was refusing
any refugees who did not plan to continue to a third destination.
As many as 200,000 more Kosovars are believed to be on the move
within the province, reportedly routed from their homes by Yugoslav
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops have made for elusive targets in recent days, as
NATO warplanes have been hampered by cloudy and snowy weather, and
as military officials have primarily limited their strategy to
using long-range planes and missiles to strike military
infrastructure targets across the country and in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The use of Apache helicopters _ along with the previously
deployed A-10, or ``Warthog,'' a low-flying aircraft skillful at
attacking tanks _ is expected to help target the ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   But defense officials acknowlege that the use of low-flying
aircraft would put US pilots at greater risk, particularly from
surface-to-air missiles, which have been all but absent and may
have been stockpiled by Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   To help protect the helicopters, US officials said 18 Multiple
Launch Rocket Systems, equipped with short- and medium-range
missiles, would be included in the expansion, along with 14 Bradley
Fighting Vehicles and intelligence officers and military police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give us the capability to get up close and personal to
the Milosevic armor of units in Kosovo, and to do a more effective
job at eliminating or neutralizing the forces on the ground,''
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger said
President Clinton had approved the deployment of the Apaches. In
order for the new batch of weapons to be used in combat, it must
also be approved by NATO's military leaders and again by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to continue an unrelenting bombing campaign that
severely damages the apparatus of military repression of Slobodan
Milosevic so that either he agrees to let these refugees back to
live in autonomy and security, or at the very least that we loosen
his grip and his ability to impose his will on Kosovo,'' Berger
said Sunday on CBS's ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Charles S. Robb, a member of the Foreign Relations and
Armed Services committees, said the new deployments were necessary
to accomplish that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really protect the Kosovars unless you go in with
Apaches and with the Cobras _ the Warthogs and other low-flying
aircraft,'' Robb, a Virginia Democrat, said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' denied the charge by
Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, that the airstrikes are
contributing to the outpouring of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has systematically brutalized his population,'' she said.
``To say we are responsible for the refugees and the atrocities is
really like saying the police force is responsible for a serial
killer.''
</P>
<P>
   The specter of a military trial for the three captured Americans
was again raised by the Yugoslav ambassador to the United Nations,
Vladislav Jovanovic, who said ``the investigation on their
infiltration in Yugoslavia is under way.''
</P>
<P>
   The American men _ Christopher Stone, Steven Gonzales, and
Andrew Ramirez _ were on a reconnaissance mission near the
Macedonia-Yugoslav border when they were captured on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the results of that investigation will depend whether there
will be or will not be a trial before the military court,''
Jovanovic said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a separate interview that only spread further confusion
about the status of the captives, Milan Bozic, deputy mayor of
Belgrade, said that ``of course they will not be tried and they
will be back in their homes as soon as this stupidity stops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure (the) American public that there will be no
problem with them,'' Bozic told ABC from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon called the Serb officials' remarks ``encouraging,'' saying
the Yugoslav government was referring to the US soldiers as
prisoners of war, which entitles them to humane treatment under the
rules of international law.

EDITORIAL: NEW DEFENSE AGAINST AN OLD KILLER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, April 5: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest infectious killer in the world today is not AIDS or
malaria, but that old devil tuberculosis. Antibiotics largely
controlled TB by 1960, but it came back in the late 1980s, often in
strains resistant to the drugs traditionally used to treat it.
While TB is epidemic in some poor countries, it can be spread on a
long plane flight, and immigrant-rich New York City was the center
of an American outbreak that peaked in 1992. The Health Department
controlled it with a new treatment that involves watching patients
take their medicine, which has proved cheap and effective
worldwide. To prevent the further spread of drug-resistant
tuberculosis, countries and international organizations need to
invest money now in treatment everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the same antibiotics that cured tuberculosis decades
ago have made it deadly again. Tuberculosis becomes drug resistant
when patients receive an incomplete mix of antibiotics or stop
taking their pills when the symptoms begin to subside. The World
Health Organization, which found that a third of the countries it
studied had resistant TB, estimates that 50 million people are
infected worldwide. Drug-resistant TB is particularly common in the
former Soviet Union, where medicine was widely available. But it
was of poor quality and badly administered.
</P>
<P>
   Today the world's most efficient TB incubators are Russian
prisons. Russia imprisons 300,000 new people a year. Nearly all
catch the TB bacillus. Most have a dormant form, which activates
when their immune system slumps _ which is why AIDS and TB are such
a lethal mix. A quarter of prisoners catch the deadly
multidrug-resistant strain. If they have active TB, they pass the
resistant strain on to the general population when they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a new treatment cures normal TB and prevents new
drug resistance. The W.H.O. calls DOTS, for Directly Observed
Treatment Short-Course, the biggest health breakthrough of the
decade, which could prevent 10 million deaths in the next 10 years.
DOTS insures that patients finish their treatment by having health
workers watch them take their pills, every day, for the six- or
eight-month minimum necessary to cure TB. Since New York began
using DOTS in 1992, new cases have declined by 60 percent, and
drug-resistant cases dropped by 92 percent. Health workers went
into crack houses to watch patients swallow pills. DOTS has nearly
doubled cure rates where it has been tried all over the world.
Almost anyone who can read can be trained to observe patients.
</P>
<P>
   But DOTS does require that countries have a steady supply of
medicine and the organization to carry it out. The W.H.O. estimates
that about 12 percent of patients worldwide receive DOTS. Russia is
now trying DOTS in six prisons, in a project carried out mainly by
the New York-based Public Health Research Institute and financed
with $12 million from the Soros Foundation. It would take only $100
million to put DOTS into every prison in Russia, but the country
has no money for it.
</P>
<P>
   While DOTS prevents new cases of resistance, it does not help
people who already have the superbugs. When they can be cured, it
is with very expensive drugs, their cost boosted by the lack of
demand in rich countries, which have few cases of resistant TB. If
poor countries could be helped to buy them, their cost would drop.
</P>
<P>
   The United States spends about $12 million annually on
international TB control. An increase, to spread DOTS and
facilitate curing the superbugs, would be a wise investment for
world and American health. TB is proving that no bacterium is an
island.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZARAGOZA, El Salvador _ When he was 13, Jose Isidro Rodriguez
drew a picture. It showed circling helicopters dropping red pellets
over a landscape of mountains. It showed bodies flowing down a
river, soldiers shooting and people bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother died in what is known as the 1980 massacre of
the Sumpul River, on El Salvador's border with Honduras, during the
country's 12-year civil war. The boy, then 11, hit by bullets and
shrapnel three times, found his way to safety and later to a
refugee center in San Salvador where an American priest offered him
the first slot in an orphanage he had started here in Zaragoza.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rodriguez, who grew up in the orphanage, rules over it
and Zaragoza's 20,000 residents as the town's mayor and the
embodiment of El Salvador's transformation from a war-ravaged
country to peaceful democracy. He is Zaragoza's first mayor from
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the former
guerrillas' political party. He joined the group only after the
fighters laid down their arms under peace accords signed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The war that killed 70,000 Salvadorans, Rodriguez said, left him
with a visceral aversion to arms. It also infused him with a sense
of civic duty. It is what some political analysts say gives El
Salvador a generation to improve the lot of most of its citizens _
and bridge the persisting great divide between rich and poor _
before social unrest, and the threat of more violence, is likely to
set in again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For everybody who lived through the conflict,'' Rodriguez, now
30, said in an interview, ``the great utopia is to prepare the
conditions so that war never returns to the country,''
</P>
<P>
   In Zaragoza, a poor rural town between San Salvador and the
Pacific Ocean, Rodriguez has not had to look hard for work to do.
Roads are full of potholes. Nearly half the town does not have
electricity, and 70 percent of residents lack piped-in water, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To undertake public works, Rodriguez, elected two years ago for
a three-year term, raised taxes and improved their collection. That
might get most mayors a one-way ticket out of office, but he seems
to be surviving this time too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the streets, the lighting and the shopping areas to
be fixed and, compared with the others, he has tried to improve
things,'' said Rosa Reynado, a hardware store owner who said she
did not mind paying higher taxes if she saw results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accepted him because we know the orphanage and we saw him
grow up,'' she said. ``Because of what he's suffered, he has seen
the needs of people and he feels for them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses' accounts, hundreds of people died when
Salvadoran soldiers aided by Honduran troops fired on peasant
families as they crossed the Sumpul River. It was one of many times
during the war when unarmed civilians were victims of army
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez remembers the crowd, including his mother, an uncle
and neighbors from his rural village in Chalatenango _ who had
lived like nomads for two years as they fled heavy fighting _
trying to scatter ``like cattle in stampede.'' He said his mother
soon tired as they hiked north toward the Honduran refugee camps _
``she was a little fat,'' he said _ and urged him to go on without
her.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after they separated, he was wounded in the face and
body and tried frantically to return to his mother but was pushed
back by gunfire. ``I never knew exactly what happened to her,''
said Rodriguez, an only child who never knew his father.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was at a refugee center in San Salvador, after
reuniting with some relatives, when he ran into the Rev. Kenneth C.
Myers, a missionary from Ohio who was Zaragoza's parish priest. The
priest had opened Comunidad Oscar Arnulfo Romero, an orphanage
named after the Archbishop assassinated in 1980, under the orders
of right-wing leaders, as he celebrated Mass, and the priest made
Rodriguez his first charge. Up to 300 children, many of them with
missing limbs, shared the home at the height of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was worse off because he was alone,'' Mercedes Alvarado,
31, a police officer who spent seven years in the orphanage with
five of her siblings, said of Rodriguez. ``He almost never talked
to anyone, but he never caused any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety of an orphanage that educated the children and
distracted them from their personal agonies was shattered, however,
when four American churchwomen who had helped Myers open the home
disappeared. Myers eventually identified the bodies of three Roman
Catholic nuns _ Maura Clarke, Ita Ford and Dorothy Kazel _ and a
lay worker, Jean Donovan, who had been raped, shot and killed in
December 1980 by Salvadoran national guardsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the nuns died it was really traumatic,'' Rodriguez said.
``We had felt safe because of the gringos.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, now 57 and director of a seminary in Santa Tecla, near
Zaragoza, said the shock spread all around the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all felt so badly because it had touched us,'' he said.
``I told them, `Now we know how you feel,' because they had all
lost someone.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seems so deeply buried in the past now that Father Myers
laments that ``all of a sudden, everything is forgotten and
erased.'' But Rodriguez, now married and the father of a 4-year-old
son and 2-year-old twins, a boy and a girl, is a walking reminder
for many of both the good and bad of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very well respected'' said Myers. ``I tell people my son
is the mayor of Zaragoza.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 119 children living at the Comunidad Oscar Arnulfo
Romero are not the orphans of war but of drugs, alcohol, poverty
and AIDS. At an arts and crafts workshop on a recent afternoon, six
boys sat at a long table painting happy landscapes _ flowers and
sunrises, not hovering helicopters and bleeding people.

DAVID BROOKS, 83, STAGE STAR OF `BRIGADOON'

<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Brooks, an actor who created the leading role
of Tommy Albright in the 1940s Broadway musical ``Brigadoon,'' died
on Wednesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. He was
83.
</P>
<P>
   A classically trained baritone, Brooks first appeared on a
Broadway stage in 1945, playing a handsome Southern slaveholder
opposite Celeste Holm in the musical comedy ``Bloomer Girl.'' The
show was a hit and began for Brooks a career in theater that would
eventually include work as a director and producer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 Brooks won the role of Tommy, a young American traveler
who happens upon a mysterious Scottish village that awakens only
every 100 years, in a new musical by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick
Loewe. The musical, ``Brigadoon,'' went on to play 581
performances.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s Brooks lived in Milan, Italy, where he
directed and produced plays. There he came in contact with Europe's
avant-garde theater scene, including the works of Eugene Ionesco
and Samuel Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return from Europe, Brooks help found Rooftop
Productions, a production company responsible for the American
premieres of Beckett's ``Endgame,'' Ionesco's ``Bald Soprano'' and
James Joyce's ``Ulysses in Nighttown'' off-Broadway. He continued
to direct, and worked with Leonard Bernstein on the 1955 musical
revue ``Trouble in Tahiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks later worked as an actor, onstage and on television.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was born in Portland, Ore. After graduating from the
University of Washington, he won a scholarship to the Curtis
Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he studied opera. While
there he began to dabble in theater, and those efforts eventually
led to an agent, to Broadway and to ``Brigadoon.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Frances Kessler, and a brother,
Ben Berger of Portland.

   Jackson, Pacers share strength in beating Knicks
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ The Pacers' Mark Jackson wanted to be anywhere but
where he found himself Sunday, on the floor against the New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   On any other day, this would be one of the highlights of
Jackson's season. Born and raised in New York, Jackson relishes
playing the team he grew up admiring, and the team with which he
began his career.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday wasn't any other day for Jackson, who immersed
himself in basketball to escape from his emotions. Just days after
the death of his father, Harry, Jackson's best friend and biggest
booster, the point guard was on the floor against the Knicks,
against the wishes of Pacers coach Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson insisted, and he turned out to be the difference,
sparking a 108-95 victory before 16,731 rowdy fans at Market Square
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Jackson had to choke back tears as he talked about
his father's death from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' Jackson said, pausing to control his
emotions. ``I'm a guy who trusts in God, and the Lord says, `When
you're weak, I'll be strong.' Certainly there are times when you're
weak, when you want to cry, when it hurts, but this is an
opportunity for God to use me to show somebody else that it's all
right _ he's still God, he's still good and he's still in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may look at me and wonder what it is, how can I still
continue to do it? Where do I get that peace from? It has nothing
to do with me, believe me. I hurt just like the next person. I
think about the good times and I think about the example I had in
my father _ the man he was and the man he will continue to be,
living through me. That's a tremendous blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson scored 13 of his 16 points in the first quarter,
sparking the Pacers to a lead they never would give up. Included
were three 3-pointers against a New York defense that had been
geared to stop noted Knicks-killer Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Bird called Jackson's performance amazing, even though he would
have preferred to see his veteran point guard back home in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a professional,'' said Bird of Jackson, who will miss
today's game at Detroit and Wednesday's game at Chicago while he
attends to family matters in New York. ``I'm sure his family told
him to stay and play the games. Mark knows what he means to this
team. He's the heart and soul of this whole club.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not here we miss something, and this has to be a tough
situation for him. I'd rather he be home with his family, but he
chose to stay and play, so that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers needed Jackson as much as he needed the Pacers. The
club had been reeling, losing three consecutive one-point games
last week. Included was Tuesday's 94-93 loss to New York, a game
notorious for the brief scuffle between Indiana's Jalen Rose and
New York's Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   His father was close to death, and it affected the play of
Jackson and the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that he has a lot on his mind with the loss of his
father,'' said Miller, who scored 12 points Sunday. ``To tell you
the truth, where Mark's head is at is almost where our head is at
because he's such an emotional leader for this team. When he's
down, the rest of the guys feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for him to come out and still perform, play well and try
to do all these things when we know his heart and his head are
elsewhere. ''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson figured that if he was going to play Sunday, he might as
well make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson bombing away from the outside, the Pacers built a
nine-point lead at the end of the first quarter, a lead that grew
to 12 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks rallied in the third quarter behind Latrell Sprewell,
who got 16 of his 20 points in the period. Sprewell finally got his
wish and was put in the starting lineup by New York coach Jeff Van
Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   With Sprewell taking over, the Knicks pulled to within 76-72 at
the end of the third quarter, even though Indiana's Rik Smits
scored 12 of his 22 points in the period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers started the fourth quarter with a 14-4 run and
cruised from there. The Knicks, looking old and tired, lurched down
the stretch, hitting just seven of their 24 fourth-quarter shots
(29.2 percent). Larry Johnson did what he could, scoring half of
his 16 points in the quarter, but neither Ewing (16 points) nor
Allan Houston (19) helped much, combining for just seven points on
2-of-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson took it all in from the bench, watching Travis Best play
the entire fourth quarter, scoring 10 points to nail down the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have (God) in my life, then I probably would have
gone crazy,'' Jackson said. ``My father was a man who was married
to my mom for 40 years, who provided, sacrificed, made a way and
fought for us. It hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'm dedicating anything, this game, a
championship, playing hard or whatever, to him. I can't give him
back what he's done for me. It would be an injustice to say I'm
doing it for him. I've dedicated my life to him.''

INTERNET RETAILERS HIDING TRUE COSTS OF PURCHASES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Car dealers have a reputation for waiting until the last minute
to reveal hidden charges to unwary customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be developing a similar syndrome _ call it
clicker shock _ as retailers acquire a reputation for hiding
shipping and handling charges until the final stage of the
transaction. Consumers who reach that point face an unsavory
choice: swallow higher-than-expected prices, or abandon the
purchase, often after investing time filling out a registration
form and possibly giving out a credit card number.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce sites say their motives are not duplicitous, citing
technological hurdles and their unwillingness to bog down shoppers
by asking too early for the information that determines shipping
costs. Even so, many sites lure customers with promises of low
prices up front, which are often offset by high back-end charges.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of consumers to easily research prices on line,
particularly with the aid of price comparison services, has
contributed to the reluctance of merchants to disclose the add-on
charges quickly. These services typically list the advertised
prices offered by various resellers for a range of items, but leave
it to shoppers to find the final selling price _ which can be as
high as 40 percent more than the advertised price, once shipping
and handling is added.
</P>
<P>
   The price pressure is felt most keenly by sellers of so-called
commodity goods, like computers, books, CDs and videos. Resellers
all buy such goods for virtually the same prices, so they are often
compelled to advertise low prices to consumers and find other ways
to make a profit on each sale.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Internet search for a Compaq Presario 1235 notebook
computer, for instance, yielded 29 prices ranging from $1,099 to
$1,579, before shipping and handling. Among these, the retailer
advertising the lowest price, Corporate Raider
(www.corporate-raider.com), charged the most for shipping _ $48 for
UPS ground service. (UPS itself charges roughly $10 to ship such a
package coast to coast, via ground service.)
</P>
<P>
   The five Internet retailers in this sampling that advertised the
lowest prices for the computer made consumers go no fewer than
three steps and as many as seven into the buying process before
disclosing shipping and handling fees. According to a study by the
Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm, 66 percent of Internet
shoppers see shipping costs as an obstacle to purchasing on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's necessarily anything subversive on the part
of e-commerce sites,'' said Melissa Bane, a Yankee Group analyst.
``It's a function of the E-commerce transaction systems. No one
thought this through and said, `We should put shipping and handling
up front,' until now.''
</P>
<P>
   A contributing factor is that many Internet retailers have more
than one warehouse, so they must know the consumer's location
before they can calculate shipping costs. These retailers do not
want to alienate potential customers by making them divulge
personal information before they shop, so they wait until late in
the process to gather facts like the shipping address.
</P>
<P>
   Even if sites have difficulty calculating shipping costs, what
stops them from giving a range of shipping and handling fees up
front? ``It's not necessarily a hard thing to do,'' said Peter
Granoff, co-founder of Virtual Vineyards, a Web wine seller
(www.virtualvineyard.com). ``It's just competing with a million
other priorities.'' Granoff said that in response to customer
comments, he was changing his site, in part, ``to put more shipping
information up front.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, of the 10 most visited shopping sites, as measured by
Media Metrix, an Internet research firm, just one, Amazon.com,
includes a ``shipping policies'' link on its first page. The link
leads consumers to a chart explaining shipping and handling fees.
First-time buyers who miss the shipping policies link on Amazon,
though, must wait until the final stage of a seven-step
registration and purchasing process to find out shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   The other sites in the top 10 that arrange for shipping do post
information about the shipping and handling fees, but these
explanations are often buried within ``help'' or ``shopper
information'' pages.
</P>
<P>
   For sites that do provide a range of shipping and handling costs
alongside the price, like NECX Direct, a computer goods retailer
(www.necx.com), the decision to do so is not easy. ``Sometimes we
kick ourselves and say, `Why don't we play that game, too?'' said
Brian Marley, vice president for operations at NECX Direct. ``Not
that we're martyrs or anything, but we just don't see the integrity
in that.''
</P>
<P>
   In determining how much to charge for shipping, many Internet
retailers have adopted the practices of mail-order companies, said
Cliff Sharples, founding chairman of Shop.org, a trade group of
Internet retailers. Sharples, who is also chief executive of
Garden.com, which sells gardening supplies, said that ``almost all
of the mail order companies look at shipping as a way to break
even, or as a profit center.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharples, who is planning to redesign Garden.com to disclose
shipping and handling earlier in the purchase process, said sites
that withheld shipping and handling information and then charged
high fees risked undermining the industry's growth. ``It's a very
fragile environment out there,'' he said. ``This issue, and
privacy, can have a very large effect on the overall adoption of
E-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Nielsen, who advises companies on how to make Web sites
easier to use, agrees. ``There's a danger of the Web turning into a
low-trust environment, and this adds to it,'' Nielsen said. ``You
feel like you've got to be on guard constantly, because people are
trying to cheat you. You might still buy, but it's not a pleasant
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For E-commerce companies, it is a quandary. On the one hand,
Internet retailers are struggling to convince users that the medium
is about convenience, not bargain hunting. Yet many retailers feel
they cannot compete if they do not advertise low prices.
</P>
<P>
   By making consumers spend considerable time and effort to see
the real deal _ a significant issue for the legions of Internet
users who browse with slow dial-up modems _ E-commerce companies
provide neither bargains nor convenience.  &QL;

Loaded Astros can go a long way 
 
 By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSTON _ This is why time begins on opening day: it is The
Truth after six weeks of make-believe. You will know the season
really has started when you don't see a player wearing No. 92, and
in the bleachers nobody has taken off his or her shirt to catch
some rays.
</P>
<P>
   The old and the new blend again Tuesday night, when the Astros
host Sammy Sosa and the Cubs, the liftoff of their final campaign
in the Astrodome. While the fans will be allowed to wallow in
nostalgia, the Astros, The Team That Came in From the Heat, have a
tighter focus. Their mission is to win a third division title in a
row _ and keep going.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, this figures to be a schizoid season. In a quake
of a break with tradition, the Padres and Rockies met Sunday night
in the national opener in Monterrey, Mexico, where beisbol is the
fourth-most popular sport after soccer, bullfighting and riding in
a taxicab.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the schedule makers gave the Cincinnati Reds
the first game, usually a day ahead of the rest of the league. But
this tradition was allowed to disappear, and baseball continues its
quest for expanded markets.
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate dance, this balancing of new concepts and
grandpa's memories. But Houston is literally the last place to
complain. This was where six-guns gave way to spaceships, and Buck
Rogers replaced Roy Rogers. The Astros could put a bonnet on a
ballpark and push the game toward the 21st century, but what they
haven't been able to do is win a National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs to remind owner Drayton McLane Jr. that the perfect
exit from the Astrodome would be after a World Series. Hey, the
city has been waiting only 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were good enough a year ago to win 102 games and in
the 1990s have a record second only to Atlanta's in the National
League. They won't have the Big Unit, Randy Johnson, for half a
season or the injured Moises Alou for a full one. But what they
have in their inventory is very, very good.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in his rookie season, manager Larry Dierker doesn't have
to wonder what the cat has dragged in. Rarely, if ever, in their
history have the Astros had a player the quality of Alou go down
and replaced him with a talent like Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   This is a smart team, sound, aggressive, with at least three
players among the best in the league at their positions _ Jeff
Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Ken Caminiti. If they could sing, they
would be the Three Tenors.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros ranked at or near the top of the NL a year ago in
batting average, runs, stolen bases and doubles. And not many teams
can offer a lineup with four .300 hitters: Bagwell, Biggio, Hidalgo
and Derek Bell. In a healthy year, Caminiti, back where he belongs
after a stint with the Padres, will join that group, with 30 homers
and 100 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros play with such group efficiency you tend to overlook
Bell, who gave them an All-Star effort, and Carl Everett, a Mets
castoff who hit .296 and earned a good-conduct medal.
</P>
<P>
   What the pitching staff lacks in glamour, it makes up for in
consistency. Four starters won 11 games or more last year, led by
Shane Reynolds with 19 and the surprising Jose Lima with 16. Billy
Wagner has established himself as a closer, and facing The Kid's
fastball is a heartless way for opposing hitters to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez answered last year's question at shortstop. Time
will tell if the Astros made a major error in trading Brad Ausmus,
but tough Tony Eusebio will get the chance he always wanted to be a
starting catcher.
</P>
<P>
   What these ingredients add up to is a team perfectly tailored
for the big ballpark that has been their Dome, sweet Dome since
1965. With the exception of Eusebio, every player can steal, take
two bases on a single, or score from first on a double.
</P>
<P>
   They finished 12{ games ahead of the Cubs in '98 and became a
veteran ballclub while many of us were thinking of them as
tomorrow's team. Dierker, in his third year as the manager, is a
secure fellow who lets his players do some of their own thinking.
He never has managed a team that finished below first in its
division, and he knows this isn't how the game works. So the Astros
have to raise their sights this season before reality bites.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, on the eve of the season opener, the trained
observer drops in a couple of predictions intended to dazzle the
readership. You can usually get a terrific reaction by picking
someone like Tim Bogar, the utility infielder who hit .154 last
year, to lead the league in hitting. But why put that kind of
pressure on Tim?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Astros are good enough that they don't need any
miracles to go where no Houston team has gone before. And we are
not referring to a new ballpark downtown.

 By ALEX WITCHEL  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``When I interviewed Mick Jagger,'' Sara Davidson
recalled, ``he said he'd never know what the hit song on an album
would be. It was hard to tell what would touch the chord.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davidson knew what he meant. When her first book, ``Loose
Change'' (Doubleday), was published in 1977, it touched enough of a
chord about the failed idealism of the 1960s to sell more than a
million copies and establish its author as a voice of her
generation. So much so that in her newest book, ``Cowboy: A Love
Story'' (HarperCollins), the reader winces along as Ms. Davidson
recalls being at the Golden Globe Awards in the early 90s when a
woman greeted her, saying: ``You used to be a hot new talent and
everyone wanted to know you. Then you got married and disappeared.
Nobody knows what happened to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Though her only best-selling book since ``Loose Change'' was
``Rock Hudson: His Story'' (William Morrow) in 1986, Ms. Davidson
created a short-lived television series, ``Heartbeat,'' for ABC,
before joining ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'' as a writer and
eventually co-executive producer. Though she did not create that
show, she stayed with it, having found herself a financially
strapped single mother after her second divorce in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The book she was writing then, an account of baby boomers as
parents, was dropped by its publisher after an unsuccessful first
draft, and Ms. Davidson was later dropped by her agent. It was
increasingly difficult for her to get journalistic assignments:
after discovering she worked on ``Dr. Quinn,'' an editor at The New
Yorker said he feared she might have ``lost her intellectual
rigor.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, however, she was sent by The New York Times Magazine to
cover the annual cowboy poetry and music festival in Elko, Nev.
There she met Richard Goff, a cowboy artisan 10 years her junior,
whose specialty was braiding rawhide. Ms. Davidson quickly
discovered his extracurricular specialties, and now, at 56, has
published ``Cowboy,'' her testament to the happy fact that women of
a certain age can not only find love in all the wrong places, but
also find the greatest sex they ever had _ at least since
Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a downside to this particular brand of
paradise: virtually no common frame of reference. For example,
although Goff had heard of the Holocaust, he didn't know who Anne
Frank was. Or Shakespeare, for that matter. The poetic extent of
his sweet nothings was, ``Your feet are like horse's hooves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davidson, who visited New York recently from her home in
Santa Monica, Calif., seemed surprised to hear that some women
might consider an absence of knowledge about world events or
literature a turnoff. She shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people hear that he's a fabulous lover, does shiatsu
massage, rides horses and loves to dance,'' she said, ``and that
sounds very appealing because there are a lot of brilliant men who
don't know how to relax. Richard said to me: `You want an
intellectual who can also rock and roll with you in bed. You've
only had either or.' And he's right. I would like intellectual
companionship to be together with what Richard has. But I haven't
found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davidson was sitting in the Central Park West living room of
a friend with whom she grew up in Los Angeles. Ms. Davidson is a
tall woman, 5 foot 11, and whether or not her feet are like horse's
hooves, they are large. But her voice has a quiet, soothing tone,
that is almost an antidote to her towering presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a successful relationship with a man before
Richard,'' she said. ``I wanted to have one, but I felt
pessimistic, since I live in a community where youth is everything.
Richard was someone who from the get-go said: `I'll take you just
the way you are. I see the worst, and I'll take that, too.' It had
a tremendously healing effect on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Cowboy'' is based on the couple's relationship, Ms.
Davidson calls it a ``fictionalized memoir'' because she has
changed the details of other characters, including her children and
their father, to protect their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my intention to tell the story without slavishly
adhering to facts but to the emotional truth of what happened,''
she said. ``How in this some ways absurd relationship, love and
deep sexual fulfillment are possible at any age and may not come in
forms you expect, and if you open up to it, what are the
consequences. So the children and ex-husband are fictional, but the
tensions are the same.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``It isn't often God gives you this kind of
material,'' she said of Goff, who is named Zack in the book. ``He
is so eccentric and fabulous. I never could have invented a
character like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff moved to Santa Monica from Arizona a year after the affair
began; he was hired as a riding extra on ``Dr. Quinn.'' But the
couple have always lived apart. For one thing, his relationship
with Ms. Davidson's teen-age children is strained. ``My son and he
have a nice working relationship, but my daughter doesn't like
anything about him and probably never will,'' Ms. Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends, however, are supportive. ``When you get past 40,''
she said, ``your real friends don't care who you're with if he's
making you happy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Ms. Davidson acknowledges that she is equally
an outsider in Goff's world. ``His daughter got married in Building
Five of the Arizona State Fairgrounds,'' she said, ``and registered
at Kmart.''
</P>
<P>
   An ongoing theme in ``Cowboy'' is that Goff has problems with
money, making and keeping it. Being financially dependent on Ms.
Davidson, even intermittently, has tested the relationship. But
after extensive soul-searching about Goff and the numerous men she
has dated over time, Ms. Davidson prefers to dwell on the positive.
``When I'm with Richard, I feel I've shed all the tensions and
responsibilities of the world,'' Ms. Davidson said. ``He's the most
accepting person: understanding, emotionally intuitive and wise.''
She paused. ``And then there's this big gap.'' She laughed, almost
helplessly. ``But it's narrowing a bit. He just read `Moby-Dick' on
books on tape.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davidson maintains that her relationship is not an isolated
incident, but a bona fide trend, perhaps hoping she has written a
``Loose Change'' for women in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend who calls it fourth-wave feminism,'' she said,
``when all the rules go out the window, and women can choose what I
call nontraditional men. My new agent has a romance with a
carpenter. Roseanne married her bodyguard. Jane Smiley says her
husband's main job is to manage her. I think the barriers are
coming down, and it's becoming more acceptable and possible for
women to have a broader choice. You used to have to find a man who
was older, smarter, taller, richer, more successful. As you moved
up, the field became narrower and narrower.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there was also a stigma about younger men, but
things are loosening up. There's no one answer for anyone. That's
the key. My life now is not what I expected or imagined. I never
wanted to be Isadora Duncan. I've never been with this
unconventional a man. But I feel excited by the potential of life
to surprise you, which is something I didn't know I wanted or
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be that, if it didn't seem Ms. Davidson needed
further convincing. She called the next day, the comforts of her
trend theory seemingly forgotten. She sounded defensive, delivering
what sounded like a prepared speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I have a deep relationship with someone who hasn't read
Anne Frank?'' she said. ``Yes. Just because someone comes from a
different culture doesn't mean he's not wise. Is love about having
matching educations? Not necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davidson also wanted to clarify something she said about the
mythology expert Joseph Campbell's ``pathless path'': ``It means
that if you take the path already cut, you won't find the truth and
knowledge you are seeking. That will only happen if you cut your
own path.''

GEORGE RAPEE, 83, ONE OF WORLD'S TOP BRIDGE PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By ALAN TRUSCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Rapee, one of the world's foremost bridge players, died
Thursday at his home in Floral City, Fla. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Rapee was a winner of three world championship titles at the
start of the modern series of competitions: in Bermuda in 1950, in
Naples, Italy, in 1951 and in New York in 1953. He is the last
survivor of those teams, which included stars like Charles Goren,
Howard Schenken, Sam Stayman and B. Jay Becker. Rapee also
represented the United States in the world championships of 1958
and 1959, finishing second to Italy, and in 1960 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Rapee's tournament career, which spanned more than half a
century, began with a national victory in 1936. From 1942 to 1980
he was the most successful player in the three major team
championships. He won the Spingold Knockout Teams in 1944, 1948,
1950, 1952, 1957 and 1968, and the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams in
1946, 1950, 1951, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1959 and 1970. He was a winner
of the Board-a-Match Teams, now called the Reisinger, in 1945,
1947, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1970 and 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Rapee continued to challenge at the highest levels
of bridge. In 1990 he won a bronze medal in the world team
championships in Geneva, and last year his team reached the
semifinal of the Vanderbilt Teams.
</P>
<P>
   About 1940 Rapee had an idea that became world-famous as the
Stayman Convention: a response of two clubs to an opening one
no-trump to ask for a major suit. His partner, Stayman, enlarged
and publicized the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Rapee was inducted into the Bridge Hall of Fame in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rapee was born in New York City of parents from Hungary. His
father, Erno Rapee, was an orchestra conductor. He graduated from
New York University and later from its law school. After three
years in the Army in World War II, he became a real-estate lawyer,
and continued assembling packages for development until he retired.
</P>
<P>
   Rapee is survived by his wife, Joellen Hall Rapee, one daughter,
Christina Winkler, of New York, and two grandsons.

Brown said. ``I didn't have any expectations that I would ever play
beyond college.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he pitched in a game at the University of Maryland his
sophomore year. Something happened. The stars in Brown's pitching
constellation aligned. In one start, his velocity jumped from 86
mph to 96 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was outta nowhere,'' said Jim Morris, Brown's coach at
Georgia Tech and now coach at the University of Miami. ``Something
clicked. There was no explanation for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, very few people had heard of a gangly pitcher named
Kevin Brown. Now, he is the highest-paid baseball player in the
world and he's become the poster boy for intensity, determination
and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has won 20 games in a season once in 10 full
seasons, what he means to a pitching staff is so valuable that
teams clamored for his services this season.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the key ingredient of the Los Angeles Dodgers' master
plan. The team figured they needed him so badly they gave him an
unprecedented $105 million, seven-year contract, not to mention 12
charter airline flights so his family can visit hassle-free from
Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his acquisition, a team that finished out of the
playoffs last year is picked by most to contend for the World
Series. Who better than Brown, a member of the last two teams to
win the National League pennant, to begin it? He starts today
against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium in the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see his leadership until you're around him and
you see the other players respond,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone said. ``I hadn't seen it until (spring training). After I
met with him, I recognized he had the potential to be that on this
club. He's a warrior, very intense. A competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's mentality always matched Malone's description. His
baseball ability is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Roger Clemens or Randy Johnson or so many other of the
game's top pitchers, Brown spent his high school days pitching in
obscurity. He attended Wilkinson County High in Irwinton, Ga., and
played baseball, football and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about scholarship offers. Brown didn't even receive one
of those form letters every borderline prospect gets. Not from a
Division I, a Division II or a Division III school. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   So he planned on a career as a chemical engineer. For kicks, he
wanted to play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, nicknamed ``Blade'' because of his less-than-Adonis
physique, walked-on at Georgia Tech as a 6-foot-4, 160-pound
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him before,'' Morris said about seeing Brown as a
freshman. ``He was trying to walk on, but I didn't know who he was,
nor did anybody else. Nobody heard of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's personality _ he's often described as ornery and
sometimes confrontational _ is well reported. But it was another
trait, his work ethic, that pushed him from obscurity to the game's
top pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Blade bulked up. Nothing outlandish or special. He just spent a
bundle of time in the weight room. That's his secret. He works
inordinately hard at whatever he does.
</P>
<P>
   The radar gun was a testament to it and the scouts noticed. By
the time his junior season arrived, he was one of the top prospects
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started off the season great, but I didn't get loose one
game, throwing in relief, when we were in Hawaii,'' Brown said. ``I
had tendinitis, and the problem was they told me I wouldn't do any
permanent damage, so I kept throwing. They just told me it would
hurt like hell. It was in the middle of our conference schedule so
I didn't take any time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My velocity fell to 85 and every pitch _ sheer pain,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown finished his junior year with a single-season school
record for wins (11) and strikeouts (122). But as his velocity
dropped, so did his status with scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the signing bonuses and the thought of playing baseball
for a living. It was back to that chemical-engineering gig with
Englehard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to kill my draftability,'' Brown said.
``I thought that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1986, just before the June draft, Brown visited
the Atlanta Braves' team physician. The diagnosis was elbow
tendinitis. It was wonderful news for Brown, because that meant
there was nothing structurally wrong with his elbow or shoulder,
and that his velocity should return. The Texas Rangers took him
with the fourth overall pick in the June draft. The journey was
only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had an amazing repertoire of pitches, but something was
amiss. It was his intellectual approach to the game, along with his
temper, that kept working against him. In 1987, his only full
season of minor-league ball, he went 1-11 with a 6.49 ERA. He ended
the season with 11 straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd be very, very good,'' said Dodgers pitching
coach Charlie Hough, a teammate of Brown's with the Rangers. ``He's
a very intelligent guy. At times in Texas, it almost worked against
him. (His thinking) was beyond the instant. He was thinking beyond
this one pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Brown made his mark on the Rangers' rotation.
It would be four more years before he stamped himself as a top
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had learned how to harness his physical talent, but he
struggled to contain his temper. There were still times Brown would
glare icily through a teammate after an error. Mistakes _ his own
and others _ would cause him to lose his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that probably hurt him is he's so high strung
as a player,'' Morris said. ``He's very aggressive. He doesn't like
to lose. He would let one play affect him for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   His breakthrough year was 1992. Brown went 21-11 with a 3.32 ERA
after going 33-31 in his three previous seasons. Brown had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn to be successful,'' Brown said. ``There's a
comfort zone people get locked into. To me, if you're not trying to
improve, you're going backward. It's not a smooth, steady rise. You
can't do everything better one year than the year before. There may
be dips in the short haul, but you have to work for the long
haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Even success was fickle at first. He went 32-30 in his next
three seasons, which included a one-year stop in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brown signed a free-agent deal with the Florida Marlins
after the 1995 season, and he began his domination of major-league
hitters in earnest, going 17-11 with a 1.89 ERA in 1996 and 16-8
mark with a 2.69 ERA and a World Series title the next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he's done is apply things better,'' Hough said. ``He
understands himself more, knows what he can do when. He knows when
he can throw his breaking ball, when he can drop his arm and throw
a sidearm fastball. He knows his capabilities on the mound better
than he used to.''
</P>
<P>
   People also began to appreciate Brown based on his approach and
influence on teammates, not just his won-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made you work harder,'' said Mets pitcher Al Leiter, a
teammate of Brown's on the Marlins. ``You knew how badly he wanted
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   His reputation grew last season, when he went 18-7 to help the
San Diego Padres to the World Series. That's why Malone, seeing
what Brown did for Padres pitchers Sterling Hitchcock and Andy
Ashby, decided Brown was worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   He'll still be collecting checks from the Dodgers when he's 41,
and who knows if Brown will still be pitching, let alone starting.
</P>
<P>
   It matters very little from a non-financial perspective. By
2005, the tone of his tenure with the Dodgers will already be
shaped. It will be measured by World Series titles, and it will be
measured on the influence he's had on Chan Ho Park, Darren Dreifort
and Ismael Valdes and whomever else pitches for the Dodgers.

   Rangers set sights &QL; 
beyond West title &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ARLINGTON _ A quarter century of long, hot summers and eerily quiet
Septembers finally came to an end three years ago with a first-ever
American League West title. A second was added last season, proving
this wasn't a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, two out of three isn't considered bad. But with
a $75 million payroll, baseball's fourth-highest average ticket
price and an owner accustomed to having things his way, things are
a little different around here. Even before today's 1:35 p.m.
season opener against the Detroit Tigers at the sold-out Ballpark
in Arlington, the Texas Rangers know tacking on another division
championship isn't likely to be good enough anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added expense and salary to our roster,'' general
manager Doug Melvin said. ``With that, our expectations are raised
a little higher.''
</P>
<P>
   As another season gets under way, there is considerable room for
debate over whether the Rangers can clear the higher bar. At the
heart of the discussion: Is this an improved team or simply a
different-looking one from the club that finished 88-74 last season
before being swept by the Yankees in the Division Series?
</P>
<P>
   The daily lineup should be a little better. The defense should
be improved, too. But the starting pitching looks like more of the
same, and relief is only as good as John Wetteland's surgically
repaired elbow and nagging sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good team,'' said first baseman Rafael Palmeiro,
back after five seasons in Baltimore. ``There's no doubt in my mind
that we're going to win a lot of ballgames this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro replaces the departed Will Clark, the man who took his
job five years earlier, and the new/old Ranger figures to be a
significant upgrade if his twice surgically repaired knee holds up.
Palmeiro played all 162 games for Baltimore last season, reaching
career highs of 43 home runs and 121 RBIs. The short Home Run Porch
in the Ballpark could help him approach 50 homers this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers knew how to score runs. Their .289 team average
led the American League in 1998. They also were second in the major
leagues in hits (1,637 to Colorado's 1,640) and runs (940, bettered
only by the Yankees' 965). AL Most Valuable Player Juan Gonzalez
(157), Rusty Greer (108) and Clark (102) topped 100 RBIs, and
catcher Ivan Rodriguez chipped in 91.
</P>
<P>
   So offense wasn't the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It were the finer points of the game that proved trickier.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, the Rangers ranked just ninth in the AL with a
.978 percentage. In an 84-game stretch between June 3 and Sept. 4,
they committed 83 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, they had five in a game. On two occasions, they made
three in one inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had a hard time catching the ball, and it really
hurt us,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``We're still not going to be
the greatest team throwing, but we ought to catch it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding Gold Glove winner Palmeiro will help, though he will open
the season as the club's designated hitter while building strength
in the knee. Even more important to the defense was the re-signing
of shortstop Royce Clayton, who was acquired from St. Louis along
with pitcher Todd Stottlemyre at last year's trade deadline to
replace statue-like Kevin Elster.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is a few more plays in the field will make a
difference, because a pitching staff that labored most of last
season doesn't appear to be significantly better.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, largely a bust until his last few starts, has moved
on to Arizona. The club replaced him with Mark Clark (9-14, 4.84
ERA in 213 innings for the Cubs), a move that hardly qualified as a
coup after flirtations with Randy Johnson and Roger Clemens failed
to land either.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has set a goal of 70 wins for his rotation, but that might
be optimistic. There is no guarantee Rick Helling (20-7, 4.41 ERA)
or Aaron Sele (19-11, 4.23) can match last year's results, though
each benefited from healthy run support. The bottom of the rotation
is more suspect with John Burkett (9-13, 5.68) and Esteban Loaiza
(3-6, 5.90) or Mike Morgan (4-2, 3.49 in 18 starts with Minnesota
before being traded to the Cubs last year).
</P>
<P>
   Without an established ace, taking that next step could be too
much to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, everyone would like to have a No. 1,'' Melvin said.
``There just aren't enough of them to go around. The one thing
about our rotation, and I think it's important, is that we have
five guys who are healthy and can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy? Yes. Able to pitch? That wasn't quite so apparent in
the spring as Sele (6.46 ERA), Loaiza (8.03) and Burkett (6.46)
were shelled early and often while closer Wetteland pitched just
five innings after that ankle began to bother him early in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Clark insists, despite his 5.04 spring ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring training is spring training,'' he said. ``You've got
guys working on things, pitchers working on pitches. Sometimes it
doesn't go the way you'd like.''
</P>
<P>
   So why should the Rangers expect to improve on last year's
plus-14 finish, which was good enough to beat out Anaheim by three
games in the Mild, Mild West?
</P>
<P>
   When the Ballpark in Arlington was designed, the short Home Run
Porch in right field seemed ideal for Palmeiro, who departed before
the stadium opened for the 1994 season. If he stays healthy, he
could more than double the 23 home runs Will Clark managed last
year in his best of five seasons in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Clark, obviously, is no Clemens, but he should provide
innings for a team that will score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the big reasons I wanted to come here,'' he
said. ``That doesn't mean you want to go out and give up four or
five runs every game, but you know if you can hang in there, you'll
have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Each starting position player has been in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the enjoyment of being there,'' Melvin said. ``They
know what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Does all of that add up to another AL West title? Anaheim is the
trendy pick, but the Angels did little beyond adding first baseman
Mo Vaughn _ a significant pickup, certainly, but comparable
statistically to Palmeiro. With decent health, the Rangers should
at least be in the race to the end and ought to be capable of the
90 or so wins it will take to defend.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, that might not be enough to satisfy the
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, a high-strung fellow even in the best of times, clearly
felt the heat this spring as his club offered mixed signs in
Florida. A repeat of last year probably won't mollify owner Tom
Hicks, who OK'd big contracts for Palmeiro and Clayton and faces
the prospect of a $100 million extension for Gonzalez, now a
two-time MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Already, then, the heat is on, even if it is only April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first job is to win the division,'' said Burkett, the
winning pitcher in the only postseason victory in Rangers history
(Game 1 of the 1996 Division Series against the Yankees). ``If we
take care of that, we'll worry about the playoffs when the time
comes.''
</P>
<P>
   The job is scheduled to get under way this afternoon. The 161
games to follow are billed as merely the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time,'' Greer said, ``when you realize things
count, and you turn it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Or two or three notches maybe.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, the stakes are higher. Being best in the West
isn't quite what it used to be.

THE INTERNET MAGAZINE SALON PLANS ITS FIRST EXTENSIVE MARKETING
CAMPAIGN.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the changes set to be announced today by Salon, the
online magazine published by Salon Internet Inc., perhaps the
biggest is a new address.
</P>
<P>
   After three and a half years of haggling, David Talbott, Salon's
editor and founder, has persuaded the owner of the Internet
address, www.salon.com, to sell his domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot is counting not only on the new Internet address but on a
national advertising campaign, a newly designed site and a larger
staff to help attract many more visitors to his digital
publication. More visitors, in turn, would attract new advertisers.
Regular advertisers in Salon already include the Saturn unit of the
General Motors Corp. DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes-Benz division
and the AT&AMP;T Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Talbot and his staff have been rethinking Salon and the role it
should play in the ever-dense media universe since late last year,
primarily because of the news media attention and the controversy
Salon attracted as Congress moved toward impeaching President
Clinton. In September, the magazine reported that Rep. Henry Hyde,
the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who would
lead the impeachment effort, had once been involved in an
extra-marital affair. That report sent potential readers searching
for the Web site of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But many could not find it. Instead, when readers logged on to
the address where they thought they would find Salon, they instead
found themselves at a Web site owned by Roy Frederickson, who owns
two beauty salons in Austin, Texas Frederickson said he was
planning to use the site as a portal for the hairdressing business.
</P>
<P>
   Salon magazine, meanwhile, had been residing at three Internet
addresses _ www.salon1999.com, www.salonmagazine.com and
www.salon.net _ since its debut in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Though Talbot would not disclose the exact price he paid for
www.salon.com, he did say a promise of stock, an undisclosed sum of
cash and the salon.net domain finally persuaded Frederickson to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I agreed to the deal is I respect what they're
doing,'' Frederickson said. ``Nothing they could have said would
have convinced me if I didn't think they had a great future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its old address, however, Salon had been attracting
1.2 million different visitors a month, according to Talbot.
</P>
<P>
   But to expand the magazine from a haven for intellectual essays
and commentaries from the likes of Sallie Tisdale, Camille Paglia
and Anne Lamott, Talbot knew the domain name was key. Still, he
also saw the Web growing from a curious oddity to a critical
information source, and he decided he needed to change his
publication as the public perception of the Web matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a medium for New Yorker-type content. It's a
medium for newspaper-type content,'' he said. ``What the Web is
mostly known for at this point is cud-chewing punditry. That's
fine. It's a good medium for that. We decided we want to go beyond
that and start breaking stories.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that breaking news on a Web site, where
boutique magazines sit side by side with behemoth news-gathering
institutions like CNN and where publishing cycles never cease, will
be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't compete on that level,'' he said. ``We can make a
contribution, as we did with coverage of Ken Starr and the
impeachment hearings. It's a huge goal and we don't take it on
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon will be introducing two sections today, focusing on health
and people. Obituaries are being added to the site as well, Talbot
said, along with a daily gossip column. And the magazine is opening
an office in Washington, where it has hired two staff reporters. In
all, 20 new staff members have been added.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said he was now attracting financial interest from
venture capitalists who had once shunned companies like Salon that
created original content for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, no one wanted to invest in content
companies,'' he said. ``Everyone said, `We're interested in
E-commerce.''' But those attitudes have changed this year, Talbot
said.
</P>
<P>
   Salon posted revenue of $3.5 million in its fiscal year ended
April 1, derived largely from advertising, but Talbot said the
magazine was not yet profitable. As for whether the company would
file for an initial public offering and seize the frenzied momentum
from Internet stocks, he said, ``We'd have to be crazy not to
consider it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of venture capital financing is helping to pay
for the expanded staff and to start Salon's first advertising
campaign, created by Odiorne Wilde Narraway &AMP; Partners in San
Francisco, in print magazines including The New Yorker, American
Monthly, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly and Fast Company next
month. A radio campaign will begin shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one advertisement a year in The New York Times Book
Review to announce its annual book awards, ``we haven't spent a
dime,'' Talbot said, ``unlike people like Candice Carpenter and
iVillage,'' referring to the co-founder of the online site for
women. ``We obviously need to do more of what they've done. We're
taking an aggressive stance.''
</P>
<P>
   This is another reason he considers the simplified Web address
to be so critical. There is nothing particularly catchy or
memorable about having to explain that Salon can be found anywhere
other than www.salon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gold,'' he said. ``It's priceless.''

EDWARD A. MANFIELD, BRIDGE CHAMPION, 55
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y. Pa. Va.)  (rk) 
 By ALAN TRUSCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward A. Manfield, a world champion bridge player, died on
Monday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Melanie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Manfield was a member of an American team that won the
Rosenblum Cup for the World Team Championship. In 1982, he won a
silver medal in the same event.
</P>
<P>
   Manfield won the Vanderbilt Knockout Team Championship in 1991.
His 10 other national victories were the Grand National Teams in
1984, 1988 and 1992; the Open Board-a-Match Teams in 1994; the
Men's Board-a-Match Teams in 1986 and 1989; the Blue Ribbon Pairs
in 1990; the Open Pairs in 1987 and 1989, and the Men's Pairs in
1985. He won the Cavendish Invitational Pairs in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Manfield was born in the Bronx and graduated from Harvard
University in 1965. He served in the Army and received a master's
degree in economics from the University of Virginia in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   From 1972 to 1985 he worked as an economist at the Federal Trade
Commission. He then became an options trader on the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange and was the head of Binary Traders Inc.
</P>
<P>
   His marriages to Lynn Johannesen of Sunnyvale, Calif., and JoAnn
Sprung of Philadelphia ended in divorce. In addition to his wife,
he is survived by their two children, Seth and Sabrina Manfield; a
daughter from his first marriage, Karen Manfield of New York; his
mother, Roslyn Manfield of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and two brothers,
Philip, of Oakland, Calif., and David, of Lake Oswego, Ore.

   Astros eager to get &QL; 
real season going
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ The question was posed to Jeff Bagwell, and he
provided a fitting response without saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   Is spring training too long?
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell yawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably two weeks too long,'' the first baseman said
after the Astros concluded their exhibition season Sunday with a
4-3 victory over Class AAA New Orleans at Zephyr Field.
``Especially when you get to the last few days. All you want to do
is get home and sleep in your bed. That's all you're looking
forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six days after players began arriving in Kissimmee, Fla.,
for the start of spring workouts, the Astros found their way home.
Undoubtedly tired after six grueling weeks in the Florida sun, the
Astros capped off spring training with a whirlwind three-city tour
that took them to Arlington, San Antonio and New Orleans over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been that long since the start of camp Feb. 18? The
answer through the clubhouse was a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like forever,'' reliever Doug Henry said. ``I
realize we need time to get the pitchers in shape, but it just
seemed a week or two too long this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are cooped up inside of a little apartment or house
for seven straight weeks, and your families aren't there, the whole
time it gets old. At least during the season you get to go to
different cities and change it up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't appear to be a quick fix. Spring training has
become big business across Florida and Arizona, with fans going
extreme distances to catch a glimpse of their favorite stars.
</P>
<P>
   But after a dozen long bus rides, a slate of 30 exhibitions and
only one day off, Florida doesn't seem like such an exciting
vacation spot. The excitement of beginning another season turns to
finding a way to survive the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way spring training goes, everybody gets excited to get
down (to Florida) initially, and halfway through you get tired of
that because then you are ready to play games,'' said second
baseman Craig Biggio, a 12-year spring training veteran. ``Then you
get halfway through the games, and you're ready for the season to
start. Seven days a week for six weeks that's a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution, some players suggest, would be adding five or six
days off or reducing the exhibition schedule by a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would break the monotony of having to come to the yard,''
Biggio said. ``That's every day, seven days a week for six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering spring training, the Astros had few available roster
spots up for grabs, leaving little suspense among the 48 camp
invitees. Compared to other major-league clubs that invited 50 or
more players, the number training at the Astros' facility ensured
there was plenty of work to go around.
</P>
<P>
   And while the primary focus is getting innings for the pitching
staff, hitters generally can be ready within two or three weeks,
Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point this spring, manager Larry Dierker called a team
meeting when it appeared the long, sometimes boring, spring was
taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too long for a veteran club like ours,'' Dierker said.
``We didn't have enough competition for jobs to really keep the
spirit up. Once guys get close to being ready, there is still two
or three weeks left, and they start to drag a little bit. I don't
think there's any way to avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   The extra time does have its advantages for prospects hoping to
get noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you're trying to make a club, and you have to make
an impression, it might be nice to have as much time as you can so
the coaching staff can see you,'' Bagwell said. ``Once you have
established yourself and know you have a job, then it gets a little
tedious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it can be a downright yawner.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When writer Francine Prose received a
formidable-looking letter from the New York Public Library, her
first thought was one of overdue fines, lots of them. ``I was so
amazed when I read it that my family had to explain it to me,'' she
said of the notification that she had been named a director's
fellow at the library's new Center for Scholars and Writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter was almost as gratifying as the fellowship,'' she
said. ``It meant that someone had read my work and gotten it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prose is among the center's first class of 15 fellows, whose
names are being announced Monday. Twelve of them fulfilled rigorous
selection criteria for what have quickly become coveted positions.
</P>
<P>
   Three _ Ada Louise Huxtable, the architectural critic and
historian; Marion Kaplan, professor of history at Queens College
and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and Ms.
Prose _ were chosen at large by historian Peter J. Gay, the
center's director.
</P>
<P>
   The fellows will take up their yearlong residencies beginning on
Sept. 13 at the center, in a newly renovated suite in the
Humanities and Social Science Library, in the library building at
Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The center was made possible by a $10 million gift from a
library trustee, Dorothy Cullman, and her husband, Lewis B.
Cullman, and by gifts of $3.4 million from the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, $3 million from the estate of Margaret Liebman Berger
and $1 million from the Samuel I. Newhouse Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Gay, the center's mission is to draw on
the collections of the Humanities and Social Science Library to
foster creative writing and innovative thinking, to advance
scholarship and to sponsor public events in which the fellows will
participate.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Gay, the Sterling Professor of History
Emeritus at Yale University, in July 1997 drew a strong response
from writing and academic circles, leading to more than 900
requests for applications, said Paul LeClerc, the library's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Of those expressing interest, 226 from 31 countries went on to
submit applications and produce weighty recommendations. A panel of
15 judges winnowed the pool down to about 50 applicants, whose
names were then submitted to a seven-member selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both LeClerc and Gay declined to name the committee's members,
who were described by Gay as ``a historian, a museum person, a
historian of science, a sociologist, a literary critic and
historian, a writer of fiction and a playwright.''
</P>
<P>
   The center will provide the fellows with work space, access to
the library's collection of 54 million items, and stipends of
$50,000 each for the 1999-2000 academic year, as well as assistants
and a housing allowance, where needed.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the fellows will be required to participate in
lectures, readings and symposiums and to meet at daily luncheons,
while working on projects of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do see the center as becoming a great intellectual
spark plug in the life of New York,'' LeClerc said. ``What is novel
is that we're mixing creative writers and scholars together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That mix was the deciding factor for Mrs. Cullman, who said she
and her husband were adamant that writers be included when the
couple were first approached about contributing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see the library become a living center,'' she said.
``There were always writers there, always people doing research,
but there were never connections between them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be glitches along the way as we go along,
but right now we're very, very hopeful,'' she added. ``Everyone is
very enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm is far reaching. ``I cannot tell you how much
I'm looking forward to this,'' said Ms. Huxtable, former
architecture critic of The New York Times. ``I have been working on
my own for years, and I love the prospect of the communication and
exchange that will come with working together in a structured
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Kaplan agreed. ``The way colleges are set up, you
associate with people from your own discipline,'' she said. ``Here,
we'll be learning something about each other's fields.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the other fellows:
</P>
<P>
   Sven Beckert, assistant professor of history, Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Berman, a critic and journalist.
</P>
<P>
   D. Graham Burnett, the Mellon Fellow in History, Columbia
University, and assistant professor in the Honors College,
University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Neal Cleaver, visiting assistant professor of history
and American studies, Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Clemit, reader in English studies, University of Durham,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Delbanco, the Julian Clarence Levi professor in the
Humanities, English and Comparative Literature, Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory K. Dreicer, visiting associate professor of American
studies, George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Fleck, associate professor of sociology, University of
Graz, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Holden, a London-based writer.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Kurzweil, a novelist from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Market, associate professor of pediatrics and
communicable diseases and director of the Historical Center for the
Health Sciences at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Sachs, a writer living in Italy.

Easter Egg Nest which he created for the annual Easter Egg Hunt.
Rogers is not sure how his peculiar fascination with nests began.
Maybe, he says, it had something to do with where he grew up, on
the edge of a Virginia apple orchard that his grandfather owned. As
he made nest baskets and nest centerpieces for tables, he realized
that he had latched onto an especially universal, beloved symbol.
``There are no nest haters out there,'' says Rogers. (Shana

Mark Rogers, a nest artist, with a replica of the White House
Easter Egg Nest which he created for the annual Easter Egg Hunt.
Rogers is not sure how his peculiar fascination with nests began.
Maybe, he says, it had something to do with where he grew up, on
the edge of a Virginia apple orchard that his grandfather owned. As
he made nest baskets and nest centerpieces for tables, he realized
that he had latched onto an especially universal, beloved symbol.
``There are no nest haters out there,'' says Rogers. (Shana

Rogers is not sure how his peculiar fascination with nests began.
Maybe, he says, it had something to do with where he grew up, on
the edge of a Virginia apple orchard that his grandfather owned. As
he made nest baskets and nest centerpieces for tables, he realized
that he had latched onto an especially universal, beloved symbol.
``There are no nest haters out there,'' says Rogers. (Shana

STARS STALL AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Using only two of their four recent acquisitions, the
Detroit Red Wings yesterday won a battle of depth with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   And if the playoffs are all about survival, the Red Wings are
showing they have plenty in reserve when it comes to manpower.
</P>
<P>
   Newly acquired winger Wendel Clark scored his fourth goal in six
games with Detroit, and role players Kirk Maltby and Tomas
Holmstrom chipped in scores as the Red Wings stopped the Stars,
3-0, at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Chris Osgood stopped 27 shots to grab his 24th career
shutout. But the real story was the potent Red Wings, who played a
near-flawless game without the help of Igor Larionov (60 points),
Brendan Shanahan (54 points), Ulf Samuelsson, Darren McCarty (40
points) and Brent Gilchrist. The Stars, meanwhile, were left to
bemoan injuries to key players such as Mike Modano, Shawn Chambers,
Richard Matvichuk and Brian Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going through a tough stretch right now,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``This is what we expected when we lost
those players.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the absence of top-line players hurt the Stars
significantly more than the Red Wings, who ran their record to 6-0
since acquiring Clark, Samuelsson, defenseman Chris Chelios and
goalie Bill Ranford in a March 23 trade-deadline deal.
</P>
<P>
   While the Red Wings (40-30-6) played a calculating game and took
advantage of their own momentum, the Stars (47-17-12) struggled,
losing their second consecutive game. Brett Hull missed an open net
and was robbed by Osgood on a point-blank shot from five feet. Dave
Reid and Derian Hatcher were twice foiled on the same breakaway.
Jere Lehtinen twice missed the net on prime scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   While the game was hardly a preview of a possible playoff
showdown _ the two wouldn't meet until the Western Conference
Finals _ it was an interesting test of two teams who both are
getting ready to pursue the Stanley Cup. The Red Wings played
confidently. The Stars appeared frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we know how much we have to do to get ready and how
much better we have to become,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said
of the challenge presented by the Red Wings. ``They're focused
right now, you can see that in their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were spectacular in a first period that had the feel
of a playoff series. While the Stars had built a 3-0 lead in th
1998-99 season series with the Red Wings, Detroit played much
closer to the way it had in last season's playoffs, when it won a
six-game series against the Stars in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars had answers early. Goalie Ed Belfour was on top of
his game, helping the Stars fend off three Red Wings power-play
attempts in the first 10 minutes. Belfour also stopped Sergei
Fedorov on a short-handed breakaway later in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   But then Belfour was betrayed on a shot that was neither hard
nor pretty. Maltby worked hard to keep a loose puck in the
offensive zone and fired a soft wrister from the blue line. Stars
defenseman Craig Ludwig tried to block the shot and inadvertantly
set a screen in front of Belfour. The puck squeezed past Ludwig,
and Belfour had little chance for the save as the Red Wings took a
1-0 lead at the 17:01 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had a chance to tie the game in the second period, but
Hull missed an open net when Osgood was knocked down behind the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scored the game-winner on me last time I was here,'' Osgood
said. ``He owed me one.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was the case, the Stars paid back in double coupons.
They missed open nets, they shot pucks into Osgood's stomach and
they simply couldn't get the puck past the Red Wings goaltender,
who moves to 14-5-3 lifetime against the Stars during the regular
season.

TWO CONSULTING FIRMS STEP ON EACH OTHER'S TOES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Calif, Conn.)   (rk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looked like the blandest of press releases. The Gartner
Group, the big technology consulting firm, said it would begin a
survey of users of Internet portals. But to Jupiter Communications,
the release seemed a deliberate provocation.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Gartner owns about one-third of Jupiter and until now
it has not ventured into the sort of Internet media and
electronic-commerce research that is the trademark of Jupiter, a
Silicon Alley company.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner, based in Stamford, Conn., has typically concentrated on
its traditional and hugely profitable business of advising
technology departments of big companies.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Internet exploding, this informal division of labor
was bound to come under pressure, ever since Gartner acquired its
stake in Jupiter a year and half ago for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd,'' Gene DeRose, Jupiter's chairman, said of Gartner's
portal study. ``We have a great relationship with them, and I'm
sure we will figure out how to enjoy the benefits of this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind this public spat is a relationship at a crossroads that
probably must either get more serious or break up. Gartner, in
fact, is trying to tie the knot and buy all of Jupiter, consulting
executives said. Gartner declines to comment on the matter at all.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, meanwhile, is moving closer to hitting the road and
taking itself public. It has just hired a high-profile chief
financial officer, Gene Robinson, formerly a technology banker with
JP Morgan. Such a hiring is often a sign that a company wants to
increase its appeal to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   DeRose is prudently oblique when asked directly whether Jupiter
wants to make a public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be entirely in line with companies like ours to go
public in the near future'' is about all he will say on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, of course, is still a small company, with some 200
employees and 1998 revenues between $10 million and $20 million,
according to DeRose. He noted, however, that with demand for
Internet consulting still increasing, Jupiter expects to nearly
double its revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, to have a successful offering, Jupiter would have to
smooth things out with Gartner. DeRose says he hopes to work out an
amicable resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, he knows how to kick where it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're introducing a service on electronic-commerce strategies
for the enterprise,'' DeRose said. ``Enterprise'' refers to big
corporate projects _ just the sort of work in which Gartner
specializes. ``They sure will love that.''

MEMORIES MADE ON OPENING DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SUILLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ ``My Economics 4 professor at the University
of San Francisco had no appreciation for baseball. He was from the
Middle East, but that was no excuse for scheduling a mid-term exam
on Opening Day 1981.
</P>
<P>
   I found that unacceptable, even if this was the last class I
needed to graduate in May. After all, the only reason I went to USF
was it was a Catholic school in a market with two major-league
teams.
</P>
<P>
   So I did the only thing possible. I told a bold-face lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an important job interview that day,'' I told him. ``I
can't afford to miss it. Can I take a makeup test later?''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't happy, but I was a senior so he relented.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. I passed the test ... barely. I passed the class ...
barely. I graduated.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part was on an absolutely gorgeous afternoon in San
Francisco, the Giants lost to the San Diego Padres. But I wouldn't
have missed it for anything.
</P>
<P>
   It was Opening Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who loves baseball has their favorite Opening Day story,
as vivid in their minds as their favorite Christmas present or
first Easter egg hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball often can be a violent game, head-on collisions at home
plate, fastballs under the chin or spikes flashing at second base
as a runner attempts to break up a double play.
</P>
<P>
   But memories of Opening Day are much softer, evoking images of
blue skies, green grass and that one special moment in the sun. The
Rangers expect such memories to be created this afternoon when they
host the Detroit Tigers at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what cherished memories will arise from today's game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually the Opening Day I remember is when I managed my first
game in the minor leagues and the opposing pitcher threw a perfect
game against us,'' Rangers coach Jerry Narron said. ``It was the
first game of a doubleheader. In the second game, Steve Avery took
a no-hitter against us into the seventh. We got one hit that day
and lost both games.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the pastoral aspects of the game and the old saying
that hope springs eternal on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most in baseball look at Opening Day as a true national
holiday, a day of renewal and optimism, with the unwavering belief
that grand things are in store for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Opening Day 1976, when I broke my collarbone and
never got a chance to catch regularly after that,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``I was with the Phillies. Dave Parker ran over
me scoring the tying run in the ninth. I tried to block the plate
before the ball got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   So much for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Oates does have happier moments, from witnessing Hank Aaron hit
his 714th home run in 1974 to the opening of Camden Yards in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very special day, you better believe it,'' Oates said.
``The only day in baseball even more exciting is the seventh game
of the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people around here will have to take Oates' word on that
one.
</P>
<P>
   At least we can appreciate Opening Day. Today will be the 28th
here since the Rangers moved to Arlington. But the special feeling
it brings across the country dates back to before the turn of the
century when the game truly was the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   President William Howard Taft confirmed that on Opening Day 1910
when he threw out the first ball right before Washington Senators
pitcher Walter Johnson threw a one-hitter and defeated the
Philadelphia Athletics, 1-0. That began the tradition of the
Presidential opener, although more than one Secretary of the
Defense has had to step in to throw out the ceremonial first ball.
</P>
<P>
   Even the late, great Joe DiMaggio, as stoic as he was, got
misty-eyed when he once said, ``You always get a special kick on
Opening Day, no matter how many you go through. You look forward to
it like a birthday party when you're a kid. You think something
wonderful is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If DiMaggio can get worked up about it, then why can't the rest
of us? Rafael Palmeiro can sense something special about to happen
as he takes the field today as a Ranger for the first time since
Oct. 3, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Opening Day is special,'' Palmeiro said. ``You wait a
long time for it. But this means a little more to me because this
place is so special. I left and now I've come back, that makes it a
little sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll be a little nervous and anxious and excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that the way everybody is supposed to feel, especially a
20-game winner making the first Opening Day start of his career?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched some big ballgames in my career, but Opening Day
is a different feeling,'' said Rick Helling, the Rangers' starter
today. ``It's the start of the season, we'll be sold out, I've got
family in town. It is special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers used to open at night, until they opened The
Ballpark in 1994, a special day highlighted by Van Cliburn and the
Fort Worth Symphony delivering a stunning rendition of the
``Star-Spangled Banner''. Now Opening Day has been established as a
local tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sneak off from work or _ God forbid _ sneak out of
school for a little taste of forbidden fruit,'' Rangers president
Tom Schieffer said. ``All of us like to play hooky, and I think
Opening Day allows us to play hooky from real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody should have a chance to skip an economics examination.
Who cares, as long as you get to see that first pitch and still
somehow find a way to graduate.

BOOK BY KOCH CALLS NEW YORK CITY MAYOR A `NASTY MAN' 
JOURNALISTS' VIEWS ON MEDIA WORSEN 
NFL AND PETERSEN PLAN TO GO `INSIDE'
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch may have missed his
chance for a celebrity arrest outside Police Headquarters, but he
is seizing the opportunity to needle the present occupant of City
Hall with the publication of a collection of his various newspaper
columns titled, ``Giuliani, Nasty Man.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Nasty' means what it says,'' remarked Koch, who noted that
he picked the title himself to describe Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
``You try to disembowel people. That's what he tries to do.'' He
also considers Giuliani a ``very charming and a very gifted
person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I see this really as almost a Greek tragedy,'' Koch added.
``His nastiness is causing his self-destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The book will be published by Barricade Books, the gadfly
company that has produced books ranging from celebrity biographies
to controversial titles like the bomb manual ``Anarchist Cookbook''
or the right-wing fantasy novel ``Turner Diaries.'' It is rushing
to try to get Koch's 120-page book out by June.
</P>
<P>
   The book will include about 20 columns that appeared in The New
York Daily News and The New York Post. In addition, Koch is writing
a new prologue for the columns, which start with an essay offering
advice to Giuliani in 1994 and end with a critique of his behavior
rising out of the police shooting in February of Amadou Diallo, an
immigrant from West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Giuliani, Sunny Mindel, declined to comment on
Koch's latest literary effort or his choice of book titles.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, who supported Giuliani in the 1993 mayoral race, said he
focused on a nasty streak because Giuliani exhibited a
``mean-spiritedness that everybody recognizes.'' He cited
Giuliani's criticism of people who were arrested in connection with
protests of the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He attacks the motives and decency of the people who had
themselves arrested,'' said Koch, who had planned to take part in
the protests, but was hospitalized briefly with low blood pressure
before he could do so.
</P>
<P>
   Why the rush to publish? ``We would like to influence Giuliani's
political career,'' said Barricade's publisher, Lyle Stuart, who
explained that the book is timed to have an impact on a potential
candidacy by the mayor in a U.S. Senate race. ``I think he's a
nasty man, too.''

<P>
   Journalists' Views On Media Worsen
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer just the public that is disappointed with how
the news media cover events. Journalists increasingly find fault
with how they do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 552 journalists and news media executives, conducted
by the Pew Research Center from Nov. 20, 1998, to Feb. 11, found
that 40 percent of journalists working for national news
organizations and 55 percent of those working for local outlets
said that news reports were increasingly marred by factual errors
and sloppy reporting, up from 30 percent and 40 percent,
respectively, four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds said the boundary between reporting and
commentary had eroded. The survey drew on roughly equal numbers of
journalists from print media (newspapers, magazines and wire
services) and broadcast media (radio, television and cable). The
respondents came from national and local organizations as well as
Internet-only news companies and included correspondents, senior
editors, producers and media executives.
</P>
<P>
   Other criticisms cited were that the media were out of touch
with the public (57 percent of national journalists and 51 percent
of local ones) and that the media had a growing credibility problem
(30 percent of national journalists, 34 percent local).
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't trust us the way they used to, and they have good
reason not to,'' a local TV news assignment editor said in the
survey. ``A lot of stuff now is slanted toward sensationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do journalists think these problems exist? A majority of
national news journalists, 53 percent, said financial pressure in
the industry had hurt their news-gathering ability. Executives did
not agree. Almost 60 percent said such pressure had only changed
the way things are done, not hurt the quality of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of staff journalists said the increasing pressure
to attract new audiences was driving media coverage in the
direction of ``infotainment.'' Most news executives agreed, but not
in such overwhelming numbers (57 percent among national news
organizations and 54 percent among local ones).
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center, said the most
surprising finding of the survey was how much more self-criticism
there was compared with earlier surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists see the reactions that the public has and believe
that credibility has become the No. 1 issue facing journalism,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal, and how it was
covered, had a significant effect on the survey's findings, he
said. About 60 percent of those surveyed thought the Lewinsky
matter received too much coverage. And nearly half of national news
journalists and 56 percent of local ones now think that press
coverage drives controversies about personal and ethical behavior,
up from 41 percent and 33 percent, respectively, four years ago.

   NFL and Petersen Plan to Go `Inside'
</P>
<P>
   In September, NFL Properties Inc. and Petersen Publishing,
publisher of 160 magazines from Guns &AMP; Ammo to Teen, will introduce
NFL Insider Magazine. It will be appear eight times a year, during
football season, and will, its publishers say, have a
staggering-sounding circulation of one million readers with the
first issue.
</P>
<P>
   But how inside can you go without ever disclosing anything
critical?
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that a magazine in partnership with the NFL would
have a hard time disclosing anything controversial about the
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   John Wiebusch, the magazine's editor in chief, said the inside
information would include locker-room visits, coaches' training
routines and players' perspectives, and added, ``Clearly, this
magazine is not going to offer exposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiebusch said he felt comfortable with a completely
nonconfrontational format. His reason: Sports Illustrated, as an
example, does not score hits with readers when it features
controversial articles. ``It's hardly a secret but a lot of the
exposes they have done haven't been well received by the public so
they tend to do those less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Colson, managing editor of Sports Illustrated, said his
magazine's best-selling cover articles in the last year had been on
controversial subjects, and added that he might question the
ability of a magazine with NFL in the title to cover the industry
objectively.
</P>
<P>
   And the secret of the million subscribers? The magazine's
circulation will be fortified by an arrangement with ``NFL Sunday
Ticket,'' which is carried on DirecTV and costs $159 a season. Each
viewer will get a subscription. Chris Widmaier, an NFL spokesman,
said he expected ``NFL Sunday Ticket'' subscribers to exceed
700,000 this year.

A CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET ADDRESS SPECULATORS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network Solutions, the company that assigns Internet addresses,
is again trying to curb what it terms registration abuses by
speculators aiming to turn a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently purged 18,000 registrations that it
suspected were held by speculators. In most cases, the company
says, the domain names, as Internet addresses are known, were
registered by people or companies matching the basic profile of a
speculator, who typically register thousands of names at once.
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly every case of a name's being purged, the
registrant had not paid on time, giving Network Solutions the legal
right to reclaim it, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were well-known speculators that had registered
thousands of domain names,'' Christopher Clough, a spokesman for
Network Solutions in Herndon, Va., said. Clough said the company
regularly purged delinquent registrations and specifically aimed at
domain-name speculators.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate attempt to curb domain-name speculation last
month, the company enacted a policy of restricting access to ``root
zone'' files, which can alert speculators about when a domain name
will become available.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions said it would no longer make the files freely
available, but instead would license them for specific purposes. As
a result, many businesses that help companies secure valuable
domain-name addresses suddenly found themselves unable to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Woodward, president of Myinternet.com, a registration
services company, was one of them. Last month he discovered that
his company suddenly was unable to get access to the Network
Solutions zone files. After he threatened to file a lawsuit, his
access was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions holds a government-backed monopoly in the
registration of the most popular domains. The market is to be
opened to competition later this year.

DODGERS HUBBARD, CADARET MISS THE CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Outfielder Trenidad Hubbard thought last season
counted for something. Left-handed pitcher Greg Cadaret thought 10
seasons in the big leagues were important. Both were casualties on
the final day of cuts, as the Los Angeles Dodgers trimmed their
roster to 25 for today's opener against the Arizona Diamondbacks at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret was beaten out by lefties Pedro Borbon and 21-year-old
rookie Onan Masaoka for a spot in the bullpen. Jacob Brumfield, who
played for Dodgers manager Davey Johnson in Cincinnati, won his
duel with Trenidad Hubbard for the final outfielder's spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned, but this is their team,'' said Hubbard, who was
the Dodgers' opening-day center fielder last season and hit .298.
</P>
<P>
   Until outfielder Todd Hollandsworth's hamstring injury heals,
the Dodgers will go with four outfielders. It also means they'll
carry three catchers _ Todd Hundley, Rick Wilkins and Paul Lo Duca
_ on the opening-day roster. Hundley will be the opening-day
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel (Hundley's) all right, but I would rather have a little
insurance in that area,'' Johnson said. ``I don't know how (many
games) Hundley can give me in a row. I think his legs are still not
there yet, and (Wilkins) is another left-handed bat. It gives me
more versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   It clearly appears the decisions to re-assign Hubbard and
Cadaret were based on spring performance, and not past seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When Cadaret broke into the big leagues, Masaoka was 9. But this
spring Cadaret was 0-1 with a 4.61 ERA in the spring. Borbon
pitched well in the last two weeks of spring training and had a
2.45 ERA, while Masaoka, who is yet to pitch above the Double-A
level, surprised everyone by yielding one run in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield, along with Wilkins, was signed to a minor-league deal
by the Dodgers. He hit .265 in the spring and gives the Dodgers
more speed on the bases. Hubbard, beset by injuries, batted .192.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard packed his equipment and headed for Triple-A
Albuquerque. General manager Kevin Malone said he would listen to
trade talk regarding Hubbard, but was content with keeping him in
the organization. The Toronto Blue Jays showed interest in Hubbard
last week, but Dodgers officials said that interest cooled in the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret, who will get his guaranteed $375,000, was designated
for assignment but said he wouldn't accept it. He has that right
because he has more than five years' service time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Borbon and Masaoka) had great springs, but the veterans, I
told (the Dodgers' management), come along slower,'' Cadaret said.
``I told them I'd be ready opening day ... and I had my best stuff
(Sunday). You think 10 years, they'd judge you by your past
history. I didn't get the first (lefty) out and the last one out, I
got them all out in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Dodgers had to purchase the contracts of
Wilkins, Brumfield and Borbon. In other expected moves, the club
optioned lefty Jeff Kubenak to Albuquerque, designated pitcher
Arnold Gooch for assignment and placed right-handed pitcher Steve
Montgomery (recovering from shoulder surgery) on the 60-day
disabled list.

MAJOR MATCHUPS ON HORIZON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Take a blindfold, cover your eyes and toss a dart
at a list of tournaments on the PGA Tour calendar. Chances are good
that you've struck an event where one of the game's top young
players has stuck like glue to a final-round leader board in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, six of the highest-ranked participants in the
Masters Tournament have combined to win 46 events without
celebrating so much as one 30th birthday. The list includes David
Duval and Tiger Woods, who will carry the No. 1 and No. 2 spots,
respectively, in the world golf rankings into the opening round
Thursday at Augusta National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Add the names of Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, Justin Leonard and
Jim Furyk to the mix, and you've got a collection of under-30
players with four major championships and five Ryder Cup
appearances. What you do not have is a memorable shootout between
any of the PGA Tour's young stallions during the final round of a
major championship _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But that day is coming, and soon, tour competitors say. Perhaps
as soon as this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will definitely happen in time. The `when' is hard to
tell,'' said Mark O'Meara, 42, the defending Masters champion.
``You have got a handful of very young, talented players that have
proven themselves and could win at any time. Match them up any way
you want. It's just incredible what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the most incredible of the bunch has been Duval, 27. A
four-event winner, including his triumph at the BellSouth Classic
yesterday, Duval tops the chart in five of 10 statistical areas
kept by PGA Tour officials, including scoring average (68.28),
greens in regulation (72.5 percent) and putting (1.677 strokes per
hole). He ranks eighth in driving distance (284.5 yard average) and
is the only player on tour averaging more than five birdies per
round (5.04).
</P>
<P>
   By winning the BellSouth, Duval earned $450,000 to boost his
season total to $2,598,300. The figure is a PGA Tour season record,
eclipsing the mark of $2,591,031 Duval set last season.
</P>
<P>
   Duval said his March 28 victory at The Players Championship,
which propelled him past Woods in the world golf rankings, boosted
his confidence to new heights because it came against a field that
included 47 of the world's top 50 players.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of downplaying a potential rivalry with Woods, as he did
earlier this season, Duval said he is ready to increase the stakes
with his 23-year-old adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I play well enough to be a rival of his for a long,
long time,'' Duval said. ``If my play dictates that, I would
certainly embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, likewise, said he is eager to engage in the first all
Gen-X shootout for a major championship, whether that involves a
tussle with Duval, Mickelson or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is bound to happen,'' Woods said. ``I am sure we
are all going to get going at the same time some week, and it will
be great. I'd welcome that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances have prevented such a matchup from unfolding.
While rolling to a 12-stroke victory at the 1997 Masters, Woods'
closest pursuer was Tom Kite, who will join the Senior Tour next
season. Duval saw his bid to win the 1998 Masters revoked by a
closing birdie barrage from O'Meara, who joined the PGA Tour when
Duval was a fourth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Els' victories at the 1994 and 1997 U.S. Opens came at the
expense of veteran players, most notably Colin Montgomerie of
Scotland. Leonard's strong closing kick at the 1997 British Open
allowed him to reel in Jesper Parnevik of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   But none has dusted another in the final round of a major. The
Masters, a tournament with a history of dramatic finishes, would
seem an appropriate backdrop for such a first occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Els is quick to identify the likely suspects: Duval, who
has won 11 events in 18 months, and Woods, who has finished first
and eighth in his two professional appearances at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really proven themselves as the two best players in
the world right now,'' Els said. ``I've had my flashes, but those
two guys have been dominant. I wouldn't say I am quite at their
level with the way they have been playing. But at my best, I can
play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, O'Meara said, having Duval and Woods atop the
world rankings benefits players such as Els, Mickelson, Leonard and
Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent level is close,'' O'Meara said. ``If the top two
guys draw all the attention, that third, fourth, fifth and sixth
guy are going to go right by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, the guy with the biggest bull's eye on his chest, said
he's prepared for the challenge. Winning at TPC, he said, convinced
him that he is ready to succeed in the cauldron of a major
championship. Even if his closest pursuer is another Gen-Xer such
as Woods or Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can beat these players,'' Duval said. ``It's just a
matter of being ready, being on my game and playing well. The final
round at TPC, I was more nervous than the final round last year at
Augusta, and I still won. I can draw on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seems to make it known that most players don't hit
their peak until they're 31 or 32. But I think as everybody
matures, we'll have more head-to-head matches between us, and that
will be great. Who knows? This week may be a little taste of what
could be in store for the future.''

DODGERS HOPE FOR SPRINGBOARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Does a spring-training record mean anything in
baseball? The Los Angeles Dodgers won a record 21 games in 1988,
the year they won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the New York Yankees 8-4 Sunday afternoon in front
of a paid attendance of 30,315 at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers
closed their spring schedule with 21 wins in 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``For not trying to win them, (that was) pretty good,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``We'll see how we do when we try to
win them.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who leads all active managers with a .575 winning
percentage, wants to win every game _ even if it doesn't count _
and especially against the world champion Yankees, whom they beat
for the second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a couple easier games against the Yankees in my
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed rules: Devon White called a players' meeting before
Sunday's game to discuss a few of Johnson's team rules, especially
his ban on facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Johnson said, ``there's going to be a minimum amount of
allowable facial hair.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules regarding players' children on team flights and in the
clubhouse have also been slightly modified, according to Johnson,
who added he will stick to any rule about any behavior that ``is
going to be detracting for us to play championship baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling expectations: The Dodgers' top hitter this spring was
third baseman Adrian Beltre, who batted .453 (29 for 64). Beltre,
who turns 21 Wednesday, had three hits Sunday, including a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the only question for me was if I could hit in the big
leagues,'' Beltre said. ``I stay positive now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruised but not beaten: A day after getting hit on the right
elbow by a line drive, Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez said he
will be able to make his scheduled start Thursday against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a problem with my left arm,'' he said. ``I pitched
the last two months (last season) with a broken nose. I love to be
on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said his elbow didn't bother him Saturday night after he
was knocked out of the game by the liner off the bat of David Cone.
Sunday morning was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) night there wasn't any pain,'' he said. ``This
morning when I woke up ... whew!''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers cruncher: Johnson, known for determining lineups based
on statistics pumped into a computer program, may have come upon
one by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley, who set a major-league record for home
runs in a season by a catcher with 41 in 1996, batted No. 2 against
the Angels on Friday and the Yankees on Saturday. Gary Sheffield
was No. 3 and Raul Mondesi batted cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of liking the way that is looking against a
right-hander,'' he said. ``Hundley can hit the ball through the
hole. He's also a guy who can drive in a run. It's a very
intriguing lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, a switch-hitter, didn't play Sunday and shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, who batted .333 this spring, was in the No. 2 slot
ahead of Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he will use Grudzielanek in the No. 2 spot today
against Arizona left-hander Randy Johnson and Hundley will hit
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated opening-day lineup: Eric Young, second base;
Grudzielanek, shortstop; Sheffield, left field; Mondesi, right
field; White, center field; Eric Karros, first base; Hundley,
catcher; Beltre, third base; ninth, Kevin Brown, pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Slick glove: Grudzielanek, who committed 33 errors last year,
made just one this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a steppingstone,'' Grudzielanek said. ``I
misplayed one ball and it was a fly ball. It's something to build
on.''

<P>
   KOSOVO-MOBILIZE (Belgrade, Serbia) _ No general mobilization has
been declared, but reserve units are being called up as
specialities are required. Men who served in radio and
communications units, for instance, are being ordered to report for
duty, some Serbs say. Wartime military courts have been established
to court-martial those who do not report to their units
immediately, with prison terms for draft-dodging can range from one
to 20 years. Official Serbian state television has shown glowing
reports of young men responding to mobilization or draft orders,
and it is likely that a large majority does so. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace) _ As the tide of refugees has swelled
the miserable crowd to 30,000, conditions have deteriorated
alarmingly. Death and disease are becoming commonplace. Aid
agencies said 11 people died Friday night, and another 14 died
Saturday night, mostly the old and very young, many of them
suffering from exposure. Local journalists reported several babies
had been born in the camp, too, and that one of the mothers died in
childbirth Saturday. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ At its starkest, the truth in Kosovo
is simple. Serbs, enboldened or maddened by NATO bombings, are on a
rampage of ethnic cleansing that has caused nearly a quarter of the
ethnic Albanian population to flee. But close up, real life is
rarely simple. Between those deaths lies a tangled web of history,
friendships and enmities, of war and routine business that were
echoed all over Kosovo. And those are the minutae of life and death
that are drowned out by the clashing statements of Washington and
Belgrade. By Alessanrda Stanley.

mix of news, entertainment and political commentary. But the

dropping red pellets over a landscape of mountains. It showed
bodies flowing down a river, soldiers shooting and people bleeding.
The boy's mother died in what is known as the 1980 massacre of the
Sumpul River, on El Salvador's border with Honduras, during the
country's 12-year civil war. The boy, then 11, hit by bullets and
shrapnel three times, found his way to safety and later to a
refugee center in San Salvador where an American priest offered him
the first slot in an orphanage he had started here in Zaragoza.
Today, Rodriguez, who grew up in the orphanage, rules over it and
Zaragoza's 20,000 residents as the town's mayor and the embodiment
of El Salvador's transformation from a war-ravaged country to
peaceful democracy. By Mireya Navarro.

   EDUC-PARTNERS (Montclair, N.J.) _ On a frigid March morning, 35
second graders squirmed with delight in the Watchung School
auditorium at the prospect of receiving a disposable camera and a
creative assignment: recording their lives and tastes in
photographs and writing. The homework was not assigned by teachers
at this public elementary school just 15 miles west of New York
City. Instead, the assignment, handed out to some 250 children at
the school, came from researchers for Noggin, a new educational
channel that has formed a special partnership with Watchung. In
exchange for $7,100, Noggin can go into the school once a week from
now until June to run focus groups with some 250 children who
turned in parent permission slips. For Rita Miragliotta, Watchung's
principal, the partnership has been a boon, helping ease a budget
crunch. But for others in the education world, which has seen an
explosion of corporate suitors, deals like the Watchung-Noggin
partnership are things to be avoided, as they blur the line
separating schools from supermarkets.

for some of computing's most important developments in the last two
decades has some radical ideas and designs for computing's future.

   HONGKONG-TECH (Hong Kong) _ Richard Li, the wealthy Hong Kong
entrepreneur who means to become the cybermogul of Asia, plans to
build a $2 billion high-technology center in Hong Kong. Called
Cyberport, it is one of several futuristic technology parks that
are rising from Taiwan to Singapore. With Asia mired in recession
and the United States enjoying a high-technology boom, governments
in this region have seized on technology as a way to recapture
their growth. They regard these parks as potent marketing tools _
showcase projects that can help vault them into the digital age and
perhaps even reverse a brain drain among their technology-minded
youth. By Mark Landler.

`TONGUE OF A BIRD': AUDIENCE ONLY GETS CRUMBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Tongue of a Bird'' certainly lives up to its name.
The play by Ellen McLaughlin chatters so obsessively about birds
and flight, conjures avian imagery so frequently, that one would
think the whole endeavor had been hatched by an undergraduate
ornithology department.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in Ms. McLaughlin's ethereal riffs on mother
love and loss, on gravity-defying escapes into memory and dreams,
that suggests the sensibility of a sincere college student intent
on containing the whole, messy world in a tidily kept aviary of
winged metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   If her characters are not talking about seeing birds, or hearing
birds, or imagining their ancestors as birds, they are themselves
in flight, in planes over mountains or in nighttime visions, over
beds.
</P>
<P>
   Bird symbolism may be a time-honored device in world drama;
think of ``The Seagull'' and ``The Wild Duck.'' But as demonstrated
by Trevor Nunn's invigorating new production of Tennessee Williams'
early, deeply flawed ``Not About Nightingales,'' playwrights must
learn to walk before they fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tongue of a Bird,'' unfortunately, is far too languorously and
self-consciously poetic to locate a vital dramatic landscape. The
play is instead a dry, pedantic exercise in lyricism, the sort that
seeks to camouflage prosaic storytelling in lofty language. What
should be affecting comes off as affectation.
</P>
<P>
   Not even an actress as grounded as the sturdy Cherry Jones can
levitate ``Tongue of a Bird,'' which opened Sunday night at the
Joseph Papp Public Theater. Ms. Jones, whose recent successes have
included a Tony-winning performance in ``The Heiress'' and a
healthy run in Tina Howe's ``Pride's Crossing,'' here plays Maxine,
a woman haunted in midlife by her dead mother Evie (Sharon
Lawrence), who killed herself when Maxine was a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   The trauma inspires in Maxine an ardent lifelong quest to help
others who have lost loved ones _ she is, in service of the
playwright's dot-every-i approach, a search and rescue pilot _ and
to find a serenity in the clouds that eludes her on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reverential direction of Lisa Peterson, who by
encouraging the actors to treat the dialogue as a delicate, exotic
object plays into Ms. McLaughlin's worse instincts,
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones invests Maxine with a superhero's saintly solemnity.
She's supposed to be deeply wounded and deeply troubled, but she
seems somehow the opposite in Ms. Jones' shining, apple-cheeked
mien. We know from the very first instant that this robust woman is
going to pull through, which doesn't make the evening any more
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Maxine's mission in the play is to find Charlotte (Julia
McIlvaine), a teen-ager who has been kidnapped by a man in a truck
while on an outing with friends in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   As in all such tales, the distressed family turns to the
superhero when the authorities fail them. Charlotte's desperate
mother, Dessa (Melissa Leo), retains Maxine, whose record of
locating the missing is a miraculous 100 percent. Dessa places 100
percent of her hopes in Maxine's skills, although after a week of
vain searches, she appears only to half-believe Charlotte is still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The freshness of Dessa's despair stokes the embers of Maxine's
old longings. She beseeches her reluctant grandmother Zofia
(Elizabeth Wilson, affecting a generic Eastern European accent) to
fill in the sketchy details of her mother's suicide, but Zofia is
as loath to confront the past as Maxine is eager.
</P>
<P>
   As a result Maxine is compelled to have her mother visit in her
dreams. Suspended on cables, Evie hovers over Ms. Jones' bed like a
_ well, need it be spelled out? Ms. Peterson and Ms. McLaughlin
think so.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright, an actress best known for her own high-flying
role as the Angel in ``Angels in America,'' can resist no
opportunity to underline. She outfits Ms. Lawrence in the garb of
another famous missing woman, the aviator Amelia Earhart, and to
make doubly, triply certain the audience makes all the obvious
connections, the playwright has her hero provide an interpretation
of the vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dress my mother like you, Amelia,'' Maxine says. ``What is
that about? Other than the obvious: the great disappeared flyer,
the one they never found ... Amelia Earhart. Air heart.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of humorless literary posturing seals the play off
hermetically from real feeling, and there's little the high-powered
cast can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lawrence and Ms. Leo, both so memorable in long-running
roles on television's ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Homicide,'' respectively,
are pretty much wasted in ``Tongue of a Bird.'' Ms. McIlvaine is a
vibrant presence as the missing girl in whom Maxine sees her own
vanished youth, and Ms. Wilson soldiers on in a precious role that
borders on unplayable.
</P>
<P>
   The only truly reliable parts in Ms. Peterson's production are
the mechanical ones. Ms. Lawrence swoops and spins with the
greatest of ease, the only convincing bird in this overly gilded
cage.
