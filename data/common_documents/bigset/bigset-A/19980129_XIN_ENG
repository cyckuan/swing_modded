<HEADLINE> WB Likely to Conduct Feasibility Study on Ganges Barrage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) is likely to
make a feasibility study on the Ganges Barrage project, the
national news agency BSS reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The WB intended to render assistance for the proposed project
with an estimated cost of 140 billion taka (3.11 billion US
dollars), BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh wanted the WB to become the lead donor for the
project and sought financial assistance from prospective donor
countries and agencies including Japan, Italy, the Netherlands and
the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government considers the Ganges Barrage as a priority
project which is aimed at harnessing the river for irrigation,
after the signing of the Ganges Water Treaty with India in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rising in the Himalayas, the 2,700-kilometer-long-Granges River
is the most important river in the South Asian region. Bangladesh

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes EU Decision to Resume Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran has voiced its welcome to
the desire of the European Union (EU) to resume "critical
dialogue" with Iran, the official IRNA news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The recent EU meeting to review its ties with Iran has
demonstrated that the EU is moving towards greater realism,
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said Tuesday
evening, according to IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Iran has noticed that after several months, the EU has come to
realize it should reconsider its earlier policies for bilateral
ties and the statement made last April, Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
European Union countries have decided to study the possibility
of resuming "critical dialogue" with Iran two months after their
ambassadors returned to Tehran ending a seven-month diplomatic row
in November.
</P>
<P>
Last April, most of the EU members recalled their ambassadors
in Tehran and announced to suspend "critical dialogue" with Iran
after a German court ruled Iranian leaders had sponsored the
killing of Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
After the election last May of Mohammad Khatami as Iran's
president, who pledged to ease tension with other countries, both
Iran and the EU expressed willingness to make a rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that Iran's relations with all
European countries are based on respect for mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized Britain for repeating its concern over
Iran's support for state terrorism and efforts to develop weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly denied the charges as baseless.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Visits Farmers on Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today
celebrated the traditional Spring Festival, the Chinese lunar new
year, in a northwestern suburban village of Beijing with local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year in a row Li visited farmers during the
Spring Festival. In 1996 and 1997, he spent the new year's days
with farmers in Yan'an in northwestern Shaanxi Province and
Xingguo County of Jiangxi Province, both old revolutionary bases.
</P>
<P>
At around 4:30 p.m., Li, accompanied by Beijing Mayor Jia
Qinglin, arrived at Xiaofengying village in the suburban county of
Yanqing, where he was greeted by local farmers with dragon-lamp
dances and firecrackers at the village entrance.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 2,300-plus villagers in Xiaofengying grow
vegetables for export, and last year their per capita income
exceeded 4,000 yuan (500 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li first reached the five-apartment house of villager Zhao
Yuchen, a taxi driver. Zhao told Li that his family could earn
50,000 to 60,000 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Learning from Zhao's father, a 75-year-old veteran farmer,
that the weather and soil of Yanqing County are also good for
grape growing, Li responded excitedly: "I suggest you also plant
some grapes, especially those suitable for wine-making."
</P>
<P>
He told the farmers that fruit wines are getting increasingly
popular in the Chinese market these years, and that alcohol
distilling will use a lot of precious grains.
</P>
<P>
"I always hold that we should brew more fruit wines to meet the
huge demand during the Spring Festival," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
While at the home of villager Song Xinqi, who makes a living on
pig raising and a private orchard, Li first extended festival
greetings to the parents of Song, and then asked about how Song's
two daughters are doing at school.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he inquired of meat supply in the capital's market
during the holidays from Beijing municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so glad to see that you are all leading a happy life," Li
told all the villagers upon his departure. "I wish you still
better harvest and a better life in the new year."
</P>
<P>
Before his return, Li also watched an exhibition of ice
lanterns and a fireworks display sponsored by the Beijing
Municipal Government in the suburban county.

Wednesday called on Iraq to respect the United Nations resolutions

BAGHDAD -- An Iraqi daily has slammed chief U.N. arms
inspector Richard Butler for breaching rules of his work in his
capacity as an international envoy representing the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jumhuria (The Republic) newspaper said Wednesday that
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, told reporters
that Iraq possesses biological weapons enough to annihilate the
population of Tel Aviv, capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that at the peak of America's
preparation to launch military actions against Iraq, Butler made
this kind of accusation in order to thwart the Russian special
envoy's mission in Baghdad and to give America additional pretext
to launch its aggression. (Iraq-Butler-Paper)

<HEADLINE> WHO Says No Human Case of Influenza A in Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) team have not found human case of influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection in Guangdong province in southern China, a WHO press
release said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This announcement came as a result of a WHO mission to the
province from January 16 to 22 and a few days before Hong Kong
resume importation of chickens from China.
</P>
<P>
But the the organization recommended that intensified levels of
surveillance for the virus be kept for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
"We were very impressed with the high quality of the
surveillance activities which had been implemented by the Chinese
government in December, 1997 and January, 1998." said Dr. Daniel
Lavanchy, who heads the WHO program on influenza surveillance and
was a member of the WHO team in China.
</P>
<P>
Lavanchy said the increased surveillance was being implemented
with the full support of local and central government.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "there is still the need to remain
vigilant, because if the H5N1 virus adapts to humans, it could
lead to the transmission of a highly virulent strain from person
to person".
</P>
<P>
The WHO team confirmed that the Guangdong Province Agriculture
Bureau had found no trace of H5N1 among the samples taken in the
annual routine surveillance for avian influenza in poultry breeder
and chicken farms since 1994. The bureau is planning to complement
routine surveillance with additional surveys in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will resume importation of chickens from China on
February 7, 1998. Requirements for this will include additional
inspection, and blood testing at chicken farms prior to export
with complementary testing for avian influenza upon arrival in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chickens will be segregated from live ducks and other water
fowls at all levels to minimize the risk of transmission of the
H5N1 virus from live ducks and other water fowls to live chickens.
</P>
<P>
WHO also stressed that there is no public health reason for
other countries to ban the importation of chicken and chicken
products from China, including Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> ESABO Condemns Burundi Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Eastern and Southern Africa
Business Organisation (ESABO) which met in Burundi this month
recommended the sanctions imposed on that country to be lifted
immediately to allow the resumption of normal business activities
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists on the outcome of their discussions,
Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce
Wonder Maisiri who is also ESABO member of the executive
committee today said the delegation from among others, Uganda,
Mauritius, Zambia and Zimbabwe intended to establish the effects
the sanctions have had on the investment and trade in Burundi in
particular, and trade in the region in general.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The business community also recommended to COMESA to
reconsider economic sanctions as a tool for scoring political
points."
</P>
<P>
The business delegation which met from January 13 to 16
established the economic sanctions had resulted in a drastic
reduction of the export earnings of the Republic of Burundi and
the extent that the economic development of the country was
seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions have resulted in the increased cost of
acquisition of goods and services and has condemned the majority
of the Burundi people to a level where they eke out a livelihood
below the poverty line," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that because of the imposition of the sanctions,
Burundi was not able to implement the program of tariff
reductions as envisaged by Common Market of Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
He stressed ESABO's aim was to promote business and trade
without boundaries, but such sanctions were counter-productive to
the economy of Burundi and the region as a whole.

MOGADISHU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The arrival of Somalia's two
major faction leaders Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto

Just a few hours later, the same radio again asked the people

Early Wednesday morning, people in the capital were awakened
by the loud noise of speakers mounted on Toyota pickups, urging
them to get up to receive Hussein Aidid and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of battle wagons with militiamen rushed to Km-50
airstrip in the morning as others hastened to cross the greenline
to Issaley airstrip controlled by Ali Mahdi Mohamed, 15 km north
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the delegations using Boeing airplanes have
landed at Ballidogle airport, 90 km southwest of the capital,
where they had planned to hire another small Cesna plane to reach
Km-50 airstrip. The large planes can not use any of the airstrips
of km-50 or Issaley.
</P>
<P>
At Ballidogle airport, Hussein Mohamed Aidid made a VHF radio
contact with Ali Mahdi Mohamed at Issaley airstrip to give his
excuses soon after landing. According to the report, Hussein
Aidid has apologized for the inconvenience. The political sides
are expected to meet on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people including traditional leaders, high level
religious scholars and local and international journalists who
had been waiting for the faction leaders to talk to them were
disappointed when they were told that nobody was to come there.
</P>
<P>
The tarmac road between Ballidogle and Mogadishu still remains
impassable since last December when floods from Shabelle river
crushed the road, making a hole of about 40 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid and his delegation took their journey to
Mogadishu via Terra in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of these delegations coincided with the last day
of the Holy month of Ramadan when the people are buying a lot of
food, sweets, clothes. The people of the capital are not only
anxious to receive the long awaited delegations, but to see the
Cairo agreement fulfilled with the return of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"We suffered because of their successive failures to reach a
comprehensive and lasting solution, but now we hope the faction
leaders will once and for all convert their agreement into
practice," said Abdulkkadir Yahye Ali, a Somali intellectual.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Iraq Must Be Stopped from Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Wednesday Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was a
"dictator" and must be stopped from building weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
"You've got a dictator who is prepared to abuse his power, to
launch war upon his neighbors, and if he isn't stopped -- and
stopped soon -- the effects will be worse for the whole of the
world in the long term," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. inspectors over the years had uncovered detailed
evidence that Iraq was constructing biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed that process carries on the whole time," Blair told the
parliament at question time.
</P>
<P>
Saddam had spent billions of dollars on weapons of destruction
and on the 45 presidential sites that he has declared off limits
to the inspectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will arrive at
London on Friday to discuss with Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on
the Iraqi crisis and a possible military strike against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Confidence Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A slump in business confidence
shown in the latest quarterly industrial trends survey by the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) eased the pressure for
rate rise next month.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 percent of manufacturers said they were less optimistic
over general business prospects. Just 13 percent were more
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs
committee, said the CBI believed there was no pressure to raise
interest rates because of the slowdown in economic growth and the
absence of inflationary pressures in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
That view was shared in the City, where analysts are watching
next week's meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) to see whether rates are lifted from their present
level of 7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Adam Cole of HSBC Holdings said: "Taken together with the
December retail sales data and the fourth-quarter GDP figures, the
survey suggests the MPC is likely to leave rates unchanged."
</P>
<P>
Despite the gloomy outlook, the CBI said it still expected the
economy to achieve a soft landing later this year rather than
enter recession.
</P>
<P>
CBI economists predicted that financial turmoil in Asia is
expected to have a further deflationary impact on Britain's
economy. it could cut growth this year by 0.3-0.4 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Makers Increase Earnings in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The "Big Three" U.S. auto
makers earned a collective 16.33 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, 25
percent more than in 1996, according to their reports released
this week.
</P>
<P>
They achieved this due to cost-cutting measures and vehicle
mix strategy.
</P>
<P>
With a 6.9 billion dollars income, 56 percent higher than in
1996, Ford's performance topped General Motor (GM) and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
Its revenue for 1997 surged 2.9 percent to 39.95 billion
dollars from 38.83 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
GM's profit was up 34 percent to a record 6.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 20 percent fall in its earnings, 1997 was Chysler's
third best year with 2.81 billion dollars fetched.
</P>
<P>
All the three saw their business boomed in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Ford managed to cut its costs by 3 billion dollars and
has aimed at reducing a further 1 billion dollars this year. GM
also saved 3.5 billion dollars in costs last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see 1998 as a tough year for auto makers in the
absence of immediate turnaround of a flat market in North America,
a persistent scene in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The Big Three are also facing challenges from Japan as its yen
devaluation helps Japanese cars to penetrate in U.S. market.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda's roads have become a
new killer claiming the lives of many people.
</P>
<P>
There has been a sharp increase in road accidents in the
country, officials from the Traffic Police noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 73 people perished in road accidents, while 225
others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of enough driving skills, reckless driving, poor
mechanical condition of vehicles, intoxication, as well as the
poor state of the road networks are major causes of accidents,"
said police in Butare, the country's second largest city with the
highest number of road accidents.
</P>
<P>
According to traffic police, communication equipment such as
the radar to monitor the speed, and well-trained staff are needed
to curb road accidents.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the accidents that claimed the lives of people in
Butare occurred during the end of the year holidays," officials
in Butare said.

BAGHDAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
Wednesday met with Viktor Posuvalyuk, envoy of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Posuvalyuk, who is Russia's deputy foreign
minister, delivered a letter to Saddam from Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The letter dealt with the on-going diplomatic efforts to find a
way of defusing the crisis over weapons inspection by the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Saddam praised the Russian efforts to solve the crisis, and its
understanding of Iraq's call for the lifting of the sanctions
imposed by the U.N. in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk reiterated Russia's position on rejecting the use
of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused to grant U.N. arms inspectors access to scores
of presidential palaces for reasons of national security and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened military strike to force
Iraq's compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Reiterates Stance on Missile Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia's ambassador to Cyprus,
Georgi Muratov, has reiterated his country's position that the
only way the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles will not be deployed on
the island is if Cyprus is demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here Wednesday, Muratov said that Russia
had confirmed to the Cypriot government during a recent visit to
Moscow by Finance Minister Christofoulos Christodoulou that the
relevant deal will be observed.
</P>
<P>
Muratov noted his country doest not believe the agreement to
deploy the missiles negatively affects the prospects of a
settlement to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that both Russia and Cyprus did not choose the
militarization of Cyprus and that there was ample time to find
ways for demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
Russia takes part in efforts for a Cyprus settlement and is
willing to cooperate closely with Britain and the U.S. toward this
end, the Russian diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government signed an agreement in January 1997 to
buy S-300 missiles from Russia, which will be delivered later this
year.
</P>
<P>
The deal was criticized by the U.S. and some other western
countries. Turkey had threatened to take preemptive measures if
the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> EU Imposes Heavy Fine on Volkswagen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
decided on Wednesday to impose a fine of 102 million ECU (112.2
million U.S. dollars) on German carmaker Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
The fine is the largest ever imposed by the executive body of
the European Union on a single company.
</P>
<P>
The German carmaker was fined for barring its Italian
distributor from selling Volkswagen cars to German and Austrian
residents who sought to take advantage of the price differences in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Karel van Miert, responsible for fair
competition, said that the size of the fine was decided upon the
duration and seriousness of the illegal practice by Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
What van Miert described as "systematic abuse" was aggravated
by the German company's ignorance of an earlier EU warning and by
its rescinding of contracts with its dealers, the commissioner
added.
</P>
<P>
Van Miert said that illegal practices such as Volkswagen's had
to be fined at least 50 million ECU.
</P>
<P>
The European Union modified its 1995 rules to allow dealers to
sell to individuals or companies acting on behalf on individuals
seeking to benefit from the price differentials in different EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tax prices for cars vary more than 30 percent within the EU
whose single market rules allow customers to buy their cars
wherever it is the cheapest and pay taxes in the country of
importation.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that Volkswagen had been conducting such
illegal practice from 1987 to 1997 and its abuse aggravated since
1993.
</P>
<P>
The commission raided some of Volkswagen's outlets after German
and Austrian residents complained that Volkswagen's Italian
distributor Autogerma had refused to sell them a Volkswagen car.
</P>
<P>
Written proofs were found including phrases warning Volkswagen
distributors not to tell foreign customers why they were not
allowed to buy or the distributors might run the risk of being
fined.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Frustrated by EU Ruling on Gold Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi expressed his frustration Wednesday about a European Union
ruling barring his country from using a one-time gain from a gold
transfer to help reduce budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
He said that EU's statistical arm Eurostat had said that each
member state should keep accounts according to national rules.
"And that was what we did and that is why I was frustrated."
</P>
<P>
No other member state did what Italy has done in the strife for
economic and monetary union (EMU) convergence, the prime minister
told a press conference after his meeting with European Commission
President Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission made the ruling on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government received 3.685 trillion lire (2.09
billion U.S. dollars) in tax on the gold transfer to the country's
central bank last year.
</P>
<P>
Italy wanted the revenue, amounting to 0.15 percent of its
gross domestic product, to help keep its budget deficit below the
3-percent mark as required by the Maastricht Treaty for EMU
convergence.
</P>
<P>
The mark is the upper limit for countries aspiring joining the
planned single currency to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, however, said that EU's ruling would not jeopardize
Italy's chance of joining in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
The statistical agency said that based on Italy's latest claim
of a 2.7-percent deficit, the ruling would raise the country's
deficit to 2.85 percent which is still below the 3-percent
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister said that his formal meeting with
Santer for the first time was to confirm his country's strategy in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether his efforts were convincing enough for
Germany that doubted Italy's ability to join the euro in the first
wave, the prime minister said: "My job was not to convince my
partner. My job was my job and was what I have done."

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Is Hardly to Affect EMU: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Union
official said on Wednesday that the current financial crisis in
Asia would hardly affect the process of EU's economic and monetary
union.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, commissioner in charge of economic,
monetary and financial affairs of the 15-nation union, told a
European Parliament hearing that the Asian crisis will not have an
impact on the process of the realization of the economic and
monetary union.
</P>
<P>
"The euro will be a reality on January 1, 1999, and the list of
countries participating in the single currency in the first wave
will be made on May 2 during the summit of EU heads of state and
government," said de Silguy.
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner admitted that the Asian financial crisis
would have a slight influence on the economic growth of the union
though the influence will be "technically" limited.
</P>
<P>
Only 2.2 percent of EU trade are to be directed to Asia in 1998
when the internal demand is on the rise and is expected to rise to
2.7 percent within EU that will help offset the decline in demands
in the weakening Asian market, said de Silguy.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also cited as his supporting argument that the
Asian crisis would hardly etch into the banking system in the EU.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the union is on high alert and will follow
closely the development in Asia.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer later said that
the only contribution EU can make to help stabilize the Asian
financial market was to continue as planned with its single
currency implementation.
</P>
<P>
"Of course the crisis in Asia will have an impact on Europe,"
said the commission president, "but how big an impact and in what
way it will affect Europe."
</P>
<P>
Santer said that he, like always, was confident that the euro
will be duly implemented and that will be EU's best contribution
toward stabilizing the Asian financial market.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A record 178,580 motor vehicles were
reported stolen in Canada in 1996, reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rate of vehicle theft in the country has increased for eight
consecutive years and has nearly doubled since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The increase in thefts across Canada has resulted in soaring
insurance costs for customers, who saw their premiums rise markedly.
</P>
<P>
In 1995-96, the theft of vehicles cost Canadian insurance
industry an estimated 420 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 70
million dollars from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that a large percentage of vehicles are stolen
by young people going on joy rides or using them to commit other crimes.
</P>
<P>
Yet, an increasing number of vehicles, most of them luxury cars
and sport utility vehicles, are stolen by organized criminal gangs
and exported around the world.

<HEADLINE> US Secretary of State to Visit Egypt Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will visit Egypt next week after wrapping up her visit to
European and Middle East countries, the Middle East News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright's tour comes at a critical time as the U.S. failed to
bridge the gap between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told the press Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright reportedly is scheduled to start a visit to Europe and
the Middle East on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Albright's visit to Cairo will be a good
opportunity for the discussion of several essential issues
pertaining to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Among the issues to be raised during Albright's visit to Cairo
would be the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace track and the
stalemate facing the peace process in general," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
during his recent visit here talked about U.S. ideas on promoting
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, Moussa said all American and
Israeli proposals were discussed.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that there is no defined American plan but there
are just a number of ideas," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his talks respectively with Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton
reportedly proposed that a step-by-step Israeli troop pullback in
the West Bank go hand in hand with Palestinian fulfillment of
Israel's security demands.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has reportedly rejected the plan and threatened to
resign if the U.S. pressures him to accept Israeli demands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa said that he will meet with British Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchette in Cairo next
Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> WTO Urges Japan to Intensify Deregulation, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) is not quite satisfied with what Japan has done in
deregulating its economy since 1995, saying that several sectors
are still under restrictive regulations.
</P>
<P>
The WTO Trade Policy Review Body met here on January 27-28 to
assess Japan's trade policies and practices during the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
In a report published today, WTO pointed out that there have
been no major changes in Japan's tariff structure since the last
trade policy review in April 1995. The simple average rate was 9.4
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
High tariff peaks occur in agriculture, food manufacturing,
textiles and footwear, and substantial tariff escalation occurs in
a number of sectors, mainly between semi-processed and
fully-processed items, particularly in food manufacturing and
petroleum refining, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report stated that Japan's economy has not improved since
1995. Various packages of fiscal and monetary stimulus during 1995
sustained moderate economic growth, but led to a worsening of
public finances.
</P>
<P>
Since the second quarter of 1997, the report said, there has
been a downturn in the domestic economy, with export demand the
only significant source of growth.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Japan's financial sector has been
severely affected both by internal structural problems, with the
collapse of a major bank, a major securities company and emergency
mergers of some banking firms, and by the economic crisis since
mid-1997 in other Asian economies, particularly Thailand and Korea
which are substantial recipients of Japanese investment.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Japanese government announced a new series
of proposed measures aimed at reducing regulatory barriers to
business and stabilizing financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Deregulation and structural reform are the main themes of
Japan's current trade and investment-related measures. While
taking bold steps in domestic reforms, the Japanese government has
been aware of the benefits that it has enjoyed under the
multilateral trading system, and the responsibility it has in its
maintenance and strengthening.
</P>
<P>
Japan reconfirmed its long-standing commitment to maintain and
strengthen a multilateral free trade system in close cooperation
with other WTO members and within other frameworks such as the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) and the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM), and reiterated its readiness to strive for active
and continued leadership in further liberalization of trade and
investment in the next decade.

<HEADLINE> Israel Keeps Wary Eye on Iraqi Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said Wednesday Israel is keeping a wary eye on
the Iraqi situation, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Knesset (parliament) members, Mordechai
expressed hope that any military confrontation between the United
States and Iraq will not affect Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, Iraq fired more than 40 Scud
missiles at Israel. Israel deferred to U.S. pressure not to bomb
Iraq in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai indicated that Israel is keeping a low profile to the
current crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Israel is also ready to take whatever
measures necessary according to developments.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reportedly has set up a special unit to conceal
biological weapons from the United Nations arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, said on
Tuesday that Iraq has enough biological weapons to destroy the
residents of Tel Aviv, capital of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Raps Greece over Territorial Waters Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish official said here
Wednesday that Greece's unilateral increase of territorial waters
from six to 12 miles will mean a violation of the mutual promises
spelled out by the Madrid Accord.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press conference, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Necati Utkan rejected a statement made by Greek Foreign
Ministry spokesman that international law had given them the right
to increase their territorial waters to 12 miles.
</P>
<P>
"Greece does not have the right to increase its territorial
waters more than six miles, " Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece has to act in a responsible way and should
avoid increasing its waters more than six miles.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
that Turkey rejected a Greek protest over alleged violation of
Greece's air space by Turkish planes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over several issues,
including the limits of airspace, rights of sea-bed mineral
resources as well as the protracted Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Former White House Intern Still Awaiting Prosecutor Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky hasn't yet heard from independent counsel Kenneth
Starr about whether he will protect her from prosecution in return
for testimony against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's attorney, William Ginsburg, appearing on CNN today,
said, "We have had absolutely no word whatsoever in the last 24
hours from the office of the independent counsel."
</P>
<P>
"Patience is the hallmark of negotiations.... We are expecting
a call but we have not had one yet," Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a grant of immunity from prosecution, Lewinsky
has offered to testify regarding alleged sexual relations with
Clinton. Clinton has repeatedly denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg told CNN she might undergo polygraph or psychological
exams as "good practice" to ensure she is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky reportedly told a friend in secretly recorded
conversations that she had sex with Clinton and that he urged her
to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
"If indeed Judge Starr wants her to corroborate the truth or
falsity of what's on those tapes," the attorney stated pointedly,
"he can really only do it with Monica Lewinsky."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Starr's office continued presenting evidence to a
federal grand jury, before which former White House chief of staff
Leon Panetta, Lewinsky's one-time boss, appeared today.
</P>
<P>
In another development, for a second day Hillary Rodham Clinton
took to the morning television talk shows to defend her husband,
asserting, "I can say unequivocally these are false allegations."
</P>
<P>
She also signaled a new silence on the subject from the White
House, telling ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" that while there is
an investigation going on, "nobody can expect the president to
speak."
</P>
<P>
Overnight polls taken after Clinton's State of the Union
address, meanwhile, appeared to have swayed public opinion in his
favor. NBC and ABC both released survey results showing that,
among Americans who watched the speech, fewer people believed the
president had the affair with Lewinsky than did before the speech.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends High Officials Abroad on Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday launched what is called the last diplomatic mission for
strong response to Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors
to carry out their work of finding out weapons of mass destruction
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Department announced that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will leave for Europe and the Middle East later
on Wednesday to confer U.S. allies and Russia on any possible
action other than diplomacy to force Iraq into abiding by U.N.
resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of her trip will be to discuss with allies and
U.N. Security council member states a strong international
response to Iraq's continued defiance of U.N. Security Council
resolution," State Department spokesman James Rubin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Albright will first meet French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
in Paris on Thursday, then travel to Madrid to meet Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Friday and to Britain for
talks with Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After her European trip, Albright will then go to the Middle
East to visit Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, and will be back to Washington on Feb.
3, Rubin said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright will explain U.S. views on how to proceed to
ensure Iraqi compliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States believes it has been exhausting diplomatic
effort and a next step stronger than that should be taken into
consideration..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill
Richardson will travel later this week to capitals of other U.N.
Security member states to drum up international support.
</P>
<P>
Richardson will lead a delegation to Sweden, Switzerland,
Portugal, Kenya, Gabon, Gambia, Brazil and Costa Rice, as well as
meeting the prime minister of Slovenia in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said on Monday that time was running out
for a diplomatic solution and it might resort to military force to
make Iraq comply. It argued that it is authorized by U.N.
resolutions to take unilateral action against Iraq without the
need to go to the Security Council for another resolution -- which
it would almost certainly not get.
</P>
<P>
Among U.N. Security Council permanent member states, only
Britain expressed full support to the United States for its
possible military action and has sent its aircraft carrier the
Independent to the Gulf to assist the U.S. forces already there
for a potential strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But Russia and France are opposed to the use of force, and both
foreign minister, Russia's Yevgeny Primakov and France's Hubert
Vedrine said in Paris when they met on Wednesday that they favored
diplomatic means. And Vedrine stressed that force was "not
desirable in the current situation."
</P>
<P>
Gulf Arab states are also less than enthusiastic about the use
of air strikes, fearing any explicit support for the American
military attack might lead to a backlash in their own countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Seek Arbitration on U.S. Military Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq expressed readiness
Wednesday that it will turn to the International Court of Justice
to lodge a complaint against U.S. military threats and seek
arbitration and advice from the international body.
</P>
<P>
The United States intends to divert international attention
from the real work of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in Iraq, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The American military threat against Iraq is a unilateral
work, unilateral position, (which) has nothing to do with the
(U.N.) Security Council resolutions," said al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military threat is "legally baseless" and "has no
foundation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He described as outrageous the statements to the New York Times
by Richard Butler, chairman of UNSCOM in charge of eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Butler told the paper on Tuesday that Iraq has enough
biological weapons to annihilate Tel Aviv, capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Butler is not a neutral expert and he is blindly committing
deadly mistakes to his honesty, and to his neutrality, and to
professionalism of his job as a U.N. man," Al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
He said he has sent a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to protest against Butler's discreet remarks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the meeting between Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and Russian envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk, al-Sahhaf said
several ideas were discussed but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
"This is a process, a continuation of the close contacts"
between the two countries, he said, adding that Iraq will
cooperate with Russia in the framework of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq is closely watching the contacts and deliberations
among the U.S., Russia, France and Britain, which he emphasized
should be carried out within the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Progress In Sino-African Relations (2) by Liu Yunfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited six African countries in
May 1996 and proposed the development of long-term stable
Sino-African relations geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's proposals were widely accepted by African countries and
their people.
</P>
<P>
For example, China and Niger resumed diplomatic relations three
months after Jiang's African tour.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng visited seven African nations in May
1997.
</P>
<P>
The two visits pointed to the fact that China attaches great
importance to Africa and highly values the traditional
Sino-African friendship. They also indicated that China is fully
prepared to advance political relations with African countries,
and at the same time expanding economic and trade cooperation, and
seeking common development.
</P>
<P>
In a May 1997 meeting with China's Ambassador to Zimbabwe,
Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the Organization of
African Unity, said that Africa and China enjoy a deep friendship,
and noted that the latter attaches no conditions when providing
support.
</P>
<P>
He said the visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier
Li Peng signaled growth in Sino-African relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Morocco early this month, Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen noted that excellent prospects exist
for the development of relations between China, the largest
developing country, and Africa, the world's largest developing
continent.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of diplomatic relations between China and
Central Africa serves as yet another example of the continuing
steady development of relations between China and Africa.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Know US Attack on Iraq in Advance: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to get 24-hour
advance notice from the United States before Washington carries
out military strike against Iraq, Israel Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the U.S. have been holding close consultations
recently over the current crisis between Iraq and the U.S. over
the United Nations weapon inspection mission.
</P>
<P>
As the possibility of a U.S. military strike against Iraq
looms, Israel is closely monitoring the situation in order to
prepare for a possible retaliatory attack by Baghdad. On
Wednesday, Israeli inner Cabinet held a meeting to discuss the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At present, the assessments in both Washington and Israel are
the same: there is low possibility of missile attacks by Iraq
against Israel since Iraq's attacking capability has been greatly
reduced. In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq launched dozens of Scud
missiles against Tel Aviv, causing no deaths but some property
damages.
</P>
<P>
So far, Israeli officials have assured the public not to be
panic about the U.S.-Iraq military standoff and to continue life
as normal. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told the nation
Wednesday that at this stage no special steps are needed to be
taken since the possibility of being attacked by Iraq is low.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Israel has begun taking precautions to get
prepared for all eventualities. Israeli Home Command has advised
the public to check their gas masks and exchange the old masks
for new ones so to guard against possible biological or chemical
attacks. Since the weapon crisis surfaced last month, Israel has
been requiring citizens to update their masks.
</P>
<P>
Gabi Barabash, director-general of Health Ministry, said Israel
has all the necessary medical responses to the weapons in Iraqi
arsenal. He added that Israel would be ready for any Iraqi attack
as preparations could be ready within days.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China and the Central African
Republic restored diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level
today as Chinese people celebrate the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The event indicates new progress in Sino-African relations
early in the Chinese New Year, and in the wake of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South
Africa on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking Chinese Foreign Ministry official in charge of
African Affairs told Xinhua that the restoration of diplomatic
relations between the two countries signals the willingness of
African nations to develop relations with China. He also noted
China's growing role in the international arena and the further
development of Sino-African ties over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that an increasing number of African
nations have realized that the real intention of Taiwan
authorities is to split the motherland by engaging in "elastic and
pragmatic diplomacy".
</P>
<P>
The restoration of diplomatic relations between China and
Central Africa serves as proof that "elastic and pragmatic"
diplomacy practiced by Taiwan authorities will go nowhere.

<HEADLINE> Rotation of Duties for Euro Central Bankers Likely to Occur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The top two candidates for the
chief of the first European Central Bank (ECB) have made a
compromise deal which would see a rotation of duties, the German
newspaper Handelsblatt said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted unnamed German government sources as
saying that Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch head of the European
Monetary Institute, and Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank
of France, had apparently reached a "gentlemen's deal" to split
equally the eight-year term for the post.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Duisenberg, 63, would serve as the first
ECB chief for the first four years and then give up the post to
Trichet, 55, for the second half of the term.
</P>
<P>
As evidence for the alleged deal, the newspaper said that
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel had praised both Duisenberg
and Trichet recently as "recognized defenders of the stability
policy."
</P>
<P>
But Waigel declined to make any comment on the reported
compromise, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The ECB will be established this year to run the single
European currency, the euro, which is due to be launched on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the appointment of the ECB chief was ignited
last November when the French government surprisingly announced
that it wanted French central banker Trichet to take the job.
</P>
<P>
However, most other European Union countries, including
Germany, expected Duisenberg to take the post.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Hopes No War to Break Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 29 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
expressed hope Thursday that no war would break out, but Iraq
would fight any aggression if forced, the Iraqi News Agency INA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Saddam made the remarks when receiving well-wishers of the
National Command of the Arab Baath Socialist Party (ABSP),
Revolution Command Council, Iraq's ABSP command and government
ministers on the Festival of Fast-breaking.
</P>
<P>
He warned that should those evil-driven enemies commit an
aggression against Iraq, Iraq would have no other option but
to fight with all potentials, experience, faith and motivation
at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
"Had the aggressors made the mistake of attacking Iraq,
sons of the nation and friends would find people fulfilling
its national and patriotic tasks up to awe-inspiring levels, out
of unshakable faith in Almighty God that victory would be the
share of the true believers", said Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that in modern history conceptions and
those of life, there is no more blasphemy than the unjustifiable
shedding of people's blood, adding it is an aggression against
Humanity and the will of god.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has proposed to freeze discussions or actions regarding
U.N. arms inspectors' access to presidential sites until results
of the forthcoming technical evaluation meetings come out in
April.
</P>
<P>
The United States is firmly opposed to the Iraqi proposal and
warned of military actions to force Iraq into full compliance
with the Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said that American officials did not have to launch
such aggression. "As far as America's national interests are
concerned, they have no legitimate excuse for crossing thousands
of kilometers to attack Iraq", he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Launches Anti-malnutrition Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Department of
Health on Thursday launched a 9-million-US-dollar three-year
program to reduce moderate and severe malnutrition in the country
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Protein Energy Malnutrition Prevention and Control Program
involves the provision of food supplementation to an estimated two
million malnourished children, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The program was conceived after a 1995 survey among the
country's major cities revealed that 43.8 percent of Filipino
children were suffering from varying degrees of malnutrition.
About 16.6 percent of the children were moderately and severely
underweight.
</P>
<P>
The survey further revealed that the urban poor in large cities
are at greatest health and nutrition risks partly because of poor,
overcrowding and difficult access to health and nutrition
services.
</P>
<P>
The program will also provide training and continuing education
to all health personnel and community nutrition workers and
implement an income-generating project in each community.
</P>
<P>
A nutrition scholar will be assigned in at least 250 households
to ensure the success of the program.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Complain about UAE's Ban on Their Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Many Somalis are now facing
their harshest economical crises following the recent ban on the
country's meat exports to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
In the capital alone, more than 4,000 people have lost their
jobs as livestock exportation, one of Somalia's large revenue
making business, seems to have come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
The meat of between 8 and 10 thousand heads of slaughtered
goats are air-freighted each week to the Gulf countries mainly to
the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The ban on the meat will also
affect the markets, devaluating the Somali Shillings as against
international hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
"Livestock and banana exports bring about significant amount
of hard currency to Somalia to challenge the United States Dollar
in our markets," said Ismail Abdullahi Siad Goni, a famous
business dealer in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to Goni, chairman of Dayah company which is one of
the eight meat exporting companies in the capital, the ban on
Somalia's meat is more propaganda than a reality.
</P>
<P>
"The aim behind the ban is just to hide the reality of high
quality Somali fresh meat and to give chance to the meat from
Australia, India, Iran and Syria," he said, adding
"Unfortunately, our meat lacks political package required since
we have no government in the past seven years."
</P>
<P>
Goni described the UAE ban on Somalia's meat as biased and
called for an independent veterinarian committee to investigate
the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Historically, our livestock is one of the healthiest in the
world," claimed Goni who also asked if the UAE could prove the
sickness they spoke about.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slaughtered meat ban, Dayah company still
maintains exporting live goats to the UAE, "They now check them
and they never find anything wrong with our animals," said Goni,
adding "those live ones and the others are from the same herd."
</P>
<P>
A group of local vets went to the regions of Middle and Lower
Shabelle, Middle Jubba and Bay to investigate the alleged Rift
Valley Disease in those regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Ahmed Ali Farah Deed, one of the vets who visited
those regions, the livestock there are mainly suffering from
effects of the floods.
</P>
<P>
"Medically, we can't declare the existence of this sickness,"
said Deed who also called for an international investigative team
to see into the matter.
</P>
<P>
Yussuf Hassan Eyow, governor of Somalia's central region of
Galgudud, has also denied the existence of the Rift Valley Fever.
</P>
<P>
"Only the people are badly affected by severe cerebral
malaria," said Eyow, adding that the livestock in the central
regions are at their best times and healthy.
</P>
<P>
Dr Deed said it's really unfortunate that this ban is
coinciding with the annual time table when Somalia gets ready for
exporting the largest number of livestock to the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Another group of vets have also left for the central regions
Thursday to ascertain the alleged sickness which equally hits the
livestock and humans. The team is expected to bring about a
written report over the animal health condition in Mudug,
Galgudud and Hiran regions.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls on UN to Consider Replacing Butler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 29 (Xinhua)-- Iraq has called on the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to consider whether Richard Butler
should continue with his job as chairman of U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarmament in Iraq, the Iraqi news
agency INA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official spokesman said that Butler is not fit
for the job, and accused him of trying hard to strain the
relationship between Iraq on one side and UNSCOM and the
Security Council on the other to justify (U.S. President)
Clinton's possible Aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"He (Butler) has based his dubious role in providing excuse
for an American-Zionist aggression", said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on Butler's statements at a recent
meeting with heads of American and Jewish organizations in which
he repeated the accusation that Iraq owns enough missiles and
chemical weapons to annihilate Tel Aviv of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said the parties dominating UNSCOM had
close links not only with foreign quarters and CIA (Central
Intelligent Agency), but also with Mossad (Israeli intelligence
agency).
</P>
<P>
"The past few months have proved beyond doubt that Butler has
not been acting as a neutral U.N. official when dealing with
Iraq. Sometimes, he even seemed to have been coordinating efforts
with American CIA and State Department", said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Continue Mediating Peace in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will continue to
mediate the Cambodian crisis until the country achieves peace,
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said here today.
</P>
<P>
If the Cambodian conflicting parties accept the Thai government
as a "helpful" mediator, Thailand will continue its mediating role
in helping bring about an end to the conflict, Surin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Surin made the remarks after meeting with Ranariddh who is
currently residing in Bangkok. The prince was ousted last July by
troops loyal to Cambodian Second Premier Hun Sen, who accused the
prince of alleged acts of terrorism and smuggling of illegal
weapons into Cambodia, but Ranariddh has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The past several months have seen sporadic fighting between Hun
Sen's men and troops led by Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also told reporters after the meeting that Thailand
could play an important role in brokering the conflict. He pledged
to cooperate with Thailand in securing a ceasefire and resolving
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai is expected to meet Ranariddh
next week to discuss the Cambodian issue, Surin said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines make up the ASEAN
three-nation mediating committee set up to broker the Cambodian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to restore peace in Cambodia are at a deadlock. There
seems to be no peace-broker currently acceptable to both parties.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said earlier that his troops defending the last
royalist stronghold at O'samech were willing to enter into a
ceasefire unilaterally declared by Hun Sen
</P>
<P>
The mediating committee has been seeking Ranariddh's opinion on
the latest ceasefire. Ranariddh's statement was viewed as a
positive development that enhanced peace efforts.

HANGZHOU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yi, a businessman in
Hangzhou city in east China, departed from the city with his
family for a trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand on the first
day of the Spring Festival holidays, immediately after his return
from a business trip to Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
This year's Spring Festival has witnessed an unprecedented tour
boom in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province. An increasing
number of local residents have opted to travel rather than staying
at home for a traditional family reunion.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, China's southernmost island province, is the first
choice of Hangzhou residents seeking warm weather. Other choices
include Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia as well as
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Rising income has prompted the residents to expand their access
to sources of information, with beepers and mobile phones
remaining the hot consumer items. Many Hangzhou residents have
exhibited great enthusiasm for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lei, an employee in a trade company in Zhejiang,
used his annual bonus to apply for Internet services. Zhang said
he would send New Year's greetings to his friends across the country
via E-mail.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Internet will provide him with greater
access to wide-ranging sources of information.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of department stores, shops and
supermarkets is providing the Hangzhou residents with greater
options on where to purchase inexpensive, quality products.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are benefitting from intense competition, which has
forced some department stores to offer discounts.
</P>
<P>
The new vogue amongst the Hangzhou residents centers on the
aqusition of knowledge, with many people flocking to bookstores
and libraries over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou Xinhua Bookstore has opened special counters to
meet the demand for books the residents are presenting as New
Year's gifts. The store's business volume has doubled over the

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the United
States was ready to act alone if necessary to punish Iraq for its
efforts to develop chemical and biological weapons. Though she
reiterated the warning that President Clinton delivered on
Tuesday, White House and Pentagon officials sought to stamp out
expectations that a strike against Iraq was imminent or inevitable.
</P>
<P>
-- Top American intelligence officials testified that while the
world bristles with weapons, the United States is relatively
secure from the threat of war. In testimony before a Senate
committee, the experts warned, however, that potential threats
still come from the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton took his offensive to shift attention from
the scandal that grips his presidency to the heartland Wednesday
with a pair of campaign-style appearances promoting his State of
the Union agenda of reforming social security and improving
schools.
</P>
<P>
-- Analysts in Syria say President Hafez Assad thinks that he
cannot implement painful economic reforms without a peace
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The White House may cite executive privilege to shield
scandal discussions. The strategy is being considered to block
Whitewater prosecutor Starr from access to internal meetings to
plan the president's defense against allegations he had sex with a
former intern.
</P>
<P>
-- Aides to Arafat say the Palestinian leader is threatening to
quit if the U.S. forces him to accept an Israeli offer for a West
Ban pullout that he considers highly inadequate. Arafat's threat
may be just a bargaining tool in discussions he and Netanyahu are
scheduled to hold with Albright next week.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Market Value Turnover Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The total value turnover in the
Philippine stock market fell 12.4 percent to 586.2 billion pesos
(14.3 billion U.S. dollars) from the 1996 level due to the
regional financial crisis, the Philippine Stock Exchange said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Value turnovers at the local bourse plunged in late 1997 due to
uncalled financial pressures from the prolonged currency crisis
sweeping Southeast Asian countries, the PSE said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The PSE said that the total volume turnover dropped by 15.4
percent to 1,924 billion shares last year as the currency crisis
caused the shift of equities investments from the country to other
more stable markets around the region.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the volume of peso traded was slightly lower than
the 1996 total.
</P>
<P>
The PSE report showed that despite the serious impacts
experienced by the market last year, its value turnover did not
suffer much as compared to other Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the drop in the value turnover was traced to
the Property Sector which slashed 20 percent of its 1996 total to
cap 1997 with a value turnover of 125.4 billion pesos (3.1 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The commercial-industrial sector, which reeled off from poor
corporate performance, stayed on the sideline, with its volume
turnover closing 1997 with only 310.67 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, both the oil sector and the banks and
services sector registered less volume and value turnovers in 1997
than those of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of all the sectors, however, mining did a remarkable
performance after it registered 178-percent increase in value
turnover which was triggered by positive speculations from market
players and investors.
</P>
<P>
As a result, volume turnover of the mining sector grew by 121
percent to reach 506 billion shares valued at 22.5 billion pesos
(5.5 billion dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief to Discuss Iraqi-U.N. Crisis With Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel Meguid will meet with United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan on means to avoid possible military strikes
against Iraq on February 12.
</P>
<P>
The talks, to be held at the AL headquarters here, will also
deal with the latest developments of the Middle East peace process
and efforts exerted to push it forward as well as the Libya-West
crisis and new Arab proposals to ease the sufferings of the Libyan
people.
</P>
<P>
The present standoff between Iraq and the U.N. Special
Commission on scrapping weapons of mass destruction is expected to
dominate Annan's visit to Egypt, which is his first since he took
the post at the world organization a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid will stress the importance of the diplomatic
solution to the Iraqi crisis and the gravity of resorting to
military force to settle it as the military option will
complicate the situation, said MENA.
</P>
<P>
As the crisis between Iraq and the U.N. over its weapons
inspection escalating, the United States has threatened to use
military action, allegedly to stop Iraq from building a biological
and chemical arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader will also reiterate during his meeting with Annan
the gravity of the Israeli intransigence and the Israeli
government's practices that run contrary to the U.N. principles
and resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Annan, during his three-day visit here, will also meet with
President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the
peacemaking in the Middle East and the implementation of the
U.N. resolutions on the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Egypt will be part of a Mideast tour, which will
also take him to Syria, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan, working with the U.N. for 30 years, replaced Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to become U.N. chief on January 1, 1997.

the construction site for the Yellow River Xiaolangdi
Multi-Purpose Water Control Project in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 workers poured concrete carried to towers by two large

SHIJIAZHUANG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Victims of the Januray 10
earthquake, which killed 50 people and injured thousands of others
in north China's Hebei province, are busy reconstructing their
homes during the Spring Festival holidays.
</P>
<P>
"The primary concern of the victims is to rebuild their homes,
rather than joining in festive greetings and enjoying fireworks,"
said a farmer at Xingjialiang village in the quake-devastated
Zhangbei County.

Some 30 members of the village committee gathered on Wednesday
morning to discuss reconstruction efforts. All villagers are now
enjoying the warmth provided by temporary shelters, according to
Li Youzheng, chairman of the village committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said they plan to build a new village near the old one
which was ruined by the quake. He noted that the new village will
be closer to a river and a highway.

ZHENGZHOU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Henan, China's most populous
province, has clamped down heavily on illegal blood collections in
recent years, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Provincial authorities have reorganized some 200 blood
collection centers and have closed an additional 100 facilities
which failed to fulfill standards.
</P>
<P>
In addition, public security departments have closed 13

The Provincial Department of Health has allocated 13 million
yuan (1.56 million US dollars) over the past two years to fund 21
blood collection centers operating in line with provincial
regulations. Local health departments have trained 244,045 workers
and have established a databank for blood donors.
</P>
<P>
The Henan People's Congress has also adopted regulations
governing blood collection.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Shaanxi Province,
northwest China, have begun to show interest in building water
conservation projects at a time when they have become relatively
better-off.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, farmers in Weinan city, for
instance, spent 236 million yuan on 20,856 water conservation
projects to improve irrigation of 176,000 ha of farmland and
provide drinking water for 110,000 people. The projects are said
to bring 250 million yuan in profit every year.
</P>
<P>
The local government put in two billion yuan to build water
conservation facilities in the past 40 years, making it possible
to irrigate 60 percent of the total farmland.
</P>
<P>
However, existing water facilities no longer met the demand of
rapid agricultural development. Some better-off farmers took the
chance to invest in this field.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1996, 24,700 rural families in the province
participated in the effort by increasing investments by 100
million yuan. The local government also adopted favorable policies
to encourage them.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Shen Zhicheng built a water diversion project and earns
annually more than one million yuan. He provides water for fruit
growers at 0.75 yuan per cubic meter, compared with seven yuan
when they had to carry water by carts from far away.

CHONGQING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing municipality in
southwest China recorded sound economic growth in 1997, with major
economic indicators surging above the national growth level.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, which was separated from Sichuan Province last March
to become China's fourth municipality directly under the central
government administration, is expected to score an annual GDP
worth 137.5 billion yuan (16.566 billion US dollars) in 1997, a

<P>
With a total population of 30.02 million, of which over 24
million are rural people, Chongqing is believed to be the world's
largest municipality.
</P>

enjoyed by regions of different sorts. The municipality itself has
also come out with a series of new policies and regulations.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the municipality accomplished fixed-asset
investment of 39 billion yuan in the first year of its founding,

<HEADLINE> Priests' Lives Threatened by Junta Supporters in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- At least six Catholic priests
in Sierra Leone said Thursday that they had received anonymous
telephone calls "threatening their lives."
</P>
<P>
"The calls were made to about four churches in the capital up
to Wednesday evening," a senior member of the Catholic Pastoral
Council told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The calls are persistent and many times agonizing. They were
made just about the time we are retiring to sleep," said Father
John Wilson, one of the priests.
</P>
<P>
The calls have so worried the clergies that they wrote about
them in Lithurgy News Bulletin calling on their parishioners "to
continue to pray for them."
</P>
<P>
A Church spokesman said priests have repeatedly condemned the
May 25 coup and called for "genuine peace to be restored in
Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
"The calls must be from junta supporters who are against the
democratic stands adopted by the priests," he added.
</P>
<P>
"A church is not a political venue but purposely built to
worship God," the spokesman concluded.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Inter-Religious Council of
Sierra Leone (IRCSL) Thursday criticised the junta for what it
said "is the slow progress made so far in the implementation of
the Conakry Peace Plan " signed in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Llowlyn Rogers Nirght, chairman of the Organisation, said to
the press that "the spirit of all Sierra Leoneans has been
seriously dampened by events and utterances since the peace plan
was signed" in neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
"All key players should demonstrate sincerity of purpose to
ensure the realisation of the plan by April 22," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Conakry Peace Agreement gave the junta up to that date to
hand over power to the toppled civilian government and restore
constitutional rule in the war-torn state.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Helps Laid-Off Workers Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest
industrial city in China, has made notable achievements in tackling
unemployment over the past few years, according to local
government sources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.3 million people have been laid off by state-owned
enterprises in the city in recent years along with the deepening
of economic reforms and restructuring of local industries.
</P>
<P>
However, 1.1 million of the laid-offs have found new jobs,
thanks to the reemployment programs launched by the local
government.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, there were only 200,000 laid-off workers
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Behind these figures, people are hard to tell about the great
efforts made by the city government in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the issue, the Shanghai Municipal Re-Employment
Project Leading Group was set up in 1996, which is headed by two
deputy mayors.
</P>
<P>
Re-employment centers, set up by local governments at various
levels, are playing a crucial role in assisting the laid-offs from
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, most laid-offs came from the textile,
metallurgical and other traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
The laid-offs would be put under the temporary control of these
centers, where they would get financial assistance. Afterwards,
they would receive professional training so as to be capable of
doing a new job.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has pushed forward the development of the
local labor market and built up an information network on the
market. Nowadays, people can get information about the market by
watching television programs as the city's 437 job agencies have
been on line with local television stations.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the city has set up an army of full-time directors
on employment who help the laid-offs with a single skill or
poor education background to find a new job as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, some 10,000 laid-offs were trained gratis by the
directors, while in 1998, the figures is expected to go up to
100,000.
</P>
<P>
Due to the achievements in tackling the re-employment of factory
laid-offs, Shanghai has developed steadily, enjoying a social
stability and healthy economic development.

NANJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Green food industry has
developed rapidly in east China's Jiangsu province over the recent
few years, now with a yearly output of 484,000 tons and an annual
sales of 440 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has made hard efforts to develop the industry so
as to meet the growing demands for environment-friendly food
domestically and internationally. Green food has been termed as
the "leading food" for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
All the green food, including grain, edible food, animals and
birds, eggs, milk, vegetable, fruits, alcoholic drinks and soft
drinks, are produced under the best ecological environment, strict
quality control and a unified management.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has set up a number of green food production bases,
using non-polluting chemicals and fertilizers as well as employing
qualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
A green food quality control network has been formed in the
province to supervise the environment in the bases and help
certify green food products.
</P>
<P>
The provincial green food office has set up its branches in six
cities, 18 counties, 14 state-owned farms and over 30 food
factories.
</P>
<P>
Several local universities, including Nanjing University and
Nanjing Agricultural University, have been involved in providing
technical assistance to the industry.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities have also set up the Jinling Green
Food Catering Center to specialize in marketing for the
products.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Former First Lady Convicted of Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the
Philippines sentenced Thursday former first lady Imelda Marcos to
12 years imprisonment as it affirmed a graft court decision in
1993 convicting her of graft and corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
The high court ordered the widow of the late ousted strongman
Ferdinand Marcos, now a congresswoman, and former transportation
head Jose Dans, to pay 189.4 million pesos (4.5 million US
dollars) to the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA).
</P>
<P>
In a 30-page decision, the high tribunal held that Mrs. Marcos'
execution of a lease contract in behalf of the LRT in 1993 when
she was then its chairperson and Dans the vice chairman, was
prejudicial to the said agency.
</P>
<P>
The contract, the ruling said, involved the irregular transfer
of profits to Marcos' other project at the government-run
Philippine General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
In the lease agreement, the LRTA had agreed to lease its lot to
the hospital for a monthly rental price of 102,760 pesos (2,447
dollars), however, barely 10 days after the contract was signed,
the property was sub-leased by the hospital to another private
entity for 730,000 pesos (17,381 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The high court said "because of this deal, the government was
thereby deprived of at least an additional half a million pesos
per month."
</P>
<P>
In another development, presidential legal counsel Rene
Cayetano asked for the automatic transfer of the Marcos' 15
million dollar Swiss assets, following the former first lady's
criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
Cayetano said such conviction by a Philippine court is one of
the requisites given by a Swiss court for the transfer of Marcos'
bank deposits in Switzerland to the Philippine government.

GUANGZHOU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's privately-run
high-tech enterprises have been doing well over the past few
years, according to a recent meeting held here in this regard.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had 50,000 private scientific and
technological businesses, involving two million employees, and
produced more than 300 billion yuan in output value.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders attributed the rapid development to
independent funding, management, and being responsible for their
own profits and losses.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprise groups are emerging and have begun to
participate in international competition. The Sanzhu Industrial
Group, the Legend Group, and the Beijing University Founder Group
are typical examples of the kind, each of which has several
billion yuan in annual sales volume.
</P>
<P>
The laser phototyping systems in Chinese manufactured by the
Founder Group have won more than 80 percent of the world market
shares. And some other groups are also doing well in world market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the private high-tech sector contributed 5.26 billion

<P>
Shandong is home to 25 specialized chemical enterprises with
annual turnover of over 100 million yuan each. Said enterprises
account for 70 percent of Shandong's total chemical sales value.
</P>
<P>
Fei noted that the province is striving to form large
conglomerates in the sector. Plans through the end of the century
call for the establishment of a major chemical enterprise group

NEW DELHI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian Union Cabinet
Secretary T. S. R. Subramanian said Thursday that there was need
to diversify Indian garment exports, which have all along been
cotton oriented.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the India International Garment Fair here, he said
that the time has come to diversify into cotton blended garments
using polyester to face the competition from other exporting
countries.
</P>
<P>
Processing was another area which needed to be addressed, he
said adding that the garment industry should also endeavor to tap
the vast domestic market by standardizing products and modernizing
the industry.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the devaluation of the country's currency issue, he
said that devaluation was not the panacea for all the problems
facing exporters and such a measure would on the contrary lead to
an inflationary trend, complicating the situation. There was no
need to fear the contagious effect of the currency crisis that has
hit Southeast Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of vehicles on
Indian roads has almost trebled in the past ten years adding to
the growing menace of air pollution, said a study report here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of registered motor vehicles in the country
has increased from 11 million in 1986 to more than 30 million in
1995, of which about 35 percent is concentrated in 23 metropolitan
cities.
</P>
<P>
The steep rise in the vehicular traffic would only add to the
already high levels of automobile exhausts in the environment, the
report warned.
</P>
<P>
The principal vehicular pollutants are carbon monoxide, oxides
of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, suspended and particulate matters, a
varying amount of sulphur dioxide and lead compounds.

<P>
CAIRO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will take part in a summit
meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on the
prevention and settlement of disputes in Africa to be held in
Harare on February 11-12.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Foreign Minister Mohamed Shabaan will lead Egypt's
delegation to the summit, the Middle East News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The summit will discuss Egypt's reconciliation efforts among
various Somali factions that led to the signing of Cairo
Declaration last month, Shabaan told MENA.
</P>
<P>
After months of Egyptian brokerage, warring Somali factions
signed an agreement in Cairo on December 22 to end conflicts and
form a federal government in country in the Horn of Africa for the
first time in more than six years of clan war.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the summit also includes the issues of the
Comoros, Sierra Leone, Burundi and Angola, the African states that
have been ravaged by domestic turmoils, according to the Egyptian
official.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Egyptian stance on the issue of Comoros, he
said Egypt supports Comoros' territorial integrity and that all
parties concerned should abide by the agreement signed under the
OAU supervision, Shabaan added.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and governments of 21 African states are set to
participate in the summit.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Consumer Inflation Falls Again in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's consumer
inflation maintained a downward trend for six months in a row
till December, raising hopes that the central bank would cut
interest rates in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI) fell to 6.1 percent in December
from 6.8 percent in November, according to the Central
Statistical Service (CSS).
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate for last year was 8.6 percent
compared with an average of 7.4 percent in 1996 and 8.7 percent
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the CPI trend of the last quarter of 1997 was particularly
encouraging with the seasonally adjusted and annualized rise in
the CPI being 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists are predicting a sharp fall in inflation this year
to 6 percent or even five percent.
</P>
<P>
They believe the trend should enable Reserve Bank Governor
Chris Stals to cut interest rates in the first half of the year,
possibly as early as March or April. At least one more cut is
expected in the second half of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankans Demonstrate in Support of Deputy Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Massive public demonstrations
and rallies were held Thursday in Colombo, Kandy and many other
cities and towns in Sri Lanka in support of Deputy Defense
Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte, who asked to resign Wednesday, Sri
Lanka's national news agency, Lankapuvath, said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, holding placards and posters, marched
through the main roads in Colombo. They shouted slogans and
criticized the main opposition, the United National Party (UNP),
for pressuring Ratwatte to resign, the Lankapuvath said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here Wednesday afternoon said in
the Northern city of Jaffna, some posters in Tamil language were
put up on walls, asking Ratwatte not to resign.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte submitted his resignation letter to President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, saying he wanted to resign from the post of
deputy defense minister because he felt responsible for last
Sunday's bomb attack in Kandy.
</P>
<P>
A truck bomb detonated by Tamil rebels in Kandy, the ancient
capital, killed at least 16 people and damaged the holiest
Buddhist shrine, the Dalada Maligawa (Tooth Relic Temple).
</P>
<P>
The UNP and many other people criticized the security lapse and
repeatedly asked the deputy minister to quit from his cabinet
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
However, the president, who also holds the post of defense
minister, has rejected his resignation.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ruling Party's Women Leader Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian ruling party's women
leader has been arrested for possible involvement into the
country's abortive military coup last October, government-owned
Zambia Daily Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nakatindi Wina, women's affairs chairperson of the ruling
Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) and wife of MMD Chairman
Sikota Wina, was arrested in Lusaka on Tuesday night by police
detectives accompanied by a heavily armed contingent of
paramilitary officers, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Nakatindi, also member of parliament, is the first senior MMD
official arrested since the coup to date and now placed under a
28-day police detention order but has not been furnished with the
grounds of detention.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa confirmed the arrest
Wednesday and disclosed that Nakatindi is being held at Mukobeko
maximum prison in Kabwe, 150 kilometers north of the capital,
said the paper, adding that the prison is usually reserved for
hard-core criminals and sometimes political detainees.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Nakatindi's husband as describing the arrest
as a "terrible" blow to their family. He said that their family
are shocked especially because he and his wife have steadfastly
supported MMD throughout.
</P>
<P>
The arrest comes in the wake of investigations into the
attempted coup in which the Winas' house was implicated as having
been the venue for the plot.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Nakatindi announced publicly one day
after the coup that "some of us know about the coup" and for this
reason she appeared last month in the Lusaka High Court to
explain what he knew about the coup.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, 95 people including former president and
opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda have been arrested for alleged
involvement into the coup under the country's current state of
emergency, but none of them has been tried.

''we are just organizing for the day to see them off. We are
organizing funds.''
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said the army halted the proposed retirement

<P>
LAGOS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The mortality rate of children
under five years old in Nigeria is now number 14 in the world,
according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
In its report entitled "The State of the World's Children in
1998", UNICEF revealed that in Nigeria, 191 out of 1,000 births
die at the age of below five.
</P>
<P>
Niger has the world's highest child mortality rate with 320
deaths out of 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
However, life expectancy in Nigeria, which was just 43 years
in 1970 recorded an improvement over the years leading to 52
years in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which has nutrition as its focus, said between
1990 and 1997, 36 percent of under weight children under five
years old suffer from moderate under weight, 12 percent severe,
nine percent wasting and 43 percent stunting due to malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that between 1995 and 1996, only 36

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Wednesday Voiced Tehran's opposition to any possible
military operations against Iraq by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA Thursday,
Kharrazi made the remark before his departure for Switzerland to
take part in the annual world economic forum meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran is against escalation of tensions in the
region and further believes that military operation against Iraq
would not only worsen the plight of the Iraqi people but would also
make the situation more complex.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain threatened to launch air strike on Iraq in
order to force Baghdad to make a concession over the U.N. arms
inspection. Baghdad has stopped cooperation with some U.N. arms
inspection teams as it could "no longer accept the humiliations
inflicted on it" by the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President Bill Clinton has met his military and
security aides at the weekend to show Washington's impatience with
Iraq while Britain sent a new aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf
to support any possible strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi government announced its rejection to
threats of attacks by the U.S. and Britain, saying that it was
"determined to claim its legitimate right for the lifting of the
embargo" imposed by the U.N. since the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called on both sides to exercise restraint and to
respect international law in a bid to reach a solution by
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the international economic forum to be held in
Davos, Switzerland, on February 2-5, the Iranian foreign minister
said that Iran's participation in the meeting is in line with
Iran's policy to have active presentation in international fora.
</P>
<P>
Iran's participation in the session serves its goals of
development and progress in the country and the Iranian delegation
would take advantage of the opportunity to meet with officials of
the countries with which Iran has established bilateral relations,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Beats Huber in Three Sets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- World tennis No.1 Martina
Hingis survived a semi-final scare to win the right to defend her
Australian Open title in Melbourne today.
</P>
<P>
Hingis began with her customary dominance, but was caught by
surprise when German 10th seed Anke Huber stormed through the
second set.
</P>
<P>
But the Swiss teenager steadied, winning the match 6-1, 2-6,
6-1.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the winner of three of the four grand slams last year,
emphasised the difference between herself and the rest of the
women professionals as she regrouped and turned the match around
in the third set.
</P>
<P>
"I started off unbelievable," Hingis said. "Everything hit the
lines, I couldn't believe myself what I was hitting out there".
</P>
<P>
"Then I started to hit a bit shorter and she was there all the
time. I felt I didn't do anything wrong but I was still losing.
</P>
<P>
Hingis said her decision to start playing heavy returns down
the middle of the court to cut out Huber's angled returns paid off.
</P>
<P>
Huber said later the match was gone before she had a chance,
flashing by her in the final set.
</P>
<P>
"I just let it slip away and it shouldn't happen like that,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Hingis meets Conchita Martinez of Spain in the final on
Saturday in a bid to make it four.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, considered a veteran at 25, was also won from a
comeback, shutting out the No.2 seed, American Lindsay Davenport
4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon 1994 was Martinez' only grand slam final appearance
and she declared after beating Davenport today, her time was now.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready, it's about time. I'm more ready than ever," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Main Opposition Rejects Sri Lankan Govt Peace Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition,
the United National Party (UNP), has rejected the government's
devolution proposals, which are the core of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga's peace initiative, sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the UNP is to submit its alternative proposals
to the Parliamentary Select Committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the UNP clarified its stance towards
the government peace package.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the UNP proposes to appoint two
deputy presidents, each from the Tamil and Muslim minority
communities, and set up a second chamber.
</P>
<P>
The party is totally against the creation of regional councils,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it proposes to establish an independent police
commission, a government service commission and an independent
election commission.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no official response from the government, which
has been trying to win the UNP support during the past two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Petr Korda completed another
chapter in his comeback story when he powered into the final of
the Australian Open at Melbourne Park today.
</P>
<P>
Korda of Czech, the sixth seed, beat Karel Kucera of Slovakia
6-2, 6-4, 1-6, 6-2 to win through to only his second grand slam
final.
</P>
<P>
It was the more experienced Korda who took control of the match
in the opening few games, constantly outmanoeuvring his rival and
producing by far the better shot selection.
</P>
<P>
But after two one-sided sets, Kucera began to play.
</P>
<P>
The free-flowing play that had been too much for the world No.1
Pete Sampras returned and he found himself up 5-0 with Korda
struggling.
</P>
<P>
Korda regrouped though and turned the final set into something
of a procession.
</P>
<P>
Korda had been down and almost out of tennis in 1995 after he
underwent a long-avoided groin operation.
</P>
<P>
A second groin muscle operation a year later was followed by a
sinus operation last year.
</P>
<P>
While he was injured, and during his recovery, Korda's ranking
slipped to the 50s, but he has fought back to be No.6 in the
world, only one spot short of his career best which he achieved in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Korda will play either Marcelo Rios of Chile or Nicolas Escude
of Italy in Sunday's final.

victims.

NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania, the three members of the East African Cooperation
(EAC), are set to visit Japan, Belgium, Britain and the United
States from next week to seek investment and possible market.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete will head the
delegation which may also include Kenya's Minister for East
African and Regional Cooperation Nicholas Biwott. Who will
represent Uganda in the team is unknown.
</P>
<P>
"Our mission to these countries is intended to formally
introduce the EAC, explain to them what our intentions as a group
are and what we are currently doing," said Kikwete here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to introduce ourselves as a single market and a
single investment area. We will also take the opportunity to
discuss possible support for our programs such as infrastructure
building," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said repairing and reconstructing the region's road network
was a priority for the three nations and the issue will be high
on the team's agenda.
</P>
<P>
"The east African road network will be our most important
issue and we will be seeking financial support for this," Kikwete
noted, declining to reveal how much would be needed to revamp the
network destroyed by years of poor maintenance and the El Nino
rains since October.

The visit would also enable the ministers to market the
region's economic activities as well as its investment potential,
said Biwott.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States
reaffirmed its commitment to the security and stability to
Kuwait, an official statement said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah Wednesday, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hoped the U.S. and
Kuwait further foster the existing bilateral relations in the
fields of politics, economy and trade, according to reports by
official Kuwait News Agency (Kuna).
</P>
<P>
Albright also said the U.S. support to Kuwait and other
Gulf states is vital to confront the Iraqi threats and to
push the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
She said the Iraqi government "had to abide by Security
Council Resolutions unconditionally" and expressed "Washington's
support for its allies in the region."
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to visit Kuwait Sunday within a new
Middle East tour which would also take her to Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and Bahrain before returning to Washington on February 3,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Her tour will be aimed at lining up support for possible
military action the U.S. has warned to take against Iraq on
pretext that Iraq has blocked the U.N. arms inspections in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's first Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad also received a letter from the U.S.
Secretary of State Monday praising the level of bilateral
relations and renewing the U.S. firm commitment to Kuwait's
security.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Foreign Undersecretary Suleiman Majed Al-Shaheen also
received Monday morning the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait and held
talks centering on regional and international issues of common
concern, Kuna said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed a defense treaty with the U.S. following the
Gulf War which seven years ago helped to drive the Iraqi
occupation troops out from the small Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates the country's commitment to supply
arms and carry out joint military exercises within the
framework of defense cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tourist Industry Hit by Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The food riots which rocked
Zimbabwe last week have extensively tarnished the country's image
as a tourist destination, with some tourists reported to be
canceling bookings or delaying their trips.
</P>
<P>
The weekly "Business" reported today that the situation has
been worsened by the negative international publicity which the
country received following the riots.
</P>
<P>
From Monday to Wednesday last week, thousands of residents in
Harare, Chitungwiza and other small towns started demonstrations
in protest against recent prices increase. Some of them looted
shops, stoned cars and destroyed property causing millions of
Dollars losses.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Chairman of the Zimbabwe Council of Tourism
Herbert Nkala expressed concern at the situation, which had to a
large extent undermined Zimbabwe's ability to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
"There is doubt that the World Tourism Organization says the
most important consideration by tourists in choosing a
destination is safety," Nkala said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why over the past ten years the industry has grown
rapidly. The selling point has been safety," said Nkala, who is
also chief executive of Rainbow Tourism Group.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that some tourists were making inquiries about
the country's safety while others were canceling bookings.
</P>
<P>
He said the past few years have seen Zimbabwe's tourism
industry grow. Stability has been a major factor that has managed
to lure tourists to this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore disturbances such as the riots are bound to affect
the industry's performance to a large extent.

January 13 and 22 to negotiate the disbursement of the stand-by
facility and make an assessment of the completed first phase of
the economic reform program that is leading into the launching of
the Zimbabwe program for economic and social transformation.
</P>

Dollar which plunged to an all-time low in November last year and
the rebuilding of international reserves.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that the inflationary pressures will be

which included massive cuts in expenditure and other measures to
generate more fiscal revenue.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
rushed in a security team to world-famous Maasai Mara National
Game Reserve following a series of violent attacks on tourists
there by armed robber gangs.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and Wildlife Minister Henry Kosgey said Tuesday a
combined force of regular Kenya Police, paramilitary General
Service Unit, Tourist Police and Game Rangers are currently on
the ground patrolling and keeping vigil around the reserve.
</P>
<P>
Nine tourists were on Saturday evening attacked and injured by
heavily armed robbers on the way to the Maasai Mara National
Reserve. The tourists were robbed of money and personal effects,
including gold rings and chains.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth attack in less than one week in the same
area and tourists and their drivers have since been avoiding the
vital road citing insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Kosgey said the government was edgy about any incident that
would further destabilize the country's already sagging tourism
industry, the largest foreign exchange earner for the country.
</P>
<P>
The current ethnic clashes in Rift Valley Province would
definitely not augur well for the government's attempts to
attract more tourists into the eastern African state, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya stood to lose a whopping 18 billion Shillings (some 31
million U.S. Dollars) in earnings from tourism due to violence
last year, the year of election, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Base Taking Shape In Xinjiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China is edging up to become the most
important contributor to the country's oil increase at a time
when most oilfields in the eastern parts are going downhill.
</P>
<P>
The region had 16.41 million tons of oil in 1997, accounting
for 11.5 percent of the country's onshore oil output, ranking
third in China after Daqing and Shengli oilfields in the east,
according to Li Naizhen, head of the region's Oilfields
Coordinating Department.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, the region has maintained an average
annual increase of 13 percent in oil production, or 1.2 million
tons, to make up for the descending drop of petroleum production
in the east.
</P>
<P>
And by the end of the century, Xinjiang is expected to produce
23 million tons of oil annually, to contribute 20 percent to the
national total oil production.
</P>
<P>
China has long been plagued by insufficient oil reserves, and
in its eastern parts, which provide more than 80 percent of the
country's annual oil output of over 140 million tons, recoverable
reserves have been declining.
</P>
<P>
What is worse is that no more oilfields like Daqing and Shengli
have been found in the east during the past decade. Production
costs at Daqing, Shengli and some other oilfields have increased
dramatically, as large amount of water has to be injected to
extract oil.

<TEXT>
<P>
So, beginning in the late 1980s, China turned to the western
parts for oil resources, mainly Xinjiang, which is estimated by
geologists to have more than 30 billion tons of petroleum and gas
resources.
</P>
<P>
By now, over 50 billion yuan have been spent looking for oil
and gas in the three basins of Tarim, Junggar and Turpan-Hami. As
a result, 15 oil and gas fields have been found in the Tarim
Basin, which is as large as France, with 600 million tons of
proven reserves at hand.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Oilfield with an annual oil production capacity of
five million tons had 4.71 million tons in 1997, 1.26 million tons
more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration in the Junggar and Turpan-Hami basins has also
been doing well, with 34 oilfields found, some of which are
reported to have more than 100 million tons in reserves each.
</P>
<P>
The two basins have maintained an annual oil increase of
800,000 tons over the past few years, and pumped 11.7 million tons
of oil and two billion cubic meters of natural gas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang increased 860 million tons of proven oil and gas
reserves in 1997, bringing the total amount to 2.4 billion tons,
while China National Petroleum Corporation required the three
basin oilfields to verify four billion tons of oil reserves and 510
billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Telephones Link Chinese Farmers with Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Better-off farmers in central
China's Hunan Province have been doing well by marketing farm
produce and by-products through telephones.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Yang Zhenqiu in Leishen'an Village of Hanshou County is
an example. He earned 6,000 yuan not long ago, when he sold local
oranges of low prices to Henan Province at higher prices, and in
turn, shipped in apples from Henan and then resold them in his
home province, mainly through telephone contacts with his uncle
living in Henan.
</P>
<P>
A major grain producer, Hunan reaped good harvests of grain,
cotton, oil crops, fruits, vegetables and tobacco in 1997, but
immediately faced sales problems.
</P>
<P>
So, market information was put high on the agenda. Quick-minded
farmers began to organize marketing groups and make full use of
telephone links in doing business.
</P>
<P>
Lanxi Township of Yiyang city opened a 200-meter-long rice
street, dotted with 35 telephones, which helped sell nearly 100
tons of rice daily. Farmer Xiong Jianmin had his telephone number
printed on name cards, and handed them out to all his business
partners. As a result, he provided more than 100 pieces of
information for other farmers last year, which have led to one
million yuan worth of rice transactions.
</P>
<P>
More than 45,000 rural families of the city have their own
telephones. In addition, 2,400 public telephones were installed at
country fairs and along major roads in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in other places followed suit, and have been doing just
as well. Some 20 percent of rural households in 131 villages of
Yongzhou city now have home telephones. Over the past five year,
the city has led the province in marketing vegetables elsewhere,
and it now sells 300 million tons of vegetables annually, valued
at one billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Beijingers Celebrate Spring Festival at Quadrangle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Siheyuan, typical Beijing
compound with houses around a courtyard, is the best place to
enjoy the harmonious relations of neighbourhood and warm festival
atmosphere of the Chinese lunar new year in the Chinese Capital.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shichang, an aged man living in a quadrangle near
Wangfujing, a busy shopping street in Beijing, hang two red
lanterns at the entrance of his quadrangle on the eve of the lunar
new year.
</P>
<P>
He thought hanging lanterns a special privilege for the
quadrangles dwellers compared with those who live in highrises.
</P>
<P>
The old man also pasted spring festival couplets on gateposts,
decorated new year's paintings on wall of his rooms and prepared
a splendid array of delicious food for the family.
</P>
<P>
The quadrangle is shared by Zhang's family and eight other
households who have lived there for years.
</P>
<P>
neighbors came out to the courtyard to exchange festival
greetings when they heard the televised sound of the new year's
bell on the eve of Spring Festival and on the first day of the
lunar new year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's elderest son invited the old couple to a restaurant for
the dinner party. However, Zhang insisted in making 1,000 Jiaozi
(dumplings with meat and vegetable stuffing), a favorite food for
the spring festival in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The second son and son-in-law of Zhang came to offer a helping
hand in a minibus they had bought not long ago.
</P>
<P>
"I plan to drive the family out for sightseeing in
the suburbs during the festival," the son said.
</P>
<P>
"But what worries me most is to find a parking place near the
quadrangle," he said.

<HEADLINE> Officials Help Farmers Sell Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Jianzhuang, an official
with Tianyang County of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, went to
the region's capital of Nanning shortly after the New Year's Day,
not on business as usual, but to help farmers sell vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The county is the largest winter vegetable producer in the
western part of the region, and is expected to produce more than
300,000 tons of vegetables on 10,000 ha during the cold seasons.
</P>
<P>
"If farmers could not sell their vegetables, a busy winter
would be fruitless, " Zhao said, adding that the county government
had organized at least 50 marketing teams to lend a hand in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The practice of official participation proved effective. The
county harvested 270,000 tons of vegetables during the 1996-97
season, and 245,000 of them were sold elsewhere, valued at
approximately 200 million yuan, or 650 yuan for every farmer.
</P>
<P>
"It is a pity that we have not yet set up a reliable winter
vegetable sales network," Zhao said, noting that if there was a
secure sales channel, the county would increase the existing
vegetable acreage to 20,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
Now the county is stepping efforts to improve infrastructure,
especially transportation and power supply, in a bid to boost the
development of cash crops, and also offering market information
for farmers on what to grow next year.
</P>
<P>
The practice has also been expanded to the rest of the region,
and even other parts of the country.

WUHAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Travel agencies in Wuhan, capital
of central China's Hubei Province, are having booming business
these days as quite a number of local people choose to travel
outside during Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival, the most important traditional Chinese
festival, falls on January 28 this year.
</P>
<P>
As a Chinese tradition, family members return home from
different parts of the country or even from abroad for a
big reunion during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Some six percent of Wuhan residents, however, spend the Spring
Festival by travelling outside, and over 1,000 of them choose Hong
Kong, Macao, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand as their
destinations, according to a survey by the provincial tourism
bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that many tourists choose southeastern Asian
countries and regions as their travel destinations mainly for the
devaluation of local currencies as a result of the financial
turmoil.

DHAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
undertaken a massive afforestation program in the south division
of the Chittgong Hill Tracks (CHT) about 250 kilometers southeast
of Dhaka, a local press report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, 3.64 square kilometers of denuded hills
associating tribal forest villages will be afforested for the
first time at a cost of 2.8 billion taka (about 62.2 million U.S.
dollars) during the 1995-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the program has been accelerated due to
the signing of the peace accord between the government and the
tribal rebels on December 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Necessary steps have been taken for collecting seeds and
raising nursery to implement the program, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The CHT's south division, one of the major territorial forest
areas in the country, possesses rich forest resources with virgin
forests on a vast tract of hills rearing hundreds of species of
century-old valuable trees such as teak.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Question Former White House Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to seek
evidence of an alleged affair between President Bill Clinton and
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, prosecutors on
Wednesday questioned the president's former chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Leon Panetta testified before a grand jury in the federal
courthouse. Lewinsky started her unpaid White House internship
by working in Panetta's office.
</P>
<P>
Panetta said he was unaware of "any improper relationship,
sexual or otherwise," involving Clinton. He said: "My fervent
prayer is that for the sake of the president and the sake of this
nation that this matter is resolved soon."
</P>
<P>
Among the charges prosecutors must weigh is whether Ms.
Lewinsky and the president committed perjury and whether she and
Clinton conspired to suborn perjury and obstruct the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, White House press secretary Mike McCurry
said, "we are in a hostile proceeding right now with a very
determined independent counsel", and Clinton's lawyers would like
to wait to tell his story in a "setting in which witnesses can be
examined and cross-examined."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the president promised a more complete accounting of
his relationship with Lewinsky. He has repeatedly denied he had
sex with her or did anything to encourage her to lie.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials told the Associated Press that Prosecutor
Kenneth Starr's office and Treasury officials were discussing how
to gain testimony from Secret Service agents in the White House
about whether they saw anything that would support allegations
that the president had an affair with Monica Lewinsky.

<P>
DHAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- With Eid-ul-Fitr only one day
away, city dwellers in the capital city of Dhaka started leaving
for their village homes to celebrate the festival with their near
and dear ones.
</P>
<P>
Huge crowds are seen at all city exits, such as the Kamalapur
railway station, the Sadarghat launch terminal and all bus
terminals, and the home-bound people are in a mad rush to leave
for their sweet home by whatever means possible- huddling inside
buses, trucks, trains and launches and sitting on the roofs.
</P>
<P>
With more than one-third of the capital's nearly 9 million
people expected to leave here to celebrate Eid elsewhere, it is no
easy job to get a ticket of transport of whatever kind, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Passengers have to pay two or three times the normal price for
a bus or launch ticket on the black market, the reports said. A
ticket on the Dhaka-Chittagong luxury bus fetches 400 to 500 taka
(9 to 11 U.S. dollars), instead of the normal 250 taka.
</P>
<P>
Special trains have been arranged to operate Thursday on
various routes linking the capital to other parts of the country,
and more motor launches and steamers will ply the southern riverin
routes, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
And Eid shopping in the city is in full swing, with large
numbers of people crowding the shopping centers which remain open
late at night.
</P>
<P>
A three-day public holiday starts in Bangladesh Thursday on the
occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, the greatest religious festival for the
Muslims, after a month-long fasting during the month of Ramadan.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's sole international
airport has taken drastic steps to improve flight safety, press
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu-based Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA)
Wednesday began the trial operation of its new radar equipment and
formally opened a new "approach control" unit to guide all
incoming and outgoing aircraft, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
While the new radar equipment is expected to be formally opened
later this year, the "approach control" services enable the TIA to
have two separate offices for guiding air traffic -- the East
Control office for traffic east of the capital and the West
Control office for traffic in the west, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The equipment and the related resources for manpower training
are provided by the Japanese government, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
Flight safety experts said that had radar been operational at
the TIA earlier, the two air crashes over Kathmandu in 1992 could
have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
Two Airbuses from Thai and Pakistan airlines crashed
respectively in late July and in late September of 1992, killing a
total of 280 passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
"The measures are an important step towards providing safe and
reliable air service in the kingdom," the Department of Civil
Aviation was quoted as saying.

BANGKOK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) will close its Vientiane and Chicago offices from
May as part of a drive to save 90 million baht (1.8 million U.S.
dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Staff in the remaining 15 tourism offices will be halved to two
or three per office, while representative marketing bases in 21
countries will be closed.
</P>

Currently, the authority spends 300 million baht (6 million
U.S. dollars) on renting offices abroad which also hire local
staff, marketing representatives and advertising consultants.

TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said if more offices had to be
closed, its base in South Korea and one of three offices in Japan

<HEADLINE> Prince Ranariddh Set to Meet Thai Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Cambodian First Premier
Prince Norodom Ranariddh is expected to meet Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai next week to discuss the Cambodian issue.
</P>
<P>
A government official said Wednesday that Thai Foreign Minister
Surin Pitsuwan will hold talks with Ranariddh later today to
prepare for next week's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Surin, a member of the ASEAN three-nation committee set up to
broker the crisis in Cambodia, is expected to inform Ranariddh
that Thailand is ready to act as a mediator between the Cambodian
factions. The committee also comprises Indonesia and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who currently resides in Bangkok, was ousted from
office last July by troops loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Fighting between the prince's forces and troops led by Hun Sen
broke out sporadically.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to restore peace in Cambodia are at a deadlock. There
seems to be no peace-broker currently acceptable to both parties.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Foreign Secretary Saroj Chavanaviroj and the
ambassadors of Indonesia and the Philippines called on Ranariddh
Wednesday at his residence, seeking his opinion on the latest
ceasefire unilaterally declared by Hun Sen, The Nation newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh informed them that his troops defending the last
royalist stronghold at O'samech were willing to enter into a
ceasefire agreement with Hun Sen's forces without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The prince said he wanted to return to Cambodia as soon as
possible on the condition that his safe return be guaranteed by
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has insisted that Ranariddh should stand trial in a
Cambodian court for alleged acts of terrorism and smuggling of
illegal weapons into the country. Ranariddh has required that he
be tried in absentia on the charges.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Attract More Foreign Governmental Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port city
of north China, will take effective measures to attract foreign
investments, especially foreign governmental loans.
</P>
<P>
Local officials in charge of foreign trade and economic
cooperation explained that foreign governmental loans are badly
needed in fields such as upgrading of some urban civil
infrastructure and construction of environmental protection
projects, where foreign investment is scarce.
</P>
<P>
A special coordinative group for use of foreign investment has
been established under the Foreign Investment Office of the
Tianjin Municipal Government since last year to increase the
efforts to attract more foreign governmental loans with favorable
terms.
</P>
<P>
The coordinative group has so far prepared a database of
investment target projects in the city and an information database
of loans.
</P>
<P>
The city will also change its past practice of limiting the use
of foreign governmental loans to state-owned enterprises only and
allow all economic entities meeting with set requirements to use
foreign governmental loans.
</P>
<P>
To achieve best economic and social efficiency, Tianjin will
also practice full-process tracking management over those projects
involving the use of foreign governmental loans and solve possible
problems in the execution of those projects.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has used foreign governmental loans in the city's 42
projects since 1982, of which, 33 projects have been completed and
put into use. The agreed volume of foreign funds on the loans
stands at 1.32 billion U.S. dollars, but the paid-up sum is 1.2
billion U.S. dollars, said the officials.

contributor to local economic development. In 1997, the sector
provided 44 percent of the city's total industrial output value,
30 percent of the total taxes, and 60 percent of the exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Cup year was kicked off
when French president Jacques Chirac declared open of the Stade de
France in front of a capacity crowd on Wendesday.
</P>
<P>
Fittingly France won the friendly 1-0 over Spain through a
Zinedine Zidane goal and the 80,000 spectators, the most ever to
watch a football match in France, had a taste of the atmosphere
expected in nine of the World Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
The last record was 63,638 to watch Ajax defeat Benfica 3-0
after extra time in 1969 in Colombes in European competition.
</P>
<P>
The 445-million-dollar stadium is expected to host 20 to 40
sporting and other events and have 1.75 million people a year
pouring through the turnstiles at this Saint-Denis suburb.
Saint-Denis was selected from 26 sites around the capital on
October 1993.
</P>
<P>
French governments had been talking of building a national
stadium for the last 100 years and its completion gives France an
added boost in hopes of hosting a summer Olympics sometime in the
future.
</P>
<P>
It took 31 months to build with 32,000 tonnes of steel and
180,000 cubic meters of concrete, and its six hectare roof, the
size of the famous Place de Concorde in the center of Paris,
weighs 13,000 tonnes or twice as heavy as the Eiffel tower.
</P>
<P>
However the stadium has received criticism from some quarters.
</P>
<P>
French football federation president Claude Simonet has been
having differences with the stadium consortium, which built the
structure and is entrusted with managing it till 2025, over its
high costs.
</P>
<P>
Ecologists have warned that poisonous substances below the
pitch, as the site was formerly used for a gas works, are a health
and security hazard.
</P>
<P>
However the consortium argued a special membrane below the
surface of the pitch would ensure no dangerous substances would
reach pitch level should the water table rise after heavy rain.
Other measures to pump away, divert or destroy these substances
have been used, the consortium says.
</P>
<P>
Many believe transport will be a problem too. The autoroute,
which links Paris to the Charles de Gaulle airport, is set to have
bumper-to-bumper traffic on match days. And the 6,000 parking
spots will surely not be enough, critics argue.
</P>
<P>
However the show went on with a spectacular half hour laser and
light display before Chirac gave a short inauguration speech to
officially declare the stadium open.
</P>
<P>
The display left its mark on the match as French keeper Fabien
Barthez kicked the ball out of play to give time for a cable to
be moved from his area seconds after the start.
</P>
<P>
A rasping volley from Zidane from the penalty spot, pushed over
by Spain's veteran keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, gave a hint of
things to come.
</P>
<P>
A poor back pass by Abelardo almost let in Youri Djorkaeff with
only Zubizarreta to beat, but the keeper cleared the ball to
safety.
</P>
<P>
And it was a combination of Italian exports Zidane of Juventus
and Djorkaeff of Inter Milan, who once again proved their immense
value to France, which brought the winner in the 20th minute.
</P>
<P>
A shot from Djorkaeff was parried by the keeper on to the
crossbar and Zidane, running in, had plently of time to score his
seventh goal in 29 internationals with a carefully-placed right
foot shot.
</P>
<P>
Spain's best chance before the break came from Raul, who shot
narrowly wide after a defence-splitting pass from Alfonso.
</P>
<P>
Chances came few and far between after the break and French
coach Aime Jacquet, no doubt experimenting, made four
substitutions, including a debut for Monaco's 20-year-old David
Trezeguet.
</P>
<P>
However the result was never really in doubt and Spain,
previously unbeaten in 31 matches since their 1994 World Cup
quarter-final loss to Italy, finally tasted defeat.
</P>
<P>
In their 25 matches with Spain, France have now won nine to
Spain's 10 with six matches drawn.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Athletics Assails IAAF View on Slaney Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. athletics officials
criticized on Wednesday the International Amateur Athletics
Federation's (IAAF) decision to review whether former world
champion Mary Slaney is guilty of using a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
Slaney, champion of both the 1,500 and 3,000 meters at the
inaugural 1983 world championships, tested positive at the 1996
U.S. championships for excessive levels of the male sex hormone
testosterone. She has consistently denied taking any banned
substance.
</P>
<P>
Last September the U.S. governing body cleared the 39-year-old
American of any offense but an IAAF drugs commission called for
further scientific evidence before deciding whether to accept the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
"Mary Slaney was exonerated. USA Track &AMP; Field fully supports
the outcome of its hearing process and will vigorously oppose any
efforts to overturn it," the sport's U.S. governing body said in a
statement issued from its headquarters in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
IAAf spokesman Giorgio Reineri, speaking earlier on Wednesday
from the federation's headquarters in Monaco, said the IAAF
council had decided by postal vote to refer the case to its
arbitration panel. It would be probably be some months, he said,
before the panel assembled all the necessary documents.
</P>
<P>
Reineri said the drugs commission had since studied conflicting
opinions from experts worldwide and finally recommended that the
case go to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a crusade against Slaney," he said. "But there are
a lot of differing opinions."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials indeed differed.
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised, disappointed and disturbed by this
announcement," U.S. athletics chief Craig Masback said in the
statement. "Mary Slaney has been one of our greatest athletes.
Our process was a complete and fair one, and was based on an IAAF
investigation that took more than six months to complete.
</P>
<P>
"Given that fact, it is particularly upsetting that the IAAF
sees the need for further investigation and consideration of this
matter."

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Consider Fourth Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- World football's ruling body FIFA
is about to discuss the possibility to add a fourth official in
matches when its International Board meets here on March 6.
</P>
<P>
FIFA secretary general Sepp Blatter said the additional
official's main role would be to take some pressure off the
referee by logging the yellow and red cards handed out, as well as
substitutions.
</P>
<P>
The International Board will also ratify a proposal to allow
one of the two referees' assistants onto the pitch to ensure
defensive walls are far enough back at free-kicks.
</P>
<P>
This would allow the referee to take up a position from where
he would be better able to spot fouls in the penalty area, Blatter
said.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will be executed after the World Cup finals
tournament June 10-July 12 if it is defined.

NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
scheduled four pre-tournament exhibition games before defending
its title at this year's World Basketball Championships.
</P>
<P>
The US team will play the French national team on July 18 and
the Spanish national team on July 19 at Stade Louis II Arena in
Monte Carlo. The US team will train in Monaco from July 16
through to the 23.
</P>
<P>
The NBA players will also play the 1998 US Goodwill Games team
on July 14 in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and meet the Italian
national team on July 25 in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The world championships are from July 29-August 9 in Athens,
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Many world championship lineups will play a pre-tournament
schedule at the Goodwill Games in New York in a tournament that
lasts from July 19-24.
</P>
<P>
The US has named 10 of 12 players that will defend the gold
medal won in Toronto four years ago by "Dream Team II". But the
latest club is notably not billed as a "Dream Team" lineup, in
part because of the taunting and rowdy behavoir shown by the 1994
lineup in dominating rivals at Canada.
</P>
<P>
The US lineup includes four players who will compete in next
month's NBA All-Star Game -- Grant Hill, Glen Rice, Gary Payton
and Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
Others on the US world team include Chris Webber, Terrell
Brandon, Tom Gugliotta, Allan Houston, Vin Baker and 1992 "Dream
Team" reserve forward Christian Laettner.

<P>
NANNING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region expects to increase its foreign trade volume in
1998 by 11.7 percent, with its actual use of foreign capital
up 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export volume of Guangxi this year is planned to rise by
nine percent, with the import volume expected to grow by 18.8
percent, according to Yang Daoxi, director of the Planning
Commission of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuang nationality, a major ethnic group in Guangxi, used
to live a poor life and had little contact with other places in
the past as high mountains cut it off from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
But they have frequently exchanges with neighbouring provinces
and foreign countries and greatly improved their living
conditions thanks to the opening up drive over the recent years,
said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Guangxi used 5.1 billion U.S. dollars of
foreign funds from more than 50 countries and regions during
1993-1997, which were invested in agriculture, industry,
transportation, energy, telecommunication and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi also have also took advantages of its long border to
develop trade with southwestern Asian countries. The border trade
volume in the past five years reached 14.2 billion yuan (about
1.77 billion U.S.dollars), said Yang.

NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Postal Service has
recently issued the sixth in its series of Lunar New Year stamps
to celebrate the Chinese New Year of the Tiger in 1998, according

The 32-cent stamp features a paper-cut, multi-colored tiger in
the center and contains the words "Happy New Year" in white
lettering in the upper right-hand corner, and on the left side of
the stamp, Chinese calligraphy signifies "Happy New Year."
</P>
<P>
The new stamp and the previous five Lunar New Year stamps have
all been designed by Clarence Lee, whose special paper-cut style
visually ties the entire series together.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a Chinese-American from Hawaii, has been commissioned to
design the remaining six stamps in this series, which will
complete the twelve-stamp set in 2004 with the Year of the Monkey.

The previous five Lunar New Year Stamps are ones for Year of
the Rooster in 1993, Year of the Dog in 1994, Year of the Boar in
1995 and Year of the Rat in 1996. The remaining six ones are for

<HEADLINE> Albright to Travel to Europe, Mideast on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
today announced that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
leave for Europe and the Middle East later today to confer U.S.
allies and other countries on any possible action stronger than
diplomacy to force Iraq into abiding U.N. resolutions on weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of her trip will be to discuss with allies and
U.N. Security Council member states a strong international
response to Iraq's continued defiance of U.N. Security Council
resolution," State Department spokesman James Rubin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Albright will first meet French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
in Paris Thursday, then travel to Madrid to meet Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov Friday and to Britain for talks with
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After her Europe trip, Albright will then go to the Middle East
to visit Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain and Egypt, and will be back to Washington on February 3,
Rubin said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright will explain U.S. views on how to proceed
to ensure Iraqi compliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors' access
to sensitive areas like presidential sites on the ground of
sovereignty and dignity, the United States believes it has been
exhausting diplomatic effort and other kind of options including
military action should be considered.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said Monday that time was running out for
a diplomatic solution and it might resort to military force to
make Iraq comply. It also justifies any potential military attack
on Iraq as fully in accordance with U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen to File Lawsuit Against EU Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest carmaker
Volkswagen AG said today that it would bring a lawsuit to the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to challenge a record fine
imposed by the European Commission to punish its alleged illegal
marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen was fined 102 million ECUs (112.2 million U.S.
dollars) today for barring its Italian dealers from selling
Volkswagen cars to German and Austrian residents who sought to
take advantage of the price differences in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The fine is the largest ever imposed by the European Commission
on a single company.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen, however, denied any wrongdoings and described the
penalty "incomprehensible and completely out of proportion with
regard to its size."
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Karel van Miert, responsible for fair
competition, said today in Brussels that the EU had hard evidence
about Volkswagen's offense against the EU common-market rules,
which state that consumers can buy whatever they want wherever
they want within the EU at whatever price they find it.
</P>
<P>
He also said the size of the fine was decided upon the duration
and seriousness of the illegal practice by Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
But Volkswagen argued that it had only asked its Italian
dealers not to sell VW and Audi cars to unauthorized dealers, and
therefore it had not barred sales to authorized dealers and
private customers from Germany and Austria.
