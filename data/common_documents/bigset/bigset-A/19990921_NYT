UCLA DOES MORE QB SHUFFLING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it's Monday, Bruins coach Bob Toledo must have
a quarterback announcement. Cory Paus remains the starter, but he
probably won't start (or play) Saturday at Stanford because of
injuries, which means Drew Bennett, the former starter, will start.
</P>
<P>
   Got it?
</P>
<P>
   Paus did not practice Monday and is listed as doubtful because
of bruised ribs and a strained neck suffered in the second quarter
of the victory over Fresno State. If he can't play, then Bennett,
who directed the second-half comeback, will start against the
surging Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cory is healthy, he's the starting quarterback,'' Toledo
said. ``There's a reason we picked him before and a reason now...
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I don't think at this point that he's going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus, a freshman, completed his first eight passes against
Fresno State and was 9 of 12 for 113 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   He was injured when he fell on the ball and two Bulldogs fell on
him. He bruised ribs on the upper left side of his chest, near the
collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   Third-string sophomore Scott McEwan, of Thousand Oaks, becomes
the backup if Paus can't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brushing my teeth hurts _ anything with my arms, anything with
my upper torso,'' Paus said. ``I'm disappointed, obviously. It's
like, `Yeah, I played good, but I got hurt.' I could ice it all day
and it wouldn't help. I just have to let it heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to play, but if I can't play up to the standards to
beat a team like Stanford, I won't even try. Drew did a fine job.
Obviously, he showed that in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed from the anxiety that accompanies starting, Bennett played
the best game of his career. He completed 13 of 24 passes for 176
yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the quarterback competition earlier in the week, he
proved to himself he could lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me confidence as a backup,'' he said. ``Coach Toledo
told me (last week) that no matter what happened, I'm still
valuable to the team, and I showed that when Cory got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll probably have to show it again, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Menace in the middle: Middle linebacker Robert Thomas returned
from a two-game suspension to show why he was a coveted national
recruit two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a sophomore, had a game-high 14 tackles and was named
defensive player of the game. His punishing third-quarter hit
dislodged receiver Rodney Wright's helmet and ignited UCLA's
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all over the field,'' Toledo said. ``He made a few
mistakes from being a little inexperienced, but he's going to be a
great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Freddie Mitchell (nine catches, 149 yards) was named
offensive player of the game. Long-snapper Jeff Grau won the
special-teams honor.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Amid myriad bumps and bruises, the Bruins have
several significant injuries, excluding Paus:
</P>
<P>
   Receivers Danny Farmer (sprained ankle), Brian Poli-Dixon
(sprained wrist) and Mitchell (thigh bruise) are probable. Farmer
practiced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Pete Holland (back) is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Mike Saffer (ankle) and cornerback Jason Bell (heel) are
out.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo dismissed the idea of redshirting Bell, who played as a
true freshman and is eligible for a medical exemption if he misses
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to play,'' Toledo said. ``I'm going to sit and talk
to him. It hurts a little bit, but we want him to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Bell, UCLA's top four cornerbacks are freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: This week's captains are fullback Durell Price
and linebacker Tony White.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State game starts at 12:30 p.m. and will be
televised on Channel 7. The Stanford game starts at 2 p.m. and will
not be televised live. However, Fox Sports West 2 will show a
tape-delayed broadcast beginning at 3:30 p.m.

POLITICIANS CAN SINK OR SWIM ON NATURE'S WHIM

 Washington Bureau   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Hurricane Floyd churned up the Eastern Seaboard,
Rep. Martin Frost turned his own wrath upon the Republican House
leadership, ripping into them for failing to adjourn Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trapping members in the nation's capital who want to
be home with their constituents,'' roared Frost, D-Texas , on the
House floor. ``This is an extraordinary development.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost was speaking for many of his colleagues who were eager to
avoid becoming political casualties of the high-profile hurricane.
It is a hard-learned truth that public officials must be seen as
being fully engaged in preparing for a storm and efficiently
handling its aftermath or they risk being cast adrift by an angry
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The nexus between politics and weather was never clearer than
the past week when Vice President Al Gore was interviewed on the
Weather Channel while Hurricane Floyd was leading the news on CNN's
show Inside Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural disasters are the ultimate test for political
leaders,'' said CNN's political analyst Bill Schneider. ``They have
to do the impossible _ reassure people that they are in control of
a situation that nobody can control.''
</P>
<P>
   After Frost's tirade, House leaders quickly canceled their
business last week, though the Senate stayed in town. And House
members weren't the only ones changing their plans. President
Clinton cut short his own trip to New Zealand to return home to
monitor the storm's progress and make sure emergency operations
were running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton flew to flood-ravaged Northeastern North
Carolina, where members of Congress from the state appeared with
the president as he urged battered residents to ``keep your spirits
up and know that we're going to be with you every step of the way.
Know that you have strong advocates in your local officials, your
wonderful governor and your very vigorous congressional
delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   History shows that storms can be politically deadly. In one
famous case, Chicago Mayor Michael Bilandic was ousted in 1979
after his administration failed to clear city streets for a week
following a blizzard. Detroit's mayor was subjected to a recall
after snow removal efforts fell short this year. Washington Mayor
Marion Barry, who had other problems, was often criticized for his
nonchalant approach to snow removal.
</P>
<P>
   The harshly critiqued federal relief effort following Hurricane
Hugo in 1989 as well as Hurricane Andrew in 1992 tarnished
political careers and led to a shakeup and restructuring at FEMA.
And Gore himself took some heat for not appearing sufficiently
comforting after tornados raked Alabama in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any sense that political figures are insensitive
to the trauma or disruption in life caused by a natural disaster,
are not right on top of it, it becomes almost disqualifying,'' said
Norm Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The past week's storm quickly sparked political sniping and
second-guessing. Charleston, S.C., Mayor Joseph P. Riley hit his
fellow Democrat, Gov. Jim Hodges, for waiting too long to make
Interstate 26 a one-way evacuation route inland. In Florida, Gov.
Jeb Bush was quizzed about traffic snarls caused by the massive
evacuation and by week's end he had launched a statewide review of
the matter. And there was commentary that the overall response to
the storm in some areas exceeded what was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton predicted as much. ``There may be some people who
question ... whether we did the right thing to recommend all the
evacuations,'' he said. ``But now that we have this technology at
the National Weather Center, we have to act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the storm progressed, lawmakers remaining in Washington were
quick to make their attentiveness known. Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla.,
and John Edwards, D-N.C., were on CNN exhibiting their firsthand
knowledge of the evolving emergency plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten folks away from the greatest places of danger,''
announced Edwards one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP campaign committee offered to make television
satellite time available to Florida members, giving them a chance
to reassure constituents and offer storm tips.
</P>
<P>
   And Florida Gov. Bush was not going to repeat a mistake made in
1992, when state officials were chastised for waiting too long
after Andrew hit to request full federal relief. The governor
wasted no time, seeking a disaster declaration for more than 50
counties even before the first hurricane winds reached the shores
of Florida, which was ultimately spared the brunt of the storm's
fury.
</P>
<P>
   Some Florida Republicans saw another political opening in the
hurricane, writing Clinton to urge him not to veto the $792 billion
GOP tax cut package in light of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Floyd is threatening our coast and you are
threatening to veto tax relief that would help its victims,' said
the letter signed by Sen. Mack and Reps. Dan Miller, Cliff Stearns,
Porter Goss and Charles Canady among others. ``In the aftermath of
a hurricane, our constituents need to know that we are doing
everything possible to help them recover and this one tangible way
to do it.''

COLUMN: HERE SHE IS _ BUT WHERE IS SHE FROM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ It didn't take long for Miss New York to
fall by the wayside at the Miss America Pageant the other night,
not that it came as a great shock. New York's standard-bearers have
not usually fared well at the pageant, and Brandi Burkhardt, 20,
was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   There was an interesting tidbit about her in the program. Alone
among the 51 contestants, she gave a hometown that was not in the
state she represented. Pasadena, Md., the program said. Graduate of
Chesapeake High School. Doesn't sound terribly New Yorky, does it?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, in the last few years Ms. Burkhardt seems to have
settled nicely into Manhattan life, studying at New York
University, working as an Off Broadway production assistant and
looking toward an acting career. So said the program.
</P>
<P>
   The point, if there is one, is that her New York sponsors were
clearly unfazed by the fact that she is new to their state _ what
some might go so far as to call a carpetbagger. Based on her
talents (and looks), she was deemed a fine representative, no
matter where born.
</P>
<P>
   You may already sense where this is headed. Might Ms.
Burkhardt's presence in Atlantic City be a sign that the
carpetbagger issue will prove a nonstarter in a certain Senate race
taking shape in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is reaching, even overreaching, for a significance
that isn't there. Still, the question of what makes a New Yorker
came to mind over the weekend while spending time here with
Patricia Harris, originally of Detroit. For half a century, she
lived and flourished in Manhattan, and even though no longer there,
she remains as identifiably New York as the Statue of Liberty,
which comes from France.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harris was in Atlantic City as grand marshal of the
boardwalk parade that preceded the pageant, a stream of contestants
and marching bands.
</P>
<P>
   She earned the honor because she was Miss America 1939. The name
then was Patricia Donnelly. Going into the contest, she was Miss
Michigan, all of 19 years old. For the talent section, she played a
bass fiddle while singing a number called ``Old Man Mose Is Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sang with bands back then,'' she recalled. ``I was a good
singer _ not great, but good.'' What clinched the title was her
gait, straight and firm even now in her 80th year. ``I always
walked well,'' she said, stepping in high heels around a sidewalk
grating on her way to the hall where the pageant was held.
</P>
<P>
   For the parade, Mrs. Harris wore a silk jacket she bought years
ago in Hong Kong. She rode tall, sitting on the back of a limo as
wide as the QE2 and waving to the crowds, filled with people not
embarrassed to stand and salute when a contingent of aging
ex-Marines strode by. Later, in restaurants and in her hotel, women
rushed up to ask for her autograph and to say that she looked like
a million, which in fact she did.
</P>
<P>
   You can, if you wish, dismiss the pageant as a silly exercise,
or as Babbitry in a bathing suit, or as an offense to women
everywhere. You may even be right. But 78 years after it got its
start, it still means a lot to many people. After a while, that
simple truth becomes hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Mrs. Harris said. ``But kids do grow up admiring
Miss America, so the organizers try to keep her a person they can
look up to. I think they've done a pretty good job. These are about
as nice a group of women as you'll ever meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after her year as Miss America, she moved to New York
City, where she met Robin Harris. He was a writer. They were
introduced at a night club and were married a few months later in
the Municipal Building.
</P>
<P>
   It was some time that they had. Theirs was the New York of white
gloves and snap-brim fedoras, of days at the track and nights on
the town. They got to meet everyone from J. Edgar Hoover to Meyer
Lansky. Of course, they had to make a living. They traveled the
world and wrote magazine articles on what they had seen. But the
road always led back to New York, until her husband died. Her home
is now outside Boston, near grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a buildup to the following question:
</P>
<P>
   What makes you a New Yorker _ merely taking up space in the city
for a stretch, or diving into it to make it your own? Patricia
Donnelly knew the answer. So, it seems, does Brandi Burkhardt, who
showed how quickly one can move from being an outsider to top of
the hill.

CHOICE OF CLINTON FOR HUMANITIES TALK MEETS RESISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS Clinton being first president to be asked)  (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since 1972, the National Endowment for the
Humanities has selected a leading scholar to give its annual
Jefferson Lecture on the Humanities. Past recipients of the honor
have included Lionel Trilling, Robert Penn Warren, John Hope
Franklin, Sidney Hook, Toni Morrison, Gwendolyn Brooks, Gertrude
Himmelfarb and Barbara Tuchman.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the chairman of the endowment, William R. Ferris, said
the lecturer in 2000 would be President Clinton, and some scholars
are not happy.
</P>
<P>
   John Hammer, the director of the National Humanities Alliance,
said he was concerned that the choice of Clinton, who appointed
Ferris chairman, would politicize the endowment, a federal agency.
Clinton is the first president to be asked to deliver the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list of lecturers until now has been very distinguished,
without regard to politics,'' Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
   John H. D'Arms, president of the American Council of Learned
Societies, told The Chronicle of Higher Education, which first
reported the selection of Clinton on its Web page Monday, that he
was also concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when one is very careful about trying to
depoliticize the humanities and the arts in the United States in
the eyes of Congress,'' D'Arms told The Chronicle, a ``speech by
President Clinton might have the reverse effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris defended the choice. ``You take a little heat when you
make a change,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of inviting Clinton, he said, was to begin a
tradition in which all presidents would deliver a Jefferson
Lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expanding the endowment to reach the whole country,''
he said. ``We're opening all the doors and windows. Having the
president reflect on his or her relationship to the history of the
nation is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because history is one of the endowment's main components, the
endowment has helped to finance many presidential history projects,
Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if what he was doing would be considered an injection
of politics, Ferris replied: ``In a way it is. We're a political
reality. We depend on Congress and the White House for our very
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   But any politicizing, Ferris insisted, was bipartisan because
the Clinton invitation would set a precedent to be followed in
future administrations, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   One former chairman of the endowment, William Bennett, said that
the invitation to Clinton was not only a politicization of the
endowment, but a partisan one as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrible, corrupt, but it fits the pattern of this
administration,'' said Bennett, a conservative Republican who
served in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bipartisan?'' Bennett asked. ``I don't think so. The
Clinton-appointed chairman picks the guy who picks him to give the
lecture, a guy who has no qualifications, and calls it bipartisan
and broadening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett added, ``Clinton has not only been corrupted; he has
corrupted all of those around him, and this is an example of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said of Bennett's criticism, ``It's short-sighted to
couch this as a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to create a historical record,'' he said. ``We
will have a bipartisan record.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said Clinton, a friend, had not answered the invitation
by Monday evening but that he expected the president to accept. The
White House did not respond to a call seeking comment. The lecture
is given in the spring in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Clinton could be regarded as a scholar, Ferris
said: ``The endowment's founding language calls for bringing the
humanities to the American people. No matter how visible the
lecturer is, very few Americans have ever heard of the Jefferson
Lecture. This will bring it to every American. People will become
aware of what the humanities are. It will broaden the humanities
and touch the lives of all citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris acknowledged that Clinton, whose advanced degree is in
law, was not a scholar in the traditional sense, adding, ``But he
is in the Jeffersonian sense that every citizen has the right to
express their thoughts about the nature of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the typical president would not simply assign the
speech writing task to an aide, Ferris said he thought each
president would write every humanities speech, seeing it as an
opportunity to express his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, the director of the National Humanities Alliance, said:
``I understand they are hoping it will provide more publicity. I
imagine that's true.''

MCGWIRE HITS NO. 59, SOSA JUST A SINGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Mark McGwire insists that there is no home run race.
``It doesn't matter who finishes first,'' he said. ``I was in a
race with Ken Griffey several times, and no one cared.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire relaxed at his locker before Monday night's game, all
muscles and red hair, saying it was no big deal. Then he went out
into the cool night at Wrigley Field and hit his 59th home run,
breaking up a perfect game in the seventh inning against the
Chicago Cubs. Sammy Sosa remained at 61 home runs, hitting only a
single, as the St. Louis Cardinals won, 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   The race, McGwire said, was last year, the race for Roger Maris'
single-season record, and he broke it with 70. Winning this year's
home run crown is less important to him than hitting 50 home runs
for four years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that getting to 50 is a piece of cake,'' McGwire
said before the first of three games against the Cubs. ``You can't
fill up one hand naming the people who got to 50 consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Two fingers should do it: Babe Ruth and Mark McGwire. Each has
done it four times. Several _ Sosa and Griffey, Jimmie Foxx and
Ralph Kiner, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays _ have twice hit 50.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night didn't seem conducive to home runs. During the
national anthem the wind at Wrigley Field was blowing toward home
plate at 16 mph. The temperature was dipping below 60. The rookie
umpire Ian Lamplugh was calling everything within reach of home
plate a strike.
</P>
<P>
   And Jon Lieber was pitching a perfect game for the Cubs. The
former Pittsburgh right-hander (8-11) retired the first 20 batters,
striking out nine. McGwire struck out twice.
</P>
<P>
   No Cub has pitched a perfect game, a record that was preserved
with two outs in the seventh inning, as McGwire lined an 0-1 pitch
into the third row of the bleachers in straightaway center field. A
Cubs fan followed the tradition of disgust, throwing the No. 59
ball onto the field, but most of the crowd of 38,085 gave McGwire a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber didn't last through the inning, giving up three homers in
a span of seven pitches _ to McGwire, Thomas Howard and J.D. Drew.
In all, the Cardinals scored seven runs in the inning. Mark
Thompson (1-2) won his first game for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' McGwire said of the turnaround. ``The way he
was pitching me, I didn't think I would make any contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa missed a home run by a few feet in the first inning,
hitting a ball into the wind to the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I hit mine a little high,'' said Sosa, who finished
the game 1 for 3 with a walk and a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was 1 for 4, leaving the game in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Flashbulbs accompanied their every swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're swinging from their heels,'' said Jerome Holtzman, the
historian for Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame and a
longtime sportswriter for Chicago newspapers. ``Of course, there's
nothing new about that. Ruth did it. Mantle did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, each team's manager swore that his pitchers
would pitch to the other guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to pitch them carefully, make them chase a pitch out
of the zone,'' said Tony La Russa, the Cardinals' manager.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he thought Sosa should get more recognition than he
has for hitting 61 home runs for such a bad team. The Cubs have won
60 games and lost 90. No player has ever hit more home runs than
his team has had victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your team's having a rough year,'' McGwire said, ``it's
not easy coming to the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have a winning percentage of .400.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year hurts me to my soul,'' the Cubs veteran Mark Grace
said. ``And I've played on some bad teams.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Sept. 21:
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, after Hurricane Floyd had come and
gone, most observers breathed a sigh of relief that the storm had
not been as dangerous and damaging as predicted. But the good
fortune that spared millions of residents along the Eastern
seaboard did not shine equally on everyone. Streams and rivers in
North Carolina and parts of Virginia and New Jersey began rising
ominously, then jumped their banks, leaving thousands of people
homeless, inundating entire towns, paralyzing commerce and causing
damage that could run into the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, northern New Jersey suffered the most when the
Raritan and other rivers and streams overflowed, ruining homes and
businesses and almost burying the town of Bound Brook. But North
Carolina was by far the hardest hit, and President Clinton, who
toured the state Monday, was visibly shocked by the damage. What
brought the state to a standstill was not the wind but the rain, 20
inches in all, which sent rivers like the Tar, the Neuse and the
Cape Fear to levels not seen in 70 years. One result was the
flooding of many thousands of acres of agricultural lowland.
Officials estimate that the toll on farmers alone could exceed $900
million.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials at both the Environmental Protection Agency
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are already searching
for lessons in the North Carolina disaster. The EPA is involved
because wastewater treatment plants have failed in lowland areas
and some factories may be leaking dangerous chemicals. There is
also the problem of agricultural runoff, which causes water
pollution even in normal times. North Carolina is the country's
largest producer of turkeys, its second-largest producer of hogs
and its third-largest producer of chickens. All these animals
generate vast amounts of waste. When the floodwaters recede, the
EPA will learn much about whether these wastes have been properly
stored and whether stronger state and federal regulation is
required.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the emergency management agency will try to
determine, as it always does, how much damage could have been
avoided if people had chosen not to build and live in the flood
plain. As it has since the Mississippi River floods of 1993, it
will also offer federal assistance to homeowners who wish to move
to higher ground and to communities that wish to protect themselves
against future floods. It is, of course, impossible to predict
floods of this magnitude. But each new disaster _ the Mississippi
flood, or the Grand Forks flood in North Dakota _ helps prepare for
the next one.

EDITORIAL: A SOVIET FIRST LADY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Sept. 21:
</P>
<P>
   When Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost began to allow the Soviet
people to complain openly, his wife was one of the first targets of
bitter, public debate. Raisa Gorbachev, who died of leukemia Monday
in Germany, was too glamorous to be a Soviet leader's wife, her
people grumbled. She wore spiked heels and fox furs at a time when
most women her age were standing for hours in Soviet bread lines.
She was too arrogant, they groused, unwilling to keep her pedantry,
as professor of communist philosophy and sociology, safely confined
to academia. Once, after she prodded her husband to say hello to a
youngster who came to see the Soviet first couple, the citizenry
reeled. This bit of wifely intervention, so normal for any
political helpmate in America, brought a wave of visceral
disapproval, even in a country that repeatedly issued empty
proclamations about the equality of Soviet women.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Mrs. Gorbachev simply declared herself the Soviet
Union's first first lady, a powerful act by a commanding woman.
Unlike most Kremlin wives, who favored mud-colored clothes and a
secure position out of sight, Mrs. Gorbachev's role was front and
center. She disrupted other upstaged wives like Nancy Reagan, who
labeled her ``arrogant'' for such stunts as appearing at a summit
that did not include spouses. Mikhail Gorbachev reported that she
also mystified his colleagues in the Kremlin, who kept asking,
``Who does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?''
</P>
<P>
   While her husband was the Soviet leader, Mrs. Gorbachev was his
closest ally. An expert on Marxist-Leninist philosophy, she helped
him oversee the end of the Soviet era. A sociologist, she toured
areas where her husband would attract too much official attention,
bringing back vital research on how people actually lived. On trips
abroad, Mrs. Gorbachev might veer into a shopping mall to get an
unvarnished view.
</P>
<P>
   Almost eight years after her husband's resignation and three
years after his pathetic efforts to be elected Russian president,
Mrs. Gorbachev, like her husband, is still more admired outside her
own country than within. Abroad, she is seen as a modern partner
who tried to help turn the old Soviet Union into a modern Russian
state.

RHUBARB SPRINGS FROM `FIELD OF DREAMS' BASEBALL DIAMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DYERSVILLE, Iowa _ In the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' the ghost
of Shoeless Joe Jackson emerges from a stand of corn onto a
baseball outfield and asks: ``Is this heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kevin Costner's young farmer character responds ``No,
it's Iowa,'' the film implies that the hereafter has a rival in the
base paths and a backstop amid Midwestern farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Fans charmed by the movie's romance with baseball and farm life
have come here ever since, chasing fly balls and nostalgia on the
movie set playing field.
</P>
<P>
   But this piece of Iowa is heaven no more.
</P>
<P>
   The field's caretakers _ Becky and Don Lansing own most of the
infield and right field, Rita and Al Ameskamp hold deed to left and
center fields _ can't seem to get along.
</P>
<P>
   In a conflict perhaps as American as the game the field
celebrates, the Lansings and Ameskamps peddle souvenirs out of
competing shacks and regularly settle scores at meetings of the
county zoning panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' Don Lansing said. ``It takes away from the
field and the fun for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel real bad about it every day,'' echoed Rita Ameskamp.
``It's all about one word _ control.''
</P>
<P>
   The field remains a pleasant, if out-of-the-way, stop. On Labor
Day, families streamed to the field throughout the day to pose for
pictures where Costner, James Earl Jones, Burt Lancaster and Ray
Liotta brought to life the novel Shoeless Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heads up.'' A foul ball sails over the backstop. Another
whack, as ash slaps horsehide. In the informal batting practice
here, everybody swings not for the fences but for the corn. A
grade-schooler connects with a pitch. ``Atta boy!''
</P>
<P>
   An overhead power line marks each family's portion of the field,
but the grass is equally green on both sides, and the division
around third base is seamless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lansings say the Ameskamps sully the field with too much
commercialization. The Ameskamps say they're only doing what the
Lansings have done for a decade: making money off the movie.
</P>
<P>
   So now tourists coming down the gravel road tend to pause at the
entrances to two lanes, separated by a few yards, leading to the
field. The Lansings' sign beckons visitors to the ``Original Field
of Dreams Movie Site.'' The Ameskamps' hails travelers into the
``Left &AMP; Center Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It confused me for a second,'' said Myra Hayes of
Indianapolis. ``But then we figured out that they both go to the
same place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood came to Dyersville in 1988, when producers went
looking for an idyllic Iowa farmstead. The white two-story home
with the wraparound porch where Don Lansing was born, and where his
family has lived for more than 90 years, fit their vision.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 weeks, he moved out and the filmmakers moved in. They
filmed Costner walking his cornfield and hearing a bodiless voice
promise ``If you build it, he will come.'' To the consternation of
his wife and the puzzled looks of his neighbors, Costner's
character carves a playing field out of the edge of his cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   His seemingly irrational decision to put a baseball diamond in
the middle of nowhere eventually brings the farmer peace with the
memory of his late father and saves the farm when people pay to
watch games there.
</P>
<P>
   After the filming, Lansing left his portion of the field intact.
``I thought it was neat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The film first screened in late April 1989. By early May of that
year, Lansing said, ``people just started showing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists had to settle for most of the dreamy field. The
Ameskamps had plowed their land again and planted corn.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing began selling T-shirts, he said, to offset the cost of
keeping up the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 people came that first summer. By the spring of
1990, both families realized the attraction ``Field of Dreams'' had
made of their farmland. The Ameskamps restored their portion of the
ball field.
</P>
<P>
   Since they rebuilt it, the people have come. About 15,000 that
summer. Fantasy camps and exhibitions put on by Ghost Players teams
wearing old Chicago White Sox uniforms more than doubled those
numbers in subsequent years. This season, Dyersville is on track to
attract nearly 55,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so neat,'' said Mark Mason, who brought his two teen-age
sons with him from Effingham, Ill. ``It looks just like the movie,
and you don't have to pay anything to throw around a ball. My boys
will remember this their whole lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lansings met when Becky, a fan of the movie traveling from
her Boulder, Colo., home to see a cousin in Wisconsin, took a side
trip to the field in the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They married the next year, about the time the Ameskamps brought
in investors to manage their operation and the competition between
the two owners began to grow more tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al has been fighting cancer for the last four years,'' said
Keith Rahe, who manages the Ameskamps' part of the field. ``I don't
think it's so bad that they should have this income for their
retirement years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lansings see nothing wrong with capitalizing on the luck
that made a movie set of three acres in eastern Iowa. But it's a
matter of scale, they say.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ameskamps sought a zoning change to put in batting
cages, the Lansings blocked them. When the Ameskamps wanted to
expand their gift shop, the Lansings got the county zoning board to
prevent the building of anything larger than their own. (Both sides
sell jerseys and caps and key chains. The Lansings have replaced
the white fence that circled their house in the movie with a vinyl
facsimile and sell pickets from the original for $25 apiece.)
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the spat brought an end to organized games. Now
the Ghost Players, a traveling exhibition team that includes a few
extras from the film, perform their comedy routine using only left
and center fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Rahe said, ``neighbors can't help fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Things grew more bitter this summer, when the Ameskamps' Left &AMP;
Center outfit enlisted a seed company to sponsor the making of
``the most colossal corn maze on earth'' _ as their Web site calls
it _ beyond the outfield and charged $6 a head for tourists to poke
their way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just the last straw for us,'' Becky Lansing said.
``It shows they have no respect for what's special out here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, the Lansings and the Ameskamps talked about
managing the field jointly, maybe running a single gift shop. But
every meeting only left each side angrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to get together and run it as one operation,''
Rita Ameskamp said. ``But the percentage they would give us was
nothing. They must feel that their side is more important to them
than ours is to us. We think ours is important because the ghost
players came out of our (corn) field....
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ever going to get any better between us.''

POLICE CHIEF URGES DISCIPLINE FOR COMMANDER IN GROWING   LAPD
SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE, LISA VAN PROYEN AND TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Mayor Richard Riordan and other officials vowed
swift and thorough action in the LAPD corruption scandal, Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks announced Monday that a commander who knew
about a brutality case and ``chose not to take appropriate action''
has been recommended for discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Capt. Richard Meraz, said he is being unfairly
punished in the scandal that has so far led to a dozen Los Angeles
Police Department officers being suspended, disciplined or fired.
He called the penalty ``severe,'' short of demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel just a whole myriad of emotions from anger to sadness
to disillusionment,'' said Meraz, a 35-year veteran who now
commands the LAPD's Central Division. ``I feel that the decisions
that I made at the time were correct decisions and I don't agree
that the discipline should be as severe as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would seek a Board of Rights, an internal trial by
command staff officers to ``give me the opportunity to give my side
of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Meraz is accused of knowing about the alleged beating of Ismael
Jimenez, who claims he vomited blood three times in February 1998
after being handcuffed and beaten at the Rampart Division by
Officer Brian Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   In another development in the rapidly expanding scandal, Police
Commission President Gerald L. Chaleff said the commission is
committed to a ``thorough, objective and wide-ranging''
investigation and that Inspector General Jeff Eglash would have
full access to oversee the internal probe.
</P>
<P>
   And Riordan promised to make sure the LAPD was cleaned up as
quickly as possible and expressed his support for Parks' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate, disappointing and disgusting that a police
officer would violate the laws he or she is sworn to uphold,''
Riordan said. ``Do not let a few evil officers ruin the reputation
of the entire police force.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was triggered when Officer Rafael Perez
pleaded guilty to stealing cocaine from LAPD custody and agreed to
cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he and his Rampart Division partner, Nino Durden,
shot Javier Francisco Ovando, 22, an illegal Honduran immigrant,
then planted an assault rifle on him. Ovando, left paralyzed, was
released Thursday after three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy swirled about his whereabouts and whether he is
being treated properly by LAPD officials who have been interviewing
him since his release.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said Ovando is voluntarily cooperating with police and can
telephone or meet whoever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ovando is in Los Angeles and he has the opportunity to
leave,'' Parks said. ``He has met with friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, called for Ovando's
release, saying he is concerned about the LAPD holding him in
``persuasive custody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is unique in relation to a Police
Department that is charged with wrongdoing and is holding a person
who may become a witness against them on down the road,'' Hayden
said. ``There is no moral foundation for the very department which
apparently abused and nearly took Mr. Ovando's life to continue to
keep him in unexplained protective custody.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on Parks to set up a meeting between himself and
Ovando to clear up the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the investigation _ the most extensive inquiry into
LAPD misconduct since the late 1930s _ is widening. It focused on
illegal shootings, drug dealing, excessive force and ``code of
silence'' violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be developing a Board of Inquiry today to look at all
of the systems that impact Rampart,'' the chief said. ``We will be
looking at all of our systems involved with use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks pledged to cooperate fully with the Police Commission in
its probe, but said he also has a responsibility to ensure that
information the department releases doesn't raise the risk that the
city could be sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Department has the responsibility to protect and
assist the city in keeping liability down to reduce future
litigation,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaleff said he has assurances from Parks that Eglash will be
granted ``full access'' to LAPD reports and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I will have access to everything involved in the
investigation and I will report the findings back to the
commission,'' Eglash said. ``The commission has made it clear to
the chief that they want me to have unrestricted access, and I will
continue being their eyes and ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said his discipline record shows his commitment to clean
up the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have terminated over 70 people in the last 18 months for
severe misconduct,'' he said. ``We have sent a clear message that
misconduct, particularly criminal misconduct, will not be
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti said he will seek a 30-day
suspension of the injunction against the 18th Street gang because
evidence used to support the injunction might be tainted.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Officer Rafael Perez was a gang officer whose
declarations we relied on, we will go into court today to ask the
court to suspend the injunction for 30 days while we determine if
the injunction is credible,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   The injunctions are designed to prevent gang street violence by
prohibiting gang members from associating with one another, wearing
pagers and their colors or intimidating businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rafael Perez is just the beginning,'' Garcetti said. ``We are
going to follow every lead. We are adding personnel to our
prosecution team. I will do everything I have to to get to the
bottom of this.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the attorneys for Ovando's 2-year-old daughter,
Destiny, criticized the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all the statements from last Thursday, they
have changed continually. One day he's in police protective custody
and the next he is free to go,'' said Gary Frischer, a spokesman
for the attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ovando spoke by telephone with the girl's mother,
Monique Valenzuela, who was ``reduced to tears during the call,''
Frischer said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Ovando said detectives have told him that she
does not want him to see their child, Frischer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is totally false ... We want to reunite the daughter with
her father ... This is a heartbreaking situation,'' Frischer said.
``If he is free to come and go, one would think that he would come
to see his daughter, who he's never seen.''

APPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST PUNITIVE ACTION BY EPA [START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency cannot seek penalties against a company for
violating hazardous-waste laws if state regulators already have
taken enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling from a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in St. Louis may affect federal enforcement
actions across the nation, far beyond the interests of Harmon
Industries, a Blue Springs manufacturer of railroad safety
equipment that initiated the federal court litigation. EPA hit the
company with a $2.7 million penalty in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to affect EPA throughout the (judicial) circuit
and, possibly, throughout the country,'' Robert Payne, corporate
counsel at Harmon Industries, said Monday. ``Others will look at
this as a well-reasoned resolution to the question.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA and Justice Department officials said no decision on an
appeal had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the EPA is concerned that this ruling will have a negative
impact on the federal enforcement program,'' said Cristine Romano,
a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington. ``It creates doubt
whether EPA can assist states in enforcing hazardous-waste cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo., lawyer Terry Satterlee, who represented Harmon
in the litigation, said some lawyers are speculating whether the
case might also affect the way EPA enforces its federal clean-air
and clean-water laws. ``But that's yet to be determined,''
Satterlee said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that a federal court has ruled on the
enforcement authority of EPA in states that have authority to
enforce the hazardous-waste law known as the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, Satterlee said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental leaders in Missouri raised concerns about the
decision. ``This is a concern because of the weak enforcement
decisions and settlements by the state,'' said Ken Midkiff of the
Sierra Club in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Midkiff said he didn't think the ruling would affect potential
federal action against Premium Standard Farms, a Missouri-based hog
producer. Earlier this year, the EPA announced it would investigate
the company's compliance with the federal Clean Water Act. But
state officials had just settled numerous violations with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, the EPA has given its authority to state
regulatory agencies to enforce the federal hazardous-waste law. But
across the nation, it has levied penalty and enforcement actions in
several instances in which the state has been delegated authority
to enforce the hazardous waste law. Those are the type of cases
that might be affected by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate ruling from St. Louis, filed last week, springs
from 1987, when Harmon notified state hazardous waste officials
that it had learned its employees had dumped hazardous chemicals
behind the company's Grain Valley plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Natural Resources investigated and
was negotiating an agreement with Harmon about how it would clean
up the contamination. As part of the deal, state regulators
eventually agreed not to impose penalties on Harmon, partly as a
reward for voluntarily reporting its violations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the EPA levied its penalty, saying Harmon had dumped
toxic solvents on the ground from 1973 to 1987. EPA officials said
at the time that the federal agency had grown impatient waiting for
state regulators to take enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, through an administrative appeals process, the fine was
reduced to $586,716.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon decided to fight the penalty in federal court, saying the
EPA didn't have the authority to issue the penalty since it had
delegated authority to Missouri officials to enforce the federal
hazardous-waste law.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Ortrie Smith sided with Harmon in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA appealed the ruling, contending that the language of the
act allows it to initiate an enforcement action against a violator
even in states where state regulators enforce the law. All it needs
to do is notify the state in writing if it intends to initiate the
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's attorneys argued that in such situations states have
been granted enforcement authority in lieu of the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen industry groups, including the American Forest
&AMP; Paper Association and the American Petroleum Institute, filed
briefs in support of Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point of working with the state agencies that are
supposed to have the authority and competence if the feds can veto
any resolution you reach with the state?'' said Payne, the
corporate counsel at Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Payne added that a ruling against Harmon would also have sent a
message to industry that it doesn't pay to voluntarily report its
violations.

SHEFFIELD GETS HIS WIRES CROSSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even in a forgettable season, Gary Sheffield took
the thought to an extreme.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing an MRI exam on his ailing right knee Monday
afternoon, Sheffield returned to his Bel Air home instead of
driving to Dodger Stadium for his game against the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived home, Sheffield was greeted by his surprised
wife, Deleon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `What are you doing here? Don't you have a game
tonight?''' Sheffield said. ``They usually don't schedule MRI's on
game days. It was Monday and I just thought we didn't have a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield got back in the car and arrived at Dodger Stadium
around 5 p.m. Manager Davey Johnson had Sheffield in the starting
lineup and allowed him to play despite missing batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mix-up, that's all; I'm not bothered by that,''
Johnson said. ``They don't usually do MRIs on game days.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson probably cut him some slack because despite knee and
shoulder problems, Sheffield has been one of the most durable and
productive Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has 27 homers and 89 RBI, is tied with Eric
Karros for second in games played on the club (142) behind Raul
Mondesi (147).
</P>
<P>
   The MRI revealed no structural damage in his right knee but
found scar tissue from an old injury around a ligament that has
caused discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who underwent surgery on his right shoulder last
winter, said he was told by doctors that an offseason
rehabilitation program should properly strengthen the knee and
shoulder by spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia out: Mike Scioscia, the longtime Dodgers catcher who
became the manager at Triple-A Albuquerque this season, will not
return next year.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone would not confirm Scioscia's
ouster, saying, ``It is a little premature to discuss anything like
that. We are still in the process of evaluating our minor-league
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who served as the Dodgers bench coach the previous two
seasons, guided Albuquerque to a 65-74 record in the Pacific Coast
League Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Scioscia and long-time third-base coach Joey Amalfitano
survived a purge of the Dodgers coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   But after manager Davey Johnson took over, Scioscia was
reassigned and Amalfitano left the organization to join the San
Francisco Giants minor-league department.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, a member of two World Series-winning teams with the
Dodgers, previously managed in 1997 in the Arizona Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are in the midst of evaluating their major-league
coaching staff and expect to make a decision on their futures
before the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff includes Glenn Hoffman (third base), Claude
Osteen (pitching), Rick Down (hitting), Jim Tracy (dugout), Rick
Dempsey (bullpen), John Shelby (first base).
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort uncertain: Right-hander Darren Dreifort, bothered by
shoulder trouble the past two weeks, might be done for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, limited to just four innings last Wednesday, was
scratched for tonight's start and replaced by minor-league
left-hander Jeff Williams..
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort will throw in the bullpen Thursday. If all goes well he
could start Sunday against San Diego in the final home game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is any discomfort, we'll shut him down for the
rest of the year,'' Johnson said.

CD-ROM CARRIES LESSON IN LIQUOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The war against binge drinking on college
campuses has featured many weapons _ alcohol bans, lectures,
newspaper advertisements, alcohol awareness sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Now some colleges are using a new weapon appropriate for these
high-tech times. Alcohol 101 is an interactive CD-ROM that walks
students through a virtual party and virtual bar to teach them
about the dangers of drinking too much.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Karen McCarthy, a Democrat from Kansas City, Mo., said
during a demonstration Monday at Rockhurst University that Alcohol
101 could be an important tool in the battle to keep students
responsible about their intake of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I had no idea what the effects of
alcohol were on my body,'' she said. ``This will help students
understand the effects of alcohol and the choices we choose to make
when we use alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol 101 was developed by the University of Illinois and paid
for by the Century Council, a group of American liquor distillers.
It is aimed at fighting drunken driving and underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Rockhurst already has been using Alcohol 101 as part of an
educational program for underage students caught drinking, said Liz
Brent, vice president for student development.
</P>
<P>
   But some Rockhurst students who checked out the program Monday
said they thought the new weapon probably would have the same
effect on campus drinking that others have had _ not much.
</P>
<P>
   The program will get students' attention because it shows how
quickly alcohol streams through a drinker's blood, impairing the
person's judgment and balance, said Mary Klump, an 18-year-old
Rockhurst freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But students enjoying a party on a weekend probably won't make
their decisions based on a CD-ROM they used weeks or months before,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and other students said their peers would react more
strongly to firsthand accounts of how alcohol destroyed a person's
life, not to computer simulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (CD) seems kind of funny, kind of goofy,'' said Casey
McGraw, a 21-year-old Rockhurst student from Independence who has
lived on campus for four years.
</P>
<P>
   He said it doesn't show the real-life effect drinking can have
on alcoholics and their families, as well as the victims of
drunken-driving accidents.

COWBOYS TAKE TIMEOUT AT HALF TO CELEBRATE PAST
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ One hundred eight former Cowboys, members of
teams spanning the franchise's 40 years in the NFL, took the field
once again Monday night at Texas Stadium in a star-studded
celebration of the organization's history.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the old Cowboys hobbled out, some trotted and others
walked out from under the giant inflatable Cowboys helmet leading
out of the tunnel. Then came Hall of Fame member Tony Dorsett.
Looking like he could still make a linebacker stand in quicksand,
Dorsett jogged onto the field, then unexpectedly struck the Heisman
pose. Dorsett won the Heisman Trophy in 1976 at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett received one of the loudest welcomes from the sellout
crowd, along with fellow Hall of Fame members Roger Staubach, Bob
Lilly and Randy White, and Cowboy Ring of Honor members Drew
Pearson and Ed ``Too Tall'' Jones. Among others who lined up on the
field between arches made of white and blue balloons, were Lee Roy
Jordan, Chuck Howley and Mel Renfro.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his way off the field, Dorsett spiked the football in
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Dorsett mocked scoring a touchdown, his successor,
Emmitt Smith, scored one on the first series of the third quarter.
In doing so, Smith passed Dorsett for fourth place among the NFL's
career rushing leaders.

FALCONS NOTES: NO MIRACLES THIS TIME (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dan Reeves had said it would take a miracle for
Chris Chandler to start at quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at Texas Stadium, there were no miracles in sight.
So the Falcons were forced to face the Cowboys with 25-year-old
Tony Graziani, whose resume includes a 24.4 career passer rating,
in place of the man who led Atlanta to the Super Bowl last season.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who suffered a strained right hamstring late in last
week's season-opening loss to Minnesota, limped noticeably as he
went through pregame warmups and was designated as Atlanta's
emergency third quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Falcons' offense in the hands of Graziani, a
third-year man from Oregon who made only his third NFL start.
Graziani was lifted in the third quarter after completing 7 of 16
passes for 90 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. He
also fumbled at the Atlanta 24 early in the third quarter, setting
up a Cowboys touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   For his career, Graziani is 30-of-72 for 330 yards with no
scores and five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTAIN HOOKED: When Tony Graziani took the opening snap of the
third quarter, it marked the first time in his career he has
started the second half of a game. He was pulled at halftime of his
two previous starts. He was 8-for-18 for 102 yards with one
interception in the first half against St. Louis last season and
went 4-for-18 for 24 yards and two interceptions against Carolina
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while he made it into the third quarter Monday night,
Graziani watched the fourth from the sideline again. The longest
stint of his career ended when Danny Kanell replaced him with 1:05
remaining in the third quarter. Kanell didn't fare much better,
throwing two incompletions and taking a sack in his first series.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT BLUES: Some teams relish the prime-time stage that
comes with Monday night games, but the Falcons aren't among them.
Atlanta's most recent Monday night victory came in a wild 31-30
upset of Minnesota on Nov. 23, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have lost their past nine Monday games, a streak
that includes a 41-17 drubbing by the Cowboys in 1992. Atlanta's
overall Monday night record is an unenviable 5-16, including 1-8 on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ANDERSEN'S STREAK ALIVE: Kicker Morten Andersen's scoring streak
appeared to be in jeopardy until the Falcons scored with 4 minutes
remaining Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With his point-after touchdown, Andersen has scored in an
NFL-record 239 consecutive games, including 66 for the Falcons.
That's two games short of the franchise record of 68, held by Mick
Luckhurst (1981-85). Andersen has scored in every game he played
since Week 15 of the 1983 season, when he was kicking for New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY: Falcons coach and former Cowboy Dan Reeves isn't too
fond of returning to Texas Stadium. He is 0-5 as a visiting coach
with Denver, the New York Giants and Atlanta. He had not previously
faced the Cowboys as Atlanta's coach ... In addition to Chris
Chandler and Jamal Anderson, several other Falcons spent time on
the bench with injuries Monday night. Defensive tackle Travis Hall
(hip) and wide receiver Chris Calloway (right knee) were both
knocked out of the game in the second quarter. Both returned in the
second half.

FARMLAND CEO IS STEPPING DOWN BUT NOT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ To get the merger he wants, Harry Cleberg has
to give up the job he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most difficult decision of my career,'' Cleberg
said Monday in the Kansas City headquarters of Farmland Industries
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The South Dakota native has led Farmland since April 1991. He
has been in its management ranks since 1977. His Farmland ties
stretch back 40 years to when he joined South Dakota Wheat Growers,
which is the largest equity owner of Farmland, a farmer-owned
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   At 61, Cleberg is leaving his post as president and chief
executive officer early. Most chief executives his age would be
looking forward to at least four more years on the top corporate
rung.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleberg has agreed to step down as part of Farmland's merger
agreement with Cenex Harvest States Cooperatives. Noel Estenson,
Cleberg's counterpart at Minnesota-based Cenex, made the same
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cleberg explained why. To win approval from both
cooperatives' member-owners, neither top manager could claim the
top job, even with the backing of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed early on that that probably wouldn't work,'' Cleberg
said. ``If there was a perception that one or the other was the
victor in running the company, it could impair the (support) of the
ownership community.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the merger might not win approval from members of the
co-op whose chief executive didn't get the job.
</P>
<P>
   Member-owners of both co-ops will vote on the merger in
November. A two-thirds approval from each is required.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the unique structure of a cooperative made the
decision necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike publicly traded companies, cooperatives are owned by the
people and companies that do business with them. Furthermore, the
return on members' ownership is based on how much business they do
with the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the result was much more contact between owners of
a cooperative and its chief executive. He said a cooperative was
more like a partnership than a publicly traded company in which
owners come and go.
</P>
<P>
   So the top executives each agreed to clear the deck for new
leadership on March 1, when Farmland and Cenex are expected to
merge as United Country Brands. The new operation will have its
headquarters in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, Bob Honse, Farmland's chief operating officer, will
become United Country's first chief executive officer. He is
scheduled to give way in four years to John Johnson, who will be
president of United Country Brands and is now the No. 2 executive
at Cenex Harvest States.
</P>
<P>
   Estenson and Cleberg will remain as advisers to United Country
Brands through the end of 2000. Cleberg said Monday that he might
continue with projects that carry on beyond 2000. Otherwise, he's
looking for a second career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clara and I are evaluating what my, and our, next career will
be,'' Cleberg said of his plans with his wife of 40 years. ``We
have never used the term `retirement.' I don't plan to ever
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said he would consider a second business career; his
contract prevents him from competing against Farmland until he
turns 65.
</P>
<P>
   He would consider a government post. He would consider a
nonprofit organization and has been involved with several area
groups for years.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the door is wide open _ but with one caveat. Cleberg
plans to stay in his adopted hometown of Kansas City, where the
Clebergs have lived since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever career Cleberg chooses, he said, it will allow more
time for his civic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   That was welcome news to Guyla Stidmon, executive director of
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Greater Kansas City.
Cleberg is the longtime chairman of the group's advisory board and
a past president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably is one of the most effective advocates I've ever
seen,'' Stidmon said. ``Wherever he is, he always remembers his
other causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg is a trustee, adviser, director or board member of 17
area businesses and civic groups.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City,
director and past chairman of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce and the chairman of this year's Heart of America United
Way campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg serves on the board of governors at the National
Agricultural Center and Hall of Fame in Bonner Springs. He has been
on the board of governors of the American Royal Association since
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He is a director of three St. Luke's area hospitals, Commerce
Bank of Kansas City and Payless Cashways Inc. He is a trustee of
the Midwest Research Institute and the St. Paul School of Theology
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg says he hasn't been as involved civically as he would
like. And his departure offers him the chance to rework his
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to remain active,'' he said. ``We're just deciding
where and which direction.''

 CONGRESS STUDIES RAPIDLY CHANGING FACE OF iNTERNET AND iNDIAN (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As legalized gambling spreads, industry lines are
starting to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Marriages of tribal and corporate casinos, slot machines and
racetracks, the Internet and everybody come at a time when the
nation's gambling laws have never been murkier or more
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal lawmakers' plates are heaped with hot-potato
gambling issues, and none is hotter for Congress than deciding
whether to ignore, regulate or outlaw the explosion of Internet
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawmakers also soon must sort out the muddled state of
American Indian gambling, which has pitted tribes desperate for
casino revenue against state governments resistant to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Both topics were discussed last week at the World Gaming
Congress convention, along with the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission report, which was issued in June.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, after spending $5 million and two years
researching the state of gambling in America, cooked up a casserole
of 76 recommendations that ranged from criminalization of Internet
gambling to the need for more research and public education.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not answer the big question of whether America's
infatuation with wagering had become a malignant obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it called for a nationwide ``pause'' in gambling
expansion while states and gambling-host communities conduct their
own economic- and social-impact studies and then reach their own
hard decisions on whether to expand, contract or even abolish
regional gambling activity.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly what the gambling industry _ or its opponents _
wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking whatever they want out of it to advance
their own position,'' said Rick Hill, chairman of the National
Indian Gaming Association, which represents 168 of the 195 U.S.
tribes that offer legal casino or bingo gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of the commission's own members acknowledges a lack of
interest by the American public and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the report will disappear,'' J. Terrence Lanni,
chairman and chief executive of MGM Grand Inc., said last week in
remarks to delegates at the international gambling industry's
largest annual trade show.
</P>
<P>
   But at its heart, Lanni added, the commission's work did reflect
the mood of the American public _ compassion for addicted gamblers
but a demand for legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the report fades away, those paramount issues will not.
As wagering becomes ever more widespread, Congress must resolve the
profound issue of Internet gambling and the politically touchy
matter of tribal gambling.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 nations, mostly in the Third World, license and tax
online gambling enterprises that operate through 700 sites on the
World Wide Web. The number grows almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, the most watched developments are in
Australia, which recently permitted its states and territories to
individually license and regulate sports and racetrack betting on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. gamblers are beginning to discover these legal bookies Down
Under who gladly accept wagers from anywhere in the world _
seemingly daring legal retaliation from Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sports book American Wagering Inc. of Nevada holds one
of the Australian licenses. American is the only online Australian
operator not accepting U.S. bets, but only because that action
could jeopardize its U.S. licenses.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bother American's CEO, Vic Salerno, who said he was
convinced that his company had taken the Internet plunge in the
right nation and at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   And if the United States never joins the global cyber party,
Salerno said, so what? ``There's enough money left out there
outside of the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robust international betting on events such as World Cup soccer,
Formula I auto racing, cricket and rugby ``makes the NFL (sports
books) look like child's play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gordon, an Australian territorial government gambling
regulator, predicted at one World Gaming Congress seminar last week
that Australian regulatory and consumer protection statutes would
become the model as other rich nations, one by one, accept the
inevitability of worldwide cyber gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the First World's foremost society debates whether to
ban Internet gambling and almost certainly usher in a new
Prohibition era _ this time featuring bootleg e-commerce sports
bookies and slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Current U.S. law on gambling by ``wire'' communications was
written in the 1960s, tying the hands of federal prosecutors with
statutes that never imagined the legal complexities of offshore
cyber casinos and bookies with toll-free phone lines, and bank
accounts that can afford huge U.S. advertising budgets and platoons
of silk-tie lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona, for two years has been
pushing for outright prohibition of such high-tech gambling, and
his Senate Bill 692 is heading toward a floor vote this fall. House
action is not expected until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri is a co-sponsor of the Kyl
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bond spokesman Dan Hubbard acknowledged
the technological challenge of enforcing a nationwide ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's no reason to throw up your hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond has concerns about the spread of gambling that defies
international boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these are based offshore,'' Hubbard said. ``You can't
regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier failed versions of the Kyl bill would have made
criminals of Internet casino executives and their customers. In the
latest version the public is let off the hook, as are
fantasy-sports players and some pari-mutuel wagering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The national commission bolstered Kyl with its own call for a
ban, criminal prosecution and even diplomatic pressure from the
United States on nations that ``harbor Internet gambling
organizations that prey on U.S. citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have serious doubts the Internet can be controlled by the
federal government,'' Lanni said.
</P>
<P>
   One idea out there would make cyber-gambling police of the U.S.
banking industry, whose plastic accounts are the currency of choice
for many in the online betting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Barring the use of U.S. credit cards for Internet wagering would
certainly put a damper on casual gamblers, but such legislation
could be difficult to pass and would be a nightmare for the banking
industry to implement.
</P>
<P>
   And for serious gamblers, there still would be many ways around
a credit block _ money orders and Australian or European
bank-issued credit cards, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, commercial casino companies such as Station
Casinos Inc. are aggressively positioning themselves for the
cyber-gambling era by teaming up with online operators.
</P>
<P>
   Indian tribes are in court fighting for the right to establish
multistate bingo, lottery and casino games that offer big jackpots.
One such tribal Internet lottery case is scheduled to be argued
Thursday in a Kansas City federal courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so un-American to back away from a challenge,'' said
Jacob L. Coin, executive director of the tribal gaming association.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (in Congress) fear the Internet because they don't
understand it. So they are just going to ban it ... run and hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look to what Australia is doing. Let's learn from them.
Let's find a way to benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to a court ruling, Congress in 1988 laid out a statutory
framework allowing American Indian tribes to offer high-stakes
bingo games and casino-style gambling on their historic reservation
lands.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since, almost no one is satisfied with how those
laws have played out. A congressional revision of the law seems
inevitable in the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are tangled ones.
</P>
<P>
   Few states receive taxes or significant revenue from what has
blossomed into an $8 billion-a-year industry.
</P>
<P>
   The states' regulatory role is often minimal. Worse, governors _
Kansas' Bill Graves among them _ increasingly argue that states'
rights have been trampled in a headlong rush to nurture needy
tribes with this ``new buffalo'' of tribal sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes, meanwhile, interpret assertion of states' rights as
an assault on their sovereignty as legally independent nations.
</P>
<P>
   That stance irritates the commercial casino industry, which
competes with the tribes but must pay taxes and conform to tight
state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, each tribe regulates itself in conformance with
broad federal rules that demand very little public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Native American tribes need to be a little less geared to
using sovereignty to protect themselves,'' said MGM's Lanni.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have to disclose information like the rest of us.
Native Americans should come into the (gaming industry)
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk also rankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tribes feel under attack,'' Coin said. ``Instead of applauding
the early successes of Indian gaming, there are those who are
trying to undermine it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Coin said, ``is that the quality of life on
tribal reservations is improving'' solely because of gambling
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal law expert and Minnesota lawyer Tom Foley told World
Gaming Congress delegates that Indian gambling was entering a new
era.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game of politics now,'' he said. ``Tremendous
dollars are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial casino industry and state officials will push
Congress to level the playing field with tribal gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes will resist.
</P>
<P>
   Coin stated the tribes' case eloquently last week in Las Vegas
in remarks that defiantly recalled centuries of injustice:
</P>
<P>
   ``When our children are as healthy as yours, when our futures
are as bright as yours, then we can talk about a level playing
field.''

COWBOYS NOTES: ELLIS GOES ALL THE WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ What a difference a year has made for defensive
end Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Previously known as the player the Cowboys drafted in the first
round of the 1998 NFL draft instead of Randy Moss, Ellis has become
a bit of a second-year phenomenon. In the season opener, he was the
lone bright spot on the Cowboys' defense with two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   In last night's 24-7 defeat of Atlanta, Ellis tipped a Danny
Kanell pass with about one minute to play in the game and hauled it
in for his first career interception, returning it 87 yards for a
touchdown. The play was the fifth-longest return for an
interception in Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   ISMAIL SHOWS WORTH: Raghib Ismail, sprained his left shoulder on
a play that again demonstrated why the Cowboys signed the wide
receiver. On third-and-13 from the Atlanta 47-yard line, Ismail
hauled in a Troy Aikman pass in the middle of the field, split the
defenders and was off. Ray Buchanan and Keith Thibodeaux finally
dragged him down, dropping him hard on his left shoulder at the 9.
</P>
<P>
   The catch led to a touchdown to give the Cowboys a 10-0 lead.
Ismail returned on the Cowboys' first series of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail missed most of training camp when he separated the same
shoulder on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   TWO-WAY PLAYER: Rookie defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban debuted on
offense during the Cowboys' first-quarter touchdown drive. With the
Cowboys on the Falcons' 3-yard line, Ekuban lined up on first down
as a blocking tight end in motion. Emmitt Smith followed his lead
on a dive for 1 yard.
</P>
<P>
   On second down, Ekuban moved to the left side of the line in a
two tight-end set. This time, Ekuban stuffed right end Chuck Smith
allowing Emmitt Smith to walk around left end and into the end zone
for a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   NO GO ON FG: The Cowboys passed up an opportunity to take
advantage of an obscure and rarely implemented rule.
</P>
<P>
   If a half or the game ends with a fair catch on a punt, the
receiving team can take a free kick, an unobstructed field goal
from the spot of the fair catch.
</P>
<P>
   Wane McGarity made a fair catch of a Dan Stryzinski punt on the
Atlanta 47 as time expired in the first half. Leading 10-0, the
Cowboys opted not to attempt what would have been a 64-yard field.
The NFL record is 63 yards set by Tom Dempsey and matched by the
Broncos' Jason Elam.
</P>
<P>
   SERVING UP FALCON: Troy Aikman entered the game 3-1 against the
Falcons as a starting quarterback. The following is a list of
Aikman's statistics in those four starts against Atlanta: Date
score statistics 9/17/89 at Atlanta L,27-21 13-23-2-241, 1 TD
12/21/92 at Atlanta W,41-17 18-21-0-239, 3 TDs 10/29/95 at Atlanta
W,28-13 19-25-1-198, 2 TDs 10/20/96 vs. Atlanta W,32-28
17-24-0-265, 2 TDs 9/20/99 vs. Atlanta W,24-7 10-22-2-109, 0 TDs
</P>
<P>
   SANDERS SITS: Deion Sanders' status for last night's game was
going to be a game-timedecision, however Sanders clearly made his
decision well before game time. Sanders was decked out in his usual
practice grays several hours before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders continues to say he will not play until he is 100
percent. His projected return is Oct. 30, after this week's bye,
when the Cowboys play host to division rival Arizona, the team he
hurt his big toe against last season.
</P>

strained right quadricep. Did not return. Tony Hutson started at
right tackle

TWO ENCEPHALITIS CASES IN WESTCHESTER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two people in Westchester County have contracted the potentially
deadly mosquito-borne disease St. Louis encephalitis, county
officials announced Monday night, in the first cases in the current
outbreak reported outside of New York City. The officials said that
they would begin spraying pesticide on the southern third of the
county on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A third person is considered highly likely to have the disease,
said the County health commissioner, Dr. Harold N. Adel.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the confirmed patients _ a man from Yonkers in his
70's and a Mount Vernon resident in his 50's _ nor the likely case,
a 57-year-old woman from Port Chester, has died from the disease,
officials said. One of the victims is recovering in a hospital, one
is listed in stable condition and a third is recovering at home,
the officials added without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are not sure whether the victims were exposed to the
virus in Westchester County, but they said two of the three had
recently visited neighborhoods in New York City where cases had
been reported. Since the disease was first reported in New York
City three weeks ago, Westchester officials have been sending
mosquito samples to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to be tested, and no encephalitis has been found in any
of the 350 mosquitoes tested so far, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Adel said at a news conference that ``it would be imprudent
not to take action,'' adding that the county felt it had no choice
but to begin spraying. The county will use a pesticide called
Anvil, derived from an ingredient found in chrysanthemums, that is
considered less toxic than the malathion that is now being sprayed
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although no pesticide can be considered completely harmless,
this is the safest type of pesticide available for the task,'' Adel
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Westchester is scheduled to begin spraying the
entire county south of Interstate 287, home to most of its
population, as well as three communities north and east of the
interstate that border Connecticut: Port Chester, Harrison and Rye
Brook.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where 12 cases of encephalitis have been
confirmed, three of them fatal, and 10 more cases are considered
probable, officials said the news from their northern neighbor
would not affect the city's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already doing what we felt we had to do to prevent
additional cases,'' said Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the
city's Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the latest spraying campaign in the city,
helicopters, planes and trucks are scheduled to visit parts of
Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island today, unless there is rain or
fog.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sept. 3, there have been 108 possible cases of St. Louis
encephalitis &UR; ,  &LR; which is spread by a species of mosquito called
Culex pipiens, reported in New York City. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say babies, the elderly and those with weak
immune systems are the most vulnerable. All three fatalities were
elderly people. The disease does not pose as great a risk to older
children and healthy adults.
</P>
<P>
   Encephalitis is hard to diagnose since its symptoms closely
resemble those of other illnesses, including the flu and a form of
meningitis that is common at this time of year. The disease is not
curable; only the symptoms can be treated.
</P>
<P>
   All of Manhattan was sprayed from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Sunday.
On Wednesday, Riverside Park will be sprayed again. Several Queens,
Brooklyn and Bronx neighborhoods were sprayed Monday and several
other neighborhoods are scheduled to be sprayed on Wednesday.

MANN THEATRES CONSIDERS PULLING CURTAIN ON SOME LOCATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The parent of the struggling Mann Theatres chain,
which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, said
Monday that it might close underperforming locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to look at the overall business and the viability
of all the assets,'' said Michael Solomon, a turnaround specialist
named last week to the post of chief executive officer of WestStar
Cinemas Inc. ``One of the beauties of filing for Chapter 11 is we
now have the time to look at our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said no timetable has been set for possible closures or
filing a reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court. He plans to
seek renegotiation of lease agreements for Mann, which operates 54
theaters with 357 screens including the legendary Mann Chinese in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Encino-based Mann has lagged rivals in building megaplex
theaters that cater to customers' preference for multiple screens,
tiered seating and staggered start times. Mann's only megaplex
among its 27 Southern California theaters is the 9-month-old Plant
16 in Panorama City and analysts have been warning that outmoded
multiplexes are creating cash-flow problems for operators.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's other local sites include the six-screen Agoura Mann, the
Village 8 in Westlake Village, the eight-screen Janss Marketplace
in Thousand Oaks, the four-screen Buenaventura in Ventura, the
five-screen Simi Valley Mann, the Marketplace 4 in Glendale, the
10-screen Exchange in Glendale, the nine-screen Valley West in
Tarzana, the eight-screen Granada Hills Mann and the seven-screen
Mann Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said the bankruptcy filing, which will have no immediate
impact on operations, was necessary in order for Mann to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our industry continues to change, the expense of
retrofitting older, traditionally formatted theaters with
state-of-the-art technology has increased dramatically,'' Solomon
said. ``We believe it is in the best interests of all our
constituents to complete a strategic restructuring of the company,
thereby improving its financing structure and creating an
opportunity for capital infusion to make upgrades to our
theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   WestStar, an affiliate of Wall Street investment bank Warburg
Dillon Read, listed assets and debts at more than $100 million each
in the filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. It
has obtained up to $15 million of debtor-in-possession financing
from a group of creditors, led by Canadian Imperial Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our DIP financing in place, we are confident we will have
adequate financial resources to continue to operate uninterrupted
during the reorganization process,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Warburg Pincus, which bought the chain in 1997 for $165 million,
put Mann up for sale in January but was unable to find a buyer.
Solomon said his major task will not be to sell the company but to
improve its performance so that a sale will be more viable.
</P>
<P>
   Declining box office at older theaters has led to owners closing
the Americana 5 in Panorama City and the six-screen UA Warner
Center in Woodland Hills this summer. General Cinemas recently
announced it is seeking to sell its six Los Angeles-area theaters.

RHUBARB SPRINGS FROM `FIELD OF DREAMS' BASEBALL DIAMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DYERSVILLE, Iowa _ In the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' the ghost
of Shoeless Joe Jackson emerges from a stand of corn onto a
baseball outfield and asks: ``Is this heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kevin Costner's young farmer character responds ``No,
it's Iowa,'' the film implies that the hereafter has a rival in the
base paths and a backstop amid Midwestern farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Fans charmed by the movie's romance with baseball and farm life
have come here ever since, chasing fly balls and nostalgia on the
movie set playing field.
</P>
<P>
   But this piece of Iowa is heaven no more.
</P>
<P>
   The field's caretakers _ Becky and Don Lansing own most of the
infield and right field, Rita and Al Ameskamp hold deed to left and
center fields _ can't seem to get along.
</P>
<P>
   In a conflict perhaps as American as the game the field
celebrates, the Lansings and Ameskamps peddle souvenirs out of
competing shacks and regularly settle scores at meetings of the
county zoning panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' Don Lansing said. ``It takes away from the
field and the fun for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel real bad about it every day,'' echoed Rita Ameskamp.
``It's all about one word _ control.''
</P>
<P>
   The field remains a pleasant, if out-of-the-way, stop. On Labor
Day, families streamed to the field throughout the day to pose for
pictures where Costner, James Earl Jones, Burt Lancaster and Ray
Liotta brought to life the novel Shoeless Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heads up.'' A foul ball sails over the backstop. Another
whack, as ash slaps horsehide. In the informal batting practice
here, everybody swings not for the fences but for the corn. A
grade-schooler connects with a pitch. ``Atta boy!''
</P>
<P>
   An overhead power line marks each family's portion of the field,
but the grass is equally green on both sides, and the division
around third base is seamless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lansings say the Ameskamps sully the field with too much
commercialization. The Ameskamps say they're only doing what the
Lansings have done for a decade: making money off the movie.
</P>
<P>
   So now tourists coming down the gravel road tend to pause at the
entrances to two lanes, separated by a few yards, leading to the
field. The Lansings' sign beckons visitors to the ``Original Field
of Dreams Movie Site.'' The Ameskamps' hails travelers into the
``Left &AMP; Center Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It confused me for a second,'' said Myra Hayes of
Indianapolis. ``But then we figured out that they both go to the
same place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood came to Dyersville in 1988, when producers went
looking for an idyllic Iowa farmstead. The white two-story home
with the wraparound porch where Don Lansing was born, and where his
family has lived for more than 90 years, fit their vision.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 weeks, he moved out and the filmmakers moved in. They
filmed Costner walking his cornfield and hearing a bodiless voice
promise ``If you build it, he will come.'' To the consternation of
his wife and the puzzled looks of his neighbors, Costner's
character carves a playing field out of the edge of his cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   His seemingly irrational decision to put a baseball diamond in
the middle of nowhere eventually brings the farmer peace with the
memory of his late father and saves the farm when people pay to
watch games there.
</P>
<P>
   After the filming, Lansing left his portion of the field intact.
``I thought it was neat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The film first screened in late April 1989. By early May of that
year, Lansing said, ``people just started showing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists had to settle for most of the dreamy field. The
Ameskamps had plowed their land again and planted corn.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing began selling T-shirts, he said, to offset the cost of
keeping up the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 people came that first summer. By the spring of
1990, both families realized the attraction ``Field of Dreams'' had
made of their farmland. The Ameskamps restored their portion of the
ball field.
</P>
<P>
   Since they rebuilt it, the people have come. About 15,000 that
summer. Fantasy camps and exhibitions put on by Ghost Players teams
wearing old Chicago White Sox uniforms more than doubled those
numbers in subsequent years. This season, Dyersville is on track to
attract nearly 55,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so neat,'' said Mark Mason, who brought his two teen-age
sons with him from Effingham, Ill. ``It looks just like the movie,
and you don't have to pay anything to throw around a ball. My boys
will remember this their whole lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lansings met when Becky, a fan of the movie traveling from
her Boulder, Colo., home to see a cousin in Wisconsin, took a side
trip to the field in the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They married the next year, about the time the Ameskamps brought
in investors to manage their operation and the competition between
the two owners began to grow more tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al has been fighting cancer for the last four years,'' said
Keith Rahe, who manages the Ameskamps' part of the field. ``I don't
think it's so bad that they should have this income for their
retirement years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lansings see nothing wrong with capitalizing on the luck
that made a movie set of three acres in eastern Iowa. But it's a
matter of scale, they say.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ameskamps sought a zoning change to put in batting
cages, the Lansings blocked them. When the Ameskamps wanted to
expand their gift shop, the Lansings got the county zoning board to
prevent the building of anything larger than their own. (Both sides
sell jerseys and caps and key chains. The Lansings have replaced
the white fence that circled their house in the movie with a vinyl
facsimile and sell pickets from the original for $25 apiece.)
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the spat brought an end to organized games. Now
the Ghost Players, a traveling exhibition team that includes a few
extras from the film, perform their comedy routine using only left
and center fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Rahe said, ``neighbors can't help fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Things grew more bitter this summer, when the Ameskamps' Left &AMP;
Center outfit enlisted a seed company to sponsor the making of
``the most colossal corn maze on earth'' _ as their Web site calls
it _ beyond the outfield and charged $6 a head for tourists to poke
their way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just the last straw for us,'' Becky Lansing said.
``It shows they have no respect for what's special out here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, the Lansings and the Ameskamps talked about
managing the field jointly, maybe running a single gift shop. But
every meeting only left each side angrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to get together and run it as one operation,''
Rita Ameskamp said. ``But the percentage they would give us was
nothing. They must feel that their side is more important to them
than ours is to us. We think ours is important because the ghost
players came out of our (corn) field....
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ever going to get any better between us.''

EDITORIAL: RUSHED JOB ON NUCLEAR SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Sept. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Congress wants to reorganize the Department of Energy in order
to increase security at the nuclear weapons laboratories and
production plants that the department oversees. Such a step is
clearly needed to end the loose handling of classified material
that was discovered in the wake of allegations that the Chinese
government stole nuclear secrets from the labs. These concerns
remain despite the slight improvement in security procedures
claimed by the Energy Department Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This page initially favored removing the nuclear weapons
programs from the Energy Department entirely, given its long
history of mismanagement, and placing them instead in a fully
independent agency reporting directly to the White House. That was
one of the options recommended by the president's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board. But Congress has chosen to follow the
alternative route, also recommended by the board, of creating a
semi-independent agency within the Energy Department. In doing so,
it must be careful that its cure does not create other problems of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   A sound approach was taken by the Senate, which in July approved
formation of an agency to be run by an undersecretary of energy who
would have broad management powers, but would report to the energy
secretary. That left sufficient oversight in the secretary's office
to win the acquiescence of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. But a
reorganization plan approved by the House last week, as part of the
defense authorization bill, would create an agency that could
largely escape departmental oversight even in critical areas like
environment, health and safety that are unrelated to security.
</P>
<P>
   The National Governors' Association, 46 state attorneys general
and the National Conference of state Legislatures have also
expressed fear that the new legislation would lessen their ability
to enforce state environmental regulations in the cleanup of
federal nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate should reject the proposed measure, which has not
been subject to any hearings or public scrutiny, and insist that
the legislation be clarified to ensure that states' regulatory
powers will not be weakened, and that the new agency will be
subject to meaningful oversight by the Energy Department in
environmental and safety matters. These concerns are too important
to let slip in a hastily drafted reorganization.

APPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST PUNITIVE ACTION BY EPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency cannot seek penalties against a company for
violating hazardous-waste laws if state regulators already have
taken enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling from a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in St. Louis may affect federal enforcement
actions across the nation, far beyond the interests of Harmon
Industries, a Blue Springs manufacturer of railroad safety
equipment that initiated the federal court litigation. EPA hit the
company with a $2.7 million penalty in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to affect EPA throughout the (judicial) circuit
and, possibly, throughout the country,'' Robert Payne, corporate
counsel at Harmon Industries, said Monday. ``Others will look at
this as a well-reasoned resolution to the question.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA and Justice Department officials said no decision on an
appeal had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the EPA is concerned that this ruling will have a negative
impact on the federal enforcement program,'' said Cristine Romano,
a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington. ``It creates doubt
whether EPA can assist states in enforcing hazardous-waste cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City lawyer Terry Satterlee, who represented Harmon in
the litigation, said some lawyers are speculating whether the case
might also affect the way EPA enforces its federal clean-air and
clean-water laws. ``But that's yet to be determined,'' Satterlee
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that a federal court has ruled on the
enforcement authority of EPA in states that have authority to
enforce the hazardous-waste law known as the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, Satterlee said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental leaders in Missouri raised concerns about the
decision. ``This is a concern because of the weak enforcement
decisions and settlements by the state,'' said Ken Midkiff of the
Sierra Club in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Midkiff said he didn't think the ruling would affect potential
federal action against Premium Standard Farms, a Missouri-based hog
producer. Earlier this year, the EPA announced it would investigate
the company's compliance with the federal Clean Water Act. But
state officials had just settled numerous violations with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, the EPA has given its authority to state
regulatory agencies to enforce the federal hazardous-waste law. But
across the nation, it has levied penalty and enforcement actions in
several instances in which the state has been delegated authority
to enforce the hazardous waste law. Those are the type of cases
that might be affected by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate ruling from St. Louis, filed last week, springs
from 1987, when Harmon notified state hazardous waste officials
that it had learned its employees had dumped hazardous chemicals
behind the company's Grain Valley plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Natural Resources investigated and
was negotiating an agreement with Harmon about how it would clean
up the contamination. As part of the deal, state regulators
eventually agreed not to impose penalties on Harmon, partly as a
reward for voluntarily reporting its violations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the EPA levied its penalty, saying Harmon had dumped
toxic solvents on the ground from 1973 to 1987. EPA officials said
at the time that the federal agency had grown impatient waiting for
state regulators to take enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, through an administrative appeals process, the fine was
reduced to $586,716.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon decided to fight the penalty in federal court, saying the
EPA didn't have the authority to issue the penalty since it had
delegated authority to Missouri officials to enforce the federal
hazardous-waste law.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Ortrie Smith sided with Harmon in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA appealed the ruling, contending that the language of the
act allows it to initiate an enforcement action against a violator
even in states where state regulators enforce the law. All it needs
to do is notify the state in writing if it intends to initiate the
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's attorneys argued that in such situations states have
been granted enforcement authority in lieu of the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen industry groups, including the American Forest
&AMP; Paper Association and the American Petroleum Institute, filed
briefs in support of Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point of working with the state agencies that are
supposed to have the authority and competence if the feds can veto
any resolution you reach with the state?'' said Payne, the
corporate counsel at Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Payne added that a ruling against Harmon would also have sent a
message to industry that it doesn't pay to voluntarily report its
violations.

CD-ROM CARRIES LESSON IN LIQUOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The war against binge drinking on college campuses has featured
many weapons _ alcohol bans, lectures, newspaper advertisements,
alcohol awareness sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Now some colleges are using a new weapon appropriate for these
high-tech times. Alcohol 101 is an interactive CD-ROM that walks
students through a virtual party and virtual bar to teach them
about the dangers of drinking too much.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Karen McCarthy, a Democrat from Kansas City, said
during a demonstration Monday at Rockhurst University that Alcohol
101 could be an important tool in the battle to keep students
responsible about their intake of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I had no idea what the effects of
alcohol were on my body,'' she said. ``This will help students
understand the effects of alcohol and the choices we choose to make
when we use alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol 101 was developed by the University of Illinois and paid
for by the Century Council, a group of American liquor distillers.
It is aimed at fighting drunken driving and underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Rockhurst already has been using Alcohol 101 as part of an
educational program for underage students caught drinking, said Liz
Brent, vice president for student development.
</P>
<P>
   But some Rockhurst students who checked out the program Monday
said they thought the new weapon probably would have the same
effect on campus drinking that others have had _ not much.
</P>
<P>
   The program will get students' attention because it shows how
quickly alcohol streams through a drinker's blood, impairing the
person's judgment and balance, said Mary Klump, an 18-year-old
Rockhurst freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But students enjoying a party on a weekend probably won't make
their decisions based on a CD-ROM they used weeks or months before,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and other students said their peers would react more
strongly to firsthand accounts of how alcohol destroyed a person's
life, not to computer simulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (CD) seems kind of funny, kind of goofy,'' said Casey
McGraw, a 21-year-old Rockhurst student from Independence who has
lived on campus for four years.
</P>
<P>
   He said it doesn't show the real-life effect drinking can have
on alcoholics and their families, as well as the victims of
drunken-driving accidents.

FARMLAND CEO IS STEPPING DOWN BUT NOT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ To get the merger he wants, Harry Cleberg has
to give up the job he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most difficult decision of my career,'' Cleberg
said Monday in the Kansas City headquarters of Farmland Industries
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The South Dakota native has led Farmland since April 1991. He
has been in its management ranks since 1977. His Farmland ties
stretch back 40 years to when he joined South Dakota Wheat Growers,
which is the largest equity owner of Farmland, a farmer-owned
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   At 61, Cleberg is leaving his post as president and chief
executive officer early. Most chief executives his age would be
looking forward to at least four more years on the top corporate
rung.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleberg has agreed to step down as part of Farmland's merger
agreement with Cenex Harvest States Cooperatives. Noel Estenson,
Cleberg's counterpart at Minnesota-based Cenex, made the same
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cleberg explained why. To win approval from both
cooperatives' member-owners, neither top manager could claim the
top job, even with the backing of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed early on that that probably wouldn't work,'' Cleberg
said. ``If there was a perception that one or the other was the
victor in running the company, it could impair the (support) of the
ownership community.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the merger might not win approval from members of the
co-op whose chief executive didn't get the job.
</P>
<P>
   Member-owners of both co-ops will vote on the merger in
November. A two-thirds approval from each is required.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the unique structure of a cooperative made the
decision necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike publicly traded companies, cooperatives are owned by the
people and companies that do business with them. Furthermore, the
return on members' ownership is based on how much business they do
with the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the result was much more contact between owners of
a cooperative and its chief executive. He said a cooperative was
more like a partnership than a publicly traded company in which
owners come and go.
</P>
<P>
   So the top executives each agreed to clear the deck for new
leadership on March 1, when Farmland and Cenex are expected to
merge as United Country Brands. The new operation will have its
headquarters in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, Bob Honse, Farmland's chief operating officer, will
become United Country's first chief executive officer. He is
scheduled to give way in four years to John Johnson, who will be
president of United Country Brands and is now the No. 2 executive
at Cenex Harvest States.
</P>
<P>
   Estenson and Cleberg will remain as advisers to United Country
Brands through the end of 2000. Cleberg said Monday that he might
continue with projects that carry on beyond 2000. Otherwise, he's
looking for a second career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clara and I are evaluating what my, and our, next career will
be,'' Cleberg said of his plans with his wife of 40 years. ``We
have never used the term `retirement.' I don't plan to ever
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said he would consider a second business career; his
contract prevents him from competing against Farmland until he
turns 65.
</P>
<P>
   He would consider a government post. He would consider a
nonprofit organization and has been involved with several area
groups for years.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the door is wide open _ but with one caveat. Cleberg
plans to stay in his adopted hometown of Kansas City, where the
Clebergs have lived since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever career Cleberg chooses, he said, it will allow more
time for his civic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   That was welcome news to Guyla Stidmon, executive director of
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Greater Kansas City.
Cleberg is the longtime chairman of the group's advisory board and
a past president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably is one of the most effective advocates I've ever
seen,'' Stidmon said. ``Wherever he is, he always remembers his
other causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg is a trustee, adviser, director or board member of 17
area businesses and civic groups.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City,
director and past chairman of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce and the chairman of this year's Heart of America United
Way campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg serves on the board of governors at the National
Agricultural Center and Hall of Fame in Bonner Springs. He has been
on the board of governors of the American Royal Association since
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He is a director of three St. Luke's area hospitals, Commerce
Bank of Kansas City and Payless Cashways Inc. He is a trustee of
the Midwest Research Institute and the St. Paul School of Theology
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg says he hasn't been as involved civically as he would
like. And his departure offers him the chance to rework his
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to remain active,'' he said. ``We're just deciding
where and which direction.''

UW MATCHUP ELECTRIFYING FOR COLORADO'S GREGORAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ It's Washington week. Somebody get a fire truck
near Ty Gregorak in case he spontaneously combusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it's already here; I can't wait,'' Colorado's
star junior linebacker said Monday. ``Now I'm going to have to
watch (myself). It's going to be real emotional for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregorak probably won't need a plane to get to Seattle, not
after he traded his adrenal gland for a liquid hydrogen booster.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, he won't need a map.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stadium and team was my whole life,'' he said. ``Purple
and gold. The Washington program was it when I grew up. They'd won
a national championship, they were sending players to the NFL. That
was everything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have grown up on the wrong side of the state _ he was a
three-sport star and honor student at Spokane's West Valley High _
but he was a Pup down to his last thought before sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a Buffalo. Perhaps more than anything, that
symbolizes why Rick Neuheisel is at Washington and one of the
richest coaches in college football.
</P>
<P>
   His presence at Washington is also why Gregorak and his Buffs
teammates want to slap _ figuratively, it is presumed _ the smirk
off his face.
</P>
<P>
   The eagerness in this yuppie college town for Saturday's matchup
game is like a 5-year-old's for Christmas, times about seven.
Contempt for Neuheisel in general, and his unexpected departure in
particular, have fueled a public mad-on that the new coaching staff
is trying to keep from consuming Gregorak and his mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, this team has grown beyond that,'' Buffs coach Gary
Barnett insisted Monday at his weekly media briefing. ``If this
game were played six months ago, it would be different. Now, both
teams think this is a must-win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remove the personalities and play between the
lines. The early losses by both teams take something out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Just like nobody in this region is panicking because the NFL
champion Broncos have started 0-2. Given the hysteria surrounding
the Broncos and the sense of abandonment surrounding Neuheisel,
there's enough sports psychoses here in the Rockies to fill a year
of Jerry Springer shows.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the widespread angst, Barnett has closed practice
to reporters this week and is attempting to cut down on interview
availability. CU athletic director Dick Tharp, who responded to
Barbara Hedges' hijacking of Neuheisel by hijacking Barnett from
Northwestern, is also a hard fellow to track down.
</P>
<P>
   One guy who can't shut up is Gregorak, a glib communications
major who spent most of an hour Monday filling reporters' notebooks
about his feelings for Neuheisel and Washington. Calm and
undemonstrative during his media chat, he nevertheless conveyed a
wistfulness about his decision to go elsewhere for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to leave,'' he said. ``My family and friends have
a long way to travel to see me. But I love Colorado. This is where
I want to be after I'm done with football.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he avoided any directly critical remarks Monday, it was
plain that during recruiting in the fall of 1996, Gregorak and the
regime of former coach Jim Lambright failed to click. The all-state
pick was offered a UW scholarship, but with not nearly the
enthusiasm he received from Colorado, Ohio State and even
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was going through Washington's mind during
the recruiting process,'' he said. ``I don't want to say anything
negative about the staff, but I think if Don James had still been
there, there's a good chance I'd be a Husky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got a real strong positive feeling from the staff. I
never felt real comfortable. It wasn't a place I saw myself
spending the next four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregorak admits Washington figured he was too slow _ ``which I
am,'' he said _ but was also utterly charmed by Neuheisel and his
staff at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff was a big part of it. They really know how to
recruit. I knew nothing about Colorado growing up. But they made me
feel special, especially (Bobby) Hauck.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauck, 34, was Colorado's recruiting coordinator and special
teams coach who is considered aces when it comes to the art of
adolescent persuasion. He also left Colorado to join Neuheisel at
Washington, their third school together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a mom in the world who doesn't love him,''
Gregorak said. ``My mom still talks about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Gregorak was representative of the continuing drain
of home-grown talent away from Washington, which used to need only
wink at most top prep prospects in-state. Although no one around
the program will say much publicly, the biggest knock against
Lambright was that some of his own players weren't endorsing the
program to prospective recruits.
</P>
<P>
   That realization apparently drove Hedges to make her bold,
astonishing run at Neuheisel. Beyond money, the expense of that
maneuver could be tallied in the won-lost record Saturday as the
Buffaloes unleash the fury from the perceived piracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies' 0-2 start also helps make the case that the
program under Lambright was in full decay.
</P>
<P>
   Gregorak was at the heart of the Neuheisel betrayal last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, everyone was shocked and disturbed by it,'' he said.
``I found out about it from friends and family back home that it
was happening. We'd just come off winning a bowl game over Oregon,
and that week we had had a bunch of top recruits on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   When Neuheisel returned from Seattle to meet briefly with his
old players, Gregorak uttered his now-notorious remark at the
meeting, the only Buff to speak: ``We'll see you on Sept. 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregorak says now the remark was misinterpreted, that he meant
it more as a farewell than a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respected the guy for flying back from Seattle and wanting
to meet us,'' he said. ``After his statement, he asked for
questions or comments. There was about a minute of silence. Then I
just said, `See you on Sept. 25th.' I didn't mean it the way it's
come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Rick and the staff have great careers. It takes
practice to be a good coach, and I don't mean this in a bad way,
but he'll probably be better there than he was here. He learned a
lot, and will take experiences from here and learn more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he takes Washington back to where it was in the early
'90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregorak's education obviously has included classes in
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   But making nice with the press is one thing. Sweet oratory will
be utterly absent from the Colorado side Saturday when it comes to
Neuheisel and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming Gregorak doesn't explode on first contact.

SHEFFIELD GETS HIS WIRES CROSSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Updates Scioscia item) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even in a forgettable season, Gary Sheffield took
the thought to an extreme.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing an MRI exam on his ailing right knee Monday
afternoon, Sheffield returned to his Bel Air home instead of
driving to Dodger Stadium for his game against the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived home, Sheffield was greeted by his surprised
wife, Deleon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `What are you doing here? Don't you have a game
tonight?''' Sheffield said. ``They usually don't schedule MRI's on
game days. It was Monday and I just thought we didn't have a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield got back in the car and arrived at Dodger Stadium
around 5 p.m. Manager Davey Johnson had Sheffield in the starting
lineup and allowed him to play despite missing batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mix-up, that's all; I'm not bothered by that,''
Johnson said. ``They don't usually do MRIs on game days.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson probably cut him some slack because despite knee and
shoulder problems, Sheffield has been one of the most durable and
productive Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has 27 homers and 89 RBI, is tied with Eric
Karros for second in games played on the club (142) behind Raul
Mondesi (147).
</P>
<P>
   The MRI revealed no structural damage in his right knee but
found scar tissue from an old injury around a ligament that has
caused discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who underwent surgery on his right shoulder last
winter, said he was told by doctors that an offseason
rehabilitation program should properly strengthen the knee and
shoulder by spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia out: Mike Scioscia, the longtime Dodgers catcher who
became the manager at Triple-A Albuquerque this season, will not
return next year.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia did not want to come back for a second year in the
minor leagues. The Dodgers were not prepared to put him back on the
major-league coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike did a fine job for us this season at Albuquerque,'' farm
director Bill Geivett said. ``We're disappointed in the prospect of
losing a staff member with Mike's ability. However, I understand
Mike's situation and I wish him the best in his endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who served as the Dodgers bench coach the previous two
seasons, guided Albuquerque to a 65-74 record in the Pacific Coast
League Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Scioscia and long-time third-base coach Joey Amalfitano
survived a purge of the Dodgers coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   But after manager Davey Johnson took over, Scioscia was
reassigned and Amalfitano left the organization to join the San
Francisco Giants minor-league department.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, a member of two World Series-winning teams with the
Dodgers, previously managed in 1997 in the Arizona Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are in the midst of evaluating their major-league
coaching staff and expect to make a decision on their futures
before the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff includes Glenn Hoffman (third base), Claude
Osteen (pitching), Rick Down (hitting), Jim Tracy (dugout), Rick
Dempsey (bullpen), John Shelby (first base).
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort uncertain: Right-hander Darren Dreifort, bothered by
shoulder trouble the past two weeks, might be done for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, limited to just four innings last Wednesday, was
scratched for tonight's start and replaced by minor-league
left-hander Jeff Williams..
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort will throw in the bullpen Thursday. If all goes well he
could start Sunday against San Diego in the final home game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is any discomfort, we'll shut him down for the
rest of the year,'' Johnson said.

COWBOYS NOTES: SMITH SILENCES OVER-THE-HILL TALK
</HEADLINE>
 1st WRITETHRU (adds notes) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. and JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A year ago, running back Emmitt Smith rebutted
charges that he was on the downside of his legendary career.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he continued to distance himself from the
over-the-hill talk, rushing 29 times for 108 yards and two
touchdowns to help spark the Cowboys' 24-7 victory against the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Smith ran past former Cowboys running back Tony
Dorsett into fourth place on the NFL's all-time rushing list. Smith
has 12,783 yards in his 10-year career. Dorsett rushed for 12,739
yards in 12 years with the Cowboys and Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Smith did it on the night the Cowboys set aside to
honor some of the greatest players in the franchise's 40-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   While former critics continue to be amazed by Smith's
resurgence, the former Florida Gators star said he's playing well
because his offensive line is playing well.
</P>
<P>
   And what gives Smith hope that he will do even better than last
season _ he rushed for 1,332 yards in 1998 after having subpar
seasons in 1996 and 1997 _ is the presence of center Mark
Stepnoski. Smith said an already-good offensive line turned into a
potentially great one with the free-agent addition of Stepnoski,
who played with the Oilers the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan Monday night was to let Stepnoski and the Cowboys'
offensive line to pave the way for Smith against the Falcons'
defense. The 29 carries were the most for Smith since 1995. The
plan worked, even though two regular starters, Erik Williams and
Everett McIver, were sidelined with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 84-14 when Smith has at least 20 attempts. They
are 55-9 when he tops the 100-yard mark.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM: Sherman Williams certainly commands a
lot of respect from the coaching staff, which is interesting
considering that the Cowboys have tried their best to get rid of
him the past two years. They cut him before training camp last
season but brought him back before the season opened because of
injuries. They had no intention of him being with the team this
year, but injuries again necessitated a return. He was signed
Thursday and was the Cowboys' chief kickoff returner Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between receivers Chris Brazzell and Jason
Tucker to not get cut when defensive tack Leon Lett comes back
continued last night. It likely will be based on who is the better
specials-teams player. Brazzell got his chance against the
Redskins, and Tucker got his chance last night.
</P>
<P>
   With receiver Raghib Ismail sidelined in the first quarter by a
strained left shoulder, Michael Irvin attracted some of his old
double-coverage treatment from the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way players are still en vogue with the Cowboys, even
without Deion Sanders. Rookie defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban,
drafted in the first round to shore up the Cowboys' pass rush,
showed his versatility last night as a short-yardage tight end.
Ekuban had the key block on Emmitt Smith's first-quarter touchdown
run. He also plays on defense as a nickel pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   VICTORY ROCKET BOOSTED, AGAIN: Cowboys receiver Raghib
``Rocket'' Ismail didn't need a dramatic touchdown this time. And
he didn't play the whole game; however, he made his presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail keyed the Cowboys' first touchdown bailing the offense
out of a third-and-13 hole by turning a simple slant pass into a
38-yard catch and sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys spread Atlanta out with a four-receiver set. Ismail,
who was lined up in the slot, took advantage of one-on-one coverage
against Falcons safety Eugene Robinson, whose 38-year-old legs
couldn't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons caught up with Ismail at the 9-yard line and knocked
him out the game for remainder of the first half with a sprained
left shoulder. Two plays later, running back Emmitt Smith scored on
a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   ELLIS GOES ALL THE WAY: What a difference a year has made for
defensive end Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Previously known as the player the Cowboys drafted in the first
round of the 1998 NFL draft instead of Randy Moss, Ellis has become
a bit of a second-year phenomenon. In the season opener, he was the
lone bright spot on the Cowboys' defense with two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   In last night's 24-7 defeat of Atlanta, Ellis tipped a Danny
Kanell pass with about one minute to play in the game and hauled it
in for his first career interception, returning it 87 yards for a
touchdown. The play was the fifth-longest return for an
interception in Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER KEY PLAYS: The Texas Stadium turf did its part when
Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson went down in the first quarter
without being hit. He lost 2 yards on the play, and suffered a
sprained knee that knocked him out of the game. With quarterback
Chris Chandler already out, the Falcons' offense ran out of
options.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense did its part as well, highlighted by a
crucial third-and-one stop in the third quarter. Defensive tackle
Chad Hennings led the charge with his first sack of the season. He
also added the double-whammy by forcing Falcons quarterback Tony
Graziani to fumble. Alonzo Spellman recovered, and Smith followed
with his second touchdown of the game to up the score to 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   GAME BALLS: Defensive tackle Chad Hennings had two sacks,
doubling his total of last season. His first sack in the third
quarter caused a fumble that led the Cowboys' second touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave Campo rallied his troops, who gave up
504 yards to Washington in the season opener. The Cowboys held
Atlanta to 14 yards total offense in the third quarter after giving
up more than 180 in the third quarter to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail had only one catch, but
it was a 38-yarder that set up the Cowboys' first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith finished with 29 carries for 108 yards
and both Cowboys touchdowns and moved past Tony Dorsett into fourth
place on the NFL's all-time rushing list.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dexter Coakley had an interception and a sack and was
the spark plug for the defense early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Tony Hutson stepped in for Erik Williams and didn't
allow a sack.
</P>
<P>
   TWO-WAY PLAYER: Rookie defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban debuted on
offense during the Cowboys' first-quarter touchdown drive. With the
Cowboys on the Falcons' 3-yard line, Ekuban lined up on first down
as a blocking tight end in motion. Emmitt Smith followed his lead
on a dive for 1 yard.
</P>
<P>
   On second down, Ekuban moved to the left side of the line in a
two tight-end set. This time, Ekuban stuffed right end Chuck Smith
allowing Emmitt Smith to walk around left end and into the end zone
for a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   NO GO ON FG: The Cowboys passed up an opportunity to take
advantage of an obscure and rarely implemented rule.
</P>
<P>
   If a half or the game ends with a fair catch on a punt, the
receiving team can take a free kick, an unobstructed field goal
from the spot of the fair catch.
</P>
<P>
   Wane McGarity made a fair catch of a Dan Stryzinski punt on the
Atlanta 47 as time expired in the first half. Leading 10-0, the
Cowboys opted not to attempt what would have been a 64-yard field.
The NFL record is 63 yards set by Tom Dempsey and matched by the
Broncos' Jason Elam.
</P>
<P>
   SERVING UP FALCON: Troy Aikman entered the game 3-1 against the
Falcons as a starting quarterback. The following is a list of
Aikman's statistics in those four starts against Atlanta: Date
score statistics 9/17/89 at Atlanta L,27-21 13-23-2-241, 1 TD
12/21/92 at Atlanta W,41-17 18-21-0-239, 3 TDs 10/29/95 at Atlanta
W,28-13 19-25-1-198, 2 TDs 10/20/96 vs. Atlanta W,32-28
17-24-0-265, 2 TDs 9/20/99 vs. Atlanta W,24-7 10-22-2-109, 0 TDs
</P>
<P>
   SANDERS SITS: Deion Sanders' status for last night's game was
going to be a game-timedecision, however Sanders clearly made his
decision well before game time. Sanders was decked out in his usual
practice grays several hours before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders continues to say he will not play until he is 100
percent. His projected return is Oct. 30, after this week's bye,
when the Cowboys play host to division rival Arizona, the team he
hurt his big toe against last season.
</P>
<P>
   INJURY LIST: Erik Williams, RT, quadricep during warmups,
strained right quadricep. Did not return. Tony Hutson started at
right tackle
</P>
<P>
   Raghib Ismail, WR, sprained left shoulder Everett McIver, RG,

COWBOYS DEFEAT DEFENDING NFC CHAMPS, 24-7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys joined the Detroit Lions as
the only 2-0 teams in the NFC by finishing fast on ``Monday Night
Football'' for a 24-7 victory against the Atlanta Falcons, the
defending conference champions, Monday night at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who have lost a record nine consecutive Monday
night games dating to 1982, were shut out by the Cowboys until four
minutes were left. Then, as the Falcons were driving for a
touchdown that would have cut the Cowboys' lead to 17-14, defensive
end Greg Ellis stepped in front of a Danny Kanell pass and returned
it 87 yards for a game-icing touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in the right place at the right time,'' Ellis said.
The pass ``hit me in the face mask. I would've looked bad if I
hadn't caught it. ... then when I started running, I didn't think I
was going to make it'' all the way.
</P>
<P>
   With Emmitt Smith and Ellis providing the legs for this victory,
the Cowboys sit alone atop the NFC East. It's their first 2-0 start
since 1995, the last time Dallas went to the Super Bowl. The
Cowboys are 29-10-1 in home openers.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that the national anthem was sung by Waylon
Jennings, who needed the assistance of a walking cane to get in and
out of a golf cart, which carried the country &AMP; western singer on
and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Because this game was not for the weak of heart.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta, quarterback Chris Chandler didn't start because of
a hamstring injury and running back Jamal Anderson was gone less
than six minutes into the game because of a sprained right knee
that he incurred on a noncontact play.
</P>
<P>
   For Dallas, offensive tackle Erik Williams strained his right
quadriceps muscle in pregame warmups and didn't play, and speedy
receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail sprained his left shoulder late
in the first quarter, while making his first catch of the game, and
he missed the remainder of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith carried 29 times for 108 yards and became the NFL's
fourth all-time leading rusher, surpassing Tony Dorsett. By
halftime, Smith was running behind an offensive line that included
Tony Hutson at right tackle and Ben Fricke at right guard. Fricke
played more than half the game in place of Everett McIver (strained
hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised the way Hutson and Fricke played,'' Cowboys
coach Chan Gailey said. ``(The Falcons) weren't just coming through
there all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among all the injuries, none was bigger than Atlanta's loss of
Anderson, who ``was'' Atlanta's game plan with young Tony Graziani
starting at quarterback. Anderson, the defending NFC rushing
champion, will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging today.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, who was making only his third NFL start, hurt his team
by trying too hard early in the third quarter when he left the
pocket and fumbled deep in Falcons territory. Chad Hennings forced
it. Alonzo Spellman recovered it. Seven plays later, the Cowboys'
offense cashed in on it with a touchdown to take a 17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   This game was more than just about the walking wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's feat came with Dorsett in attendance at Texas Stadium,
where he was joined by more than 100 other all-time Cowboys greats
in a halftime ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Smith, who has 128 career rushing touchdowns
(compared with Dorsett's 72) eclipsed Dorsett's 12,739 career
rushing yards on his way into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's milestone breaker came on a 7-yard carry with 11:24
remaining in the third quarter, putting the Cowboys in front, 17-0.
Center Mark Stepnoski opened a hole about the size of Georgia,
through which Smith dashed and scored standing up.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, this was a game of attrition, with the Cowboys
holding onto a 10-0 halftime lead against a team without its two
best offensive players.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys linebacker Dexter Coakley returned a first-quarter
interception 43 yards to the Atlanta 10, but that resulted in only
three points.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman wasn't sharp early, and the Cowboys
stalled inside the 20, settling for a 23-yard Richie Cunningham
field goal to take a 3-0 lead with 9:53 remaining in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson left with a knee sprain, the Cowboys rode a
would-be 46-yard punt return to the Atlanta 22, but it was
nullified by an illegal block called on Robert Thomas. But the
struggle continued for the Falcons, and the Cowboys responded by
mounting a seven-play, 60-yard touchdown drive at the end of the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith scored the first of his two touchdowns on a 2-yard left
sweep behind the block of rookie Ebenezer Ekuban, a converted
defensive end playing tight end in goal-line situations. Ekuban
sealed off Falcons defensive end Chuck Smith on the play.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta, with Kanell replacing Graziani in Atlanta's dismal
third quarter (12 yards total offense), roared back with Tim Dwight
at the end of a 45-yard pass play for a touchdown with four minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell later hit Kevin Mathis for 52 yards at the Dallas 8 on a
pass that caromed off two Cowboys defenders _ Duane Hawthorne and
George Teague _ but three plays later, Ellis intercepted a pass and
put the Dirty Birds on ice. nn

IN NFL GONE BAD, CHEAP WIN GOLDEN (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cheap wins don't happen in today's NFL. Even
when the other club loses its all-world running back early in the
evening, and its Pro Bowl quarterback never took a snap due to
injury. A cheap win still doesn't compute, not by the league's
current standards.
</P>
<P>
   This brand of football has become all about a cut-rate,
bargain-basement, attention-Kmart-shoppers, made-in-Taiwan,
army-navy-store, dynasty-killing Sunday and Monday of mediocre
teams attempting to survive week to week.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime Monday night at Texas Stadium, the Dallas Cowboys
paraded more than 100 of their alums across the field in a tribute
to 40 years of what has consistently been an era of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   It's logical to assume these old-timers privately giggle when
they see what passes for the NFL of the late '90s. Salary cap, free
agency, expansion _ one and all have combined to transfer the
league into a shadow of its former self.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also the same as in any other season _ there's a
division to be won, a conference to be won, and, yes, a Super Bowl
berth to be earned.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, it might as well be the Cowboys contending strongly
for all that, particularly in the NFC. Even if the league is in an
early-evaluation period, it's obvious the Cowboys are basically as
good as anyone else in the conference, and better than most. What
that says about the NFC is nobody is worth a flip. Not yet, anyway,
and probably never.
</P>
<P>
   But don't attempt to make a dummy drill out of Monday night's
24-7 win over the Atlanta Falcons, who nine months ago were the
NFC's Super Bowl rep.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of what ails the opposition remains a survival
must, and for an ailing Atlanta that included quarterback Chris
Chandler, a no-go due to last week's hamstring ailment. From
Chandler to backup Tony Graziani is a Grand Canyon drop in class,
meaning the Falcons had only one chance to win Monday night _ and
then Jamal Anderson's evening also wrapped up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no jamming with Jamal after Anderson attempted a
cut on Jerry Jones' fake grass. His knee didn't hold up when his
shoe grabbed, and Jamal was finished for the night. That was on the
Falcons' second possession. You can slide by in today's NFL when
missing defensive stars (right, Nine-Toed?), but take away vital
offensive weapons and it's good-bye, bay-bee.
</P>
<P>
   Once Anderson was gone, the strategy became very simple for the
Cowboys: don't make any stupid mistakes and wait for Graziani's
lack of savvy to take over.
</P>
<P>
   It almost worked in both areas, too. Graziani helped the Cowboys
to 10 of their first 17 points. A Dexter Coakley interception set
up an early field goal, and when Chad Hennings, who had a very
active night, forced a third- quarter fumble by Graziani, it led to
a 17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Some late mistakes by a young Cowboys secondary actually allowed
the Falcons to make it slightly interesting, but...
</P>
<P>
   A sure win became a sure win.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, the Cowboys' offense struggled against a game
and solid Atlanta defense. Chan Gailey had billed the Falcons'
defense as the best his offense would face all season, and he'd
better be right. Troy Aikman, for one, hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman tried to take what was offered upstairs, which wasn't
that much. Plus, his arm wasn't exactly sharp. The Cowboys were
missing some offensive pieces of their own in the line. Tackle Erik
Williams damaged himself in pre-game warmups and didn't play and
guard Everett McIver went out in the first half and didn't return.
Aikman was under heavy pressure, and that may be why.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith gave the offense a boost with his work on the
ground, which was just enough Cowboys leverage to bend and finally
break the Atlanta defense.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly after last week in Washington, give the Cowboys'
defense it's share of credit. But it was also a defense blessed
with field position galore. The difference in the game? Start right
where the Falcons were forced to begin their offensive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   There was great Atlanta field position to begin with, but
starting at their 44 didn't benefit the Falcons when Coakley picked
off Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Falcons got the ball back at the 20-, 25-, 13-,
10-, 7-, 8- and, moving to the start of the second half, the
15-yard line. And that's when Graziani fumbled, leading to a 17-0,
game-over, Cowboys lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing cheap about it. Win now, win often enough, and there's a
division, a conference, and, who knows, maybe a Super Bowl,
definitely up for grabs in an NFL gone bad. nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Growing up in Montreal, Eric Gagne didn't know
about the strange things that happen between the Los Angeles
Dodgers and San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it appeared Gagne might win his first major-league
game he couldn't have realized what goes on between these two
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's 6-5 victory in front of 33,280 at Dodger Stadium
was typical, won on a ninth-inning, bases-loaded single by Eric
Karros off Jerry Spradlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored three runs after Gagne was lifted for a pinch
hitter in the fifth. But the Giants scored three runs in the
seventh, two on a home run by J.T. Snow to tie the game at 5.
</P>
<P>
   With a good chance to start the final game between the clubs
Sept. 30 at Candlestick Park, Gagne got a glimpse of one of
baseball's most storied rivalries _ warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   As with the second inning, when Ellis Burks took off from first
and Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley made a perfect throw to second _
with nobody covering the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek and second baseman Eric Young had a
long and animated conversation about the blunder, which went down
as an error on Young because right-handed hitting Rich Aurilia was
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The play didn't result in a run, but no doubt will go down as
the symbol for the Dodgers' season.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Giants, they are technically still in the National
League West race. Division-leading Arizona came in with an
eight-game lead over San Francisco and 13 games to play. The
Diamondbacks, who could clinch this weekend in San Francisco, lost
12-7 on Monday to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers appeared to get Gagne his first victory by scoring
three runs in the fifth inning after he was lifted for pinch hitter
Craig Counsell.
</P>
<P>
   Counsell opened with a walk and one out later took third on a
double by Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield was intentionally walked and Karros followed with
a two-run double into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was replaced by left-hander Rich Rodriguez, who escaped
big trouble when center fielder Marvin Bernard took away extra
bases from Devon White with a leaping catch at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield scored on the sacrifice fly to give the Dodgers a 5-2
lead, but it could have been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth was a nice gift for Gagne, who did not have good
control, walking five in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his last start against the New York Mets, it didn't
hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants got their run in the first when Bernard opened the
game with a double, stole third and scored when Hundley's throw
sailed into left field.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers took a 2-1 lead on Grudzielanek's third-inning
homer, Bernard tied it in the fifth with an opposite field homer to
left.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne couldn't get him out, but he did far better against the
Giants top hitters, Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent, who went a combined
0 for 6.
</P>
<P>
   After Bernard's homer, Gagne walked Bill Mueller. With a pitch
count nearing 100, it was his last inning, but he went out with a
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne got Bonds on a pop to the catcher and struck out Kent.
J.T. Snow then popped to third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges took over for Gagne to start the sixth, but didn't
get in trouble until the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Bonds doubled to the gap in left-center and scored
on a single by Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Snow was next and quickly got ahead 3-1 in the count.
</P>
<P>
   Herges, who like Gagne was called up in September, threw a
fastball and Snow drove it into the empty right-field pavilion for
his 21st home run.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PITTSBURGH _ Astros reliever Brian Williams answers to the nickname
``Boogie,'' a tag he earned because of his skill under a disco ball
early in his career.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently, he doesn't have a rain dance in his repertoire;
otherwise, you can bet he would have been giving his teammates a
crash course Monday night at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting out a rain delay that lasted 1 hour and 42
minutes, the Pirates waltzed to an 11-5 victory over the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   When play was halted in the third inning, the Astros trailed
7-4. League rules permit the umpires to call a rain-delayed game
after waiting at least 1 hour and 15 minutes, but considering the
circumstances _ the Astros are locked in a tight National League
Central Division race with the Reds _ every effort was made to
complete the game.
</P>
<P>
   Because an official game requires a minimum of five innings, the
Astros no doubt would have preferred to have the umpires call the
game _ as they almost certainly would have a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any doubt,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``We were going to play this game even if we had to stay here
until 2 a.m., and that's the way it should have been. I have no
problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain also is on the radar for the next two days, and it will be
accompanied by cool temperatures. The Astros can only hope better
pitching is in their forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three _ Mike Hampton, Jose Lima and Shane Reynolds _
have spent all season lifting each other to new heights. But all
they have done is bring one another down during the most recent
trip through the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was Reynolds' day to struggle, and he did, to the tune of
eight runs (five earned) in 2 innings. Reynolds surrendered the
mound to the bullpen after the rain delay and was left with plenty
of time to ponder his shortest outing since May 31, 1997, when he
was gone after 1 innings against the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   But Reynolds (16-12) shouldn't feel too bad. Lima lasted 3
innings in his last outing, and Hampton was knocked out after 3 the
next day. The trio, which has a combined record of 56-23, has
posted a cumulative ERA of 19.56 in this simultaneous funk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part is that we scored some runs and I didn't do my
job,'' Reynolds said. ``You don't want to get too down, but it's
time for us (the pitchers) to repay the offense. Hopefully the
starters will work out of this funk we're in and finish strong.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning a franchise-record 12 consecutive games, the
Astros have lost four of their last five and have been outscored
46-29 during that stretch. Their opponents have scored at least
eight runs in four of the games.
</P>
<P>
   And for the third time in four days, the Astros were victimized
by a big inning. The Pirates exploded for six runs in the third,
including Brant Brown's three-run homer, which could have brought
on the rain.
</P>
<P>
   The skies opened shortly thereafter, but the Astros appeared all
but washed away before the umpires cleared the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games we've lost on this trip are because teams are
scoring more runs against us in one inning than we're scoring in
the whole game,'' center fielder Carl Everett said. ``That's been
the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a smattering of the paid crowd of 10,256 stuck around for
the duration of the game, but it's safe to say everyone who
remained in the ballpark had a good chance to go home with at least
one foul ball. It was so quiet, players had no trouble hearing
individual fans, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But don't even think about suggesting the dull atmosphere had a
bearing on the Astros' flat performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't have anything to do with it,'' Astros shortstop
Bill Spiers said. ``If we can't get excited about what we have at
stake, then we don't need to be out there. When we won the 12 games
in a row, that was a good time to be winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good time to be losing, but if we play like
we're capable of playing, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros opened the scoring against an old nemesis, Francisco
Cordova, who allowed an RBI single to Jeff Bagwell in the first.
The Pirates answered in the bottom of the inning with run-producing
singles by Brian Giles and Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell struck again with a two-run single in the second, and
another run scored when Cordova walked Spiers with the bases
loaded. The Astros' three-run inning didn't look so good in the
third when the Pirates doubled that total to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't get into a groove at all,'' said Reynolds, who
was working without his best pitch, the splitter. ``The weather
wasn't a factor; I just didn't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Astro Pete Schourek (4-7), who relieved Cordova after the
rain passed, picked up the victory.

ANGELS BEAT DEVIL RAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Most of his teammates call him ``Fin,'' but
his fellow starters might as well call him ``Gramps.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley, who pitched the Anaheim Angels to a 10-5 victory
over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Monday night before 16,165 fans
and former Angels manager Terry Collins at Edison Field, turns 37
in November and has become the elder statesman of a starting
rotation that is otherwise young and inexperienced. The average age
of the other four starters _ Ramon Ortiz, Jarrod Washburn, Brian
Cooper and Mike Fyhrie _ is 25.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Angels take a look at their young pitchers, it
would be wise for the young pitchers to take a look at Finley,
according to interim manager Joe Maddon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about the potential of (Finley) visiting and
talking with them,'' Maddon said. ``But if they just watched Chuck
work out, watched him during a game.... If you put a camera on his
face during a game, you don't know how the game is going. He always
has the same look on his face. He knows how to handle himself as a
major-league pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley went 51/3 innings, allowing three runs and seven hits to
earn his team-leading 11th win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Collins took up Angels general manager Bill Bavasi on his offer
to watch a game from Bavasi's private box, and spent some time in
the press box chatting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' visit wasn't just a casual visit, though. Bavasi wants
Collins' input and evaluation of some of the younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want to know my thoughts about some guys,'' Collins
said. ''I appreciate they asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's game included one of the most bizarre plays of the
season. You've heard of throwing at a hitter, but what about
throwing at the umpire?
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays starter Wilson Alvarez (9-8) had just given up a
two-run homer to Garret Anderson in the third inning giving the
Angels a 7-1 lead. The count was 1-1 on the following hitter _ Matt
Walbeck _ when Alvarez's pitch sailed over the glove of catcher
Mike Difelice and grazed plate umpire John Shulock in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch wasn't that high _ about chest-high to Walbeck _ so
Shulock apparently thought it was no accident. An incensed Shulock
charged the mound _ sort of _ and screamed at Alvarez. Devil Rays
manager Larry Rothschild came out and also got an earful from
Shulock.
</P>
<P>
   After Shulock calmed down a little, Rothschild took Alvarez out
of the game. But Difelice had nowhere to go, and stood at the plate
as Shulock screamed some more.

MINIMED INSULIN PUMP PROSPECTS BOOST STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As one of its main products nears approval by the
federal government's Medicare reimbursement arm, MiniMed's stock
has been flirting with record high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Los Angeles-based medical products company closed
Monday at $101, up $3.6875 for the day and just shy of last week's
52-week high of $102.875.
</P>
<P>
   The company is awaiting approval for its external insulin pump
by the Health Care Financing Administration, the agency that
decides whether Medicare will reimburse patients for treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The approval is ``highly probable,'' said Kurt Kruger, an
analyst with Banc of America Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal government decides the product is worth
reimbursing its patients, the pressure will be on private insurers
and HMOs to follow suit, Kruger said.
</P>
<P>
   And all of these approvals probably would mean increased sales
and profits for MiniMed, he said. It's unknown, however, how much
sales would increase with HCFA and HMO adoptions; company officials
were unavailable for comment Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Patients wear MiniMed's insulin pump on a belt. It delivers a
constant dose of insulin through a tube in the abdomen, thus
eliminating the need for repeated injections during the day and
allowing patients to control their dosage of insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Kruger, who recommends the stock as a strong buy, said the stock
price isn't done climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential and the prospects that this company possesses
are just now being realized and appreciated by Wall Street,''
Kruger said. ``They could have margins that are about twice the
level they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed controls about 85 percent of the U.S. market and 35
percent of the European market for external insulin pumps and has
only one competitor, Disetronic Holding AG.
</P>
<P>
   ``MiniMed is the hands-down leader and essentially the only
company in the market,'' Kruger said. ``They owe that market share
and that lead position to their superior technology, and more
importantly to their extensive marketing and distribution efforts,
which have built this franchise for them.''

EFFECTS FIRM HEARD BUT NOT SEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an anonymous two-story building in an
industrial neighborhood, three dozen engineers struggle every day
to remove life's distractions from Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   SoundStorm, along with Hollywood-based Soundelux and George
Lucas' Skywalker Sound in San Rafael, have been the leading players
in the ultra-competitive field of movie ``sound design'' and
editing for more than a decade. But achieving the seamless
integration of sound and story has become a far more complex task
as digital sound makes it easier to recognize audio glitches
emanating from the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theaters, everything that's been shot on film is going to
be magnified _ camera noise, dry mouth, clicks, air conditioning,''
said Charles Meister, chief executive officer of Burbank-based
SoundStorm. ``Our job is to try to keep the audience in the story
as much as possible. Clicks and pops take them out of it.''
Accomplishing that sounds simple but is painstaking.
</P>
<P>
   Even though much of the process takes advantage of digital
technology, often taking months of work for a single feature, that
work usually does not start until after the shooting on a film has
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except on big-budget films, we are usually not on the set; we
provide the illusion that we were,'' Meister noted.
</P>
<P>
   SoundStorm, which is owned by half a dozen of its executives, is
not standing still. Its owners decided earlier this year that they
needed to start changing direction amid Hollywood's increasing use
of digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   SoundStorm hired Meister, who had been president of Soundelux
for six years, in June with the specific goal to ``diversify the
company's services and products'' into such areas as theme parks,
trailers, commercials and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it comes down to is moving data and eventually, we'll
move it over fiber-optics,'' Meister said. ``Everything is going to
change and it's all going to need audio. The industry is very
cyclical and tricky but all these new areas can benefit from
high-quality sound.''
</P>
<P>
   That means going after not only the high-profile studio projects
but the less visible titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently shot a scary movie called `Everything Put
Together,' where sound design is pretty important because it adds a
third dimension to the film with noises in the background that
really add to the texture,'' said Marc Forster, the film's
producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the SoundStorm people were really wonderful about
trying to offer services that were within my budget but still with
high technical standards,'' said Forster, who hopes to sell the
movie at the Sundance Film Festival. ``What I really liked is they
treated my film the same as they would have if it had been from a
name producer.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-member SoundStorm team has racked up four Academy sound
editing nominations and one victory, for 1996's ``The Ghost and the
Darkness,'' with its re-creation of turn-of-the-century life on the
African frontier. In 1993's Oscar-nominated ``The Fugitive,''
SoundStorm used more than 200 different soundtracks for the famous
train-crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   It's a business that combines a massive library of more than
7,000 separate sounds with precision location recordings. Some of
the more notable: a Puerto Rican bat cave for ``Batman Forever,'' a
Mississippi swamp in ``A Time to Kill'' and the most desolate areas
of California's high desert for the upcoming ``Three Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every film is an opportunity to do something unique,'' Meister
said.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Three Kings,'' a Warner Bros. release set at the end of
the Gulf War, SoundStorm engineers went to the barren stretches of
the northern Mojave Desert near Acton and California City to
re-create sounds of troops operating in the Kuwaiti and Iraqi
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked those areas because you can record there with very
little other sound,'' Meister said. ``Deserts are great places for
recording the sounds of vehicles and for blowing stuff up.''
</P>
<P>
   But what SoundStorm does is far more complex than going out to a
sand pit with tape recorders and setting off some dynamite. ``I
think they're very good at making very small choices to give a film
a natural look and feel,'' said Peter Freedman, who recently
completed directing an offbeat comedy called ``Bad Dog,'' about a
man who walks dogs for a living in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot very quickly and cheaply, often without synchronized
sound, so a lot of what you hear had to be created in
post-production _ scenes in the vet's office, cats howling, the
creaking of a door,'' said Freedman, who is seeking a distributor.
``The thing that was most impressive was what (SoundStorm) was able
to do _ create sound with a sense of humor, which I think is quite
rare.''

BAKER: GIANT AMONG MEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You go to the doctor for a routine physical exam,
you can expect a shot in the arm. Dusty Baker got his last week
from a nurse who, recognizing the San Francisco Giants manager,
proceeded to thank him effusively.
</P>
<P>
   For what, giving good blood? Baker was bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse went on: ``Since you've been managing the Giants,
we've had hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment he couldn't have felt dizzier if the nurse had
drawn two liters of blood. The patient making the nurse feel
better. That's pretty heady stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was cool,'' Baker says a few days later. ``Real cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope, unfortunately, sprang a leak in San Diego over the
weekend. The Giants lost twice to the Padres while the National
League West-leading Arizona Diamondbacks took two against Florida
to give themselves an eight-game cushion over San Francisco with
two weeks remaining in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Nobody in February expected the decidedly
middle-class Giants to be anywhere in the neighborhood of the
affluent Los Angeles Dodgers come September. They were separated by
$34million in player salaries at the season's start. And the gulf
between the free-spending Dodgers and the budget-conscious Giants
remains spacious; the Dodgers were 13 games behind the Giants at
the start of Monday's four-game series between the intrastate
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   When people say Baker used mirrors to keep Arizona in his club's
sight lines for so long, it's more than a figure of speech. The
Giants are a reflection of their manager. They play hard and lay
down their egos like so many sacrifice bunts.
</P>
<P>
   If you were a Dodgers fan in the club's L.A. heyday, it all
sounds achingly familiar. You remember Baker taking a hittable
fastball for ball four in the ninth inning of a game the Dodgers
were trailing by one, happy to end his 15-game hitting streak if it
helped the team win.
</P>
<P>
   You recall him hitting his 30th home run in his last at-bat of
the 1977 regular season to give the Dodgers the first team in the
majors with four players having at least 30 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   You can relate to why Darryl Hamilton would choose to wear
Baker's jersey (No. 12) when he was in Colorado, after leaving San
Francisco, and former teammate Gary Matthews would name one of his
sons (Dustin) after Baker.
</P>
<P>
   You don't laugh when one of his players, center fielder Marvin
Benard, says of Baker, ``If he would run for mayor of San
Francisco, it'd be close.''
</P>
<P>
   You cry when you think of what Baker could have done for the
Dodgers, if pride and prejudice hadn't stood in the way.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   For eight years beginning in 1976, Baker, an outfielder, was the
quintessential Dodger. He played hard, he played hurt and the only
thing he cared about was winning. It didn't bother him that the
spotlight fell on Ron Cey, Steve Garvey, Bill Russell and Davey
Lopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusty, as much as any player I've known, was always
team-oriented,'' says former general manager Fred Claire. ``You
would never hear Dusty talking about Dusty.''
</P>
<P>
   You still won't. When the conversation turns to himself, he
stammers and meanders, this man who is fluent in three languages _
Spanish, English and body language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather give credit to the players,'' Baker says. ``They're
the ones getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a windless day at Candlestick Point when you hear Baker
say, ``We did a great job'' after a win and ``They were dreadful''
after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be snowing in the Bay Area in July when you see Baker
managing from the top step of the dugout, courting the television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be hill-less in San Francisco when Baker berates a player
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder Baker's players love him like a brother, like a
father? He slips between the fraternal and paternal roles as if
born to the task.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he was.
</P>
<P>
   He led off the birth order in John and Christine Baker's
five-deep lineup. And just as the No. 1 hitter has different
strengths than the No.4 hitter, so it is with siblings.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of responsibility has always been Baker's natural
strength. He learned early how to handle his two brothers and two
sisters when his parents were both working. Little did he know then
he was, as he says now, ``a manager in training.''
</P>
<P>
   What, you thought he was an overnight success, this man who won
NL managerial honors in 1993, his first year at the helm in San
Francisco, and again in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just an overnight process,'' Baker says, leveling
you with a stare that dares you to disagree. In that instant you
know how his siblings once must have felt and what it's like now to
be one of his players.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusty very seldom tattled on his brothers and sisters,''
Christine Baker says by telephone from Rancho Cordova, a suburb of
Sacramento. ``I'm finding out now, all these years later, that it
was so-and-so who ate the cherries that went on the ham at
Thanksgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasions when there was hell to pay in the Baker
household, Dusty stoically accepted the bill. He'd settle with the
guilty party later, behind closed doors. It's the same way he
operates as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why embarrass a guy in front of the team or in the press?''
Baker says. ``No one wants to called out like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker is speaking from experience. He says he'd never want any
of his players to face the same public censure he did on occasion
during his first few years in the big leagues, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when Baker recently got wind of a Giants pitcher
denigrating the defense of one of his outfielders, he called both
players into his office, shut the door and defused the tension
right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has been known to offer his players cold compresses even
before they admit to being hot under the collar. He is acutely
observant, which turns people into dime-store novels in his hands.
He can read them in a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you think he's being inattentive, he's not. You notice
his digital wristwatch is flashing 5:24 when it's really 10:15 and
you jokingly ask him if he knows what time it is. Baker looks at
his watch, fiddles with a few of the knobs and admits he hasn't
figured out how to work the blasted thing. ``I just use it for
timing the opposing pitcher's delivery (for the purpose of stealing
bases),'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing pitcher isn't the only one hard-pressed to get
anything past Baker. Benard remembers a trip to Dodger Stadium with
the Giants during his rookie season, in 1996. Benard was pressing
something awful in batting practice. He fouled one pitch off his
foot and popped up another. Before the Nicaraguan from Bell Gardens
got two steps out of the batting cage, Baker was there to rescue
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take any more cuts,'' Benard remembers. ``Instead, we
talked for 45 minutes, and it was like he was taking a big load off
my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   The conversation could have been in Spanish. Pero naturalmente.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Baker insisted all her children study Spanish when
they were growing up, the better to facilitate communication and
camaraderie with everyone in their multi-ethnic neighborhood in
Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of high school Spanish and a few years of
winter ball in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic,
Baker became fluent in the language. Conducting television and
radio interviews in Spanish now is second-nature to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes (the Spanish-speaking) players a lot more
comfortable, to be able to speak to him in their language,'' says
Benard. ``It makes you want to play hard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a manager Baker plays his gut, not the percentages. That's
what you always hear, anyway. Baker begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   He does his homework. The hopelessly unsynchronized watch on his
wrist is grist for Baker's argument.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Baker if he manages by the book and he's liable to ask,
which one? He produces four of his favorites: ``Don't Sweat the
Small Stuff (And it's All Small Stuff),'' ``The Art of War,'' ``A
Book of Five Rings'' and ``The Gospel According to Casey.''
</P>
<P>
   From militarism to motivation, Baker would appear to have all
the bases covered.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   Baker's world was mutual funds and money markets when Dodgers
executive Al Campanis made his televised comment in 1987 that
African-Americans lacked ``the necessities'' to be in baseball
management. Baker, a stockbroker one year removed from his
retirement from baseball, already was upset at the Dodgers for
having unceremoniously dealt him to the Giants in 1984. Campanis'
comments were so much salt on an open wound.
</P>
<P>
   The healing process has been slow. It doesn't matter that the
coaching door cracked open for minorities in the wake of that
``Nightline'' nightmare, allowing Baker and a few others to squeeze
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still hurting over what happened,'' says Hamilton, the
former Giant who is now with the New York Mets. ``I don't know if
Dusty can swallow his pride.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true, Baker doesn't suffer hypocrites gladly. He'll never
forget how a certain Dodgers executive pitched Bobby Valentine to
the Giants before then-general manager Peter Magowan promoted Baker
from hitting coach to manager after the firing of Roger Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Baker says the enmity he feels toward the
Dodgers ``is fading with time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like his mother is fond of saying: You have to step over
rocks instead of dragging them behind you.
</P>
<P>
   John and Christine Baker's leadoff sibling wasn't always
nimble-footed. He has worked to make himself so.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ When Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler was unable to
start Monday night's game against Dallas, it looked like a game the
Falcons couldn't win.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson went down with a knee
injury during the second series, it was assured.
</P>
<P>
   With the Falcons' two best players on the bench, it didn't take
much for the Cowboys to muster a 24-7 win before a Texas Stadium
crowd of 63,663.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were forced to start Tony Graziani in place of Pro
Bowl quarterback Chandler, who had not recovered from a hamstring
injury suffered in Atlanta's opener against Minnesota. Graziani,
who had not lasted beyond halftime in his other two career starts,
bettered those appearances _ but not by much. He went 7-for-16 for
90 yards with one interception before being yanked in the third
quarter for Danny Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see a guy running around out there having to
fight for yardage or trying to try find a place to throw the
football,'' said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, whose team will take a
2-0 record into its bye week.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the Cowboys to get to Graziani. On the
third play of the game, Dexter Coakley picked off a pass, then ran
it back 43 yards to the Atlanta 10. The Cowboys couldn't punch it
in, but Richie Cunningham booted a 23-yard field goal, and Dallas
had an early 3-0 edge.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't nearly as distressing to the Falcons as what
happened on their next possession. On only his third carry of the
game, Anderson, last year's leading NFC rusher, twisted his knee
making a cut on the artificial turf. He was diagnosed with a sprain
after a series of negative X-rays. He never returned.
</P>
<P>
   That left inexperienced Texas Tech product Byron Hanspard to
carry the load for an equally uninitiated quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Cowboys looked more like the team that
floundered for much of its opener against the Redskins than the
team that mounted an incredible fourth-quarter comeback and
overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman started the game 1-for-5 and
finished with only 98 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's hero, Rocket Ismail, saw the end of the first
quarter in the locker room with a sprained left shoulder. Guard
Everett McIver joined him there before the end of the half with a
hamstring injury. Tackle Erik Williams never even stepped on the
field, injuring his quadriceps during pre-game warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost two guys on the right side of the ball, but we were
able to hold together,'' said Dallas running back Emmitt Smith, who
rushed for 108 yards and two TDs on 29 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Falcons (0-2) were so inept, Dallas' job became
easy, although the Cowboys were far from artistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dropped too many passes, had too many negative-yard runs,
but I thought our guys played hard throughout the ballgame,''
Gailey said. ``And we took advantage of turnovers we got. That puts
you in position to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas defense, which surrendered 35 points in the opener
against Washington, shut out the Falcons until the 4:00 mark in the
final period when Kanell hit Tim Dwight with a 45-yarder to make it
17-7.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive end Greg Ellis, who had two sacks in the
season opener, became a hero again when he thwarted any Falcons
hopes of a comeback by intercepting a Kanell pass and returning it
87 yards for Dallas' final touchdown with 46 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set the tone early in the game that we were going to be a
force to be reckoned with,'' said Cowboys defensive tackle Chad
Hennings.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IRVING _ As part of their 40th-season celebration, the Cowboys
trotted some of the great names from their past out onto the field
at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad they couldn't find some extra pads and helmets for Tony
Dorsett, Bob Lilly, Roger Staubach, Harvey Martin and all the rest
for an intrasquad game. At least a bunch of middle-aged guys with
paunchy bellies might have upped the entertainment factor with
comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys and Falcons brought to Monday night was a
compelling reason to flip the channel to Ally McBeal reruns and an
affair with less meat on its bones than Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   It will go down in the books as a 24-7 victory that jumps Dallas
to the top of the division standings, not to mention already
leaving the Cowboys as one of only two 2-0 teams in the entire NFC.
Which just goes to prove that they don't make the NFC like they
used to anymore, and the same can be said for Super Bowl teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are said to be driven this season to disprove the
notion held by most of the civilized world that last year's run to
the Super Bowl was one of those rare and inexplicable and
not-to-be-repeated occurrences. Like the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   But all they could offer up in this one was the atmosphere and
intensity of a preseason game. Not that the Cowboys don't
appreciate the opportunity for some extra work.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the celebrated 41-35 comeback win at Washington in
the season opener, there was the nagging question of a Dallas
defense that allowed the Redskins to crank out 504 yards of
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true that Deion Sanders was still sidelined with his
sore toe, Kevin Smith with a bad back and Leon Lett because of his
latest substance-abuse suspension. But if the Cowboys are going to
eventually get consideration as a team that can be more than a
playoff poseur this time around, the onus is on them to prove they
can get the job done against good competition. Which Atlanta
clearly is not.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons began the game with their veteran starting
quarterback Chris Chandler on the sideline nursing a sore hamstring
and third-year man Tony Graziani leading the way. Not to say that
Graziani is green in the ways of the NFL, but he began the night
having never thrown a touchdown pass as a professional and did very
little to change that.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Graziani's best _ and maybe only _ opportunity to take
the Falcons to a score came on the very first play from scrimmage
on the night. That's when he handed the ball off to Jamal Anderson,
took a return pitch and then heaved a perfect rainbow down the
middle of the field on a flea-flicker to a streaking Chris
Calloway, who could have cruised all the way into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, Calloway did his cruising without the ball after it
hit him in the hands and bounced harmlessly to the turf.
</P>
<P>
   End of surprise. End of any fight the Falcons would put up.
Especially when Anderson, their workhorse running back, had to
leave the game with a sprained right knee on the second series of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Without Chandler and without Anderson, the Cowboys could
probably have played the rest of the night with their arms and legs
wrapped up in duct tape like Kevin Garnett in that Nike commercial
and the Falcons would have been like the short, fat kid, still
unable to score.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there aren't still reasons for concern with
the Dallas defense. For until Sanders and/or Smith returns, there
will be too many times in the coming weeks when Charlie Williams is
left looking as confused on the corner as a lost tourist.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of game when you figured the Cowboys could again
put up some big offensive numbers and maybe would have, if they
hadn't lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first quarter, Richie Cunningham had kicked a
23-yard field goal and Emmitt Smith had run two yards for a
touchdown and a 10-0 lead, and the gap between the Cowboys and
Falcons appeared to be at least three times as wide.
</P>
<P>
   Smith added another TD in the second half and finished with 29
carries for 108 yards and moved into fourth place on the NFL's
all-time rushing list, ahead of Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Danny Kanell had replaced Graziani at quarterback
when there did not seem to be anything the Falcons could do. Except
there's always something to do against the patchwork Cowboys
secondary _ throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell hit Tim Dwight with a 25-yard touchdown and then had the
Falcons back on the Dallas doorstep in the final minute until Greg
Ellis picked off a pass and went 87 yards the other way to score.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-0 start. Another win. Even if it felt like preseason. Until
all the main men are back on defense, the Cowboys can still use the
work.

KINGS END FORUM ERA WITH ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Through 17 years, Dave Taylor played in
1,111 games for the Los Angeles Kings, a team record. With Marcel
Dionne and Rogie Vachon, he is one of just three Kings to have his
jersey retired.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Taylor's feelings _ and those of the Kings' _
were far from bittersweet as they bid farewell to the Forum in an
8-1 exhibition victory over the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Taylor, the
Kings' senior vice president and general manager, and his team were
looking to the future, not the past.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor cited reaching the Stanley Cup Finals in the 1992-93 as
his career highlight and what he will regard as his fondest memory
of the Forum. But he wasn't choked up about leaving, considering
the Kings are moving to the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings dominated the Ducks as former Islanders starZiggy
Palffy scored his first goal as a King. On the power play, Luc
Robitaille passed across ice to Jozef Stumpel, who passed to Palffy
in front of the net. It was the Kings' first goal, the only one in
the first period. The Kings' Jaroslav Modry, Craig Johnson, Jason
Podollan, Len Barrie and Audette twice, scored in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' 7-0 lead in the third turned the game turn into a
cheap-shot and fighting fest, highlighted by a confrontation
between Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg and Kings coach Andy Murray
yelling at each other. Play was stopped for approximately 15
minutes as officials tried to get the game under control.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery Men win: As part of the Forum-farewell festivities there
was a charity exhibition before the Kings-Ducks game. Kings alumni
lost 4-2 to the Mystery Men. The Mystery Men were an array of
celebrities and players from the upcoming film Mystery, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players was Scott Wolf, an actor on TV's ``Party of
Five.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not planning a career change,'' Wolf said, ``not unless
they need someone who constantly falls on the ice and is out of
breath all the time.''

MARINERS' POSSE FAILS TO ROUND UP ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was spring training all over again Monday night at
Safeco Field. Rookie auditions on the mound. Balls soaring over the
fence. Runs aplenty. Everything but Arizona's blazing sun.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners settled for ``Blazing Saddles'' instead, relying on
a little levity to get through the dog days of a lost season.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted the Kansas City Royals were not amused. They
kept things serious, cranking out four home runs _ two by rookie
Mark Quinn _ to notch a 10-9 victory before a season-low Safeco
Field crowd of 33,254.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn provided solo blasts in the fourth and seventh innings,
giving him his second two-homer game in a week in the big leagues.
That was just enough to offset Ken Griffey Jr.'s 46th long ball, a
two-run shot in the eighth inning that tied the Mariners slugger
with Joe Carter for 32nd on the all-time homer list at 396.
</P>
<P>
   Trying, and failing, to even their record at 75-75, the Mariners
turned playful. In the second inning, with one runner on and one
out, nine players donned oversized, 10-gallon hats and hung on the
dugout rail as Jay Buhner did a makeshift gallop to the plate, bat
between legs, for his first at-bat. The moment apparently was
choreographed, with the theme song to the old television western,
``Bonanza,'' playing over the public address system while all this
took place.
</P>
<P>
   The hatwear was a combination Southwestern and Puyallup Fair
motif _ foam rubber in texture, coming in separate shades of
flourescent blue, green, red and yellow, each with a little star on
the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the ugliest things I'd ever seen,'' said Mariners
manager Lou Piniella, referring to the hats, not any on-field
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's ``posse'' included Griffey, Brian Hunter, Mike Blowers,
Paul Abbott, Tom Lampkin, John Halama, Gil Meche, Ozzie Timmons and
Shane Monahan.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey apparently was responsible for the fashion statement,
ordering the hats from a Northgate costume shop for no other reason
than to pull a prank on the Mariners' sometimes overbearing
clubhouse leader. The Bonanza theme song, which accompanied Buhner
to the plate, was the inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the big sheriff,'' Griffey said of Buhner. ``We said,
`OK, we'll fix him.' So I decided to get some hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella, ``I told him to have his fun and get it over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner was so inspired, he took one for the team, hardly
flinching when a Blake Stein pitch glanced off his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   If only the Mariners could have shown as much togetherness when
it counted.
</P>
<P>
   They sent rookie Robert Ramsay to the mound for his first
big-league start. It didn't go well at all. The lefty lasted just
four innings, getting hit hard and often. His third batter, Carlos
Beltran, slugged a two-run homer. He gave up Quinn's long blast to
center in the fourth. Ramsay departed after throwing only 64
pitches, trailing 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The first-year pitcher will receive two more starts, his next
coming Sunday at home against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the learning experience for a lot of pitchers
we've had this summer,'' said Piniella, who saw a few positive
signs in Ramsay's effort. ``He didn't back away. I like that.
That's what I want to see. He didn't walk anybody. If you get hit,
you try to make better pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I try and do it, is to have them beat me with
what they've got,'' Ramsay said. ``I didn't walk anybody. I've just
got to make quality pitches when I need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay's teammates, sans cowboy hats, battled back with five
runs in the fifth to grab a short-lived 6-5 lead. Griffey had the
big hit in this uprising, a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ramsay's replacement, fellow rookie Brett Hinchliffe,
had his own troubles, giving up four runs himself. Included in his
effort was a three-run sixth inning, one that hardly endeared him
to those trying to piece together a pitching staff for next season.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Hinchliffe retired the first two batters, then
carelessly walked two. The next batter, Rey Sanchez doubled both
runners home, sending a ball deep into the gap in left-center and
pulling the Royals from a 6-5 deficit into a 7-6 lead. Sanchez had
a career-high four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners rookie pitchers weren't the only ones who suffered on
this night. Veteran reliever Jose Paniagua, out 10 days with a
groin injury, served up consecutive launching-pad shots in the
eighth, Quinn and Joe Vitiello each crunching one hard off the
upper-deck facade in left to build a 10-7 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was hats off to Kansas City.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Growing up in Montreal, Eric Gagne didn't know
about the strange things that happen between the Los Angeles
Dodgers and San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it appeared Gagne might win his first major-league
game he couldn't have realized what goes on between these two
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's 6-5 victory in front of 33,280 at Dodger Stadium
was typical, won on a ninth-inning, bases-loaded single by Eric
Karros off Jerry Spradlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know very much, only what I saw of them on
video tape before the game,'' Gagne said after his third career
start. ``I guess that first win is the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored three runs after Gagne was lifted for a
pinch-hitter in the fifth. But the Giants scored three runs in the
seventh, two on a home run by J.T. Snow, to tie the game at 5.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Borbon, the fourth Dodgers pitcher, had been struggling
for a month before he came for the ninth. All he did was set down
the Giants in order, including a called third strike on Barry
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job _ Barry Bonds,'' said Borbon (4-2). ``We had a
chance to win it earlier, but it is never easy against the
Giants''.
</P>
<P>
   Karros had two hits and four RBI. Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek
had three hits, including a home run, and is batting .327.
</P>
<P>
   But as Borbon said, there was nothing easy about playing the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the second inning, when Ellis Burks took off from first
and Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley made a perfect throw to second _
with nobody covering the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek and second baseman Eric Young had a long and
animated discussion about the blunder, which went down as an error
on Young because right-handed hitting Rich Aurilia was at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The play didn't result in a run, but no doubt will go down as
the symbol for the Dodgers' season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it lead to a run?'' Young said. ``Then there is nothing to
talk about. We just had a miscommunication.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Giants, they are technically still in the National
League West race. Division-leading Arizona has an eight-game lead
over San Francisco and 12 to play. The Diamondbacks, who could
clinch this weekend in San Francisco, lost 12-7 on Monday to
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers appeared to get Gagne his first victory by scoring
three runs in the fifth inning after he was lifted for a
pinch-hitter Craig Counsell.
</P>
<P>
   Counsell opened with a walk and one out later took third on a
double by Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield was intentionally walked and Karros followed with
a two-run double into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Russ Ortiz, in search of his 18th victory, was
replaced by left-hander Rich Rodriguez, who escaped big trouble
when center fielder Marvin Bernard took away extra bases from Devon
White with a leaping catch at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield scored on the sacrifice fly to give the Dodgers a 5-2
lead, but it could have been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth appeared to be a nice gift for Gagne, who did not have
good control, walking five in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his last start against the New York Mets, it didn't
hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers took a 2-1 lead on Grudzielanek's third-inning
homer, Bernard tied it in the fifth with an opposite-field home run
to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the other guys, but their leadoff hitter had me all
day,'' Gagne said. ``Except for the walks I felt OK. I'm just glad
we won.''

 BURTON, CRANSTON TAKE BEATTY SERIOUSLY  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A presidential race can get rougher than the final shootout in
``Bonnie and Clyde'' _ and actor Warren Beatty, who took most of
the bullets in that scene, knows it.
</P>
<P>
   But he may be willing to take another to get Democrats back on
the script of grassroots issues _ campaign finance, the environment
and the gap between rich and poor _ and he ``would do beautifully''
as a candidate, says former U.S. Senator Alan Cranston, a Beatty
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has been talking a presidential run with longtime friends
in political circles _ among them Cranston and Democratic state
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, rumored to be at least some
of the inspiration for his colorful, straight-talking pol in the
title role of last year's movie ``Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranston _ who made his own presidential run in 1984 _ met with
Beatty recently on the topic. And Burton, who suffered a mild heart
attack last week, said Monday that ``the only political thing I did
in the hospital'' was talk to Beatty about you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   Both plan to attend Beatty's keynote address at a dinner Sept.
29 for the Southern California Chapter of Americans for Democratic
Action in Beverly Hills, where he is to receive the ADA's Eleanor
Roosevelt Award. The event has reporters from around the world
already clamoring to attend in hopes of catching a presidential bid
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little overwhelming,'' said one spokeswoman for the
ADA, who said demands have come from ``everyone from Stern Magazine
in Germany to ABC News to Agence France-Presse to the Toronto Globe
and Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty himself has given little hint on the topic of his speech
or his plans _ other than authoring an opinion piece in the New
York Times that provided no direct clue to either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not saying what he's going to talk about,'' said one
insider helping to coordinate the speech. ``Warren isn't putting
any spin on it. But there's no question he's considering (a
presidential bid).''
</P>
<P>
   But the celebrated director and star of such movies as
``Splendor in the Grass,'' ``Reds'' and ``Shampoo'' has long
cultivated political interests, and both Cranston and Burton say
Beatty may be underrated by so-called political insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to people who are fairly heavyweight finance
types, and they don't denigrate his candidacy or think it's a
joke,'' said Burton in an interview Monday. ``There is a serious
message to be made, and Warren has the stature and the celebrity to
immediately do so.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, Beatty has the capacity to run a different kind of
campaign if he so chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming he got serious and did it, he could send out on the
Internet _ he's thinking of limiting contributions to $25 or $50 a
person _ and in my opinion, at least a million people would give,
even ones (already) giving 25 grand,'' Burton said. ``And they'd
give it to him to hear a second voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranston agrees that Beatty is ``touching on key and fundamental
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Beatty ``admires Al Gore and Bill Bradley, but he wants
them to be more in keeping with traditional Democratic principles
like Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. That's his purpose.
They haven't been as vigorous as he suggests they ought to be. ...
His goal is to get these issues addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty feels ``we have to get money out of campaigns,'' said
Cranston. ``He's concerned about those who cannot contribute the
big money that's practically mandatory under the system _ who are
left out of the decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranston was quick to point out that there are precedents for
actors holding high office. But he said that if Beatty is
``successful in moving Gore and/or Bradley ... I think he would not
run. If he fails, he is certainly considering it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cranston hinted the Beverly Hills speech may be too soon
for a formal launch. ``I don't think he's going to announce his
candidacy, and he's far from ready,'' Cranston said, adding that
Beatty has outlined issues that matter most to him _ and will be
the focus of his campaign, if there is one.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty is also deeply concerned about the environment, and
``he's thinking of impoverished people in our country. And people
who haven't gotten off to a good start in education and health care
and therefore have a tough time, all the time,'' said Cranston.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his actor friend's prospects, Cranston predicted,
``He will attract media attention,'' and his wife, renowned actress
Annette Bening _ who played a presidential paramour in ``An
American President'' _ would be ``a big asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Both veteran pols say presidential politics can be brutal, but
they're not worried for Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to say about him _ he went out with 8
million women?'' asked Burton. ``He's got a wonderful wife, and
he's absolutely proud of her. ... He's got great kids. All he needs
to do is get a dog and fireplace, and he's home free. ... There
ain't no secrets in Warren's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cranston: ``I told him he should be prepared for a lot of
slings and arrows.''
</P>
<P>
   But competitors say they're expecting a reprise of one of
Beatty's most notable _ and expensive _ flops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that worried,'' said one Gore adviser Monday. ``We
just saw `Ishtar' last weekend.''

BAY BILLBOARD JUST BARGING IN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ If you think there's a lot of ugly stuff floating
in the bay now, just wait for the world's largest floating
billboard _ coming soon.
<P>
   The Bay Area is a breeding ground for wonderful and brilliant
ideas, and this isn't one of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Any day now a massive billboard-on-a-barge, towed by a tug, will
begin cruising alongside Highway 101 south of Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't miss this unique opportunity to have the most
talked-about message in the Bay Area,'' crows Adauction.com
(415-365-2261).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gee, honey, isn't the Bay beautiful this morning _ the &LR; 
 &UR; whitecaps, the seagulls, the way the sun glints off the &LR; 
 &UR; Preparation H billboard? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Next: Ads painted on octopi (``Acme Scuba Shop'').
</P>
<P>
   The company says of its bilgeboard, ``It's just another way that
Adauction is revolutionizing the media world.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolutions ain't what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   SLITHERING PAST Le Central on Friday afternoon, Lotta Dotz
spotted da snake charmer, Willie Brown, rattling his dice cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't see if he rolled snake-eyes,'' Dotz sez. ``Good to
know he remains a regular at Le Central, that he still has a pit to
hiss in.''
</P>
<P>
   PREGNANT PAUSE: Seven extremely pregnant women and their
husbands stuffed themselves into an elevator at Sequoia Hospital in
Redwood City one recent evening.
</P>
<P>
   The group was touring the hospital in preparation for stork
time. The elevator protested the load by jamming between the third
and fourth floors.
</P>
<P>
   The seven couples, plus one man with a heart condition, were
trapped for an hour. Much anxiety, says Keith Majkut, but they all
kept their cool and their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The RCFD finally dropped a ladder and pulled everyone out
through the elevator roof.
</P>
<P>
   Those escape hatches are tiny. It was a tight squeeze _ kind of
a metaphor for upcoming events.
</P>
<P>
   REPORTS OF legendary barkeep Michael McCourt's minor heart
attack Saturday were greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just heartburn,'' snorts McCourt.
</P>
<P>
   But for the hell of it, Michael underwent angioplasty and will
be back behind the mahogany at the Whitehall Tavern as early as
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ix-nay on the pickled pig's feet, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   SACRED (and medium-sacred) cows are roasted weekly on the big
marquee outside Shanghai Kelly's neighborhood tavern, Polk and
Broadway. This week's message: ``Sign up here for the Committee of
S.F. Felons to Re-Elect Terence Hallinan.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW RULE IN THE NFL: Kickers must use a fresh, unused football
for each kick. Why? Because kickers cheat. They fill balls with
helium, overinflate 'em, microwave 'em (seriously), lots of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Now each pristine, security-guarded kicking ball is branded with
a ``K'' inside a circle, and Matt Rudoff points out that's one of
the symbols used to denote kosher food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosher pigskin?`' wonders Rudoff.
</P>
<P>
   He muses that the tenets of Judaism ain't what they used to be.
He himself went to a Giants game on Rosh Hashana Hoshanah &LR;   &LR; and saw
a guy wearing a cap with ``Giants'' written in Hebrew. ``Oy, the
chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   WHOLE LOTTA SHAKIN': Willie Brown saved Lotta's Fountain,
honoring a campaign promise to get it rebuilt and flowing.
</P>
<P>
   And now Brown has saved the annual ceremonial reunion of '06
Q &LR; quake survivors at Lotta's.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent re-dedication of the reborn fountain, raised from
rust and ruin on orders from Willie, the Arts Commission forgot to
invite the few remaining '06 survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Also snubbed: Taren Sapienza, for years the coordinator of the
annual Quake Day survivors' reunion. The commission also forgot a
promise to include a plaque saluting the survivors and to bury a
time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   The commission forgot that the fountain is 10 percent art and 90
percent memorial to the city's spirit. In the chaotic wake of the
Big Quake, the fountain was a bulletin board and gathering place
for dispersed and desperate friends and families.
</P>
<P>
   Da Mayor has personally apologized to the snubees and pleaded
with them to keep alive the annual ceremony at Lotta's. And it
shall be so.
</P>
<P>
   CELL PHOLLIES: Bill Higgs was in line at the Lafayette post
office behind a cell-yapper. Irritating, but get used to it, right?
</P>
<P>
   Bill elaborates: ``It's this guy's turn and he says into the
phone, `Hold on.' He reaches into his jacket pocket and answers a
second cell phone, which apparently just rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he walks up to the window with a phone at each ear. The
clerk gawks at the guy while he extricates himself from the two
calls, but not before holding up the line for several minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bitter Bill wonders, ``Do you suppose these guys will evolve
more ears to go with their multiple phones?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but in the meantime, there are other places they can put
those extra phones.

 EXCITE READY TO GO WIRELESS WITH AIRFLASH
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DEBORAH SOLOMON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- ExciteAtHome plans to announce a deal Tuesday with
AirFlash of Redwood City, Calif., that will let users access
Excite's Web content from wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   Excite said it will use AirFlash's wireless technology to offer
people on-the-go personalized content from Excite's portal.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will develop applications to help people get
e-mail, news and stock quotes from their wireless phones, as well
as location-specific information _ such as the nearest ATM or
florist.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will allow ExciteAtHome to position itself for a
fast-growing market _ handheld devices that can access the
Internet. Cell-phone-makers and handheld-computer manufacturers are
beginning to roll out phones and PDAs that can access the Web
wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome, Yahoo and other portals want to develop wireless
content so that they can translate their success on the desktop to
portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Flaum, ExciteAtHome's director of business development for
wireless, said the deal will allow Excite to offer mobile customers
content that they need in a user-friendly format.
</P>
<P>
   While the Web is great to surf on a PC, the handsets and PDAs
being released have small screens that make it tedious to browse
the Net. AirFlash is helping Excite develop personalized content
that mobile users need immediately _ such as traffic and weather _
and display it in a format that's easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just translating an entire Web site to the handheld
device, Flaum said, AirFlash will help ExciteAtHome ``decide which
pieces really matter and then create content that users will
want.''
</P>
<P>
   The rewards could be great, as more wireless carriers start
rolling out Internet phones. This month, Sprint PCS is beginning to
offer wireless Web phones and the Strategis Group, a research firm
in Washington, D.C., projects that cell phone companies will spend
more than $2 billion on location technologies over the next five
years. Most of that money is being spent to meet federal
requirements, which mandate that wireless carriers be able to tell
the location of a 911 call by October 2001. But with more than 69
million people already carrying a mobile phone and several million
more with PDAs, the market has a lot of potential.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome will use AirFlash's mobile portal service, which
works with all types of cell phone technology.
</P>
<P>
   AirFlash allows someone who is using a wireless device to get
detailed information about their location. That information can
then be used to find the closest java joint, get updated traffic
reports or even find a movie theater nearby and order tickets
online.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as SnapTrack of San Jose, Calif., are
developing technology to help wireless carriers pinpoint a caller's
location. And businesses such as Vicinity Corp. of Palo Alto,
Calif., and SignalSoft of Boulder, Colo., are creating databases of
shops, banks, hotels and other businesses that road warriors may
want to find.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first major wireless deal for ExciteAtHome, though
the company also offers limited Excite.com content on the Palm
handheld device.

 THE PLAN DOESN'T ADD UP
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ARTHUR M. LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Q: I am 60 years old and retired, with a modest pension. My wife
and I need an additional $20,000 per year in pre-tax money to cover
our expenses. I have $100,000 in stocks in my Individual Retirement
Account, and we have $100,000 in stocks in a joint brokerage
account. So we would have to withdraw about 10 percent per year
from the assets in our portfolios, which is about the average rate
that stocks appreciate over the long run. Does our plan seem
feasible?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: To answer the question definitively, I would need to know
how well your stock portfolios will perform during your lifetimes,
and also what will happen to the cost of living. Alas, nobody can
say for sure.
</P>
<P>
   As you suggest, 10 percent per year could be a reasonable
expectation for long-term growth in the average stock portfolio.
But there will be years when you do worse than that _ yet you still
will be committed to selling $20,000 of your assets. Selling that
much stock when prices are depressed would weaken your long-term
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, your plan doesn't seem to take inflation into
account. You say you need an extra $20,000 per year, but as prices
rise you will find that you need $21,000 per year, $22,000 and so
on to maintain the same standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   Because of inflation and the fact that stock performances vary
widely from year to year, your plan seems perilous. If I were in
your shoes, I wouldn't start out with a plan that required me to
sell more than 6 percent of my stocks per year. That probably would
give you the leeway you need to withstand stock-market dips and
inflationary surges. But it would require you to start with a much
larger portfolio: $333,333.33, to be more or less exact.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know you don't like to give advice about particular stocks,
but in my case it's necessary. I bought shares of Iridium World
Communications at around $40 each, thinking that their satellite
technology was a no-brainer investment. But they got into trouble
and filed for reorganization, and the stock is down to around $3. I
have a paper loss of $3,000, and wonder whether I should sell and
take the tax loss, or hold on until the year is almost over to see
whether the stock bounces back.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't have to render an opinion about Iridium to answer
your question.
</P>
<P>
   You can't sell your Iridium stock just now because trading has
been suspended since August 13, when the company announced plans to
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. You may have to wait to
sell until the reorganization is complete.
</P>
<P>
   If your stock turns out to be worthless _ as often happens to
common stock in a reorganization _ you can declare the entire
purchase price, including commissions, as a capital loss.
</P>
<P>
   If my math is correct, you hold about 80 shares, worth in the
neighborhood of $250 before trading was halted. Any further
downside risk is negligible, so it won't do you much harm to hang
in there. Perhaps your stock will make a strong recovery _ although
if past Chapter 11 sagas are any guide, that appears to be a long
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to know about options trading. I'm told that it is
high-risk, but I assume that the potential rewards are large. What
exactly is options trading, and how does one find out more about
how to do it?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you buy an option on a particular stock, it gives you
the right to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (if you buy
a put option) 100 shares of the stock at a fixed price before a
fixed expiration date. (You also can buy and sell options on
stock-market indexes.)
</P>
<P>
   Options are much cheaper than the stock itself, so if you guess
correctly about the direction the price is going to move, your
profits can be quite large relative to the size of your investment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you guess wrong, you can lose most or all
of the money you paid for the option. Many options expire
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, the risk is high if you use options strictly for
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   However, options also can be used in various conservative
strategies to protect your assets. For example, you can buy put
options on a stock you own. If the stock price falls, the value of
the put option will rise, offsetting part of your loss.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy and sell options through most securities brokers.
You have to explain in advance that you plan to trade options,
because this usually requires a special kind of account. Also, the
broker is legally required to make certain that you understand the
risks and can afford the potential losses.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most useful book for a beginner is ``Options:
Essential Concepts and Trading Strategies,'' by the Options
Institute. The institute is an arm of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, the biggest options exchange in the United States.

 SWITCHING INVESTMENT STRATEGIES _ TOTAL-MARKET INDEX FUNDS HOT
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ARTHUR M. LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
People who own shares in mutual funds that track the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index have enjoyed superior returns in recent years. But
now experts suggest that it might be time for these shareholders to
hedge their bets.
</P>
<P>
   The 500 large-capitalization companies that make up the S&AMP;P
index can't continue to outpace the rest of the market
indefinitely, the experts warn. At some point they will cool down,
and smaller-cap companies will outperform them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing goes on forever,'' says Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of
No-Load Fund Investor. ``Sooner or later, small caps are going to
do better than large caps. It has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If you accept that scenario, you might want to buy shares in one
of the so-called total-market mutual funds that track the Wilshire
5000 index. These funds are offered by the Fidelity, Schwab, T.
Rowe Price, Vanguard and Wilshire fund groups.
</P>
<P>
   The message appears to be getting through.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12 months ended in July, the assets of Vanguard's Total
Stock Market fund rose more than 80 percent to $13.1 billion. Only
about one-fifth of that was caused by an increase in the Wilshire
5000 index; the remainder was due to new share purchases by
investors.
</P>
<P>
   However, the enormous Vanguard Index 500 fund, which tracks the
S&AMP;P 500, was no slouch either. Its assets rose 40 percent in the
12-month period to $91 billion, with about half the gain
attributable to new investments.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilshire 5000 index includes almost every publicly held
company traded in the United States. Its name is misleading,
however, because it has grown to include more than 7,000 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 stocks are part of the Wilshire 5000 index, of
course, and because that index is capitalization-weighted, they
dominate it, accounting for about 80 percent of the total market
value.
</P>
<P>
   So an investment in a Wilshire 5000 index fund is not a flight
from the S&AMP;P 500. It is, however, a significant step away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will still have plenty of exposure to the big caps,''
notes Russ Kinnel, an equity fund analyst with Morningstar Inc.,
``but also to small and midcaps. So if the performance of big caps
is not great, you get the benefit of diversification.''
</P>
<P>
   Proceed with caution, however, because betting against the S&AMP;P
500 has been a losing proposition for years. The Wilshire 5000 has
lagged behind the S&AMP;P 500 every full year since 1993, and continues
to lag behind it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows how long it's going to take for the broader
market to exert some strength again,'' says Craig Litman of the
Litman/Gregory investment-advisory firm in Larkspur, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, despite his prediction that a small-cap resurgence is
inevitable, warns that you shouldn't commit yourself heavily to
small caps until ``after the next bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains: ``Small caps almost always decline more than large
caps in a bear market. That is a fairly consistent pattern. They
are less liquid than large caps, so their price declines are
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   It's anyone's guess as to when the next bear market will occur.
And recognizing when it has reached bottom won't be easy _ unless
you happen to be clairvoyant.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard, long the undisputed leader among index-fund sponsors,
has been heavily promoting its Total Stock Market Index Fund, which
mirrors the performance of the Wilshire 5000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been stressing to investors that between an S&AMP;P 500 fund
and a fund that tracks the Wilshire 5000, the latter is the better
of the two,'' says Vanguard spokesman John Demming. ``It is more
broadly diversified, less concentrated, with less inherent risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stevens, senior vice president of Wilshire Associates, notes
that his firm has been compiling the Wilshire 5000 index for 27
years, but didn't feel inspired to start a mutual fund based on it
until last year, when it detected a surge of interest among
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were deluged with calls from people who want to position
themselves in case the relationship between large-cap performance
and small-cap performance reverts,'' he says. ``We've also seen
interest in our index among institutions who want to switch to the
Wilshire 5000 as a benchmark, and on the part of financial
planners.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened for business seven months ago, the Wilshire 5000
Index Portfolio Fund has attracted more than $100 million in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the stars are lining up here for potentially a good
small-cap environment,'' Stevens says.
</P>
<P>
   Those who already hold shares in an S&AMP;P 500 fund don't have to
sell all their shares to diversify. They can simulate a Wilshire
5000 fund by shifting part of their money into a so-called
extended-market fund, which tracks all U.S. stocks except those in
the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   If you have $100,000 invested in an S&AMP;P 500 fund, for example,
you could sell $20,000 worth and invest the proceeds in one of the
extended-market funds. That would give you the same 80-20
big-cap/lesser-cap mix as a Wilshire 5000 fund.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be only two extended-market funds: the Extended
Equity Market Index Fund from T. Rowe Price and the Extended Market
Index Fund from Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   The Price fund opened for business early last year and has
assets of close to $40 million. The Vanguard fund was started in
1987 and has assets of more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Wilshire 5000 is confined to U.S. stocks, some
internationally minded investors may think that it isn't
diversified enough.
</P>
<P>
   Those who feel that way can put together an index-fund portfolio
that reflects the performance of all the world's markets.
</P>
<P>
   There is no single mutual fund that tracks all the markets, but
there are funds that track virtually all the non-U.S. markets. A
notable example is the Vanguard Total International Stock Index
Fund, which invests in 1,500 companies in 30 countries, covering
most of Europe, Asia, the Far East and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Troyer, a principal with the Vanguard fund group, says U.S.
stocks currently represent about 48 percent of the total market
value of all stocks.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you own shares in a Wilshire 5000 fund and an
international index fund in the correct proportion _ 48 percent
versus 52 percent _ you can synthesize an all-world index fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Troyer says he doubts that many U.S. investors have the guts
to risk more than half their assets abroad. ``Ten to 20 percent is
probably diversification enough for most people,'' he remarks.

ANDERSON INJURY MIGHT COST FALCONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A year ago, the Atlanta Falcons were headed for
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two games into the 1999 season, their chances to
return might have gone down in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first quarter of Monday night's game at Texas
Stadium, Atlanta's premier player, running back Jamal Anderson,
crumpled to the artificial turf clutching his right knee. Falcons
coach Dan Reeves said the injury has not been evaluated but
acknowledged that ``it could be an ACL.''
</P>
<P>
   That's football shorthand for an anterior cruciate ligament, the
most-feared injury for any player. But if it happens the man whose
1,846 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns led the Falcons to their
first Super Bowl appearance last season, the injury could mark the
beginning of a bleak season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the extent of it yet, but it's devastating,''
fullback Bob Christian said. ``He's so important to this team.
Losing him, you're losing a guy who was our most valuable guy.
Maybe he'll be back this year, but we can't count on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred on Anderson's third carry of Monday night's
24-7 loss to the Cowboys, a second-and-four from the Falcons' 24.
Anderson was cut off by the defense in the backfield and tried to
change direction, but, when he planted his right foot and cut, his
knee buckled and Anderson fell to the ground. He was not hit on the
play.
</P>
<P>
   The injury figures to have a huge impact on Atlanta's season,
which has begun with two difficult losses. In the opener against
Minnesota, quarterback Chris Chandler went down with a strained
right hamstring. He missed Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's injury, though, is a potential season-ender, and it
could be as difficult for the Falcons to overcome as the ruptured
Achilles' tendon that ended New York Jets quarterback Vinny
Testaverde's season.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the Atlanta offense Monday night was obvious.
Without Anderson, the Falcons were held to 85 yards rushing _ 76 of
them by Anderson's replacement, former Texas Tech star Byron
Hanspard _ and 3.7 yards per carry. The Falcons never threatened
until the game's final four nminutes when they scored their only
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game, man,'' tight end O.J. Santiago said.
``Guys go down every week. Byron's a capable back. Losing two guys
is no excuse for the rest of us not to do our jobs.''

WITH DOOMSDAY ON HAND, DEFENSE RISES TO OCCASION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Forty years of Dallas Cowboys' football came
parading onto the field at Texas Stadium on Monday night _ a
biblical number if there ever was one _ and a watered-down version
of the defending NFC champions had no chance against this
silver-starred legacy.
</P>
<P>
   There were too many ghosts in the place, too many reminders of
the glory years, for the toothless Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed and maligned after surrendering 504 yards and 35
points to the Redskins last week, the Dallas defense hung a 24-7
shiner on the injury-depleted Falcons, sending the Cowboys into
their bye week with a pleasantly surprising 2-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   You beat the Redskins (who put up 50 on the Giants Sunday) in
Washington and last year's NFC Super Bowl finalist back-to-back,
you deserve a week off.
</P>
<P>
   Halftime ceremonies included a roll call of 108 former Cowboys'
players, including Bob Lilly, Jethro Pugh, Randy White and Harvey
Martin. No wonder the Cowboys played like the original Doomsday was
back in town.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was.
</P>
<P>
   The inspired current Cowboys treated their distinguished guests
to a highlight film of sterling defensive plays, including a
stunning 87-yard interception return for a touchdown by second-year
defensive end Greg Ellis with less than a minute to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week we were proud of our offense for coming back and
winning the game,'' Ellis said, ``but we knew we didn't play well
defensively, and we wanted to come out tonight and make a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven-yard interception returns make statements that earn
exclamation marks.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the Falcons started a lightweight named Tony Graziani at
quarterback. And yes, premier running back Jamal Anderson was
knocked out of the game in the first quarter with a sprained right
knee. Don't bore me with minutia.
</P>
<P>
   Only a face-saving 45-yard Danny Kanell-to-Tim Dwight touchdown
pass with four minutes left prevented the Cowboys from ringing up
their second Monday night shutout in two years. They buried the
Eagles, 34-0, on Monday night in Philadelphia last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones drooled happily in his luxury box
with Lilly sitting at his elbow like an oversized good-luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's better than watching Deion cavorting around on the
sideline in sweats. Prime Time, my foot.
</P>
<P>
   (And if there's anything that might get Deion back into uniform
quickly, it's watching his defensive mates get along just fine
without him.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week Washington's Brad Johnson riddled the Cowboys'
secondary for 369 yards. Dental records confirmed that it was
cornerbacks Kevin Mathis and Charlie Williams who were burned
beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   This week Mathis and Williams were part of a defensive effort
that held the Falcons to 14 total yards in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive pressure, you pleaded? Your prayers were answered. The
Cowboys chased, bedeviled, harassed and hounded Graziani, who
started for the injured Chris Chandler, and Kanell, his eventual
replacement, recording half a dozen sacks, including two by Chad
Hennings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense also had three interceptions and recovered
a Graziani fumble as he tried to scramble for a first down in the
third quarter, setting up Emmitt Smith's seven-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, a left-hander who can throw from all angles (are you
listening, Doug Melvin?), was game but overmatched against the
Cowboys, especially once Anderson's right knee crumpled under him
on only his third carry of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense made some big plays in the ball game,'' Cowboys
coach Chan Gailey said. ``We took advantage of the turnovers we
got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with (defensive coordinator Dave) Campo and
his staff's game plan,'' Gailey said. ``They did a real nice job of
preparing for this ball game and getting some pressure on the
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that came up the middle from Hennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into the game wanting to stop the run, wanting to stop
Jamal Anderson,'' Hennings said. ``We knew their main game plan was
to run the ball down our throats because Chris Chandler wasn't in
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come from different angles, pressure from inside,
pressure from the outside. Disregard last week because I think this
is what our defensive front is capable of. This will be a big
morale booster for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when it began to get a little dicey, with the Falcons
threatening to score for the second time in the final minutes,
Darren Woodson blitzed from the corner and was in Kanell's face
when his pass was picked off by Ellis, the 286-pound defensive end,
at the 13.
</P>
<P>
   When Kanell went over backward, there was nothing but empty real
estate and a convoy of blockers between Ellis and the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and said, `Oh man.' It was a long run,'' Ellis
said. ``I thought I was going to run out of gas at the 10.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Not with 108 glorious memories looking on and
providing an extra spiritual push. nn

 &HT;    MILITARY GETS BILL FOR PRESIDENTIAL TRAVEL
 &HT;    Eds: Repeating for all needing to restore name of Sen. Larry
Craig in graf 11.
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's tour of Africa last year
brought along more than 1,300 American military and civilian
officials, 13 helicopters and enough gear to require 98 air cargo
missions, all at a cost of more than $42.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Military cooks from the White House ``mess'' also went along to
prepare some meals for first family, says a study by the U.S.
General Accounting Office scheduled to be released later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The report, an advance copy of which was obtained by Cox
Newspapers, unlocks some of the long-held secrets surrounding the
costs of presidential travel. The GAO, the investigative arm of
Congress, examined Clinton's six-nation visit to Africa as well as
his trips last year to China and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Africa tour, billed largely as a goodwill mission,
required 10 separate advance delegations to arrange the itinerary.
More than 200 White House aides either accompanied Clinton or
traveled on an advance trip, and more than 900 military personnel
were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 10-day trip to China in the summer of 1998 cost at least
$18.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ A four-day trip to Chile to attend a regional summit in April
1998 was estimated at $10.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The expense totals do not include security costs, which are
classified. However, drawn from federal agencies and U.S.
embassies, the study is probably the most authoritative estimate of
how much it costs when a president goes abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The report is unusual because presidential travel budgets have
long been closely held by administrations of both parties. Expenses
are divided among perhaps a dozen federal agencies and often kept
secret.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the GAO did not compare the cost of Clinton's
trips to previous presidential travel.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Larry Craig of Idaho
and Craig Thomas of Wyoming asked the accounting office for the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have President Clinton asking the military to do more with
less and cutting the defense budget to the bone,'' said Jerry
Fritz, an aide to Craig. ``And we find that he's spending defense
money to travel the world with little or nothing to show for it.''
Of the $72.1 million total for the three trips, 84 percent was
charged to the Defense Department. Most of the expenses came in
airlifting people and gear.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman David Leavey said that the president takes
overseas trips ``that he deems to be in the national interest'' and
added, ``I reject any notion that somehow we're taking erroneous
trips.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For the Africa trip, the military flew 98 air cargo missions for
equipment such as the president's bulletproof limousine,
sophisticated communications gear and motorcade vehicles. The cost
was more than $29 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tanker aircraft flew 110 aerial refueling missions to transport
13 Army and Marine helicopters to sites in Africa, at a cost of $1
million. And flying passengers aboard Air Force One and other
military aircraft cost $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department assumed the second largest share of the
cost for all of the trips. It paid for lodging, car rentals and
phone services for its own personnel and White House staffers as
well as members of Congress. Sixteen lawmakers accompanied Clinton
to Africa, while six went to China and five to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Private citizens invited by Clinton as guests are required to
pay their own way and were not listed in the report. The traveling
press corps, which flies on a private charter, is also billed for
presidential trips.

 &HT;    I'm listening, honey, but i can't hear you
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Political candidates remind me of a song that
was popular in the early ?50s: ``First you say you do, and then you
don't. And then you say you will, and then you won?t. You're
undecided now, so what're you gonna do?''
</P>
<P>
   All politicians are guilty of an occasional flip-flop, but the
most recent (and glaring) example was New York Senate hopeful
Hillary Rodham Clinton's last minute roll over on the issue of
clemency for 16 Puerto Rican terrorists. One day she was for it,
and the next day she was against it. So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe politics happened. No big epiphany here. The lady might be
looking for votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, New York's get-tough mayor, Rudolph Giuliani,
swears he's bewildered by the first lady's positional agility. ``I
get confused,'' he says. ``Sometimes it's stand by him, sometimes
it's stand against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy _ I'm here to tell you _ it's just another name for
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Clintons moved into the White House, Americans
have been relentlessly bombarded with more information on this
first couple than any of us ever wanted to know _ about anyone _
including the kid down the block with fake fangs and his face
painted green. Daily, we were inundated with updates on our
president's affinity for McDonald's (BIG Macs) and bimbos (any size
will do).
</P>
<P>
   In the name of news, we have been treated to candid shots of
Bill's burgeoning waistline, and meticulously kept up to date on
his golfing mulligans. We know who his friends are, and who they
aren't. Maybe even better than he does.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hillary was occupied around the house with odd jobs
like culling chipped china, and drafting health care reforms. The
rest of the time she was busier than a finicky old cat in a sandbox
covering Bill's tracks, which didn't leave them much opportunity to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be they're just talked out. Haven't you ever sat in
a restaurant and picked out the married couples? It's easy. They're
the ones not talking to each other. Maybe that's what happened to
Hillary and Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: First couple sits down to dinner. Hillary speaks:
``Hi dear, how was your day?'' Bill answers without looking up from
his spy novel: ``Same old, same old. Janet Reno is investigating
herself, and I freed a bunch of terrorists.'' Hillary: ``That's
nice.'' Bill: ``Umm. What did you do today?''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary: ``Not much. Caught up on the ironing and came out
against clemency for the Puerto Rican prisoners.'' Bill (licking a
finger and turning the page): ``Good girl.''
</P>
<P>
   See, they're talking, but they're not hearing. That's exactly
what I think happened with the clemency thing. Bill probably forgot
to mention it, or if he did one morning over poached eggs on toast
points, Hillary was thinking about something else _ like curtains
for the new house or how to muzzle Giuliani, and just didn't hear
it.
</P>
<P>
   Face it folks, at its very best, marriage is a sanctified state
of ambivalence, the success of which is re-determined on a daily
basis by whether or not he washes his whiskers out of the sink
after shaving, and if she put the cap back on the toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Marital miscommunication is rampant. It even happened to my
parents who celebrated their golden anniversary _ and then some.
``Hold onto the trunk, Doris,'' my father instructed my mother as
he prepared to cut down a 10-foot, storm-damaged avocado tree in
the side yard. ``When I tell you, push against it.'' Daddy sawed
and the tree fell _ the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris!'' he hollered when he could no longer see my mother.
``Where are you?'' A small voice answered, ``Under the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the hell are you doing under there?'' he fretted as he
scrambled to uncover her. ``?I told you to PUSH.''

<P>
   ``Sorry,'' she said as she dusted herself off. ``Guess I wasn't
listening straight. I thought you said PULL.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. A breakdown in communication. If it could
happen to my folks, it could happen to anyone. I'm not too worried
about the whole thing anyway _ the Clintons will be moving soon.

 &HT;    To quell gun bloodshed, we need policy climate change
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ What it took one of history's largest hurricanes
to achieve in four states, one crazed man did with two guns in one
Fort Worth church: kill seven.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd savaged states up and down the east coast,
ultimately claiming 49 lives. But you had to combine the death
tolls of New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland to match
what Larry Ashbrook did with his guns.
</P>
<P>
   And someone is saying that this is simply the price of human
nature.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Gov. Bush was saying in a Day 2 sound bite, which
quickly seemed divorced from the reality of events. ``A wave of
evil,'' is how he reacted.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in the case of killer Larry Ashbrook, we are speaking
of mental illness _ delusional paranoia, most likely schizophrenia
_ which makes him maybe as evil as someone with tuberculosis or
polio: Someone ill. Someone with a chemical imbalance batting his
brain around. Someone ill and armed.
</P>
<P>
   One writes about guns in the wake of another such horror knowing
exactly what the response will be: ``More gun laws would not have
saved these lives.'' It will be pointed out that Ashbrook bought
his guns legally, that his mental illness was undiagnosed, and that
none of the minimalistic gun controls pending before House-Senate
conferees would have kept him from doing what he did.
</P>
<P>
   Though apparently correct, it's also a typical dodge. It's why
we continue in the clutches of the gun culture, even as most
Americans acknowledge a direct correlation between the
proliferation of guns, the ease of illegal purchase, and the
nation's staggering gun death toll.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation, the United States has done so little to put clamps
on the gun cult. Its leaders are so spooked by the gun cult that
what we have now is policy only scraping at a notion, rather than
scraping at solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The case of ``Crazy Larry'' is a tough one for gun cultists to
dismiss, for it has nothing to do with the Internet or video games
or Marilyn Manson. In all due respect, Mr. Governor, it doesn't
even have to do with evil. It has to do with mental illness and
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Lest it be said that the media only jump on these issues after
the fact to exploit a tragedy, direct your attention to the Sept.
20 Newsweek. It was headed for newsstands before Ashbrook's deeds.
</P>
<P>
   It refers to the fact that the federal system of background
checks is full of holes, inadequate to identify many people with
felony convictions, and, most pertinently this time, not linked to
state mental-health records, though that was the intent of the
instant-check system.
</P>
<P>
   The report underlines how little we've done in the 31 years
since Congress passed the Handgun Control Act, forbidding handgun
sales to juveniles, felons, illegal aliens and adjudicated mental
patients. We have done so little because forces of self-interest _
the gun lobby _ too often trump the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this history, National Rifle Association has taken a
peculiar tack recently. When horrific gun violence flares, as it
seems to every other week now, the NRA line is this: ``We need to
enforce the gun laws we have.'' This is interesting. Had the NRA
won every battle it waged, we wouldn't have the Handgun Control Act
of 1968 or the Brady Law, which is in place to enforce the 1968
act, to check the claims people make when they buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me the NRA is saying it was wrong in opposing those
laws. And on that count it is right.
</P>
<P>
   Some historian needs to explain to the country what
``well-regulated militia'' meant when the founders led off the
Second Amendment. Did it mean an atmosphere in which semi-automatic
pistols would be a juvenile staple? Did it mean guns would be sold
at flea markets without any controls?
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: more destruction and death from coast to coast until
we get a handle on what the founders meant by ``regulated.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Drug advertisers aim to do one thing: sell you
products
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who watches enough television commercials knows there is
no health decision so foolish, no disorder so debilitating, that it
can't be overridden by a product at the drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn keeps you up at night but you just can't stand the
boredom of a sensible diet? Have we got a pill for you! We're not
allowed to tell you to grind up an extra one and sprinkle it on top
of your chili dog with onions, but we sure can give you the
impression there is nothing our magic pill won't let you eat.
</P>
<P>
   Or do you sneeze just looking outside the window during allergy
season? No problem. The right pill will have you frolicking in the
meadow and rolling through the blossoms in no time. Live a little.
Stop and smell the ragweed.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising in general is pretty much the art of coaxing us to
spend money we don't have for products we don't need because they
can't really deliver on the promises the advertisements hint at. If
something is both new and improved, wouldn't that only make it
better than nothing?
</P>
<P>
   But advertising medical products requires a level of
responsibility that advertisers don't normally display. A person
who chooses a box of corn flakes or brand of jeans that isn't just
right probably isn't going to die from it. Most European countries
have banned direct-to-consumer drug ads in order to protect their
citizens from being under-informed and overmedicated.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, nearly all prescription drug ads were
directed at doctors. They wrote the prescriptions. But federal
restrictions on those ads loosened in 1997 and drug companies spent
$1.3 billion advertising to American consumers last year, more than
the beer companies spent. The ads targeted not only people who
wanted to lose weight or grow hair, but also those who were afraid
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. More than two-thirds of allergy sufferers say their
primary source of treatment information is advertisements. In a
national survey this year, 53 percent of doctors said a patient had
requested a prescription drug by name. Primary-care doctors report
closer to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The providers are just livid about that,'' says John Tonkin,
executive director of the self-insured employers' organization that
has renamed itself the Three Rivers Health Initiative. ``The
Internet is the same problem. There's plenty of information out
there, but it's not knowledge. It's just information.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies contend they are providing a useful service in
educating customers. That's true to a point. Drugs save money and
lives when they're used correctly, and ads certainly have prompted
many people to take valuable medications.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have supplemented ads with information on the Web
and in mailings to truly raise the level of knowledge about
particular disorders. Some have helped erode the stigmas against
mental illness and impotence. An allergy drug maker will mail you a
reminder just before your allergy season begins wherever you live.
But keep in mind that it provides that service so you won't forget
to buy its product.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements are a source of education in the same way the
Cartoon Channel is a source of art. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has reprimanded nearly 20 manufacturers in two
years, and Consumer Reports found half the drug ads it examined to
be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a comprehensive review for a patient to make an
educated decision on whether this drug should be taken or not,''
says primary care Dr. Gregory Wise.
</P>
<P>
   TV commercials have to name a drug's biggest risks, and you can
even hear them if your VCR plays back in slow motion. The ads are
less reliable about discussing precisely who should and should not
use the drug. Not every body needs extra calcium, for example, or
can even tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
   So while it's fine for patients to ask their doctors for a
particular drug, it's also essential to listen when the doctor
explains why that's not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   They all have side effects, even over-the-counter drugs. If
they're strong enough to help, they're strong enough to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not magic. A person with high cholesterol won't get
enough exercise wrestling with the childproof cap on his medicine.
He shouldn't wash it down with a milkshake, either.
</P>

 &HT;    Worry less about tax; focus on your net gain
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I get lots of mail from readers who want to know how to make
more money from their investments.
</P>
<P>
   I get even more mail from people who want to make more and avoid
paying taxes on their successes.
</P>
<P>
   People feel that they are the ones taking the risks, so they
shouldn't have to share the rewards with the Internal Revenue
Service. Many are agitated by the suspicion that somebody else is
getting better tax breaks than they are. Then there's just plain
greed.
</P>
<P>
   Those feelings are strong, and they are pervasive. Our elected
leaders are responding to them every time they noodle around with
the tax code and with tax-deferred savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   But too many people get carried away about tax avoidance.
``Minimizing taxes should not be the criterion,'' said Lori Heinel,
a strategist for SEI Investments in Oaks, Pa. ``What people should
work for is better after-tax return.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes that people who focus just on taxes are in danger
of investing too narrowly, passing up growth opportunities and
generally ending up with a risky, low-return portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   She has an interesting set of tips _ and warnings _ for
investors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spread out your investments. Sticking to narrow, tax-friendly
things like growth stocks or municipal bonds will increase the
risks you face. ``Diversifying your assets is still a good thing,''
Heinel said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of hotshot mutual funds. Spectacular returns are always
alluring. ``But you might be buying into a fund with a lot of
unrealized capital gains,'' Heinel said. ``You haven't gotten the
benefit of those gains, but when they distribute them, you're going
to pay the taxes. Look to Morningstar, the Chicago-based mutual
fund researcher, for estimates of that tax overhang.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't reject dividend-paying stocks. ``The argument a few
years ago was that if you buy stocks that don't pay dividends, you
won't have to pay taxes until you sell the stocks,'' Heinel said.
``Some people were just buying big technology companies or growth
stocks that didn't pay any dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that you end up with stocks only in certain
industries. You don't buy any utility stocks or any banks. You
don't buy oil companies. You have to recognize that there are
periods when those cyclical companies come into favor, and you
won't own them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't limit yourself to index funds. Because an index mutual
fund holds onto the same basket of stocks year after year, it
doesn't have a lot of sales that generate tax liabilities. On the
other hand, Heinel pointed out, index funds are all but guaranteed
to be average performers. ``Most investors don't want indexlike
returns,'' she observed. ``They want higher performance.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want a core investment in an index fund, Heinel wouldn't
criticize you. ``But don't do it just for tax reasons,'' she
warned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't buy and hold blindly. If you hold a stock forever, of
course, you won't incur taxes from selling your winners. But you
won't be able to move to new opportunities. ``If you bought the 20
largest stocks 10 years ago, you wouldn't have Microsoft, AOL,
Intel or Cisco,'' Heinel pointed out. ``You can buy and hold if you
like a stock, but you still need to re-evaluate on a regular basis
to see if you still like it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Think carefully about selling. It's a mistake to put off
selling an appreciated stock just because your tax bill will go up.
``Paying taxes because you have a gain is not a bad thing,'' she
observed. ``The extreme case would be if you had bought Yahoo last
year. You might have a 400 or 500 percent gain. If you have to pay
20 percent in taxes, you're still ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's a good idea to consider your next
investment as you prepare to sell. Heinel suggests comparing the
taxes you would owe with the returns you can reasonably expect from
the stock you want to buy next. The best new investment would be
one with a higher rate of return, which will eventually make up for
the taxes you owe.
</P>
<P>
   The big picture from Heinel: Don't get obsessed about taxes.
Concentrate on what you can keep after you pay Uncle Sam.

 &HT;    Family deals with juvenile diabetes one step at a time
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ben Newell was only 4 when he went on his first
Walk to Cure Diabetes two years ago. As he and his parents reached
their car afterward, Ben had a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is my diabetes cured now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The disease shared by 16 million Americans remains incurable,
but the prospects are looking more hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring saw a vaccine that prevented the development of Type
I, juvenile diabetes, in mice. Summer brought news of possible
genetic manipulation that would enable people to grow the
insulin-producing cells that are missing in juvenile diabetics.
Research continues on transplanting pancreatic islet cells for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Ben is racing the calendar. He was diagnosed with juvenile
diabetes at 10 months, and complications can surface as early as
five to six years later. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney
failure, adult blindness and amputations that don't result from
injuries. Diabetics are at least twice as likely as the rest of us
to have a heart attack or stroke, and their average lifespan is 15
years shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ben is a 6-year-old Kettering, Ohio boy who loves
playing football, soccer and golf and is excited by Pokemon and
dinosaurs. He's like other sixth-graders, aside from the insulin
shots and the finger prickings and the tightly regulated snack
regimen that sometimes requires eating when he's not hungry or
going without when he is.
</P>
<P>
   Most 6-year-olds' parents, for example, have never said, ``You
can't have any fruit now but you can have a pickle.'' Nor do they
have such a thorough knowledge of food labels. ``It sure changes
your view of a grocery store,'' Ben's mother says.
</P>
<P>
   Ben's day always begins with a blood test from a prick in his
finger. ``There's no sleeping in on the weekends,'' Newell says.
Then he gets an insulin shot as soon as the blood-sugar test
results show how much he needs. It's the shots that really hurt,
Ben says.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile diabetics produce no insulin, and Type II or
adult-onset diabetics either produce not enough or don't use it
efficiently. But diabetics lack the ability to regulate their blood
sugar in either direction, so the insulin shots for lowering sugar
levels in Type I are only part of the treatment. Frequent food is
also essential, to keep the sugar levels from going too low.
</P>
<P>
   So Ben always has breakfast, and he always has a snack at around
9:30. He needs to prick his finger again before lunch to see
whether he needs another insulin shot or a heavier meal. He's doing
that himself this year at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets frustrated now that he's older,'' Newell says. ``He
doesn't want to be the last one to eat at lunch.'' But the people
at his elementary school and day care are both accommodating and
interested in what they need to learn about diabetes, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ben eats another snack at 3 p.m. at day care, then has another
blood test and shot before dinner at 6. He needs another test and
snack later in the evening, and if his blood sugar is low then, his
mom or dad tests him again at 2 a.m. Either way, they check on him
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a seizure last April at night, and he was afraid to go
to bed unless we promised to do that,'' Newell says.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure, from very low blood sugar, illustrated how complex
the chemistry of diabetes can be. That was one of the first nice
spring days, and Ben had done a lot of running around. Exercise
brings down blood sugar. ``I guess we didn't give him a big enough
snack before bed,'' Newell says.
</P>
<P>
   But another time, when Ben played with a group of friends and
his parents figured he'd need extra food, it turned out he needed
insulin instead. The excitement and stimulation had driven his
sugar up more than the activity brought it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any stress. How active you are. All that influences his
blood-sugar levels,'' Newell says.
</P>
<P>
   He's old enough now to recognize when his blood sugar is
fluctuating. ``He's really picked up on the snack part,'' Newell
says, and knows to eat his cake without frosting, say, when his
school class is having a party. On days when a field trip changes
his routine, Ben brings up his schedule so his parents can adjust
his snacking and sticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll tell us, `I'm low. I need some food,' '' his mom says.
His 4-year-old sister, Danielle also has learned the words ``I'm
low'' mean ``snack time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So sometimes she'll tell us she's low,'' Newell says with a
laugh. ``That usually doesn't get her too far.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   These columns for release Wednesday, September 22, 1999 are
moving today to clients of the New York Times News Service.
</P>
<P>
   All columns have moved, in the commentary (k) category. If you
have questions or need a resend, please call CoxNet, the Cox News
Service, at 404-526-5456.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Will you and I be allowed to have our government
back or will the big-money political players continue to shop
retail for public policies to their liking? The recent House vote
for campaign-funding reform was encouraging _ but, then, so was
last year's and it came to naught. (Teepen, Cox Newspapers.) MOVED
MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ When it I got my atomic clock for Father's
Day last June, it was because I am a stickler for being on time,
even early _ and because my children had no other idea of what to
give me. But as I stare at its green LED signal over my office
desk, I realize that knowing precisely the right time can get you
in trouble. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Al Gore is not boring, I thought to my
surprise the other morning. Al Gore is sprightly, lively, a
life-of-the-party kind of guy. I nearly cut myself shaving.
(Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ At its very best, marriage
is a sanctified state of ambivalence, the success of which is
re-determined on a daily basis by whether or not he washes his
whiskers out of the sink after shaving, and if she put the cap back
on the toothpaste. Marital miscommunication is rampant. Just ask
Hillary and Bill. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ What it took one of history's
largest hurricanes to achieve in four states, one crazed man did
with two guns in one Fort Worth church: kill seven. Hurricane Floyd
savaged states up and down the east coast, ultimately claiming 49
lives. But you had to combine the death tolls of New York,
Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland to match what Larry Ashbrook
did with his guns.
</P>
<P>
   And someone is saying that this is simply the price of human
nature. That's what Gov. Bush was saying in a Day 2 sound bite,
which quickly seemed divorced from the reality of events. ``A wave
of evil,'' is how he reacted. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LAMB-COLUMN _ Anyone who watches enough television commercials
knows there is no health decision so foolish, no disorder so
debilitating, that it can't be overridden by a product at the
drugstore. Advertising in general is pretty much the art of coaxing
us to spend money we don't have for products we don't need because
they can't really deliver on the promises the advertisements hint
at. If something is both new and improved, wouldn't that only make
it better than nothing? But advertising medical products requires a
level of responsibility that advertisers don't normally display.

his parents reached their car afterward, Ben had a question. ``Is
my diabetes cured now?'' he said. The disease shared by 16 million
Americans remains incurable, but the prospects are looking more
hopeful. Last spring saw a vaccine that prevented the development
of Type I, juvenile diabetes, in mice. Summer brought news of
possible genetic manipulation that would enable people to grow the
insulin-producing cells that are missing in juvenile diabetics.

SEX SCANDAL HALTS DISNEY MEDIA TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A sex scandal involving one of the Walt Disney
Company's hottest young Internet executives is also causing a
time-out for Mickey Mouse's burgeoning online empire.
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives have pulled the plug on a cross-country media
tour that was to start this week promoting the company's
fast-growing Web presence, following the arrest of senior executive
Patrick Naughton on charges of soliciting a minor for sex on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just too much in the news right now,'' said Disney
spokeswoman Julie Mathis. ``We don't think it's possible right now
to move ahead on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Naughton, a 34-year-old computer whiz-kid and
executive vice president of the Infoseek Web portal site and
Disney's GO Network, was arrested at the Santa Monica (Calif.) Pier
on charges of attempting to solicit a minor for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege that Naughton arranged to meet what he
thought was a 13-year-old girl after seven months of sending her
lewd e-mail messages though an online chat room. The girl turned
out to be an undercover male FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton, a native of Rochester, N.Y., was reportedly released
Friday pending an Oct. 12 arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest came just as Disney was launching a nationwide press
tour this week, meeting with reporters to promote its growing GO
Network, a collection of popular Disney-owned Web sites, including
Family.com, ESPN.com, ABCnews.com, Infoseek and Disney Online.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Online was rated the most visited family-oriented Web
site this summer by the New York-based Internet market research
firm Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Disney currently owns 43 percent of Infoseek. In July the
company said it would buy the remainder of Infoseek in a deal that
was supposed to close by year's end. The company plans to combine
Infoseek with its own Internet assets and create a stock to track
the new company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek is a five-year-old, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based ``portal,''
which is a Web site that serves as jumping off point for users
entering the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides canceling the media tour, both Infoseek and Disney
scrambled to distance themselves from Naughton.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek released a statement pointing out that Naughton came to
the company through Disney's acquisition of another Web developing
company, Starwave, where Naughton originally worked.
</P>
<P>
   Starwave was later traded to Infoseek as part of Disney's
initial investment in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shocked and disturbed by the arrest of Patrick
Naughton,'' said Infoseek in an unsigned statement released Monday.
``Mr. Naughton is no longer an employee of Infoseek.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney spokesperson Rebecca Anderson said Naughton had ``no
oversight responsibility for Disney-branded content'' on the Go
Network sites, which are developed in partnership with Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   But before Thursday's arrest, Naughton was an Internet executive
that Disney bragged about, hailing him as the ``best developer of
information-rich Web sites in the industry'' in a press release at
the time of its acquisition of Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   As a 25-year-old programmer at Sun Microsystems, Naughton helped
create the concept that would later become the popular Java
programming language. He left the company for Starwave in 1995, fed
up with Sun's intent to use Java to attack rival Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton, who lives in Seattle, was charged with interstate
travel with the intention of having sex with a minor, according to
a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
He was released after agreeing to pay $100,000 if he fails to
appear in court for scheduled hearings.

   HOW TO GET THE LOWDOWN ON GOOD AND BAD (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the digital culture zaps its way into nearly
every facet of our lives, it's no secret that the Web has evolved
into an awesome weapon for millions of investors and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Financial information is power, and you can quickly nab those
factoids online for free or for a reasonable cost _ compared with
the millions of dollars that companies pay brokerages, investment
firms and research consultants for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the average investor can't tap into the same powerful
databases and pricy financial services as money managers and equity
analysts. But some sharp Main Street investors _ armed with
personal computers, tenacious brainpower and a wealth of online
resources _ know nearly as much about companies and stocks as the
Wall Street pros do.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an investment newbie or an online rookie, you may feel
bowled over by the thousands of financial resources on the Web.
Where do you begin? What are the best ways to get the lowdown on
good and bad corporations? What online tools are quick, handy and
helpful? Your first stop: the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the agency that enforces federal securities law, and
its Web site (www.sec.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Publicly traded corporations _ companies whose shares are bought
and sold on the stock exchanges _ must file financial statements
throughout the year with the SEC. If you can survive the numbing
legal and financial jargon, the reports often are gold mines of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Need a quick profile or snapshot of a company? Check out the
annual report given to shareholders or the 10-K report, an annual
report to the SEC, both of which give an overview of a company's
financial assets, market outlook, products and other big picture
topics.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know how much top executives are making? Look up the
company's proxy statement for salaries, stock option packages and
other compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Digging for dirt on a merger, bankruptcy or other big event that
will affect a company's stock or earnings performance by 5 percent
or more? Pore through the 8-K report, which companies must file
after a ``materially important'' event occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Want to invest in an IPO, a company's initial public offering _
its first sale of shares on the stock market? The prospectus will
give you a good overview of a private company about to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, researchers would have to dig laboriously
through reams of SEC documents in government or business libraries.
Or they'd call a company's investor relations office and have the
papers snail-mailed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you simply click to the SEC's Web site and find reports
rapid-fire on the EDGAR database. Ain't technology wonderful?
(EDGAR, by the way, stands for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis
and Retrieval.) You also can check with several private firms _
including edgar- online.com, freeedgar.com and others _ that sell
SEC electronic filings for a fee. A company's complete SEC filings
and supplemental documents may not be on EDGAR, but the private
services will hunt it down for you.
</P>
<P>
   Next, get turned on to the best financial Web sites. If you
aren't addicted yet, get your fix fast _ the Internet and the stock
market aren't going away.
</P>
<P>
   The sites will help you probe a company's stock and financial
performance, call up business news stories and SEC documents, study
market sectors and the economy, set up your investment portfolio
and chat with other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want the scoop on IPO investing. While investment firms
dominate the IPO market, a small but growing niche of individual
online investors are getting a piece of the IPO pie.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to do a story on the new trend. To get a quick read on
IPOs, I clicked into CBS MarketWatch's financial news Web site
(www.marketwatch.com) and CNET's technology news site
(www.news.com/investor) to skim dozens of archived articles and
breaking stories on new offerings and tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Then I did a broad Web search using various search engines,
punching in the key words ``IPOs,'' ``online'' and ``individuals.''
The search called up investment firms that specialize in IPOs for
online investors. I looked up their corporate profiles at
www.hoovers.com, the Web site of the venerable Hoover's corporate
directory, then zipped over to each firm's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A few keystrokes later, I clicked Raging Bull
(www.ragingbull.com), a popular high-tech investment site for day
traders, and posted a request on message boards to interview online
IPO investors. Within the hour, three investors had e-mailed or
called me.
</P>
<P>
   As I chatted with one investor on the phone, I used the SEC's
Web site and an investment research firm, www.ipomonitor.com, to
call up up summaries of IPOs he liked. I also searched several
other Web sites that follow the IPO market.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, all of that paper research would have taken
several days. With high-powered online resources, it took me only a
few hours. It's like leaping from a single-engine plane to a jet
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   So get started. Top financial portals include CyberInvest
(www.cyberinvest.com), ETrade Group (www.etrade.com), Excite
(www.excite.com), Go2Net's Silicon Valley Investor
(www.siliconinvestor.com), Investorama (www.investorama.com),
Microsoft's MoneyCentral Investor (investor.msn.com), Motley Fool
(www.fool.com), Yahoo! Finance (quote.yahoo.com) and others.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of superior news sites include ABCNews.com
(www.abcnews.go.com), Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com), CBS
MarketWatch.com (www.marketwatch.com), CNN's CNNfn (www.cnnfn.com),
Dow Jones Interactive (www.djinteractive.com) and TheStreet.com
(www.thestreet.com) and the Wall Street Journal's (www.wsj.com).
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, check out some excellent books on corporate and online
research. It may cost you a few bucks and give you paper cuts, but
the books carry thousands of hands-on research techniques.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet research tips, look into ``Competitive
Intelligence, Competitive Advantage'' (Abacus) by Michelle DeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're an online god, you're guaranteed to discover
dozens of new financial sites in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Another good study: ``The Irwin Guide to Using the Wall Street
Journal'' (McGraw-Hill) by Michael Lehmann, an economics professor
at the University of San Francisco. Not exactly light bedtime
reading but still a great guide to the Journal, the bible of
business journalism, whether the print or online edition.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also recommend ``The New Competitor Intelligence'' (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons) by Leonard Fuld, a business research consultant in
Cambridge, Mass., and ``Competitive Intelligence'' by Larry
Kahaner, a former BusinessWeek journalist.

PAPER MILLS ARE LEARNING TO FIND NICHE MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They handed out the U.S. Postal Service's new
33-cent pink coral rose stamp last month at International Paper
Co.'s annual Hudson River Mill family picnic.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp is more than just a way to mail a letter. It's a
harbinger of a new mindset for many troubled New York paper mills.
No more complacency, no more heedless overproduction, no more
expecting the parent company to subsidize money-losing mills year
after year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each business is going to have to be able to stand on its
own,'' said mill manager Dave Liebetreu.
</P>
<P>
   As he and other executives made clear, the marching orders are:
Find niche markets you can profitably service with your existing
labor force and equipment. Put money into research that might
upgrade existing equipment. Use the latest financial management
tools and computer software to monitor profitability. Communicate
all this to employees, and get them behind the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The word seemed well understood by everybody at the mill picnic
in Corinth, Saratoga County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're on the right road,'' said Angela Jenkins, who
has worked at the mill for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't compete against big producers, leading us into a
different direction,'' added her husband Jim, a mill employee for
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps, for instance, aren't part of a lucrative deal. But
they are considered a prestigious commitment from the U.S. Postal
Service that appears to have helped the mill win other, more
lucrative contracts in specialty markets. Hudson River Mill is now
getting orders to produce shopping bag paper for upscale retailers
and department stores, and wrapping paper for cigarette
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Such customers want to find paper mills that can produce short
runs of products with the correct textures, colors and durability.
For a mill, that means workers are going to have to switch the
product lines more often. But a mill handling such short runs
doesn't need the huge, high-speed paper machines now being
installed in places like Brazil and Indonesia for the
mass-manufacture of standard office and printing papers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's paper industry didn't exactly turn on a dime. For
years it resisted the niche markets and kept going for volume. Only
recently have managers begun looking for smaller markets. In fact,
the Corinth mill, then under different management, in past years
passed up the opportunity to pursue a stamp contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get out of our own way sometimes,'' said
Liebetreu, who came to the Corinth mill three years ago. The
results showed on the bottom line: The mill lost money through much
of the '90s, he said, adding that in 1998, the mill started turning
a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The mill may lose money again this year, a fact Liebetreu blames
on the Asian currency crisis. But the long-term looks good because
``we've finally gotten a competitive mindset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Liebetreu's counterpart at International Paper's mill in
Ticonderoga, Calvin Staudt Jr., is preaching a similar message to
his employees. ``You have to remember, this is a business. We're
doing this to make money,'' Staudt said.
</P>
<P>
   While the gospel of profit might be ingrained at places like
General Electric, the paper industry is a different beast. Staudt
said when he arrived from an International Paper mill in Arkansas a
couple of years ago, he found the Ticonderoga motivations to be:
``Make as many tons of paper as you can.'' But the Ticonderoga mill
had lost money in nine of the 10 previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``So making more is not necessarily more profitable,'' he
pointed out. Not enough attention was paid to costs. Sometimes new
investments had to be made, such as a better internal computer
network to speed along the flow of information critical to the
manufacturing process. Product adjustments can follow too, he said.
The mill is now stressing some opaque papers that are used for
products such as the brochures that might come in the mail with
consumers' credit card statements.
</P>
<P>
   That product line also makes sense because the hardwood trees in
the region produce fibers suitable for opaque printing papers, he
said. (Hardwood fibers in paper provide durability, and softwood
fibers deliver flexibility; papermakers blend the two in various
combinations to get the product they want.)
</P>
<P>
   Staudt said the mill has been profitable for the year to date.
He is practicing what International Paper internal consultant Brad
Johnson calls ``marginal economics,'' or using the most refined
business tools available to make sure each mill is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean cutting costs, switching products, or a
combination of both. The answers are likely to be individual to
each mill, he said. But the goal is the same. ``A facility these
days has to be profitable or have a plan that's going to bring them
to profitability soon,'' Johnson said. ``Otherwise, they're pulling
down the business.''

   WHY WEN HO LEE MATTERS. Wen Ho Lee, a physicist, was fired last
March from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico after
20 years on the job. Wen Ho Lee isn't a celebrity, writes columnist
Amy Wu. So why should we care? Why does Lee's saga dominate the
headlines of international newspapers? And why did his story play a
role in the cooling of Sino-U.S. relations in May? Because the
Chinese-American scientist was fired for possibly leaking
information to the Chinese government. At the heart of the
controversy is whether or not FBI agents focused on Lee because of
his ethnicity. Wu, a new contributor to New America News Service,
explains how the controversy has affected her personally, and how
it affects most Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LEVEL THE PAYING FIELD FOR ATHLETES. Columnist Bill Maxwell
believes that those who run big-time college football need to come
clean about the corruption in the institution and the abuse of
young men who play. ``Fine-tuned, chiseled, testosterone-soaked and
egocentric, these young men are not STUDENT-athletes,'' he writes.
``They are ATHLETE-students.'' The corruption in the game was
brought to the public's attention in July when it was reported that
William ``Tank'' Black, an NFL Players Association agent, had been
caught giving cash and cars to football standouts at various
universities _ a standard operating procedure among many agents.
Maxwell's solution: ``The National Collegiate Athletic Association
needs to establish a uniform system to pay ATHLETE-students what
they deserve. If nothing is done, the system will continue to
corrupt players and their universities.''

   MULTIMEDIA PROJECT SPOTLIGHTS U.S. LATINOS. The brainchild of
actor Edward James Olmos, ``Americanos: Latino Life in the United
States'' began as a book project and quickly expanded to include a
traveling photo exhibition, an HBO documentary and even a CD of
related music. Under the direction of Olmos and Lea Ybarra,
executive director of the Institute for Academic Advancement of
Youth at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University, 31 photographers _
mostly Latinos _ spread out across the country last year to capture
the essence of what it means to be Hispanic in this country. Writer
Ana Radelat reports on this historic project in this feature
article from Hispanic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   PUSHING AGAINST THE ODDS IN LOUISIANA. Rep. William Jefferson
(D-La.) hopes to become the first black governor in Louisiana's
history. He grew up in Louisiana's East Carroll Parish, one of the
poorest places in America. At age 7, he started picking cotton for
$3 a day. Despite his parents' humble earnings, all 10 Jefferson
children attended college. Bill Jefferson went to Southern
University and then Harvard Law School, and later established what
became the largest black law firm in the South. He was elected to
three terms in the Louisiana State Senate, and is now in his fifth
term as a congressman representing New Orleans. On Oct. 23, he will
be on the ballot as an underdog gubernatorial candidate, hoping to
unseat GOP incumbent Gov. Mike Foster. ``If I were to (become
governor), I think the message would be there's a chance for
opportunity everywhere,'' Jefferson says. A profile from Hispanic
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN LAWS AREN'T FAIR. This week, columnist Juan Gonzalez tells
the story of Jose Garcia, a 68-year-old Cuban immigrant who
succumbed to a heart attack on Aug. 22 in the state prison in Green
Haven, N.Y. Garcia had worked for most of his life as a waiter, was
married to the same woman for 41 years and put his son and daughter
through Catholic schools. But a decade ago, Jose Garcia made a
foolish mistake: He agreed to become a lookout for a drug gang on
his block _ a gang busted by the cops in 1989. Although already
very sick with a heart condition. Garcia refused to accept a plea
in exchange for a four-year sentence. Gang leaders had sent word
that if he sang they would go after his family. He received 15
years to life under the harsh mandatory-sentencing requirements of
the Rockefeller drug laws in New York State. Garcia's story, as
told by Gonzalez, leads readers to ponder the severity of such laws
_ and whether exceptions should sometimes be made.

   MULTIMEDIA PROJECT SPOTLIGHTS U.S. LATINOS. The brainchild of
actor Edward James Olmos, ``Americanos: Latino Life in the United
States'' began as a book project and quickly expanded to include a
traveling photo exhibition, an HBO documentary and even a CD of
related music. Under the direction of Olmos and Lea Ybarra,
executive director of the Institute for Academic Advancement of
Youth at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University, 31 photographers _
mostly Latinos _ spread out across the country last year to capture
the essence of what it means to be Hispanic in this country. Writer

   PUSHING AGAINST THE ODDS IN LOUISIANA. Rep. William Jefferson
(D-La.) hopes to become the first black governor in Louisiana's
history. He grew up in Louisiana's East Carroll Parish, one of the
poorest places in America. At age 7, he started picking cotton for
$3 a day. Despite his parents' humble earnings, all 10 Jefferson
children attended college. Bill Jefferson went to Southern
University and then Harvard Law School, and later established what
became the largest black law firm in the South. He was elected to
three terms in the Louisiana State Senate, and is now in his fifth
term as a congressman representing New Orleans. On Oct. 23, he will
be on the ballot as an underdog gubernatorial candidate, hoping to
unseat GOP incumbent Gov. Mike Foster. ``If I were to (become
governor), I think the message would be there's a chance for
opportunity everywhere,'' Jefferson says. A profile from Hispanic
magazine.

   WHEN LAWS AREN'T FAIR. This week, columnist Juan Gonzalez tells
the story of Jose Garcia, a 68-year-old Cuban immigrant who
succumbed to a heart attack on Aug. 22 in the state prison in Green
Haven, N.Y. Garcia had worked for most of his life as a waiter, was
married to the same woman for 41 years and put his son and daughter
through Catholic schools. But a decade ago, Jose Garcia made a
foolish mistake: He agreed to become a lookout for a drug gang on
his block _ a gang busted by the cops in 1989. Although already
very sick with a heart condition. Garcia refused to accept a plea
in exchange for a four-year sentence. Gang leaders had sent word
that if he sang they would go after his family. He received 15
years to life under the harsh mandatory-sentencing requirements of
the Rockefeller drug laws in New York State. Garcia's story, as
told by Gonzalez, leads readers to ponder the severity of such laws
_ and whether exceptions should sometimes be made.

   WHY WEN HO LEE MATTERS. Wen Ho Lee, a physicist, was fired last
March from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico after
20 years on the job. Wen Ho Lee isn't a celebrity, writes columnist
Amy Wu. So why should we care? Why does Lee's saga dominate the
headlines of international newspapers? And why did his story play a
role in the cooling of Sino-U.S. relations in May? Because the
Chinese-American scientist was fired for possibly leaking
information to the Chinese government. At the heart of the
controversy is whether or not FBI agents focused on Lee because of
his ethnicity. Wu, a new contributor to New America News Service,
explains how the controversy has affected her personally, and how
it affects most Asian-Americans.

   LEVEL THE PAYING FIELD FOR ATHLETES. Columnist Bill Maxwell
believes that those who run big-time college football need to come
clean about the corruption in the institution and the abuse of
young men who play. ``Fine-tuned, chiseled, testosterone-soaked and
egocentric, these young men are not STUDENT-athletes,'' he writes.
``They are ATHLETE-students.'' The corruption in the game was
brought to the public's attention in July when it was reported that
William ``Tank'' Black, an NFL Players Association agent, had been
caught giving cash and cars to football standouts at various
universities _ a standard operating procedure among many agents.

   MOSCOW _ Beware of the watermelons. Keep your eyes on those
stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is above suspicion in Moscow these days. Rattled by a
string of devastating bombings this month that has left nearly 300
dead, Russians are on edge. They are wary of their own neighbors
and fearful that their apartment building could be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not since the dismantling of the Soviet Union in 1991
have Russians felt so strongly, and vocally, about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of rampant corruption bring a shrug and a yawn. Russians
have become all too accustomed to expect the worst of their
officials, from the ubiquitous streetcorner cop who demands bribes
from passing motorists to the bandit capitalists who have pumped
billions of dollars out of Russia and into Western banks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's economic crisis wiped out personal savings and jobs,
but elicited surprisingly little in the way of public outrage. Been
there, done that _ Russia and its struggling post-Soviet economy
have teetered on the brink of disaster several times in this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism striking home is something new and ominous. Two
apartment-block blasts in Moscow, and two in southern Russia _ all
of which followed an Aug. 31 bombing in a shopping mall near the
Kremlin _ have given the entire nation nights of fitful sleep.
Russians share the same unanswered questions: Who is responsible
for the bombings, and who is to blame for not preventing them?
</P>
<P>
   The public dismay comes as Russia prepares for important
parliamentary elections in December and next summer's vote to
choose a new president.
</P>
<P>
   The men who want to replace President Boris Tylosin _
particularly his handpicked Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his
chief rival Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov _ are scrambling to look
tough and blame the other for failing to protect Russians.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a losing game for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they have no influence over what goes on in the
country,'' and they do not trust their leaders, said pollster Yuri
Levada. The result is cynicism and conspiracy theories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful Muscovites are seeing the bogeyman everywhere. One rumor
swept the city that people should be on the lookout for
watermelons, allegedly used as a means of concealing and
transporting explosives. (Not true, said a police spokesman).
Another rumor reported in a local newspaper suggested that
stray-looking dogs could instead be highly trained canine couriers
used to carry bombs into buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that goes bump in the night is suspect, as is anyone
with a dark complexion who may come from the mountainous Caucasus
region on Russia's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities widely blame Islamic guerrillas from the
breakaway republic of Chechnya for supporting the bombing campaign
in Russia. Chechen rebel leaders named by Moscow deny complicity in
the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow police and special Interior Ministry troops have swept
the streets looking for suspects, a mobilization of force dubbed
``Operation Whirlwind,'' in which dark-skinned people from Chechnya
and other states in the Caucasus region have been targeted. More
than 11,000 ``suspects'' were taken into custody last week(CQ),
though police conceded that only about 30 were under serious
questioning as possible terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little public debate about human rights and the
rule of law. Terrorism now tops the agenda and the public apathy
about affairs of state has ended. People are scared and they want
something done about the bombs _ now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are there no resignations of people responsible for our
security? They should be ashamed to look into the eyes of the
people,'' said Slava, a shopkeeper in my neighborhood in southern
Moscow, just a short drive from the apartment buildings destroyed
by bombs on Sept. 9 and Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Many others do not trust their government and believe the
Kremlin itself, or forces aligned with it, could be responsible for
the terror. For months Yeltsin's political rivals have warned that
the Kremlin is planning to declare a state of emergency as a way to
cancel the elections and extend Yeltsin's term in office.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lack of hard evidence of Chechen involvement _ or, at
least, evidence that has been made public _ and no plausible claims
of responsibility have been made for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a proliferation of conspiracy theories and
supposed motives, often contradictory _ the Kremlin may have
ordered it, maybe the mob, maybe the state security services acting
on their own, Yeltsin wants to stay in power or Yeltsin will resign
early.
</P>
<P>
   Even the respected English-language daily, the Moscow Times, got
in on the act. In an editorial last week(CQ), it questioned why the
rubble from the two buildings destroyed in Moscow had been carted
away so soon. Why hadn't investigators taken their time sifting for
forensic evidence, the paper asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chechen theory has proved both viable and convenient for
federal authorities; investigators clearly think they've got a lock
on their suspects. Are they playing it safe (by trucking away the
ruins) and making sure no other options turn up?''
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia and politics reign in Moscow today in the fallout of
the bombs. It is not a healthy combination in a country that has
struggled toward democracy and is better known for is disreputable
government and corrupt system.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one hopeful sign, it is that Russians, at last, are
mad as hell. But will they do anything about it in the upcoming
elections?
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, the regime directed the terror campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this highly charged political current has been reversed.
Terrorism, and the fear it has wrought in Moscow and across Russia,
could be the undoing of the powerful in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rare moments in life when millions of people think
in the same way,'' said an editorial last week(CQ) in the daily
Nezavisimaya Gazeta. ``There is such a moment now when millions of
people who live in apartment blocks think the same thing when they
go to bed: whether they will be alive in the morning or not.''

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Soaring unemployment, political unrest,
restive labor unions, stifled consumer spending: the portrait of
Venezuela's economy isn't one to invite a stampede of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American companies are already here in a big way, their
names gracing Caracas' soaring skyscrapers or plastered over
billboards lining the country's modern interstate-like highway
system: Ford, IBM, Coca-Cola and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn here by the oil boom of the 1970s that vaulted Venezuela
to a broad-based prosperity that became the envy of Latin America,
the companies have weathered previous downturns, although none
perhaps as serious as the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is hurting,'' said Jorge Redmond, owner of a
chocolate-making firm and president of the Venezuelan-American
Chamber of Commerce. ``Our sales are down 15 percent, and that
applies to most consumer items. Even beer sales are down, and
that's unheard of. Unemployment is rising and people don't have
money, so they aren't spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over the nation's political turmoil has sparked a
reported 40 percent drop in foreign investment this year, so far.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that uncertainty is Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, an outspoken populist who swept to power in a campaign last
fall based on a promise to toss out the country's corrupt political
system, rewrite the constitution and redistribute the nation's oil
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has worried business leaders by lashing out at the
``savage'' impact of market reforms in which state-run companies
have been turned over to the private sector. When the president of
Venezuela's state-owned oil company resigned, he quickly appointed
a close ally and vowed to wipe out the company's lavish habits of
paying executives huge salaries and squiring them around the world
in private jets.
</P>
<P>
   His actions have sent a wave of concern through financial
markets. Earlier this month, Moody's Investor Service placed
several affiliates of the Venezuelan oil company under review for a
possible downgrade, citing concerns that the Chavez administration
might try to exert undue control over the company.
</P>
<P>
   Most business leaders here are reluctant to comment publicly on
the situation. Those who will speak choose their words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say most of the business community did
not accompany Mr. Chavez to the ballot box,'' Redmond said. ``But
far from being belligerent, we're in the mode of being helpful
where we can. We're trying very hard to get our ideas into the new
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Atlanta-base Coca-Cola Co., which became
Venezuela's dominant soft drink three years ago after luring away
rival PepsiCo Inc.'s longtime bottling partner, said they never
comment on politics in any of the countries where they do business.
They acknowledged, however, that the severe economic downturn and a
renewed effort by Pepsi have made for a challenging situation in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   One American company that has managed to skate above the turmoil
is BellSouth Corp., which moved into Venezuela's fledgling cellular
telephone market in the early 1990s. The Atlanta-based
telecommunications giant now owns 78 percent of TelCel, which
controls nearly two-thirds of the Venezuelan cellular market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been growing by 50 to 60 percent a year from the day we
started,'' said Mario Lizaso, BellSouth's point man at TelCel.
``Many industries here are hurting, but people are making a choice
about what they want to spend their money on, and fortunately for
us, they feel a hunger for telecommunications . . . we offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan companies, meanwhile, appear to be lobbying hard to
get Chavez to address the economic situation. They realize the
nation has taken something of a public-relations beating, with news
reports raising the specter of a dictatorship and a possible round
of nationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community around the world has gotten the view
that it is a very difficult situation here,'' said Vicente Britos,
president of Fedecamaras, the national association of Venezuelan
Chambers of Commerce. ``But they should realize that our political
confrontation and change have come about as a public debate. There
have been no actions or decisions taken against the business
community.''

``On the other hand, he clearly has a huge mandate from the people,

<P>
   Redmond and other business leaders were expected to accompany
Chavez on a trip to New York and Washington last week(CQ),
hopefully using the visit to reassure financial markets.

   ``We all want this president to be a success,'' he said.
``People are giving him the benefit of the doubt. But as with
everything else, he is going to have to be the one giving the
message. We're still anxiously awaiting that message.''

   MOSCOW _ Beware of the watermelons. Keep your eyes on those
stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is above suspicion in Moscow these days. Rattled by a
string of devastating bombings this month that has left nearly 300
dead, Russians are on edge. They are wary of their own neighbors
and fearful that their apartment building could be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not since the dismantling of the Soviet Union in 1991
have Russians felt so strongly, and vocally, about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of rampant corruption bring a shrug and a yawn. Russians
have become all too accustomed to expect the worst of their
officials, from the ubiquitous streetcorner cop who demands bribes
from passing motorists to the bandit capitalists who have pumped
billions of dollars out of Russia and into Western banks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's economic crisis wiped out personal savings and jobs,
but elicited surprisingly little in the way of public outrage. Been
there, done that _ Russia and its struggling post-Soviet economy
have teetered on the brink of disaster several times in this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism striking home is something new and ominous. Two
apartment-block blasts in Moscow, and two in southern Russia _ all
of which followed an Aug. 31 bombing in a shopping mall near the
Kremlin _ have given the entire nation nights of fitful sleep.
Russians share the same unanswered questions: Who is responsible
for the bombings, and who is to blame for not preventing them?
</P>
<P>
   The public dismay comes as Russia prepares for important
parliamentary elections in December and next summer's vote to
choose a new president.
</P>
<P>
   The men who want to replace President Boris Tylosin _
particularly his handpicked Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his
chief rival Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov _ are scrambling to look
tough and blame the other for failing to protect Russians.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a losing game for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they have no influence over what goes on in the
country,'' and they do not trust their leaders, said pollster Yuri
Levada. The result is cynicism and conspiracy theories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful Muscovites are seeing the bogeyman everywhere. One rumor
swept the city that people should be on the lookout for
watermelons, allegedly used as a means of concealing and
transporting explosives. (Not true, said a police spokesman).
Another rumor reported in a local newspaper suggested that
stray-looking dogs could instead be highly trained canine couriers
used to carry bombs into buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that goes bump in the night is suspect, as is anyone
with a dark complexion who may come from the mountainous Caucasus
region on Russia's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities widely blame Islamic guerrillas from the
breakaway republic of Chechnya for supporting the bombing campaign
in Russia. Chechen rebel leaders named by Moscow deny complicity in
the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow police and special Interior Ministry troops have swept
the streets looking for suspects, a mobilization of force dubbed
``Operation Whirlwind,'' in which dark-skinned people from Chechnya
and other states in the Caucasus region have been targeted. More
than 11,000 ``suspects'' were taken into custody last week(CQ),
though police conceded that only about 30 were under serious
questioning as possible terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little public debate about human rights and the
rule of law. Terrorism now tops the agenda and the public apathy
about affairs of state has ended. People are scared and they want
something done about the bombs _ now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are there no resignations of people responsible for our
security? They should be ashamed to look into the eyes of the
people,'' said Slava, a shopkeeper in my neighborhood in southern
Moscow, just a short drive from the apartment buildings destroyed
by bombs on Sept. 9 and Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Many others do not trust their government and believe the
Kremlin itself, or forces aligned with it, could be responsible for
the terror. For months Yeltsin's political rivals have warned that
the Kremlin is planning to declare a state of emergency as a way to
cancel the elections and extend Yeltsin's term in office.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lack of hard evidence of Chechen involvement _ or, at
least, evidence that has been made public _ and no plausible claims
of responsibility have been made for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a proliferation of conspiracy theories and
supposed motives, often contradictory _ the Kremlin may have
ordered it, maybe the mob, maybe the state security services acting
on their own, Yeltsin wants to stay in power or Yeltsin will resign
early.
</P>
<P>
   Even the respected English-language daily, the Moscow Times, got
in on the act. In an editorial last week(CQ), it questioned why the
rubble from the two buildings destroyed in Moscow had been carted
away so soon. Why hadn't investigators taken their time sifting for
forensic evidence, the paper asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chechen theory has proved both viable and convenient for
federal authorities; investigators clearly think they've got a lock
on their suspects. Are they playing it safe (by trucking away the
ruins) and making sure no other options turn up?''
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia and politics reign in Moscow today in the fallout of
the bombs. It is not a healthy combination in a country that has
struggled toward democracy and is better known for is disreputable
government and corrupt system.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one hopeful sign, it is that Russians, at last, are
mad as hell. But will they do anything about it in the upcoming
elections?
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, the regime directed the terror campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this highly charged political current has been reversed.
Terrorism, and the fear it has wrought in Moscow and across Russia,
could be the undoing of the powerful in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rare moments in life when millions of people think
in the same way,'' said an editorial last week(CQ) in the daily
Nezavisimaya Gazeta. ``There is such a moment now when millions of
people who live in apartment blocks think the same thing when they
go to bed: whether they will be alive in the morning or not.''

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Soaring unemployment, political unrest,
restive labor unions, stifled consumer spending: the portrait of
Venezuela's economy isn't one to invite a stampede of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American companies are already here in a big way, their
names gracing Caracas' soaring skyscrapers or plastered over
billboards lining the country's modern interstate-like highway
system: Ford, IBM, Coca-Cola and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn here by the oil boom of the 1970s that vaulted Venezuela
to a broad-based prosperity that became the envy of Latin America,
the companies have weathered previous downturns, although none
perhaps as serious as the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is hurting,'' said Jorge Redmond, owner of a
chocolate-making firm and president of the Venezuelan-American
Chamber of Commerce. ``Our sales are down 15 percent, and that
applies to most consumer items. Even beer sales are down, and
that's unheard of. Unemployment is rising and people don't have
money, so they aren't spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over the nation's political turmoil has sparked a
reported 40 percent drop in foreign investment this year, so far.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that uncertainty is Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, an outspoken populist who swept to power in a campaign last
fall based on a promise to toss out the country's corrupt political
system, rewrite the constitution and redistribute the nation's oil
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has worried business leaders by lashing out at the
``savage'' impact of market reforms in which state-run companies
have been turned over to the private sector. When the president of
Venezuela's state-owned oil company resigned, he quickly appointed
a close ally and vowed to wipe out the company's lavish habits of
paying executives huge salaries and squiring them around the world
in private jets.
</P>
<P>
   His actions have sent a wave of concern through financial
markets. Earlier this month, Moody's Investor Service placed
several affiliates of the Venezuelan oil company under review for a
possible downgrade, citing concerns that the Chavez administration
might try to exert undue control over the company.
</P>
<P>
   Most business leaders here are reluctant to comment publicly on
the situation. Those who will speak choose their words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say most of the business community did
not accompany Mr. Chavez to the ballot box,'' Redmond said. ``But
far from being belligerent, we're in the mode of being helpful
where we can. We're trying very hard to get our ideas into the new
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Atlanta-base Coca-Cola Co., which became
Venezuela's dominant soft drink three years ago after luring away
rival PepsiCo Inc.'s longtime bottling partner, said they never
comment on politics in any of the countries where they do business.
They acknowledged, however, that the severe economic downturn and a
renewed effort by Pepsi have made for a challenging situation in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   One American company that has managed to skate above the turmoil
is BellSouth Corp., which moved into Venezuela's fledgling cellular
telephone market in the early 1990s. The Atlanta-based
telecommunications giant now owns 78 percent of TelCel, which
controls nearly two-thirds of the Venezuelan cellular market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been growing by 50 to 60 percent a year from the day we
started,'' said Mario Lizaso, BellSouth's point man at TelCel.
``Many industries here are hurting, but people are making a choice
about what they want to spend their money on, and fortunately for
us, they feel a hunger for telecommunications . . . we offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan companies, meanwhile, appear to be lobbying hard to
get Chavez to address the economic situation. They realize the
nation has taken something of a public-relations beating, with news
reports raising the specter of a dictatorship and a possible round
of nationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community around the world has gotten the view
that it is a very difficult situation here,'' said Vicente Britos,
president of Fedecamaras, the national association of Venezuelan
Chambers of Commerce. ``But they should realize that our political
confrontation and change have come about as a public debate. There
have been no actions or decisions taken against the business
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who has met with Chavez personally and finds him
cordial and attentive, agrees. But he worries that Chavez has spent
his first months in office focusing on politics and rewriting the
constitution, allowing the stumbling economy to worsen
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't stuck a finger in business's eye, but we're also
very much waiting for a signal that the economy will be what he
will attend to next,'' he said. ``It's very difficult to say where
he's going next.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond says the biggest worry of most business leaders is the
caliber of Chavez's economic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly doesn't have any economic training, and he's
surrounded with people who are from the leftist parties,'' he said.
``On the other hand, he clearly has a huge mandate from the people,
and we all agree there is a real need for change.''
</P>
<P>

Chavez on a trip to New York and Washington last week(CQ),
hopefully using the visit to reassure financial markets.

MEANINGFUL MOMENTS ADD UP IN `ONCE AND AGAIN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Showtimes are West Coast time)  
By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``Once and Again'' is a pretty banal title for a
show that is anything but. Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the
guys who gave us ``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called Life,''
again have created a show that's about nothing but the sheer
accumulation of little moments that add up to a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward and Billy Campbell star as Lily and Rick, two single
parents with their own families to run and problems to weather.
Lily's recently separated from her husband and has a 14-year-old
daughter (Julia Wheelan) who's a minefield of insecurities, so Lily
herself can be something of a raw nerve. Rick, divorced three
years, has become so accustomed to his state of anomie that he's
coasting way before his time. They meet, and everything changes.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this show instantly likable is the terrific chemistry
between Ward and Campbell, evident from the outset before they even
meet, when they merely exchange glances at one another while
dropping their kids off at school. The romantic tension escalates
quickly even while Rick and Lily try to take things slowly. Even
when their connection is halting at best, and they're dancing
awkwardly around each other, one can feel their heat. In a TV
season overwhelmingly overrun by teen hormones, leave it to a
couple of adults to show the kids how it's done right.
</P>
<P>
   There's one unfortunate gambit that Zwick and Herskovitz have
opted for, one that makes the show even more touchy-feely than it
already is. In black-and-white footage, Ward and Campbell address
an off-screen interviewer, sharing ostensibly private thoughts as
if for a documentary (it's like the show's own built-in electronic
press kit). They spout such New Agey nonsense as ``So here I am,
except I don't know where `here' is'' and ``I don't know where I
fit in in my own life anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Such segments are annoying because Zwick and Herskovitz are good
enough writers and Ward and Campbell good enough actors that much
of it doesn't even need to be said _ we have the show right in
front of us; we don't need the Cliffs Notes, too. Background
material could simply be incorporated into other scenes. More
irksome, however, is the unspoken Hollywood-centric subtext that
unless one's life plays out before the glare of the media, it's
somehow diminished in importance. The rest of us get by just fine
without all the attention, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   But Ward and Campbell are so wildly appealing as a couple that
one willingly sits through the show's more treacly impulses. The
rest of the cast is excellent, too; the kids are more authentic
than on most of TV's glut of teen shows.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry about having to sit through seasons of flirting
before Lily and Rick consummate their relation. Try episode two,
which is every bit as strong _ if not better _ than tonight's
premiere. The only question is, with a couple so obviously perfect
for each other, how will the writers be able to concoct obstacles
for these two for the duration of the series?
</P>
<P>
   `MISSION HILL'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Hill,'' a new animated series on the WB, feels about
right, which isn't exactly a good thing. It's about underachievers
and, given the talent involved, it underachieves its own self.
</P>
<P>
   The series comes with a pronounced pedigree _ its creators are
veteran ``Simpsons'' executive producers Bill Oakley and Josh
Weinstein. It follows the travails of a waterbed salesman-aspiring
cartoonist (voiced by Wallace Langham of ``The Larry Sanders Show''
and ``Veronica's Closet'') hanging in a Greenwich Village-type
neighborhood. He rooms with nutty buddies (Brian Posehn of ``Mr.
Show with Bob and David'' and Vicki Lewis of ``NewsRadio,'' as well
as his fast-track, high-school-aged brother Scott Menville) in an
apartment building filled with eccentric characters.
</P>
<P>
   The slice-of-life particulars often feel genuine, and future
scripts provided by the network show promise, but the first episode
doesn't offer much in the way of real laughs. Both the animation
and the vocal performances are unmemorable, too _ ``Mission'' has a
hill of shortcomings to surmount before it'll win over audiences.
It's probably not the wisest gambit to include a joke about how
there are too many animated shows on TV when yours seems eminently
expendable. Its regular Friday timeslot practically ensures that
its target audience won't ever find it.
</P>
<P>
   `THE MIKE O'MALLEY SHOW'
</P>
<P>
   If anything, ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' gives credence to the
theory that these days, just about anyone can score a network
sitcom. O'Malley, a playwright, stars as a 30-something slacker
coasting through life until he's forced to major reappraisal by a
buddy's wedding _ even his estranged girlfriend shows up for an
uninspired round of flirting. O'Malley rooms with a dopey
ne'er-do-well who goes by the name of Weasel. Their proud adherence
to lumpen guy-ness is similar to the growth-arrested dopes of an
ABC sitcom debuting on Wednesday, ``Oh, Grow Up.'' Neither show is
particularly funny; O'Malley's is better, but scarcely offers any
reason to return to it after an initial sampling.
</P>
<P>
   `WILL AND GRACE'
</P>
<P>
   After but one year on the air, ``Will and Grace'' has become a
victim of its own success, if its season premiere is any
indication. It features an average compendium of gags and silly
situations, but all of it is underscored by a live studio audience
that wildly, deliriously overreacts to every gag, every entrance,
every lame utterance by last season's breakout performers, Sean
Hayes and Megan Mullally.
</P>
<P>
   As the show opens, Will is helping Grace move into a place of
her own after spending a season under his protective wing. But
Grace has scarcely taken flight _ her new digs, aromatically
resplendent with cat urine, turn out to be just across the hall
from Will's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the developments in the season premiere: Grace tries to
wean herself off Will's protective influence by throwing a (mostly
disastrous) party without his presence, and Will _ who made news
last year by really not making news for being the first gay male
character to grace a sitcom's title _ actually arranges for a date.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it's all perfunctory stuff. Eric McCormack as Will,
thankfully, carries the show with a smart, understated wit, and
Debra Messing remains disarmingly engaging as Grace - she's a
wonderful straight-woman (literally) who can manage an unexpected
burst of physical humor. But Hayes and Mullally, who as Jack and
Karen became universal crowd-pleasers in the show's maiden season,
have transformed their wacky shtick _ in a way, they're really the
same character _ into broad overplaying. The studio audience plays
along by madly cheering their every punchline. They've become the
new Fonzie or J.J. Such enthusiasm may be great for a show in the
short term, but is potentially disastrous for its long run. It's
far too early for ``Will and Grace,'' and particularly Sean and
Megan, to coast on their early success.
</P>
<P>
   `IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW'
</P>
<P>
   Former ``Seinfeld'' writer Peter Mehlman continues his
Seinfeldian deconstruction of Los Angeles in ``It's Like, You
Know.'' The rest of the country may not be able to appreciate some
of the series' more arcan-_m%''

arrest-and-prosecution formula for Dick Wolf's evergreen
crime-drama procedural, ``Law &AMP; Order,'' marks its 10th season with
the birth of a sibling: ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.''
``SVU'' basically offers more of the same, but if it can maintain
the quality of its predecessor, then it's certainly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special Victims Unit'' is a euphemism for the new show's
original subtitle, ``Sex Crimes.'' The portentous narrator who
opens ``Law &AMP; Order'' reappears here, explaining, ``sexually based
offenses are considered especially heinous.'' This first episode is
a particularly grim and grisly affair, concerning the murder and

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When the Ryder Cup was last played in the
United States in 1995, the golf world hailed the ascendancy of a
tournament that had once been considered something of a sleepy
contest between American and British golfers.
</P>
<P>
   The matches earned about $28 million for the PGA of America and
the Oak Hill Country Club in upstate New York, where it was played.
It was a commanding success for a tournament that in 1991 was
searching desperately for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the turnaround was the golf: The British team had
expanded into a European team that had finally begun to beat the
Americans with some regularity. But another major reason was the
long and successful marriage between the sport and American
business. Already in professional golf's thrall, corporations saw
the international event as perfect way to entertain current and
prospective clients from around the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the partnership between golf and corporate America has
evolved to the point where this Ryder Cup, which begins Tuesday
with practice rounds at The Country Club in, will be among the most
lucrative sports events ever staged.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the considerable growth in corporate spending on
luxury boxes in many new stadiums across the country, the Ryder Cup
is likely to draw a higher concentration of business executives
than other sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and college
basketball's Final Four. It has become the ultimate event for
business in the ultimate sport for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a corporation, you can be conspicuous by your absence,''
said David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co., who has cultivated a sports marketing strategy that
includes sponsoring the Olympics and the Boston Marathon. ``You
don't necessarily have to be at the Super Bowl or the World Series.
You don't have to be an Olympic sponsor. But you cannot afford to
have your competitors entertaining clients at the Ryder Cup, if
you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the event is in your hometown. ``Can you imagine
if someone like Prudential came in and brought in all of their
corporate clients, and Hancock wasn't there?'' D'Alessandro asked.
``It would reach beyond a breach of etiquette and run into the
category of business stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   The boom has happened for several reasons. The tournament
features head-to-head matches, pitched international rivalry, and
the best players in the world in a sport that business underwrites
at increasingly higher levels, and which many executives play with
nearly religious fervor. And it is all driven by the PGA of America
and the PGA Tour, which have done a remarkable job of marketing and
catering to major companies. (The PGA of America represents club
professionals and runs the Ryder Cup and the PGA Championship, one
of golf's four major tournaments. The PGA Tour operates the weekly
tournament schedule for professional golf.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look at the list of corporations that have
purchased tents at The Country Club to entertain their customers,
you are going to find them in a lot of other sports too,'' said
Larry Moulter, president of Woolf Associates. ``But golf offers
about the most premium approach to your dollar for the businesses
that get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of its former commissioner, Deane Beman,
the PGA Tour set out 25 years ago on campaign to secure more
corporate dollars. Beman said that as a player on the tour in the
1960s, he grew tired of seeing businesses giving more and more
money to the National Football League and other professional sports
while the purses for golfers languished.
</P>
<P>
   He made golf more attractive to companies by selling title
sponsorships to major tournaments that offered sponsors
considerable freedom to market the events as they wished. He also
sweetened the deal by making many of the major names on the tour
available for ``pro-am'' tournaments with employees from the
companies during the week of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Total purses increased from about $8.4 million in 1973 to nearly
$100 million in 1994, when Beman stepped down. At the same time,
the PGA Tour's assets increased from $730,000 to $200 million. And
the organization started both the Senior PGA Tour, lengthening the
careers of some of the great names in the game, and the Nike Tour,
sort of a farm team for the big circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour's marketing partners, which serve as general
sponsors, read like a Who's Who of corporate America, including
Anheuser-Busch, Bank of America, John Deere, Delta Airlines,
Gillette, MasterCard, and Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Both the PGA Tour and PGA of America have become expert at
providing businesses with opportunities to extend hospitality to
their customers by offering tickets for tournaments as part of
entertainment packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the PGA has been able to do a better job of appealing
to top-level executives,'' D'Alessandro said. ``And a lot of
tournaments are sponsored by top executives, whether or not they
have any return, because the PGA has done such a great job of
cultivating the top of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Business people are hardly a difficult group for golf to woo.
Golf courses have long been extensions of the office. By various
estimates, about one-fourth of the 25 million to 30 million golfers
in the United States are top management executives.
</P>
<P>
   When Hyatt Hotels Corp. recently surveyed 400 executives who
play golf, 80 percent agreed it is a great way to make business
contacts, and one third said some of their biggest deals were made
on a golf course. Ninety of the executives surveyed were women.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, businesswomen may not realize what they are missing,
but it doesn't take long to realize, `I should be out there!' ''
said Nancy Oliver, founder and president of the Executive Women's
Golf Foundation. Starting with 28 women in 1991, the group now has
14,000 members and 90 chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Whether playing it or watching it, the leisurely pace of golf
allows for doing at least some business while the game proceeds.
And its stylish pedigree means some will always aspire to be in on
the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a much more casual pace, on a golf course or in a
corporate tent, than at a football game, or even a baseball game,''
Moulter said. ``Golf is both a leisurely pursuit and a sign of
success. The other sports just don't deliver the same cache. It's
not a snobbish thing so much as it is, `We've worked hard, we've
arrived, we're part of a class that no one else is a part of.' ''

RIVALDO IS HEAR APPARENT AS WORLD'S BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The soccer world has been expecting someone to emerge as the
heir to Pele and Diego Maradona. Historically, the soccer world has
had patience. Modern marketers do not.
</P>
<P>
   So the crown was thrust upon Brazilian striker Ronaldo before he
was prepared for it and before the public was prepared to accept
him. Though Ronaldo might well have been the world's best player
for a few weeks at a time in 1997 and '98, the overzealous campaign
to validate him always seemed manufactured. In soccer, as in most
entertainment and sports, those with the most enduring fame
generally earn it by popular acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo has shown signs of either burnout or simply being unable
to match the unrealistic hype. Inter has ordered Ronaldo to reduce
his extracurricular activity, postponing his visit to Kosovo and
announcing that the club will be involved in the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Inter has indulged Ronaldo and his sponsors to the limit and
probably should have taken action sooner. Inter's patrons, the
Moratti family, are prominent in anti-land mine campaigns and will
certainly organize a productive visit to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But they also want Ronaldo to return to form. He was not even in
uniform for Inter's 5-1 victory over Parma Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we have the answer to Ronaldo, the ``Anti-Phenomenon,'' as
described by La Gazzetta dello Sport: a Brazilian named Rivaldo
Victor Borba Ferreira.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pele, ``Rivaldo is indisputably the best player in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johan Cruyff, ``He is one of the few modern players that
can still provide for me pleasure and excitement. He has South
American talent and European professionalism. But I must say that
above all it is the lack of great players in modern soccer that
accentuates the value of Rivaldo.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivaldo succeeded Ronaldo at Barcelona and led Barca to
successive Spanish Liga titles. He has filled the No. 10 role with
Brazil and scored three goals and set up Ronaldo for one in a 4-2
victory over Argentina in Porto Alegre Sept. 7. The only other
Brazilian to score three times against Argentina was Pele in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Rivaldo has grown strong despite a youth of malnutrition in the
favelas of Recife. At nearly 6 feet 3 inches, 165 pounds, Rivaldo
does not have the classic size of a playmaker. He is sort of a
combination of his predecessors, with Pele's athleticism and
imagination, plus Roberto Rivelinho's left-footed power.
</P>
<P>
   The Barcelona fans adore Rivaldo, and their opinion of him has
been boosted by his ability to stand up to Louis Van Gaal, the
hard-driving Dutch coach. Rivaldo often leaves his left wing
position to take charge of the team, but Van Gaal cannot easily
discipline him, even after a 2-1 loss to Alaves that dropped
Barcelona out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   The most refreshing aspect of Rivaldo's rise is that he is not
surrounded by agents and marketers. Rivaldo keeps a low profile
with his family, and he has remained faithful to his sponsor,
Mizuno, which has been judicious in promoting him.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United and Italian clubs want to pry Rivaldo away
from Barcelona. Rivaldo's salary, about $3 million a year, would
have to be at least doubled. But Rivaldo is contracted to Barcelona
through 2003, and the buyout clause is $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reigning in Spain
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The surprise leader in Spain is Rayo Vallecano, located in
Madrid's Vallecas working-class section and traditionally the
city's No. 3 club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living a dream,'' Rayo Vallecano's Maria Teresa Rivero
Ruiz, one of the few women presidents of professional clubs, told
the sports daily Marca. ``If I bring the team to the UEFA, they
will make a monument to me in Vallecas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rayo Vallecano, founded in 1924, has already become a tribute to
the Ruiz Mateos family, once considered the richest family in the
country, which named the stadium after themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of the club have been efficient in their spending,
though. They assembled a team of cost-effective players, then added
US goalkeeper Kasey Keller from Leicester City in England. Keller
was attracted to the team because his wife had studied in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Keller said he communicates with teammates in ``Spanglish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we don't understand each other, Van den Bergh (a Dutch
teammate) acts as translator,'' Keller said. ``He speaks English
and Castellano perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Communication was good in Sunday's game, as Juan Antonio
``Bolo'' Perez scored in a 1-0 victory over Celta in Vigo, which
improved Rayo Vallecano's record to 4-0-0.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Misguided effort
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pele believes that Brazil is wasting money and time campaigning
for the 2006 World Cup, which will certainly go to England,
Germany, or South Africa. And, for once, former FIFA president Joao
Havelange agrees with Pele that this would be a lost cause. ``I
would rather lose a finger than a hand,'' Havelange said,
explaining that Brazil should bid for the 2010 finals. ``To win, it
is necessary to know how to lose. If Brazil does not organize the
2006 Cup, I can guarantee it for 2010.'' . . . Meanwhile, Pele is
being criticized in his role as a director of his former club,
Santos. As Botafogo edged Santos, 1-0, for its first victory of the
Brazilian Championship, fans chanted, ``Fora Samir, fora Pele,''
calling for the ouster of the team president and Pele. Supporters
also threw shoes onto the field at Vila Belmiro in Sao Paulo and
were involved in a dispute with vice president Jose Paulo
Fernandes. The other target of fans' displeasure was striker Dodo,
at $5.5 million the most expensive purchase in club history, who
was replaced in the second half by Colombian Victor Hugo
Aristizabal . . . Department of the League of Redundancy League:
The UEFA Champions League appears to have accomplished much of what
backers of a Super League wanted. The Champions Cup has been
compromised, at least in name, since even fourth-place teams can
qualify, and the sponsorship and television money has exceeded 800
million Swiss francs (about $600 million), according to the
Geneva-based UEFA. Two successive victories and first place in
Group D after the opening Champions League game was not enough for
Olympique Marseille coach Rolland Courbis. Marseille defeated Sturm
Graz, 2-0, in the Champions League and Troyes, 1-0, in the France
Le Championnat. But Robert Louis-Dreyfuss, a Harvard student in the
'60s and now chairman of Adidas-Salomon AG and president of
Marseille, has decided to recall Croat Tomislav Ivic to replace
Courbis for Wednesday's Champions League game at Croatia in Zagreb
. . . Porto, hoping to salvage Portuguese hopes, plays host to
Olympiakos in Group E. Last week, five Portuguese clubs were
outscored, 15-1, in European competition. A last-minute goal by
Brazilian defender Deco gave Porto a 1-0 win at Molde in Norway . .
. The Celtic-Rangers game in the Scottish League was postponed to
November so the teams could prepare for European matches. Rangers
could have an edge in Group F Tuesday against Bayern Munich, which
lost all three first-team goalkeepers to injuries and will have
20-year-old Stefan Wessels in goal. Wessels has been playing for
Bayern's B team in the regional amateur league . . . Chelsea, the
first-week sensation after playing Milan to a 0-0 draw in Group H,
was humbled by Watford, 1-0, in the Premier League. Coach Gianluca
Vialli rested several starters against Watford in preparation for
hs team's visit to Hertha Berlin.

   Carolina Morace, the first woman to be named coach of an Italian
professional team, had Viterbese in first place after the first
week in Serie C1. But Morace was fired by president Luciano Gaucci
after a 5-2 loss to Crotone. Morace said she would return to law
school, and Viterbese has gone undefeated since . . . MLS is among
the youngest professional leagues, but soccer's roots in the US are
deep. In fact, the American Soccer League produced the all-time
world record-holder for goals scored in a season: Archibald
McPherson ``Archie'' Stark converted 67 goals in 44 games for
Bethlehem Steel in the 1924-25 season. According to the
International Federation of Soccer History and Statistics, No. 2 is
Ferenc Deak of Hungary, who had 66 goals in 34 games in the 1945-46
season, and then William ``Dixie'' Dean of England, with 60 in 39
games in 1927-28. Pele is seventh with 58 goals in 38 games in the
1958 Paulista season . . . Newcastle United does not seem to miss
Ruud Gullitt, who was replaced by former England manager Bobby
Robson. Newcastle earned its first victory of the Premier League
season as Alan Shearer scored five goals in an 8-0 win over
Sheffield Wednesday. Another former England manager, Glenn Hoddle,
is the top candidate to take over Sheffield Wednesday.

MORE THAN READY WAS LESS THAN SUCCESSFUL IN FUTURITY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   If there was one thing that seemed certain in what has been an
unsettled year in racing, it was that More Than Ready was the best
2-year-old colt in the country. Now, with More Than Ready having
gone down to defeat in the Futurity at Belmont Sunday, nothing can
be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Southern Halo, out of a Woodman mare, More Then Ready
had done everything right prior to the Futurity, winning five
races, four of them stakes, in fast times. However, as so often
happens, distance proved a problem for a promising young horse.
More Than Ready, who had never raced past 6 furlongs, tired coming
to the wire of the 1-mile Futurity and finished third, beaten two
necks. Ridden by John Velasquez, More than Ready was off at 2-5,
proving an old racing axiom that you never bet on a favorite to do
something he's never done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his first start over 6 furlongs, and he hung on until
the end,'' said Todd Pletcher, who trains More Than Ready. ``This
horse is a fighter with a lot of heart. I'm a little disappointed
he didn't win. But that's the way the game goes. He was just beaten
by a nice horse (Bevo).''
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference before the Futurity, Pletcher was fielding
questions about More Than Ready being Horse of the Year, let alone
2-year-old champion. You can forget that.
</P>
<P>
   An excuse can be made for More Than Ready. He had developed a
fever that caused him to miss the Hopeful at Saratoga Sept. 4, and
had not raced in 52 days. But he had bounced back quickly, working
out at the Saratoga training track Sept. 6, and then authoring a
best-of-the-day 6-furlong work at Belmont, going 1:13 Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that he had the lead in the stretch and lost
it, shortening stride in the last 20 yards to be passed not only by
Bevo, who was 11-1 under Joe Bravo, but also by 30-1 bomb Greenwood
Lake and Jean-Luc Samyn. The time for the one-turn mile was 1:36,
and the loss may be an early indication that More Than Ready has
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't respond like he did in the past,'' said
Velazquez. ``He just wasn't there in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The division for 2-year-old males is now wide open. D. Wayne
Lukas trains a top one in High Yield, who took the Hopeful in More
Than Ready's absence, and Bob Baffert may have the next sensation
in Forest Camp, who captured the Del Mar Futurity in spectacular
fashion. Bevo, whose only loss in five starts came to More Than
Ready in the Flash Stakes at Belmont June 4, also joins the upper
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has improved leaps and bounds mentally,'' said Bill
Badgett, who trains Bevo, a son of Prospector's Gamble. ``We
thought this would be the time to go after More Than Ready. Todd's
horse was playing a little bit of catch-up, while my horse has
progressed after each race. We thought we had a legitimate chance.
The Champagne (at Belmont Oct. 9) is a possibility, but we might
just skip the Champagne, and go right to the Breeders' Cup (at
Gulfstream Nov. 6).''
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that More Than Ready's off day was
caused by his layoff. Whether that's so or not, the coronation has
been canceled, and More Than Ready is now in a real horse race for
juvenile honors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keen eye for talent
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How good is Baffert? He claimed River Keen, then age 6, for
$100,000 at Hollywood Park Dec. 4. This year, River Keen won the
Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood, finished second in both the San
Diego Handicap and the $1 million Pacific Classic, both at Del Mar,
and won the $500,000 Woodward Stakes at Belmont Saturday. Since
joining Baffert's barn, the Irish-bred has earned more than
$700,000. Baffert took advantange when the prestigious Woodward
came up a little light, as the connections of heavy hitters such as
Behrens and Lemon Drop Kid chose to wait for the Gold Cup Oct. 10.
Win the Woodward with a claimer? Only Baffert . . . Trainer Nick
Zito hasn't been in the spotlight much this season, but he made a
solid mark when he saddled Doneraile Court to a victory in the
$150,000 Jerome Mile for 3-year-olds on the Woodward undercard. A
son of Seattle Slew, Doneraile Court cost $1 million as a yearling.
He'll probably never make that back _ he's up to $326,000 now _ but
he has a chance to do some good things now that his camp has
realized he doesn't want to go long. ``This horse is a miler, and
he definitely loves Belmont Park,'' said Zito. ``He beat a good
colt in Vicar. We're going to hang around New York, and the Cigar
Mile (at Aqueduct Nov. 7) is our main goal.'' . . . Pletcher had a
tough Sunday, as Circle of Life, his outstanding 2-year-old filly,
also finished third. Off at 9-5, she was beaten a total of 2
lengths by Finder's Fee and Darling My Darling in the $150,000
Matron, the companion race to the Futurity. The time for the mile
was 1:36 3/5. Finder's Fee, who was 5-1 under Mike Smith, is
another who likes Belmont. The daughter of Storm Cat had finished
out of the money in two stakes at Saratoga, but came off the pace
to take the Matron, the first race in which she had the
anti-bleeding medication Lasix. ``I think when we got her back to
Belmont, her attitude changed,'' said Shug McGaughey, who trains
Finder's Fee. ``At Saratoga, the long walk from the barn to the
paddock got to her. Plus, Mike told me she didn't like the track up
there. I always thought she had the ability.''

FOR STRATEGY, THERE IS NO RIGHT ANSWER

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Dave Stockton couldn't quite believe what he
was hearing. As a Ryder Cup rookie in 1971, he was trying hard to
calm his nerves and not be intimidated. Then his playing partner
spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just three holes into the match,'' said Stockton, ``(Jack)
Nicklaus begins whining about having to hit a 5-iron (approach). He
says: `I hit a wedge in here Monday.' '' Though Stockton, 29, was
only a few years younger than Nicklaus, he was obviously the
student driver in this tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he couldn't help himself. ``I said, `You're the greatest
player in the world. What difference does it make if you're hitting
5-iron or wedge?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus just looked at Stockton and the discussion was over.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of the story: There is a difference between a 5-iron and a
wedge and if you don't know that, then you probably don't think it
matters who is paired with whom for these Ryder Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   There indeed is a strategy, which is why American captain Ben
Crenshaw said he has been losing sleep for weeks. The challenge is
settling on a strategy that works.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foursomes (alternate shot)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the toughest format to play and requires more thought on
a captain's part. Nicklaus preferred pairing long hitters with long
hitters, short hitters with short hitters, the thinking being that
each would have yardage into greens that they were used to hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tend to agree with that sentiment,'' said Crenshaw,
who has a team with some marquee long hitters _ nothing more
attractive than Tiger Woods with David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy has not been embraced by everyone, however. In
1997, for instance, American captain Tom Kite leaned toward
personalities and paired good friends Woods and Mark O'Meara. Their
discrepancy in length was a factor in a 5-and-3 foursomes loss to
Colin Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer.
</P>
<P>
   Others dismiss the notion of putting like hitters together,
claiming two other factors are more important.
</P>
<P>
   1) Keep the ball in play. This is what led captain Lanny Wadkins
to pass over Phil Mickelson in both phases of alternate shot in
1995, a decision he he was criticized for for when the talented
lefthander went 3-0 in his other matches. But Wadkins was concerned
about every player's fear in this style of play _ having to hit a
shot out of thick rough or from behind a tree.
</P>
<P>
   2) More than anything, said Tom Lehman, you need players who
understand each other. He was a Cup rookie in 1995 and found
himself in the lead group, paired with the heart of that year's
team, Corey Pavin. ``I remember, I hit a bad shot and kind of went,
aaaaahhhh, but Corey said, `Don't worry, I hit it in worse spots
than that all the time.' That made me feel at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I didn't worry about where I hit it or didn't hit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Lee Westwood, the key is judging your own play. ``If you're
not playing well, (foursomes) gets a lot harder because you just
don't want to let your partner down and put him in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one golden rule, said Westwood. ``You never
apologize'' to your partner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four-ball (best-ball)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Captains will tend to pay less attention to playing styles and
more to personalities in this format. Since players hit their own
ball all the way, the idea is to make birdies _ or at least have
lots of chances _ and in theory players who are friendly with one
another are looser, i.e. in better form.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a strategy that will come into play in four-ball at
The Country Club, it is a straight-forward one _ the par-4 fourth
(338 yards) and sixth (312 yards) holes are drivable by the longest
of hitters, so while Woods, Duval, Sergio Garcia, Jarmo Sandelin,
and others will perhaps give it a go, the first order of business
would be for their partner to get in play.
</P>
<P>
   Captains have a better feel for this format especially since
there are so many players who are easy fits because of their games
and personalities (Lehman, Hal Sutton, and Steve Pate come to
mind). For European coach Mark James, there is the fact that
countrymen sometimes pair well together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to play with someone who speaks my language,'' said
Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal, who was Seve Ballesteros's mate in a
Ryder Cup-record 15 matches. Now, look for him to guide Miguel
Angel Jimenez or perhaps teenage sensation Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Singles
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on how a team stands through two days. If it is
trailing (as the US was in 1997), look for a captain to load up the
front of his lineup with premier players to get back into the
match.
</P>
<P>
   It almost worked for Kite at Valderrama as Fred Couples (off
first), O'Meara (third) and Mickelson (fourth) did their part;
however, Davis Love III (second) was upset and Woods (fifth) was
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   A captain may try and protect a lead by putting better players
toward the back. Ballesteros did this in 1997, but his 9-10-11 guys
(Westwood, Olazabal, and Nick Faldo) were soundly beaten. What
saved him was the big lead going into the singles matches and
unexpected victories by Per-Ulrik Johansson (over Love) and
Costantino Rocca (over Woods).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who plays
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Americans have been so strong, captains have
usually been sensitive about playing everyone in three or four
matches, rarely all five. Not so the Europeans. As annual
underdogs, they don't have the luxury of balance and depth, so key
players are called upon to carry the load.
</P>
<P>
   Only Woods for the US played in five matches two years ago. The
Europeans turned to four players (Faldo, Montgomerie, Olazabal,
Westwood) to go all the way. Ian Woosnam played just twice, got
steamed, but nobody cared once the celebration started. Ballesteros
was not there to soothe egos.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sentiment that Crenshaw may adopt for this year's
matches. Having gone 2-4-1 in recent Ryder Cups, the situation is
desperate. ``If someone is hot,'' he said, ``I'll ride them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it means being ``Not So Gentle'' Ben.

S.F. MAYORAL CANDIDATE WAGES WAR ON CHAIN STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayoral candidate Clint Reilly said he supports
stiff restrictions on chain stores in San Francisco, a stance that
could help him gain the favor of neighborhood activists.
</P>
<P>
   The political consultant-turned-candidate held a news conference
Monday across the street from a Starbucks coffee house to oppose
what he called the ``chain store invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is slowly losing the character of its
neighborhoods and its neighborhood shopping districts, and once it
is lost, it will never, ever be recovered,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's attack on chain stores hits an age-old San
Francisco campaign theme _ the neighborhoods vs. the downtown
business interests. By championing the cause of mom-and-pop stores,
Reilly is positioning himself as the protector of the
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, one of 13 candidates challenging Mayor Willie Brown in
the Nov. 2 election here, said he would appoint planning
commissioners who oppose the spread of stores such as Blockbuster
and Starbucks. And he promised to tighten zoning controls, even
suggesting a ban on drive-through windows in certain neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics suggested Reilly's anti-chain store stand may have
more to do with electioneering than conviction. ``He is running for
mayor and he needs to pick up whatever issues are important to him
in his campaign,'' Supervisor Leland Yee said.
</P>
<P>
   But Yee, who has been the board's most vocal opponent of chain
store development, praised Reilly for taking up the concerns of
neighborhood groups about chain stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a mayor with the appropriate commitment, and if you
had a Planning Commission and a Board of Permit Appeals that was a
lot more sensitive to these issues, then neighborhood groups and
individuals would get a better shake in those decisions,'' Yee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood activists have fought the encroachment of chain
stores in several city neighborhoods, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Rite-Aid, a Pennsylvania-based pharmacy chain, has lost two of
three requests to move into city neighborhoods in recent years. But
Starbucks, which had just seven stores here in 1993, now has 29
stores in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Reilly charged that chain stores had
expanded dramatically under Brown's administration. He gave
reporters a list of lobbyists connected to Brown who he said had
taken money from chain stores, including the mayor's campaign
manager, Jack Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly also held up a copy of a Starbucks brochure, distributed
at its San Francisco stores, featuring a picture of Brown holding a
Starbucks coffee mug.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more neighborhoods will our mayor sell out to
Starbucks in order to get a free brochure for his re-election
campaign?'' Reilly asked.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Johnston, the mayor's campaign spokesman, explained that
the mayor's appearance in the brochure is part of charitable
program. For every purchase of a Starbucks San Francisco mug, the
company donates 50 cents to the Mayor's Neighborhood Beautification
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``the charitable donation campaign was in place
long before the election ever approached. And the neighborhood
beautification fund does nothing but good work in the
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's plan to limit chain stores would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Define chain stores as ``formula businesses'' under the
planning code. According to Reilly, a formula business is one that
maintains standardized services, decor, uniforms, architecture and
signs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require developers to notify nearby residents and businesses
by mail about any proposed new formula business. Current law
requires only businesses over a certain size or of a certain type,
such as a nightclub, to provide such notification.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require that any prominent signs for the business _ such as a
fast-food chain's logo _ be posted on the proposed site four weeks
before a public hearing on granting a permit.
</P>
<P>
   - Help neighborhoods strengthen zoning controls. Reilly said he
favors size limits, which can keep businesses of a certain size out
of neighborhoods, and density limits, which could, for example,
keep a new pharmacy from moving in on the same block as an existing
pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston argued that ``tons of public notice'' are already
required before a permit hearing. He said Reilly's blanket
opposition to chains could prevent residents from making up their
own minds about whether they want a given business in their
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Brown's central position on the issue of chain stores is
that the neighborhood, on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis,
should determine what businesses are desirable in that community,''
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Rich DeLeon, chairman of the political science department at San
Francisco State University, said Reilly hopes to cast himself as
the outsider more allied with the concerns of residents than
entrenched City Hall interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of appeal is especially attractive to those who are
longtime residents, who worked hard to create a home and establish
themselves in a neighborhood and who want to defend that quality of
life,'' DeLeon said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Hey, have you heard the one about the Swedish
golfer who flips up the bill of his cap as if he were at
kindergarten recess, carries a tee over his ear for decoration,
eats volcanic dust for its purgative value, wears skintight pants
straight from the '50s over his toothpick legs, ponders abstruse
mathematical problems in the midst of competitive rounds,
occasionally skulls spectators with errant shots _ and is on the
European Ryder Cup team?
</P>
<P>
   Of course you have, if you follow the sport. And you know it's
no joke, although Bo Parnevik, Sweden's foremost comedian and
impressionist, might try to turn it into one. Come to think of it,
Bo's son Jesper, who fits the above description, is often mistaken
for a punch line instead of what he is _ one of the world's finest
golfers, a winner on both the European and US PGA tours, twice the
British Open runner-up, and a member of the team that retained the
Ryder Cup against the United States at Valderrama, Spain, two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik will be at The Country Club in Brookline this
weekend as Europe tries to make it three in a row, and he is
enthralled by the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' he says. ``It's different from any other
tournament on any tour. The atmosphere is so charged. You see guys
jumping up and high-fiving _ on the second hole. It's like playing
golf in the middle of the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake about it, Parnevik loves playing golf. And
he's deadly serious about it, putting in 9 1/2-hour days in
preparation for tournaments. But his eccentricities seem to
outstrip his accomplishments in the public mind. And he did his
reputation no favors during the Loch Lomond Open in July when he
missed a short putt in the second round because he was pondering
this hypothetical question posed by his caddie: If you placed a
rope around the Earth's circumference and placed another rope above
it on 3-foot stakes, how much longer would the higher rope be? The
answer: 18.84 feet. Parnevik didn't get it, but he won the wager by
coming closest to the pinpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another mathematical problem: Leading the
tournament at the time, Parnevik acknowledged being distracted by
the question, and he wound up finishing in a tie for fifth, four
strokes behind winner Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   This is why some people associate him more with his father's
occupation _ freakish entertainment _ than with the solemnities
that big-time golf demands.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way for a 34-year-old to act?
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, who is in fact a sensitive, thoughtful man, considers
the dichotomy and says, ``The public may think (he's a sideshow
act), but I think it's more the media. They like to put you in a
compartment as soon as they see something different.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also different about Parnevik is his genuine compassion
in the often cold, impersonal golf world. In truth, his Loch Lomond
performance probably suffered less from his computations than it
did from his distress after he hit a fan in the head with a shot.
He was unaware of the damage at the time and was visibly upset when
he discovered the stricken man bleeding profusely. The first thing
Parnevik did after the round was to inquire about the man's
condition, and the next day, he presented him with a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was all right,'' says Parnevik. ``I don't know if
he wanted the picture. He probably didn't want to remember the
incident. In fact, he probably didn't remember the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rim shot.
</P>
<P>
   Well, some of the old man had to rub off on him. Parnevik
remembers that when he was a youngster, his father would try out
material on him and his three younger sisters. ``We were a tough
crowd,'' he says. ``You know how it is _ you never think your
father is that funny. So if he got us to laugh, he knew he had
something.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a serious side to being the comedian's kid. His
father may not have been rich _ ``it's not like with David
Letterman and Jay Leno over in Sweden,'' says Parnevik _ but he
certainly was famous. And Jesper was caught in the spotlight's
reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been famous in Sweden since I was a kid as my dad's
son,'' he says. ``I used to do some (comic) things in school, but
you know how it is. If your dad is very successful, it's really
tough to be compared to him if you follow in his footsteps. I
probably subconsciously wanted to go a different route so I
wouldn't be known just as my dad's son.''
</P>
<P>
   That route was on the golf course, for which Parnevik indirectly
owes his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the golf bug bad in the mid-'70s,'' recalls Parnevik.
``He dug up the backyard, put in holes and bunkers, tried
computers, bought all the golf books, went for every type of

   He made two marvelous discoveries. One: ``I found it a lot of

   Sweden's premier junior player, Parnevik found a sponsor for the
European Tour after college and a stint on the national team when
he joined Team Volvo.

   ``It was me and a couple of other guys,'' he says. ``They gave
us some financial support so we could exist. Golf wasn't very big
in Sweden back then.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now. And the biggest thing in Swedish golf is Jesper
Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. -- Blame all of the upcoming Ryder Cup hoopla
on Gordon Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the young producer had the bright idea to spend
$200,000 to televise the little-known event on his lesser- known
cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a million viewers watched the three days of coverage
from The Belfry in Sutton Coldfield, England, 1989. But USA Network
had it first and had it live.
</P>
<P>
   The match came down to the last day and the last hole of singles
competition, and when the 18th proved too much for Payne Stewart,
Mark Calcavecchia, and Fred Couples, the Americans settled for a
tie. The Europeans retained the Cup because they had won it
outright in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic match and USA's coverage caught the attention of
NBC, which quickly put up $2 million to televise the 1991 Cup, live
from Kiawah Island, S.C. By 1995, the television rights went for
$4.5 million, and this year's Ryder Cup cost a little more than $13
million. Ratings have nearly doubled since 1989, a noteworthy
achievement considering the final day's broadcast competes with
Sunday afternoon NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Beck had little idea that the Ryder Cup, first played in 1927 at
Worcester Country Club, would become a premier sporting event. He
had other problems to worry about in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the PGA of America was nervous because the event
had never been televised live in America. They were not familiar
with USA Network. The cable station started broadcasting in the
early '80s and most of its programming was taped sporting events
and movies.
</P>
<P>
   More problems came from the BBC. The British television network
aired the Ryder Cup in Europe and tried to suffocate the upstart
American network. ``It wasn't that they were arrogant,'' Beck said.
``But they were a little too helpful, always telling us they would
give us a cameraman or otherwise help with our production. We had
our own production team and I got to tell you, some of their
cameramen you could tell had just been pulled from their studio and
had never covered flying golf balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck said he managed to get around the BBC and give his
broadcast an American flavor. ``It was a great dramatic event,''
Beck said. ``And it woke up a lot of people..
</P>
<P>
   This was pre-Tiger, when golf languished on network TV. ``It was
a like a backwater town,'' Beck said. ``And we've been able to ride
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion has helped USA as well. The network airs many of
the early rounds of the top tennis and golf events during the
season. USA will broadcast the first day of the Ryder Cup from The
Country Club, from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had the network rights but USA still had the cable rights.
NBC allowed USA to hire producer Tommy Roy to work on the cable
network's coverage of the 1991 Ryder Cup. In addition to four Emmys
for his coverage of the Atlanta Olympics, Roy won an Emmy in 1998
for his production of golf on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise. Roy grew up in a golf family. His father,
Billy Roy, was a PGA pro for 50 years before retiring this year.
His uncle, Jim Roy, is the pro at St. Boniface Country Club in
Winnipeg. Roy himself played for the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Roy has worked every Ryder Cup since 1991 for NBC and this year
presides over an amazing array of hardware, graphics, and on-air
talent to televise the event from The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   The tower where host Dick Enberg and analyst Johnny Miller call
the match rests near the green of the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's deployment of 35 cameras includes 18 fixed cameras, one
behind each green, and five smaller cameras positioned near the
fourth, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th holes (the camera used on
the fourth is attached to a super slo mo unit and also will be used
on the 17th).
</P>
<P>
   NBC has two cameras attached to forklifts stationed near the
first and 12th fairways; three cameras attached to boom devices
enabling viewers to see a sweeping shot of the first tee, the 11th
fairway, and behind the 18th green; and another camera attached to
a huge crane positioned to the right of the eighth green enabling
NBC to provide coverage of the eighth, ninth, and 14th holes.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has stationed a smaller crane to the right of the 11th
fairway to give coverage of the 11th and 12th holes. Three flatbed
trucks called ``Rat Patrols'' will cover the entire course.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual camera angle comes on the sixth tee, where NBC
has attached a small camera on an overhanging tree branch that will
give viewers a shot directly above the golfers as they take their
drives.
</P>
<P>
   The 35 cameras NBC is using for the Ryder Cup are more than the
30 the network used to televise Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has designed eight different types of graphics to provide
scoring updates of individual matches and team totals. NBC
spokesman Ed Markey said that the network will not have a permanent
on-screen scoreboard. ``Because this is match play as opposed to
stroke play, there's a lot of information that can clutter a screen
real fast,'' Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   At appropriate times, NBC will show eight different types of
displays, including the team totals and updates on current matches.
They will have a scoreboard for the foursomes competition, with a
photograph of the player and his country's flag, and one for
singles competition, giving viewers team totals as well as match
scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The viewer won't be wondering about information and scores,''
Markey promised.
</P>
<P>
   Beck didn't have the luxury of all that equipment and computer
wizardry. It still comes down to the performance on the field.
``There may be a hero or two,'' Beck said. ``And there might be a
goat or two.''

CORPORATE FRAUDS? A WEALTH OF EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Oh, if Thorstein Veblen could be here at The
Country Club this week.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century economist, who gave birth to the phrase
``conspicuous consumption,'' would have been alternately appalled
and amused by what he would see. For rarely in the history of this
Republic have so many so overtly conspicuously consumed as they
will be doing, starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Ryder Cup might well be the culmination of just about
everything that has gone wrong with sport in the last third of this
century. This is, after all, a golf tournament. In theory, at
least, the reason anyone should care about being at The Country
Club is the competition. In that sense, the overall opulence being
flouted here this week is irrelevant to the stated purpose of the
event. Except that it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with Judge Roy Hofheinz and his cute little luxury
suites at the Astrodome. Until that moment (1965), the most the
rich could say was that they had better seats. If it rained, and
they chose to stick around, they got wet. If some guy in the middle
of the row wanted to go out for a beer or to answer nature's call,
then Mr. Big Shot seated at the end of the aisle had to stand up,
smoosh himself back against his upturned seat and allow the other
fellow to pass by. He might even have his toes stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   Horrors!
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four years later we live in a world of luxury suites and
club seats with waitress service. These entities are the engine
driving all arena and stadium construction in this country. Our
outdoor edifices are actually smaller in seating capacity than the
ones they replace, because basic attendance just doesn't matter
when stacked up against the money generated by the swells in their
luxury suites and club seats. The message to the average person
could not be clearer: You just don't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more evident than at Jacobs Field in Cleveland.
What should be thousands of nice upper-deck seats available to vox
populi have been given over to obnoxious glassed-in luxury suites,
which, when lit, create the appearance of an ocean liner. At the
end of this horrifying display, adjacent to the left-field foul
pole, sits a three-tiered restaurant, where, you can be assured, no
one is concerned about what might be happening on the field.
</P>
<P>
   And just when you think that things cannot get any sicker or
more surreal, here come the New England Patriots. It's not enough
that the fat cats have their cozy suites and their overpriced meals
and their TV sets and their couches and their private bathrooms and
their own boring company. Oh, no. Now Robert Kraft has to give them
their own private road to the stadium. God forbid some of the elite
be forced to spend time in their cars listening to the pregame and
postgame shows like the rest of us. Their time is much too precious
for that. They might have mergers to consummate and people to throw
out of work. They can't waste time sitting in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In none of their minds is simply attending a nice sporting event
good enough in itself. It must be a vehicle to entertain, and it
must provide an opportunity to show off. What good is wealth, after
all, if it cannot be conspicuously consumed?
</P>
<P>
   That said, we give you the obscenity of the Ryder Cup corporate
tents. The competition between the best American and best European
golfers is not enough. Far more important is the competition
between Corporation X and Corporation Y to see who can pamper
customers more. That's a worthy $250,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Even fellow rich people are awed by the scope of this particular
degree of conspicuous consumption. ``I don't ever think I've seen
such corporate hospitality,'' marvels Jaime Ortiz-Patino (``Jimmy''
to his friends), the billionaire Bolivian tin magnate who just
happens to own the course at Valderrama, where the Ryder Cup was
held two years ago. ``It breaks all the records.''
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is a parallel universe in which thousands of
people will sit all day in those corporate structures while the
golf takes place outside their front door. Some small percentage of
these fans will be real, live, golf fans who are genuinely thrilled
to be in attendance. The majority will come just to say they were
there. Meanwhile, of the 30,000 Ryder Cup tickets, only 10,000 were
made available to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that David Duval has labeled the Ryder Cup as
``just another corporate outing.'' As much as any of these players
profess to be single-minded about their golfing interests, how
could someone not be distracted by what is going on around them?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely a lot of tents,'' acknowledges Jim Furyk.
``I don't think you can be oblivious to it. Half the course looks
white out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still supposed to be about the competition, and when you
turn to the sports page this week that will be the main focus. The
basic story line is that a powerful American squad _ ``the
strongest team ever to play in the Ryder Cup,'' according to
Sweden's Jesper Parnevik _ must forge enough of a team identity to
defeat a European team that has had more passion in the last two
competitions. As much as these millionaire private contractors are
businessmen to the core (and this goes for both sides), they are
athletes and competitors first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of golf is getting bigger and bigger,'' agrees
Scotland's Andrew Coltart. ``The business aspect of it is
incredible. But at the end of the day it's still 18 holes of golf
and let's see who can play.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two parallel universes in play here; it's that simple.
Come to think of it, let the fat cats sit inside all day. In order
to see what's been going on, they might have to buy a morning
paper. We'll be happy to benefit from a little unconspicuous
consumption.

BECK EASES BURDEN ON RED SOX BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>

 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From the moment he stepped off a plane at Logan
Airport, hailed a cab, and showed up at Fenway Park just in time to
save a win in his first night in a Red Sox uniform _ before he even
knew his teammates' names _ Rod Beck has had a profound effect on
the Boston bullpen and the American League playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   This, mind you, from a pitcher who had a bad back in spring
training, underwent surgery to remove bone chips that had been
floating around in his right elbow for a couple of years, and was
deemed a spare part by the Chicago Cubs when they unloaded his
salary for lefty bust Mark Guthrie and minor league third baseman
Cole Liniak last month.
</P>
<P>
   In seven appearances for the Sox, Beck has yet to give up a run
while allowing just four hits in nine innings. He has had three
save opportunities and come away with a save each time. Last
Wednesday in Cleveland, when the Sox played their longest game of
the season to beat the Indians in 13 innings, Beck pitched three
scoreless innings to give Boston a chance to win it after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   That outing became all the more impressive when Beck mentioned
he had pitched a three-inning stint just twice in the last seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   His presence has had a ripple effect on the bullpen. Derek Lowe
has four saves in five chances but also has pitched 15 2/3 innings
this month, nearly a starter's load on this team (Pat Rapp has 15
2/3 innings this month, Bret Saberhagen 11).
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's 7-3 win over the Detroit Tigers, Lowe entered with
two outs in the sixth and ran the table, allowing just one hit over
the final 3 1/3 innings, striking out three while inducing seven
ground outs.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the bullpen has benefitted. Rich Garces, who has
pitched well all season, has two wins this month, lefthander Rheal
Cormier one. John Wasdin has allowed just two earned runs in 10 2/3
innings, with no home runs in seven appearances. Bryce Florie, who
threw four scoreless innings against his former Tiger teammates
last weekend, has two wins this month. The bullpen has a depth it
has lacked all season, and relievers are not being forced into
roles for which they're not suited.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it much easier for Jimy Williams to turn to his
relievers when his starters are spent. The staff hasn't pitched
better over any stretch this season. The record is 13-4, with a
league-best 3.16 ERA, in September, with the bullpen converting
seven saves in nine chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beck has made a tremendous difference,'' pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan said Sunday. ``Now we can bring Lowe into the seventh or
eighth inning. He can finish a game, but if he has trouble, now he
has a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Beck pitches two days in a row, Lowe can close games out.
It gives us so much more flexibility, and you can see the impact
it's had on everyone: Cormier, Wasdin, Guapo (Garces).''
</P>
<P>
   Beck saved 51 games for the Cubs in their successful quest for a
wild card last season, but by the time of his trade, he had been
displaced as the team's closer by Terry Adams and Rick Aguilera.
Sox general manager Dan Duquette picked up the balance of a $5.5
million salary this season, and a guaranteed $3.5 million in 2000,
for a reliever who came to Boston with a 2-4 record and 7.88 ERA in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's last save opportunity with the Cubs came back on May 12
against the Dodgers, and he blew that one, his fourth blown save in
11 chances. He didn't pitch at all from May 16 until July 23, as
surgery intervened, and when he returned, the Cubs used him more as
mopup man than closer.
</P>
<P>
   But Sox scouts advised Duquette that the reliever was throwing
better with each outing. And when Beck received the news in San
Diego that he'd been traded, he had little doubt that he was coming
to Boston to save games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the job is available right now, so I imagine so,'' he
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Williams gave him the ball the first night, and there's little
doubt who would get last call against the Toronto Blue Jays Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great now,'' said Beck, who warmed up Sunday but hasn't
pitched in a game since his three-inning stint last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And about that last time he was forced to go three innings . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my most memorable games,'' he said. ``Against LA. They
booed me coming into the game. Three straight singles, the Dodgers
loaded the bases. Then I struck out Todd Zeile, and Eddie Murray
hit into a pitcher-to-home-to-first double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they were cheering me. It was a big game for us. Helped
us clinch a playoff spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he's doing the same for the Red Sox.

YANKEES WEAVE A TANTALIZING WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's bad enough that the Yankees are winning and the team's fans
are seem to be popping up everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now they'll have a cool three-dimensional Web site where fans
can create their own characters, walk around a cyber Yankee
Stadium, and chat with Yankee fans all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Worlds.com, a Boston-based Internet company, created the 3-D
site for the Yankees, which is scheduled to be up in time for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   While most professional sports teams have conventional Web
sites, the Yankees are the first to have one in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrastar, the New York-based company that owns the Yankees'
Internet rights, signed an agreement with Worlds.com Monday.
Worlds.com and Ultrastar will share advertising, sponsorships, and
VIP membership fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every baseball fan has a tactile and visual identity with
their favorite team,'' said Ultrastar president Rob Goodale. ``If
you are a Red Sox fan, you think of Fenway. If you are a Yankee
fan, you think of the House That Ruth Built. Baseball is a real,
physical thing and this 3-D site enables fans unable to attend
games to electronically be a part of the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Worlds.com has been granted rights to re-create not only public
areas in Yankee Stadium such as the bleachers and front-row seats
but private areas as well, including the Yankees' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the next generation,'' said Worlds.com president Thom
Kidrin. ``The Yankees' Web site is now one of the most visited
sites in the country and this new site will take it to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can predict how many visitors the 3-D site will attract.
But by all accounts, internet chat rooms are tremendously popular.
American On-Line is pulling about 150,000 new clients to its chat
rooms every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports fans want to be intimate with their information and
their team,'' Kidrin said.

Out of bounds on Ali
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NBC trained a camera on Muhammad Ali sitting in a luxury box
during the Michigan State-Notre Dame game Saturday. Ali suffers
from Parkinson's Disease and has a persistent tremor. It's one
thing for NBC to point him out, but do viewers have to watch Ali
seemingly for minutes, unable to control his movements? Put it this
way. NBC spent more time on Ali and a nothing report from Jim Gray
on the sidelines than it did on the latest allegation of corruption
(the part-time tutor writing a paper for a football player) at
Notre Dame, the network's television partner.

TEXAS CITY READY FOR CHAOS, JUST IN Y2 CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ The way Ralph Quest II sees it, being ready for
anything come Jan. 1 means stockpiling enough food to feed his
neighbors in Texas farm country and opening his two wells to slake
their thirst. Otherwise he might have to pull a rifle on them, and
the church elder wouldn't want to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long would it take for them to figure out you're eating
and they're not?'' said Quest, who heads up his church's new
disaster-relief committee. ``So I'll be storing up food for them,
too. Because what are you going to do? Shoot your neighbor?''
</P>
<P>
   Few in Lubbock, or elsewhere, anticipate Armageddon to result
from the computer glitch now known worldwide as the Y2K bug. Most
Americans _ who accept the word of companies and cities that their
computers will work properly come the new year _ anticipate only
minor problems or none at all, according to a summer Associated
Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one seems certain of how ready America's small towns
and big cities are for whatever problems do occur. In the same
poll, almost one-third of the people said they plan to stock up on
food, water, and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of folks in Lubbock, Quest said he doesn't know if
the New Year will bring a blip, a bump, or disaster. But
self-reliance runs deep in cotton country. Even locals who scoff at
the idea that computer chips and software will go haywire the
second 1999 turns into 2000 tend to keep extras on hand in case
another tornado hits. Three decades ago, the big one laid waste to
25 square miles of homes and businesses, killing 26 residents and
injuring hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   But natural disasters such as the 1970 tornado draw help from
neighboring communities. The man-made disaster that doomsayers
insist will shut down utilities, disable ATMs, and leave gas pumps
dry could mean every city for itself. On the rugged plains of West
Texas, they take the potential for even greater isolation
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   As Lubbock city manager Bob Cass put it, ``If there's a more
independent person than a West Texas farmer, I haven't heard of
them. It's in our nature to be ready for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Y2K specialists said, should stand sun-baked, pancake-flat
Lubbock in good stead, whatever happens. For a city on the smallish
side, with almost 200,000 people spread over 104 square miles, it
recognized relatively early that it needed a contingency plan that
covered everything from the Lubbock-owned water and electric
companies to the traffic signals on street corners. Seven hundred
stoplights have been ordered in case they malfunction, though tests
show they should be working properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere is immune from this,'' said Cathy Moyer, managing
director of the Cassandra Project, a Colorado-based organization
that promotes individual and community preparedness. ``Some places
will have serious problems, some places insignificant ones. Every
town, every city, has a different issue. One running concern is
that a lot of places have overlooked the importance of effectively
communicating what they're doing, how they're doing, to their
citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Lubbock, proud to call itself Buddy Holly's
hometown, also pride themselves on the city's awareness campaign in
English and Spanish. One pamphlet offers Mayor Windy Sitton's
assurances that doom is not on the new calendar. Others note that
proper precautions can minimize disruptions, and provide tips on
alternative power sources and safekeeping of spare cash. Despite
its detailed Web site, the city owns up to not knowing what to
expect. But city officials do know how bad it can get.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, in what was billed as the first exercise of its kind
in the nation, officials staged mock Y2K chaos: a riot at a nearby
state psychiatric prison, a breakdown in the sewer system, 911
calls that couldn't go through, even icy streets from a cold front.
As the problems piled up, with one computer system after another
crashing, officials at the emergency-management headquarters
frantically sought to keep order and keep critical services
functioning during the five-hour test.
</P>
<P>
   The result, as Cass later testified before a US Senate
committee, was an understanding that cities without contingency
plans risk being blindsided if disaster does strike. For its part,
Lubbock discovered holes that it has been hustling to plug ever
since. If necessary, the city plans to use runners to relay
emergency calls to its fire and police departments, and to operate
a variety of city equipment by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume there will be some failures out there; we expect
some business inefficiencies,'' said Cass, the city manager. ``But
it's the one emergency that has announced it's coming, or that it
could come, and we're going to be as ready as we can be. The
exercise gave us a qualified yes that we will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubbock isn't telling its residents anything that many other
cities aren't telling theirs. From San Diego to Seattle, from
Boston to Baton Rouge, municipalities are offering assurances that
the stroke of midnight will not spell mayhem. Banks, power
companies, and water treatment plants say they have checked and
rechecked their systems, replacing faulty computer chips, updating
systems when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Vukamic, a senior principal at San Jose-based Solutions
Plus, said his company has identified problems in no more than 5
percent of the computer equipment and software it has examined for
companies and municipalities in the last year and a half. ``In
general, it's being addressed,'' he said, adding that he was more
concerned about smaller cities and companies that may lack the
resources or enthusiasm to update their systems.
</P>
<P>
   The same concern can be heard in Lubbock, where Jay Dycus, a
vice president at the Chamber of Commerce, said many small
businesses appear to be procrastinating Y2K fixes. No one in town
would even estimate how many have gotten their computers ready or
will in the coming months. And, as local officials conceded, the
ability of Lubbock and other cities across the country to function
depends on regional suppliers and local businesses making good on
their word that they will be able to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Peter de Jager, a Canadian Internet author who began urging
corporations and municipalities to check their systems years ago,
said he is now confident that no major power outages will occur. No
banks will fail. Any problems with water treatment will be solved
in a day or two. At the same time, he holds fast to his belief that
everyone should have two weeks of food and cash on hand, supplies
they might need in any emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has woken up; we're now aware of what we need to
do,'' de Jager said. ``When everyone was asleep at the wheel and
saying this was generated by money-grubbing computer consultants, I
was terrified. . . . (But) it's a mix of yes, we're working on it,
and no, we're not. It's gotten to the point where it's real hard to
separate the wheat from the chaff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is crowded with grass-roots groups trying to hold
their local governments and utilities accountable and pull their
neighbors together just in case. More than 500 people turned out
for a daylong seminar on Y2K preparation in Ketchikan, Ala.
Seminars in Prescott, Ariz., have drawn as many as 700 people.
Every city seems to have a citizen task force. Not everyone is
taking the millennium seriously, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It varies from person to person,'' said Kenneth J. Smith, who
helps run a small preparedness group in an unincorporated area near
Spokane, Wash. ``It's a compound in the hills surrounded by
concertina wire, or you're thrown out of the house if you mention
it. We're just trying to pull together talent _ a retired nurse, an
electrician _ in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Per Kielland-Lund, who is helping run a group in Madison,
Wis., ``The least everyone should do is contact their neighbors and
see what resources they can share.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the city's encouragement, however, many people in
Lubbock said they had no plans to store up more than the usual.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Kraus, operations manager at the local Barnes &AMP; Noble
bookstore, joked that he had a sixpack of beer and a bottle of hot
sauce in his refigerator to tide him over. Paul Snyder, who owns an
industrial supply company, said he saw the potential for mayhem as
an excuse to buy extra guns. But Cathy Motty, whose family helped
organize a neighborhood meeting where city officials spoke about
Y2K, has purchased a $300 water filter and has been filling every
container she can with water now stored in her garage.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Quest's Trinity Church decided not to rely on the
city alone to assist its 8,000 members. After tests showed that its
fire and alarm systems were fine, that its computer system needed
repair, and that its telephone system needed replacing, the
church's Y2K committee began stockpiling food a can at a time in
January. The 600 gallons of water it had in the storehouse was sent
to Oklahoma City after its recent tornado, so that stockpile is
being restarted from scratch. The church also drilled its own well,
and has been using it to keep the lawn green.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people can't afford to put back a week of groceries,
much less a month,'' Quest said. ``So we've got to help ourselves
and each other. Remember, if everyone is hit, no one is running to
help; no one is coming to your aid.''

BRADLEY PLAN FOR GAYS IRKS RIGHTS LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It looked like a sure thing: Bill Bradley courting
the liberal vote by proposing that sexual orientation be added to
the list of protected categories in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But
members of the black community and the nation's most prominent gay
elected official Monday rejected the plan as politically naive.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said
that the presidential candidate was ``well-intentioned but very
incorrect'' in suggesting the Civil Rights Act needed to be
amended. He was the first openly gay official to speak out against
the proposal, echoing earlier objections by civil rights leaders
that the law could be erased in a Republican-controlled Congress
once opened to changes and amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire his instinct,'' said Frank, a Newton Democrat. ``But
he is mistaken about the way to do it. What Bill Bradley has
proposed ignores the very careful legislative work we've been
doing. I wish he had checked with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, made the comment in
an interview with the Advocate, a magazine, which is due out on
newsstands on Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the United States should ``add sexual orientation
to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,'' which outlawed discrimination
because of personal characteristics like race, gender or religion
in housing, employment and lending and paved the way for
affirmative action. The suggestion came as part of what has been a
broad attempt by Bradley to align himself with the gay community.
He has also criticized Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy
as insufficient and attacked a proposition on California's March
2000 ballot that would define marriage as viable only between a man
and woman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Civil Rights Act remark was his most far-reaching, and
was seen as the most concrete affirmation of homosexual rights from
any presidential candidate. The benefit of adding sexual
orientation, Bradley said, was that it ``would clearly indicate
that discrimination against gays is in the same category as
discrimination against other protected groups,'' according to
published reports.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of his message seemed to please some gay rights
advocates, among them Gary Busek, executive director of Gay and
Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) in Boston. Without
addressing the political side-effects of linking gay rights to
rights for other minorities, Busek said, ``I suspect it could be
received positively in the gay community.''
</P>
<P>
   But civil rights leaders were far less enchanted. Last Friday,
after Bradley's quote was made public, civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson said he would ``not want to open up that bill because, with
this right-wing Congress, they could restrict it rather than expand
civil rights.'' US Civil Rights Commission chairwoman Mary Frances
Berry attacked the idea as ``naive.'' And yesterady, Yvonne
Scruggs-Leftwich, the executive director of the Black Leadership
Forum, said that when she heard the news she was ``quite
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider Senator Bradley to be very personally familiar with
the difficulties of civil rights and maintaining civil rights
advances,'' she said. ``I thought he must have meant something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, one of three openly gay members of the US House, said he
was troubled not only by the possible Pandora's Box effect of
readdressing civil rights, but also by the damaging side-effects
for gays of arguing that homosexuals have suffered in the exact
same way as blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Linking gay rights to the Civil Rights Act would feed into the
conservative Republican argument that gays are ``looking for
quotas, looking for special rights,'' Frank said. But in fact, he
said, the gay community is looking simply for non-discrimination
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight against racism and the fight against homophobia are
not identical fights. They do have the same enemies,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``There's one big difference...We were able to
avoid some of that overt discrimination by hiding. What we want,
therefore, is non-discrimination without affirmative action'' _ a
goal that could be reached apart from Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination against homosexuals has become a focal point of
debate between the offices of Bradley and Vice President Al Gore in
recent days. Last Wednesday, after the National Gay and Lesbian
Task force issued a press release rating the presidential hopefuls,
Bradley's campaign contacted the task force to air his views,
spokesman David Elliot said. Then, after the task force released a
new press release to account for Bradley's views, Gore aides called
to add their remarks. The task force had to issue yet a third
release.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not respond directly to criticism of Bradley's ideas.
But spokesman Chris Lehane did say Gore supports the passage of the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which is the proposed
legislation to address discrimination against gays _ and is
distinctly separate from civil rights laws.

   Many a cultural icon has had a home in Minneapolis, Minn.
Consider the Mall of America, Mary Tyler Moore, Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura and the Artist formerly known as Prince. But to a
star-struck breed of cereal lovers, Minneapolis means Lucky Charms.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Lucky the Leprechaun and his party-colored product
have thrived in the Minneapolis suburb of Golden Valley, on General
Mills Boulevard just south of Betty Crocker Drive. The
oat-and-marshmallow medley is one of General Mills' top sellers,
and one of the longest-running success stories in kids' cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Charms owes much of its success to continual reinvention.
Over the decades, the marshmallow bits have undergone radical
transformations in shape, size and color.
</P>
<P>
   At first it was pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars and
green clovers. Then the mutant marbits began to appear. Blue
diamonds, purple horseshoes, red balloons, swirled whales, a
rainbow, a snowman, a pot o'gold and The Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The frosted oat nuggets have stayed the same. What mysterious
forces are shaping the evolution of Lucky Charms?
</P>
<P>
   In the Bisquick conference room at General Mills headquarters,
assistant marketing manager Patricia Chang displays a box of Lucky
Charms featuring the cereal's latest permutation: tiny marbit
charms in saturated colors and substandard sizes that the company
launched last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have a new event like this, we see anywhere
between a 10 percent to 20 percent bump in sales,'' Chang says.
</P>
<P>
   The food engineers at General Mills first clued in to this
dynamic in 1975, when blue diamonds were introduced to the
``standard mix'' and sales of the cereal jumped 31 percent. Adding
purple horseshoes in 1983 increased sales another 25 percent. When
red balloons joined the party in 1989, sales increased again. Each
time, there were permanent gains.
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned researcher cites three factors for the cereal's
unique appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the marshmallows, it's the marshmallows, it's the
marshmallows,'' says Jim Geoffrion, a department head at the
General Mills technical center.
</P>
<P>
   To determine which marbit designs kids find most enticing, the
market research department conducts frequent ``concept-ideation''
studies. A general principle has emerged. More is better. Bright
colors are better than subdued pastels, and a greater variety of
designs in each package is better than the measly four that
launched the cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youths also prefer patterned charms in multiple colors.
Satisfying that preference requires manufacturing technology that
was perfected only in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The basic recipe for the marbits is uncomplicated: sugar, corn
syrup and gelatin. The ingredients are melted together and whipped
to a foamy consistency, then extruded in strips of specified shapes
that are cut into individual pieces and dried slowly at low
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are added during the foam phase, before extrusion,
and the shapes are determined by the extrusion dies. The trick lies
in getting those patterned marbits that children find so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Separate streams of colored foams have to be ``co-extruded'' _
squeezed out through the dies together at exactly the same rate,
such as the colors in striped toothpaste come out of the tube in
sync.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike toothpaste, the marshmallow foam is compressible, and
controlling the flow rate of a compressible foam is a problem more
worthy of rocket science than food science.
</P>
<P>
   It is relatively easy to make multicolored marbits with equal
volumes of each color, squeezed out at the same rate. A lower
volume color accent _ such as a smile on the man-in-the-moon marbit
_ requires a different flow rate during extrusion, and the only
thing harder than stabilizing compressible fluids at the same flow
rate, says Geoffrion, is synchronizing compressible foams with
varying flow rates.
</P>
<P>
   Within these daunting limits, General Mills has achieved an
impressive expansion in the complexity and diversity of the marbit
community. Themes have included charms shaped like Olympic torches
and medals, seasonal tokens such as mittens and snowmen, and an
around-the-world promotion featuring Egyptian pyramid- and Statue
of Liberty-shaped marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   The inspired notion of combining marshmallows with a whole-oat
cereal came to former vice president and product developer John
Holahan in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Holahan was brainstorming in the aisles of his local supermarket
when he came upon the orange Marshmallow Circus Peanuts that were
among his favorite confections. He took a bag back to the lab, cut
up the ``peanuts,'' and sprinkled them over a bowl of Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   They ``ate just right,'' Holahan recalls. ``I knew we had a
winner, a concept that had great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The charms were a technical challenge from the start. No one in
the food industry had ever tried to make small, intricately shaped
marshmallows. Chemists and candymakers from General Mills and Kraft
collaborated for months to devise the proprietary formula and
drying technology that are still used today. The resulting marbits
have the texture of candy pumice and make up over 25 percent of a
box's volume.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than three decades later, Lucky Charms is General
Mills' No. 3 seller, bested only by Cheerios and Honey Nut
Cheerios. Among presweetened children's cereals, it is No. 1, with
more than $150 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills engineers have a dozen new designs that will
speciate on supermarket shelves in years to come. When asked if
glow-in-the-dark charms can it be done, Geoffrion says, ``Not
yet,'' with a nervous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But when it can, Lucky Charms could be the first midnight snack
to provide its own illumination.

<P>
   Eleven weeks after NATO began raining bombs on Yugoslavia,
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo. By
then, more than 850,000 Kosovars had fled the region. A few
refugees immigrated. The vast majority are housed with host
families or in refugee camps in Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Grim, an American emergency physician, volunteered her
services at a Macedonian refugee camp during the thick of the war.
This is her journal.
 &UR; MAY 6, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Managers of Senokos Camp, a refugee shelter in northern
Macedonia, have been notified that 4,000 to 5,000 Kosovars are to
arrive. Doctors of the World, the organization that provides
medical care in the camp, has called for physician volunteers, so I
find myself in their headquarters in New York City, signing an
insurance policy for, among other things, kidnapping, ransom and
extortion.
 &UR; MAY 8, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I arrive at the headquarters of Doctors of the World emergency
relief project in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Senokos Camp is
about an hour's drive away, near the Macedonian-Kosovar border.
</P>
<P>
   I am introduced around the office. Doctors of the World had been
in Pristina, Kosovo, for six years. The staff had been evacuated
two days before the bombing began in March. In the kitchen I meet
the cook, an elderly Kosovar who has been here a month. As she
serves me potatoes and Turkish coffee, she tries to explain
something. But she speaks no English. She seats herself abruptly,
takes off her glasses and starts to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, we head off to Senokos Camp. The guard waves
us through the chicken- and barbed-wire fence that surrounds row
upon row of tents. The medical clinic is a small complex of three
tents joined by an awning.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have not yet arrived. The borders are closed. We
are not needed tonight.
 &UR; MAY 9, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several of the doctors working in the camp are Kosovars who fled
when the war began. The doctor in charge of the camp health
facilities, Visar Nushi, fled Pristina a few days after the bombing
started. He was separated from his fiancee and does not know if she
is alive or dead. He does not know if his parents are alive or
dead. His sister _ with his two nephews _ has also disappeared.
Still, Nushi puts in 14-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   Senokos Camp is a small shelter. It is equipped for 10,500
people. Some 2,500 have arrived. We await the rest. Everyone has
shelter, food, potable water and privies nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in Senokos _ the crowding, the boredom, the anxiety
_ are severe but manageable. At Stenkovec II, just down the road,
there are sometimes as many as 30,000 exiles. The expanding
population has assumed a critical mass, a level of chaos that
breeds rioting.
</P>
<P>
   We are experiencing similar problems. Today a doctor treats a
refugee with two teeth knocked out by another refugee. There was no
disagreement; they didn't even know each other. The assailant had
just walked up to this man and kicked him twice in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Fuller, an American internist, sees s 32-year-old woman
brought in by her husband. She is accompanied by their 4-year-old
son. The mother says something in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a headache,'' the translator explains.
</P>
<P>
   The woman covers her face with her hands. Her shoulders shake as
she weeps noiselessly.
</P>
<P>
   The translator frowns. ``She says she just found out her mother
and her father were massacred in Kosovo. They are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman weeps. Her son stares up her, confused. He starts
sobbing in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   That is one kind of case.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Fisher, one of the doctors working here, sees another. A
17-year-old kid who had stepped on a land mine in Kosovo had been
treated by an orthopedic surgeon in Pristina. The surgeon had fled
with him across the border and was now seated next to him on the
canvas cot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a medical emergency,'' the orthopedic surgeon told
Fisher. ``He must go to Germany for surgery immediately to save the
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon leaned forward and whispered, ``He is KLA, Kosovo
Liberation Army. If they find him here, they will kill him. You
must get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan looked down at the foot. ``You've worked a miracle here,''
he told the orthopedist sadly. ``I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The orthopedist was himself very lucky to make it out. According
to the refugees and the people that I talked to in the camp, the
first thing that the Serbs did was kill all the doctors.
 &UR; MAY 14, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, nurses and other medical technicians make up half of
the organizations like Doctors of the World. The other half is
``Logistics.'' No doctor can work without nurses, translators or
the tools of modern medicine: IV fluids and catheters, sterilized
equipment, antibiotics, bandages, needles and syringes.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Fraser is a big Canadian who is the logistician in
Macedonia for Doctors of the World.
</P>
<P>
   At the general staff meeting, Fraser describes the campaign to
distribute buckets filled with local foods. About 900 have been
prepared, and recent donations have provided funding for 20,000
more. There is talk of making up boxes to feed a family of five for
a week _ to be used when the refugees go home.
</P>
<P>
   There is silence. No one really talks about what will be needed
when the war ends.
 &UR; MAY 19, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 9:00 p.m. we get word: A couple of busloads of refugees _ the
first to cross the border in weeks _ will arrive in a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the buses pull up, young men stand crowded in the aisles
while old women peer out through the windows into the night.
Macedonian soldiers are shouting, pointing at the gates. The
medical staff stands ready.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have lined up on either side of the central
clearing, straining for a first glimpse of the arriving passengers.
Most are looking for relatives, friends, neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The doors open slowly. Faces, harshly lit by the camp light,
descend. Everyone looks startled by the light, the noise, the idea
of safety. Children are sobbing. Old women weep. Young men look
bewildered, as if they are surprised they are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   No one looks critically ill, although everyone appears
shell-shocked. Some older people, hunched and frail, stumble feebly
in the direction of the camp. I stop an ancient woman who appears
to have a broken nose. It happened two days ago, she tells me. She
fell running from the Serbian police.
 &UR; MAY 20, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and I have a rare day off, so we drive to the border,
about 25 kilometers from Skopje. The dry countryside looks like the
foothills of the Sierras in California.
</P>
<P>
   An aide from the camp points to a patch of hillside that
overlooks the roofs of a small village beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs were there three weeks ago. Emptied the town right
out and set fire to everything that would burn.''
 &UR; MAY 27, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly a month since I arrived at Senokos. The number of
refugees has risen from 2,500 to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Today we learn that Milosevic has been indicted by the United
Nations War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tending to an elderly women who hasn't slept for days. She
insists that otherwise she is fine _ as the tears stream down her
face. I prescribe Valium for what seems to be the hundredth time
tonight. In the waiting room are three more just like her.

ESCAPING THE GHETTOS OF BLACK MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is black music?
</P>
<P>
   From Jimi Hendrix to Joan Armatrading, that question has long
badgered black artists whose creative inclinations and musical
directions challenge and stretch simplistic notions as to the kind
of music they are expected to create.
</P>
<P>
   This comes to mind as MeShell Ndegeocello's stellar CD
``Bitter'' is flailing for airplay. Released last month,
Ndegeocello's third album is already being hailed as one of the
year's best. A brooding 12-cut songscape about romance on the rocks
and love gone wrong, it's being compared favorably to such
I'm-so-lonesome-I-could-cry classics as Joni Mitchell's ``Blue''
and Frank Sinatra's ``In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.''
Entertainment Weekly gave its ``stunning set of tough and tender
sob stories'' an A rating, while Robert Christgau in Rolling Stone
praised the songs as ``vivid sketches.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndegeocello puts aside her trademark bass-slapping funk for blue
jazzy overtones on this CD, her first since 1996's provocative
``Peace Beyond Passion.'' But you won't hear her songs wedged
between Ja Rule's ``Holla Holla'' and 702's ``Where My Girls At.''
For most radio programmers, Ndegeocello's music does not fit the
increasing slim definition of the urban contemporary format.
</P>
<P>
   And thus the question, what is black music? What makes Whitney
Houston more of an urban contemporary artist than Tracy Chapman, or
Maxwell more of a soul man than Lenny Kravitz?
</P>
<P>
   What's occurring, even within the black community, is a sad kind
of self-segregation against those whose music dares veer away from
such urban strongholds as R&AMP;B and rap. More often than not, artists
such as Ndegeocello find themselves unable to ``crossover'' in
their own communities.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Ndegeocello, nor is this a nascent problem. It has
plagued such groups as Fishbone and the Family Stand, and was the
plight of the late, sorely underappreciated black hard rock band
Living Colour. Led by guitarist extraordinaire Vernon Reid, Living
Colour fused raw funk and metal, scoring such hits as ``Cult of
Personality,'' ``Open Letter to a Landlord,'' and ``Glamour Boys.''
The group also opened for the Rolling Stones on their 1989 Steel
Wheels tour. But Living Colour's support came mainly from rock
stations, not from those who found the music ``too white.''
</P>
<P>
   To counteract such myopic notions, Reid cofounded the Black Rock
Coalition in 1985. In its manifesto, the group denounces ``spurious
demographics'' and the ``demand that Black musicians tailor their
music to fit into the creative straitjackets the industry has
designed. We are individuals and will accept no less than full
respect for our right to be conceptually independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The mean-spirited ``too white'' label has also dogged Lenny
Kravitz. Though he has enjoyed multiplatinum success for the past
decade with such songs as ``It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over,'' ``Are
You Gonna Go My Way,'' ``Always on the Run,'' and more recently,
``Fly Away,'' the singer-songwriter has never enjoyed a fan base
within the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with MTV several years ago, Kravitz said, ``I
grew up in a very strong Afro-American environment, so it's strange
to me that the majority of my own people don't consider me to be a
black artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, music industry success is about neither black nor
white _ it's about green, as in how many albums an artist sells.
But it's unfathomable that an artist like Ndegeocello is more
celebrated at Lilith Fair _ where she was a featured performer _
than in a community that would do well to embrace something other
than the uninspiring, cookie-cutter product passing itself off as
R&AMP;B these days.
</P>
<P>
   As white artists from David Bryne to Paul Simon to Chris Cornell
on his great new solo disc, ``Euphoria Morning,'' dabble in such
black music idioms as funk, soul, and gospel, so too should black
artists be supported in explorations outside of the limits of a
self-imposed music ghetto. As Black Rock Coalition cofounder Reid
has said, ``We (black people, specifically, and the public in
general) don't know the kind of future we're cheating ourselves out
of musically and intellectually.''

   Many a cultural icon has had a home in Minneapolis, Minn.
Consider the Mall of America, Mary Tyler Moore, Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura and the Artist formerly known as Prince. But to a
star-struck breed of cereal lovers, Minneapolis means Lucky Charms.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Lucky the Leprechaun and his party-colored product
have thrived in the Minneapolis suburb of Golden Valley, on General
Mills Boulevard just south of Betty Crocker Drive. The
oat-and-marshmallow medley is one of General Mills' top sellers,
and one of the longest-running success stories in kids' cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Charms owes much of its success to continual reinvention.
Over the decades, the marshmallow bits have undergone radical
transformations in shape, size and color.
</P>
<P>
   At first it was pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars and
green clovers. Then the mutant marbits began to appear. Blue
diamonds, purple horseshoes, red balloons, swirled whales, a
rainbow, a snowman, a pot o'gold and The Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The frosted oat nuggets have stayed the same. What mysterious
forces are shaping the evolution of Lucky Charms?
</P>
<P>
   In the Bisquick conference room at General Mills headquarters,
assistant marketing manager Patricia Chang displays a box of Lucky
Charms featuring the cereal's latest permutation: tiny marbit
charms in saturated colors and substandard sizes that the company
launched last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have a new event like this, we see anywhere
between a 10 percent to 20 percent bump in sales,'' Chang says.
</P>
<P>
   The food engineers at General Mills first clued in to this
dynamic in 1975, when blue diamonds were introduced to the
``standard mix'' and sales of the cereal jumped 31 percent. Adding
purple horseshoes in 1983 increased sales another 25 percent. When
red balloons joined the party in 1989, sales increased again. Each
time, there were permanent gains.
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned researcher cites three factors for the cereal's
unique appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the marshmallows, it's the marshmallows, it's the
marshmallows,'' says Jim Geoffrion, a department head at the
General Mills technical center.
</P>
<P>
   To determine which marbit designs kids find most enticing, the
market research department conducts frequent ``concept-ideation''
studies. A general principle has emerged. More is better. Bright
colors are better than subdued pastels, and a greater variety of
designs in each package is better than the measly four that
launched the cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youths also prefer patterned charms in multiple colors.
Satisfying that preference requires manufacturing technology that
was perfected only in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The basic recipe for the marbits is uncomplicated: sugar, corn
syrup and gelatin. The ingredients are melted together and whipped
to a foamy consistency, then extruded in strips of specified shapes
that are cut into individual pieces and dried slowly at low
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are added during the foam phase, before extrusion,
and the shapes are determined by the extrusion dies. The trick lies
in getting those patterned marbits that children find so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Separate streams of colored foams have to be ``co-extruded'' _
squeezed out through the dies together at exactly the same rate,
such as the colors in striped toothpaste come out of the tube in
sync.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike toothpaste, the marshmallow foam is compressible, and
controlling the flow rate of a compressible foam is a problem more
worthy of rocket science than food science.
</P>
<P>
   It is relatively easy to make multicolored marbits with equal
volumes of each color, squeezed out at the same rate. A lower
volume color accent _ such as a smile on the man-in-the-moon marbit
_ requires a different flow rate during extrusion, and the only
thing harder than stabilizing compressible fluids at the same flow
rate, says Geoffrion, is synchronizing compressible foams with
varying flow rates.
</P>
<P>
   Within these daunting limits, General Mills has achieved an
impressive expansion in the complexity and diversity of the marbit
community. Themes have included charms shaped like Olympic torches
and medals, seasonal tokens such as mittens and snowmen, and an
around-the-world promotion featuring Egyptian pyramid- and Statue
of Liberty-shaped marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   The inspired notion of combining marshmallows with a whole-oat
cereal came to former vice president and product developer John
Holahan in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Holahan was brainstorming in the aisles of his local supermarket
when he came upon the orange Marshmallow Circus Peanuts that were
among his favorite confections. He took a bag back to the lab, cut
up the ``peanuts,'' and sprinkled them over a bowl of Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   They ``ate just right,'' Holahan recalls. ``I knew we had a
winner, a concept that had great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The charms were a technical challenge from the start. No one in
the food industry had ever tried to make small, intricately shaped
marshmallows. Chemists and candymakers from General Mills and Kraft
collaborated for months to devise the proprietary formula and
drying technology that are still used today. The resulting marbits
have the texture of candy pumice and make up over 25 percent of a
box's volume.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than three decades later, Lucky Charms is General
Mills' No. 3 seller, bested only by Cheerios and Honey Nut
Cheerios. Among presweetened children's cereals, it is No. 1, with
more than $150 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills engineers have a dozen new designs that will
speciate on supermarket shelves in years to come. When asked if
glow-in-the-dark charms can it be done, Geoffrion says, ``Not
yet,'' with a nervous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But when it can, Lucky Charms could be the first midnight snack
to provide its own illumination.

   Many a cultural icon has had a home in Minneapolis, Minn.
Consider the Mall of America, Mary Tyler Moore, Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura and the Artist formerly known as Prince. But to a
star-struck breed of cereal lovers, Minneapolis means Lucky Charms.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Lucky the Leprechaun and his party-colored product
have thrived in the Minneapolis suburb of Golden Valley, on General
Mills Boulevard just south of Betty Crocker Drive. The
oat-and-marshmallow medley is one of General Mills' top sellers,
and one of the longest-running success stories in kids' cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Charms owes much of its success to continual reinvention.
Over the decades, the marshmallow bits have undergone radical
transformations in shape, size and color.
</P>
<P>
   At first it was pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars and
green clovers. Then the mutant marbits began to appear. Blue
diamonds, purple horseshoes, red balloons, swirled whales, a
rainbow, a snowman, a pot o'gold and The Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The frosted oat nuggets have stayed the same. What mysterious
forces are shaping the evolution of Lucky Charms?
</P>
<P>
   In the Bisquick conference room at General Mills headquarters,
assistant marketing manager Patricia Chang displays a box of Lucky
Charms featuring the cereal's latest permutation: tiny marbit
charms in saturated colors and substandard sizes that the company
launched last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have a new event like this, we see anywhere
between a 10 percent to 20 percent bump in sales,'' Chang says.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Eleven weeks after NATO began raining bombs on Yugoslavia,
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo. By
then, more than 850,000 Kosovars had fled the region. A few
refugees immigrated. The vast majority are housed with host
families or in refugee camps in Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Grim, an American emergency physician, volunteered her
services at a Macedonian refugee camp during the thick of the war.
This is her journal.
 &UR; MAY 6, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Managers of Senokos Camp, a refugee shelter in northern
Macedonia, have been notified that 4,000 to 5,000 Kosovars are to
arrive. Doctors of the World, the organization that provides
medical care in the camp, has called for physician volunteers, so I
find myself in their headquarters in New York City, signing an
insurance policy for, among other things, kidnapping, ransom and
extortion.
 &UR; MAY 8, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I arrive at the headquarters of Doctors of the World emergency
relief project in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Senokos Camp is
about an hour's drive away, near the Macedonian-Kosovar border.
</P>
<P>
   I am introduced around the office. Doctors of the World had been
in Pristina, Kosovo, for six years. The staff had been evacuated
two days before the bombing began in March. In the kitchen I meet
the cook, an elderly Kosovar who has been here a month. As she
serves me potatoes and Turkish coffee, she tries to explain
something. But she speaks no English. She seats herself abruptly,
takes off her glasses and starts to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, we head off to Senokos Camp. The guard waves
us through the chicken- and barbed-wire fence that surrounds row
upon row of tents. The medical clinic is a small complex of three
tents joined by an awning.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have not yet arrived. The borders are closed. We
are not needed tonight.
 &UR; MAY 9, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several of the doctors working in the camp are Kosovars who fled
when the war began. The doctor in charge of the camp health
facilities, Visar Nushi, fled Pristina a few days after the bombing
started. He was separated from his fiancee and does not know if she
is alive or dead. He does not know if his parents are alive or
dead. His sister _ with his two nephews _ has also disappeared.
Still, Nushi puts in 14-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   Senokos Camp is a small shelter. It is equipped for 10,500
people. Some 2,500 have arrived. We await the rest. Everyone has
shelter, food, potable water and privies nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in Senokos _ the crowding, the boredom, the anxiety
_ are severe but manageable. At Stenkovec II, just down the road,
there are sometimes as many as 30,000 exiles. The expanding
population has assumed a critical mass, a level of chaos that
breeds rioting.
</P>
<P>
   We are experiencing similar problems. Today a doctor treats a
refugee with two teeth knocked out by another refugee. There was no
disagreement; they didn't even know each other. The assailant had
just walked up to this man and kicked him twice in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Fuller, an American internist, sees s 32-year-old woman
brought in by her husband. She is accompanied by their 4-year-old
son. The mother says something in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a headache,'' the translator explains.
</P>
<P>
   The woman covers her face with her hands. Her shoulders shake as
she weeps noiselessly.
</P>
<P>
   The translator frowns. ``She says she just found out her mother
and her father were massacred in Kosovo. They are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman weeps. Her son stares up her, confused. He starts
sobbing in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   That is one kind of case.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Fisher, one of the doctors working here, sees another. A
17-year-old kid who had stepped on a land mine in Kosovo had been
treated by an orthopedic surgeon in Pristina. The surgeon had fled
with him across the border and was now seated next to him on the
canvas cot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a medical emergency,'' the orthopedic surgeon told
Fisher. ``He must go to Germany for surgery immediately to save the
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon leaned forward and whispered, ``He is KLA, Kosovo
Liberation Army. If they find him here, they will kill him. You
must get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan looked down at the foot. ``You've worked a miracle here,''
he told the orthopedist sadly. ``I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The orthopedist was himself very lucky to make it out. According
to the refugees and the people that I talked to in the camp, the
first thing that the Serbs did was kill all the doctors.
 &UR; MAY 14, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, nurses and other medical technicians make up half of
the organizations like Doctors of the World. The other half is
``Logistics.'' No doctor can work without nurses, translators or
the tools of modern medicine: IV fluids and catheters, sterilized
equipment, antibiotics, bandages, needles and syringes.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Fraser is a big Canadian who is the logistician in
Macedonia for Doctors of the World.
</P>
<P>
   At the general staff meeting, Fraser describes the campaign to
distribute buckets filled with local foods. About 900 have been
prepared, and recent donations have provided funding for 20,000
more. There is talk of making up boxes to feed a family of five for
a week _ to be used when the refugees go home.
</P>
<P>
   There is silence. No one really talks about what will be needed
when the war ends.
 &UR; MAY 19, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 9:00 p.m. we get word: A couple of busloads of refugees _ the
first to cross the border in weeks _ will arrive in a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the buses pull up, young men stand crowded in the aisles
while old women peer out through the windows into the night.
Macedonian soldiers are shouting, pointing at the gates. The
medical staff stands ready.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have lined up on either side of the central
clearing, straining for a first glimpse of the arriving passengers.
Most are looking for relatives, friends, neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The doors open slowly. Faces, harshly lit by the camp light,
descend. Everyone looks startled by the light, the noise, the idea
of safety. Children are sobbing. Old women weep. Young men look
bewildered, as if they are surprised they are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   No one looks critically ill, although everyone appears
shell-shocked. Some older people, hunched and frail, stumble feebly
in the direction of the camp. I stop an ancient woman who appears
to have a broken nose. It happened two days ago, she tells me. She
fell running from the Serbian police.
 &UR; MAY 20, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and I have a rare day off, so we drive to the border,
about 25 kilometers from Skopje. The dry countryside looks like the
foothills of the Sierras in California.
</P>
<P>
   An aide from the camp points to a patch of hillside that
overlooks the roofs of a small village beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs were there three weeks ago. Emptied the town right
out and set fire to everything that would burn.''
 &UR; MAY 27, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly a month since I arrived at Senokos. The number of
refugees has risen from 2,500 to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Today we learn that Milosevic has been indicted by the United
Nations War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tending to an elderly women who hasn't slept for days. She
insists that otherwise she is fine _ as the tears stream down her
face. I prescribe Valium for what seems to be the hundredth time
tonight. In the waiting room are three more just like her.

</P>
<P>
   The woman covers her face with her hands. Her shoulders shake as
she weeps noiselessly.
</P>
<P>
   The translator frowns. ``She says she just found out her mother
and her father were massacred in Kosovo. They are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman weeps. Her son stares up her, confused. He starts
sobbing in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   That is one kind of case.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Fisher, one of the doctors working here, sees another. A
17-year-old kid who had stepped on a land mine in Kosovo had been
treated by an orthopedic surgeon in Pristina. The surgeon had fled
with him across the border and was now seated next to him on the
canvas cot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a medical emergency,'' the orthopedic surgeon told
Fisher. ``He must go to Germany for surgery immediately to save the
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon leaned forward and whispered, ``He is KLA, Kosovo
Liberation Army. If they find him here, they will kill him. You
must get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan looked down at the foot. ``You've worked a miracle here,''
he told the orthopedist sadly. ``I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The orthopedist was himself very lucky to make it out. According
to the refugees and the people that I talked to in the camp, the
first thing that the Serbs did was kill all the doctors.
 &UR; MAY 14, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, nurses and other medical technicians make up half of
the organizations like Doctors of the World. The other half is
``Logistics.'' No doctor can work without nurses, translators or
the tools of modern medicine: IV fluids and catheters, sterilized
equipment, antibiotics, bandages, needles and syringes.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Fraser is a big Canadian who is the logistician in
Macedonia for Doctors of the World.
</P>
<P>
   At the general staff meeting, Fraser describes the campaign to
distribute buckets filled with local foods. About 900 have been
prepared, and recent donations have provided funding for 20,000
more. There is talk of making up boxes to feed a family of five for
a week _ to be used when the refugees go home.
</P>
<P>
   There is silence. No one really talks about what will be needed
when the war ends.
 &UR; MAY 19, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 9:00 p.m. we get word: A couple of busloads of refugees _ the
first to cross the border in weeks _ will arrive in a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the buses pull up, young men stand crowded in the aisles
while old women peer out through the windows into the night.
Macedonian soldiers are shouting, pointing at the gates. The
medical staff stands ready.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have lined up on either side of the central
clearing, straining for a first glimpse of the arriving passengers.
Most are looking for relatives, friends, neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The doors open slowly. Faces, harshly lit by the camp light,
descend. Everyone looks startled by the light, the noise, the idea
of safety. Children are sobbing. Old women weep. Young men look
bewildered, as if they are surprised they are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   No one looks critically ill, although everyone appears
shell-shocked. Some older people, hunched and frail, stumble feebly
in the direction of the camp. I stop an ancient woman who appears
to have a broken nose. It happened two days ago, she tells me. She
fell running from the Serbian police.
 &UR; MAY 20, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and I have a rare day off, so we drive to the border,
about 25 kilometers from Skopje. The dry countryside looks like the
foothills of the Sierras in California.
</P>
<P>
   An aide from the camp points to a patch of hillside that
overlooks the roofs of a small village beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs were there three weeks ago. Emptied the town right
out and set fire to everything that would burn.''
 &UR; MAY 27, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly a month since I arrived at Senokos. The number of
refugees has risen from 2,500 to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Today we learn that Milosevic has been indicted by the United
Nations War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tending to an elderly women who hasn't slept for days. She
insists that otherwise she is fine _ as the tears stream down her
face. I prescribe Valium for what seems to be the hundredth time
tonight. In the waiting room are three more just like her.

MEANINGFUL MOMENTS ADD UP IN `ONCE AND AGAIN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Showtimes are West Coast time)  
By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``Once and Again'' is a pretty banal title for a
show that is anything but. Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the
guys who gave us ``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called Life,''
again have created a show that's about nothing but the sheer
accumulation of little moments that add up to a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward and Billy Campbell star as Lily and Rick, two single
parents with their own families to run and problems to weather.
Lily's recently separated from her husband and has a 14-year-old
daughter (Julia Wheelan) who's a minefield of insecurities, so Lily
herself can be something of a raw nerve. Rick, divorced three
years, has become so accustomed to his state of anomie that he's
coasting way before his time. They meet, and everything changes.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this show instantly likable is the terrific chemistry
between Ward and Campbell, evident from the outset before they even
meet, when they merely exchange glances at one another while
dropping their kids off at school. The romantic tension escalates
quickly even while Rick and Lily try to take things slowly. Even
when their connection is halting at best, and they're dancing
awkwardly around each other, one can feel their heat. In a TV
season overwhelmingly overrun by teen hormones, leave it to a
couple of adults to show the kids how it's done right.
</P>
<P>
   There's one unfortunate gambit that Zwick and Herskovitz have
opted for, one that makes the show even more touchy-feely than it
already is. In black-and-white footage, Ward and Campbell address
an off-screen interviewer, sharing ostensibly private thoughts as
if for a documentary (it's like the show's own built-in electronic
press kit). They spout such New Agey nonsense as ``So here I am,
except I don't know where `here' is'' and ``I don't know where I
fit in in my own life anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Such segments are annoying because Zwick and Herskovitz are good
enough writers and Ward and Campbell good enough actors that much
of it doesn't even need to be said _ we have the show right in
front of us; we don't need the Cliffs Notes, too. Background
material could simply be incorporated into other scenes. More
irksome, however, is the unspoken Hollywood-centric subtext that
unless one's life plays out before the glare of the media, it's
somehow diminished in importance. The rest of us get by just fine
without all the attention, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   But Ward and Campbell are so wildly appealing as a couple that
one willingly sits through the show's more treacly impulses. The
rest of the cast is excellent, too; the kids are more authentic
than on most of TV's glut of teen shows.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry about having to sit through seasons of flirting
before Lily and Rick consummate their relation. Try episode two,
which is every bit as strong _ if not better _ than tonight's
premiere. The only question is, with a couple so obviously perfect
for each other, how will the writers be able to concoct obstacles
for these two for the duration of the series?
</P>
<P>
   `MISSION HILL'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Hill,'' a new animated series on the WB, feels about
right, which isn't exactly a good thing. It's about underachievers
and, given the talent involved, it underachieves its own self.
</P>
<P>
   The series comes with a pronounced pedigree _ its creators are
veteran ``Simpsons'' executive producers Bill Oakley and Josh
Weinstein. It follows the travails of a waterbed salesman-aspiring
cartoonist (voiced by Wallace Langham of ``The Larry Sanders Show''
and ``Veronica's Closet'') hanging in a Greenwich Village-type
neighborhood. He rooms with nutty buddies (Brian Posehn of ``Mr.
Show with Bob and David'' and Vicki Lewis of ``NewsRadio,'' as well
as his fast-track, high-school-aged br/D( &QC; P

WILLIAMSTOWN ALUMNI CARRY ON A `PAINFUL' LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ They are 30, even nearly 40 years out of
college, by many measures more famous and successful than he ever
was, yet still they refer to him as ``Mr.'' Gaudino.
</P>
<P>
   Standing around his grave here on the campus where he focused so
much of his energy is enough to dissolve them into weeping. He has
become an adjective (Gaudinoesque), a noun (Gaudinophile), and a
frequent probing question: ``What would Mr. Gaudino think?''
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is not the usual alumni nostalgia for the cozy collegiate
years or the comfortable familiarity of this picturesque New
England campus. What these Williams College alumni return to honor
is, in fact, what professor Robert L. Gaudino called
``uncomfortable learning,'' an education they recall,
reverentially, for its power to disturb, unsettle, afflict. As
Gaudino once asked, ``Isn't education, gentlemen, one big upset
stomach?''
</P>
<P>
   But nor are these alumni content to merely reminisce _ ``he''
would pierce that notion with one incisive quip. Rather, for two
decades, they have poured their time, money, and energy into a fund
dedicated to continuing the Gaudino legacy on this campus and
others. Returning recently (Sept. 18-19) to mark the 25th
anniversary of Gaudino's death, they pledged themselves again to
the importance of ``uncomfortable learning,'' especially in an age
when college students are seen as customers paying $30,000 to be
pleased, and campus is more like a warm bath than an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I graduated in 1974, but I didn't come back to my reunion,''
said Michael Lucow. ``This is my reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversity and success of the ``Gaudino alumni'' are an
eloquent testimony to the power of great teaching and to liberal
arts education, at a time when reports decry the demise of both.
The alumni range from the deputy chief executive of Lazard Freres
to the head of Harlem Congregations for Community Involvement,
prominent conservative William Bennett as well as Carleton College
President Steve Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For everyone who took a course from him, there just wasn't
anyone else who did that, who got you to think critically about the
world, who engaged you in the process of learning the way he did,''
said Richard Metzger, a Washington lawyer who oversaw the
deregulation of the telephone industry for the Federal
Communications Commission. ``You can't duplicate him. Gaudino is
sui generis. What you can do is encourage others who are interested
in creating the same type of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question is the one Gaudino would have asked first:
Why? Why would this teacher above all others inspire so many alumni
to return so often and so many years later to renew his legacy?
</P>
<P>
   Gaudino arrived here in 1955 with a newly minted doctorate from
the University of Chicago and taught political science for 19 years
before his death at age 49. His classes were small, at most 20
students, meeting around an oblong table late in the afternoon,
even in the evening _ an hour then unheard of. He demanded
formality, insisting that everyone show up on time, addressing his
students by their last names, insisting they complete the reading
and be prepared to answer his questioning.
</P>
<P>
   He began by going line by line through the reading. Then the
questions would begin _ Would Nietzsche approve of Mao? What would
Locke talk about if you invited him to dinner? _ all designed to
test the depth of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   In today's jargon, what Gaudino called ``uncomfortable
learning'' might be called critical thinking, or even character
education. It was highly unconventional in the late '50s and early
'60s. But Gaudino believed, largely correctly, that most of his
students were coming from sheltered and homogenous backgrounds.
True education, he believed, required them to experience
``otherness,'' to step outside their experience and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Linsky, a former legislator and Weld administration
official who teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government,
holds an image of Gaudino in his mind, 40 years after taking a
political philosophy course from Gaudino. In it, Gaudino leans
across the table with his disproportionately large head, his round
and probing eyes, and asks a question. As Linsky answers, Gaudino
leans in closer: ``But why, Mr. Linsky, but why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most intense academic experience I ever had,''
Linsky said. ``It had this very deep impact, which was the
realization that all this going-to-school stuff had something to do
with me as a person, as opposed to getting good grades, absorbing
information _ the stuff I had been used to as a typical, ambitious,
middle-class high school student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that next step that I think has made it significant,
which is bringing it back to you. It's more than you have a
responsibility as an educated person to know the great works; it's,
also, you have a responsibility as a human being to connect what
you learn to your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Riehl, who took a class with Gaudino 15 years later, admits
a certain fear of going to class. ``But you always wanted to be
there,'' he said. ``You could not miss his gaze and his engagement.
He had the remarkable personality of understanding people in great
depth. He didn't please people, but you always knew you'd be
challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ``The Paper Chase,'' but with patience _ rigorous, yet
outrageous and often irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing career plans as he prepared to graduate in 1960,
Lewis mentioned that he might like to be a college administrator,
even a college president. ``But Mr. Lewis,'' Gaudino replied, ``I
thought you were interested in education!''
</P>
<P>
   Gaudino gave his students the opportunity for otherness not only
in the classroom but all over campus, at discussion groups over
doughnuts and peach ice cream in his living room, at film
screenings and at campus debates.
</P>
<P>
   And in the late '60s, he began two programs, first
Williams-in-India, then Williams-at-Home, both designed to put
students face to face with the unfamiliar, either in a foreign
country or in this one _ in Appalachia, the farming Midwest, the
segregated South. Students would live with families and work on
farms, on assembly lines, in stores. He wanted the programs to be
more than semesters abroad; students had to take courses on the
history and culture of the area before they left, and when they
returned had to spend another course reflecting on what they had
seen, learned, and experienced, for there could be no education, he
believed, without reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Yale Law School, and I can't remember 2 percent of
the content of what I studied there, but I do think the nonacademic
life skills that were developed, particularly by Gaudino, are what
has shaped my life ever since,'' said Jeff Thaler, who graduated in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Gaudino continued to teach and run the programs in India and the
United States until his death on Thanksgiving Day 1974, of a rare
neurological disorder. The fund was begun soon after.
</P>
<P>
   By 1981, a board of trustees gathered to try to decide how best
it could spend the money it raised, about $62,000, to keep alive
Gaudino's vision of education. It based its decisions on a 54-page
memo that attorney Richard Herzog, a 1960 graduate, wrote, and in
the years since the fund has helped support programs at Williams,
including a study program in China, an Urban Studies program in New
York City, a Gaudino scholar who runs Gaudino forums every Monday
night on campus, and an intensive freshman residential seminar.
</P>
<P>
   As they gathered here over the weekend to mark the official
opening of classes, more than 100 alumni took part in panels and
discussion groups. Inevitably discussion turned to what their
mission should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher education in certain ways is getting the message that
what it ought to be about is student learning,'' Lewis, the
Carleton College president, said. ``What Gaudino did, what great
teaching is about, is making the student the active partner, not a
passive vessel into which you pour knowledge. It's about what
students learn, not about what I say as a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The task of the Gaudino alumni, as one said, is to ``bear
witness'' to the power of that kind of education.
</P>
<P>
   As the alumni gathered for a dinner tribute to their teacher,
Thaler stood before them and wondered what Mr. Gaudino would have
said about their gathering. One thing was certain, he said. He
would have asked ``Why?''

LOVE IS A MONEY SPENDER THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My old pal, Joe King, is always good for a lesson or two on the
big questions in economics. Joe, you may remember, once
time-traveled to ProsperUtopia, a future world of free-market
tyranny where everyone is rich, the landscape is lovely but fake,
and the air is unbreathable. Now he has just returned from a place
of our own world, a tiny island in the Arafura Sea off New Guinea
that in recent years has emerged from its dark age into the bright
sunlight of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Joe turned up at my door all atwitter over a woman he had
romanced on that faraway island. ``The first time I saw her,'' he
said of Maoke, ``she had her head tilted back, polishing off a
bottle of Coke. Absolutely beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lovely, long neck?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. It was the Coke. I knew instantly, here was a woman I
could love.''
</P>
<P>
   I was suddenly reminded of a remark by Roberto C. Goizueta, the
former Coca-Cola chairman: ``People around the world are today
connected to each other by brand name consumer products as much as
by anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe continued: ``Of course, Maoke and I are separated by
culture, upbringing, religion, language _ you name it. But I knew
right then that in the things that mattered we had the same
desires.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe explained that until economic globalization shone on Maoke's
island, the society had been nearly untouched by Western ways for
thousands of years, and had been under the authoritarian control of
a dynasty of noncapitalist tribal leaders who were called the
Baboman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can barely speak English,'' Joe King went on, ``but she
knows all the right words: McDonald's, Levi's, Kodak, Marlboro,
Federal Express. And she's already heading up-market. You should
hear how perfect she pronounces: Armani, Cartier, Lancome, Remy
Martin, and Dunhill. We had so much to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you got to know her pretty well?'' I inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we knew each other all our lives. The minute I
heard her say Gucci, I knew exactly what she'd say next.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chanel,'' Joe said. ``She told me of her happiness, her
sadness, her dreams. She confided in me _ told me that for a long
time she didn't really like who she was. Then she switched from
Nike to Adidas, and she said, `I felt much better about myself.'
Wow. Don't I know the feeling! You can't get much closer to someone
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' I said, hesitating to raise delicate issues, ``she's
lived her whole life in the Arafura Sea, she bows to an absolute
leader named the Baboman, while you're American and all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware of that,'' said Joe King, a little peeved. ``One day
I asked her outright, `Tell me, Maoke, do you still believe in the
Baboman?' She laughed and said, `I believe in Aunt Jemima.' '' Joe
was beside himself: ``Do you know what that means? She's the Girl
Next Door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to meet this woman,'' I offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to be sure,'' Joe went on, lowering his voice.
``So I pressed her on the island dogma. I asked, `Don't you still
thank the Baboman every day for all the good things in your life?'
She smiled, shook her head: `No, I say, Thank goodness for Chef
Boyardee.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like destiny,'' I told my friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' Joe King said. ``She even has an Apple computer,
just like me, and loves the Apple slogan: Think Different. When I
heard that, I just had to hug her. `Me too!' I cried. `We're
exactly the same. We both think different.' ''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Deceptively simple and frankly brilliant, the
arrest-and-prosecution formula for Dick Wolf's evercreen
crime-drama procedural, ``Law &AMP; Order,'' marks its 10th season with
the birth of a sibling: ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.''
``SVU'' basically offers more of the same, but if it can maintain
the quality of its predecessor, then it's certainly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special Victims Unit'' is a euphemism for the new show's
original subtitle, ``Sex Crimes.'' The portentous narrator who
opens ``Law &AMP; Order'' reappears here, explaining, ``sexually based
offenses are considered especially heinous.'' This first episode is
a particularly grim and grisly affair, concerning the murder and
castration (or as a cop cynically quips, ``Whoever did this sliced
off his cigar and took it with 'em'') of a Serbian war criminal who
had raped 67 women in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, after chasing down the usual dead-end suspects,
eventually conclude that the perpetrator or perpetrators were
themselves victims of the dead man's reign of terror. (All this at
9 p.m. _ why on earth didn't NBC honor Wolf's wishes to broadcast
this show at 10 p.m.?)
</P>
<P>
   The unrelenting bleakness of ``SVU's'' subject matter is
leavened, thankfully, by the charm and charisma of the show's
principles, Christopher Meloni (of HBO's similarly devastating
``Oz'') and Mariska Hargitay. Meloni defies the gravity with a
gracefully light but intelligent presence, while Hargitay projects
a strong, appealing no-nonsense tone. Richard Belzer reprises his
role as the mordant Detective Munch from the departed ``Homicide:
Life on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's established that Hargitay's character has a
powerfully personal motivation for serving in the Special Victims
Unit. Her mother urges her to switch assignments, and her superior
(Dann Florek, who starred in the first three seasons of ``Law &AMP;
Order'') questions her ability to function within it. At the end of
this episode, he barks at her, ``You've just used your
get-out-of-jail free card _ there's only one in the pack.'' How can
she possibly survive in this environment, when it's clear that
she'll have a personal stake in virtually every case she handles?
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' wants it both ways _ it
makes light of certain sexual foibles while cloaking dark human
impulses in even darker dramatic raiment. It will require a
consistent, Herculean effort to maintain an appropriate tone for
its subject matter. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`LADIES MAN'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies Man'' wins the award for the fall season's most retro
title _ it sounds like something out of the '60s or '70s. Alfred
Molina stars as Jimmy Stiles, a guy surrounded by a lot of (rather
moody) women _ his wife Donna (Sharon Lawrence), his mother Mitzi
(Betty White), two daughters, an ex-wife and a mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, Donna is pregnant and vacillating wildly on
whether or not she wants to have sex in her condition. Jimmy's
hoping the latest addition to his family will be a boy, which makes
those around him repeatedly suggest that he hates women; there's a
weak running joke about whether Jimmy ``likes little boys.'' The
series was created by Chris Thompson, who is doing far funnier work
on his other new sitcom, Fox's ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina's acting here is unduly, and uncharacteristically, forced
_ this fine character actor (``Boogie Nights,'' ``Maverick'') looks
like a stand-up comic giving his first sitcom performance. At one
point, debating his impending child's gender, Molina babbles, ``You
can call a `she' an `it' all you want, it still doesn't make a him
a `he,''' and the line gets applause. You can just imagine

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES _ It has been five years now. But every Monday
morning of every week that passes, 270 Mondays in all so far, they
come to pay homage and plead for justice before the austere walls
of Argentina's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   A young widow implores police and prosecutors to find and punish
the murderers of her husband, who perished along with 85 others in
the July 1994 bombing of the Jewish communal center. A community
leader sounds the sacred shofar, symbol of the Yom Kippur ceremony,
hoping the piercing pitch of the ram's horn will rouse those in the
courthouse much the way it tumbled the walls of Jericho more than
3,000 years before. Some 200 others stand in mute demand for
action.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has answered their call.
</P>
<P>
   The government vowed swift action in the wake of the bombing,
which was the second in two years against a Jewish target. But the
investigation has called into question the state's competence and
raised the possibility of its complicity; only low-level
functionaries face trial, and prosecutors concede they probably
never will determine who ordered and paid for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Within this country's Jewish community of 200,000 meanwhile, the
bombs continue to reverberate.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that means steering clear of connections to their
religion and culture for fear of further violence. But for many
more, including those who appear each Monday in front of the
Tribunales building, the attacks have spurred them to reach out to
fellow Jews for consolation and community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who put the bomb, what they want is for me to leave
the shul, to say, `Yes, Judaism here is finished,' '' said Debi
Pinson, a 17-year-old who sings in her synagogue's choir and helps
lead its services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not give them what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To understand the impact of the bombings, it is critical to
understand the history of Argentina and its Jewish community _ the
biggest in Latin American and seventh largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   That history begins with Russian Jews who fled the pogroms of
the late 1800s and settled in remote outposts in the Argentine
outback, spawning a culture of Jewish gauchos, or cowboys. Their
brethren followed from Morocco and the Ottoman Empire, and by 1920
there were 135,000 Jews who brought with them Yiddish theater and
Jewish newspapers, a commitment to Zionism and a loyalty to their
new homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But the heritage also has a dark side. President Juan Peron was
sympathetic to Germany in World War II and afterward gave refuge to
Nazi criminals such as Adolf Eichmann. The military junta that held
power in the 1970s and early '80s was especially ruthless in
torturing Jews. And while anti-Semitism seemed to be on the wane
more recently, it resurfaced in 1992, when a bomb at the Israeli
Embassy killed 29, and again on July 18, 1994, when an explosion
demolished the Argentine Israelite Mutual Aid Association
headquarters in the heart of Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community at first took President Carlos Menem at his
word that he would find and punish the perpetrators of the two
bombings, but with each week that has passed without a resolution
that faith has been replaced by alienation and anger.
</P>
<P>
   It is partly that the investigations, especially on the communal
center bombing, have seemed half-hearted. For the first three years
only eight policemen were assigned, compared to the thousands in
the United States who investigated the 1995 bombing of the Alfred
P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Critical evidence
disappeared, key suspects were tape-recorded urging colleagues to
keep silent, and millions of dollars turned up in the bank account
of one key figure. Argentine law also hamstrung the investigators
by prohibiting them from questioning suspects and limiting their
use of informants.
</P>
<P>
   What they did turn up, however, raised more doubts than it
settled. Of 20 people facing charges, 15 are policeman, including
several believed to have purchased the van used in the bombing.
There also are suspicions that military officers, past and present,
were involved, along with anti-Semitic elements in Argentina's
large Arab community.
</P>
<P>
   Indictments of the 20 suspects were handed down last month, and
a trial is expected early next year. But many of the charges focus
on corruption rather than the bombing. And while the vice president
and other senior officials have suggested a link to Iranian-backed
terrorist groups, the case assembled so far focuses exclusively on
the local connection and prosecutors acknowledge they still are in
the dark about much of what transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no answers,'' said Laura Ginsberg, whose husband died
in the bombing. ``At the present moment we believe there is not a
political decision to solve the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Barbaccia, one of two prosecutors handling the case,
offered a similar verdict: ``In the government there is no need or
urge to solve the case.'' As for repeated suggestions of a Middle
East link, Barbaccia, who has been on the communal center bombing
case since the start, said, ``we have very weak evidence on that
link.''
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Aviran, Israel's ambassador to Argentina, insists that
by now, there should have been more answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want just a declaration, we want a few people put on
trial,'' said Aviran. ``Even though things now have quieted down,
we will continue insisting on and demanding justice and the
completion of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobo Timerman, a journalist and author, said it is apparent
why international terrorists twice would choose Argentina for their
attacks on Jewish interests. ``Our large community of Jews is the
first part,'' said Timerman, whose highly publicized imprisonment
and torture during the military regime makes him Argentina's
best-known Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have a large organization of police eager to accept the
job of carrying out attacks like those.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back bombings have dramatically transformed the
Jewish community here, but not always in ways that could have been
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   They exacerbated an economic crisis facing the communal
organizations, with the Aid Association now facing a debt of $25
million. They forced synagogues, schools, and other Jewish
institutions to install huge metal barriers and hire armed guards.
And they scared away some members of the community who worried
about the risks to themselves and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, the bombs also rallied many to their
religion and culture and may help stem a decline that has seen
Argentina's Jewish population fall by more than 100,000 in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because of rallies like the ones each Monday in
front of the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, composed mainly of relatives of those killed in
the communal center bombing, holds a similar protest one Wednesday
each month in front of the bomb site, which now is home to a
rebuilt center.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, the bombing touched a nerve in thousands of
assimilated Jews, making them conclude that, whether or not they
viewed themselves as Jewish, the outside world did. It also pushed
many to learn more about their roots and seek a sense of community
with coreligionists, whether that be a Jewish sporting club or
school, a social welfare agency or a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the . . . bombing, I said I really want to know what a
Jew is. I did my bat mitzvah then, and studied, and every Saturday
morning I come to the synagogue,'' said Lili Esses, a 42-year-old
artist and teacher. ``For me, Jewish life here can be divided into
after and before'' the bombing.

BASICS LIFT `ONCE AND AGAIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ONCE AND AGAIN 
Starring: Sela Ward, Billy Campbell, Julia Whelan, Shane West,
Susanna Thompson, Jeffrey Nordling, Todd Field, Marin Hinkle 
On: ABC, 10 p.m., Tuesday  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' is certainly the classiest new show of the
fall TV season. And it's not just because the series bucks TV's
tidal wave of youth worship, as it tells the story of dating
parents in their 40s who actually have wrinkles curling around
their mouths. ``Once and Again'' is special because it returns to
the basics of what constitutes superior dramatic television:
three-dimensional characters to care about, smart scripts that
never short-shrift complexity, and deeply felt acting. The formula
is simple, engaging, and incredibly difficult for TV producers to
get right.
</P>
<P>
   The show is exactly the kind of drama you'd expect from Edward
Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the men behind ``thirtysomething''
and ``My So-Called Life.'' That means the characters are touchy,
and feely, and dive headlong into self-analysis while the New Age
guitarist plucks at heartstrings in the background. Warning: It's
not for those who think of this genre as a not-so-fine-whine. Zwick
and Herskovitz are able with the show's light moments _ the awkward
head angles of a kiss, for example _ but they are far more
interested in the rigors and raptures of good old-fashioned angst.
In ``thirysomething,'' it was yuppie angst, in ``My So-Called
Life'' it was teen angst, and in ``Once and Again'' it is
post-divorce family angst. Indeed, as it ranges between the turmoil
of the parents and their children, ``Once and Again'' is a hybrid
of the two earlier shows.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are entirely distinct, though, particularly Sela
Ward's Lily and Billy Campbell's Rick. The idea is that the newly
separated Lily and the divorced Rick are magically attracted to
each other, but their love affair will be inhibited by all kinds of
broken-family issues. Fear is a barrier, as Lily is still wary in
the aftermath of her womanizing husband. And needy children are
another barrier, as Lily's 14-year-old daughter, Grace, is openly
hostile to the possibility of her mother dating. ``Please don't
have sex with him tonight,'' Grace begs, trying to make Lily feel
guilty as she prepares for a date. Rick, meanwhile, is caught up in
his own guilt trip, afraid to give needed discipline to his
scholastically challenged son.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, best known for her Emmy-winning work on ``Sisters,'' is
especially appealing as Lily. She's flustered and frightened, but
she's also got a winning sense of self-knowledge. And as Rick,
Campbell is sincere and open and boyishly charming, with a leaning
toward stoicism. Together, they have a natural chemistry. Their
classic dating moments _ the first phone call, a rushed make-out
session in the car _ are awkwardly adolescent, exciting, and always
believable. You can't help but root for them. Next week's episode
makes an amusing parallel between their dating life and that of
Rick's 16-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   As Grace, who is entering the world of men just as her mother
reenters it, Julia Whelan is also worth noting. She brings raw
feeling to Grace's nervousness and negative body image. She's more
sloppily expressive than Claire Danes in ``My So-Called Life,'' but
she's equally impressive. ``Once and Again'' explores her inner
conflict, but unlike most of the family dramas this season, it
keeps the focus on the parents' story.
</P>
<P>
   The show's only questionable move is the device of
black-and-white scenes in which Rick and Lily tell their secrets
directly to the camera as though they're in therapy. These moments
veer dangerously close to TV commercial testimonials, or the
confessional footage in MTV's ``The Real World,'' and they run the
risk of impeding the action. They are unnecessary explication,
especially given the strength of the performances.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called Life,'' ``Once and
Again'' is not a particularly original or groundbreaking hour of
TV. It works with familiar themes about divorce, and Zwick and
Herskovitz's style has been replicated all over the networks. But
it's absorbing, above average, and addictive. And if you watch it
once, you'll probably watch it again.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope ABC finds a safe new home for it, after ``NYPD Blue''
returns to the 10 p.m. timeslot on Nov. 9.

   Some people might envy James ``Woody'' Green's life as a member
of Dru Hill. After being discovered in 1995, the R&AMP;B group quickly
racked up enough sales to go platinum with hits like ``In My Bed''
and ``These Are the Times.'' They spent their lives in a blur,
hopping from New York City to Washington to Chicago performing for
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years wore on, the thrill of waking up in St. Louis
and going to sleep in New Orleans disappeared for Green. In April,
the singer decided to temporarily chuck fame with Dru Hill and
return to the musical roots formed when he sang his first church
solo as a 3-year-old toddler.
</P>
<P>
   He'll record a gospel album.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 22, who was raised a Baptist, says his goal with the
record is ``to make it almost, like, cool for young people to
accept the Lord and not be ashamed to say they're Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Green's decision is not unusual. After all, the
relationship between black music and religion stretches back as far
as slavery, when Africans added musical oomph to Christian songs to
create Negro spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, the only time major R&AMP;B and hip-hop artists
alluded to their spirituality was when they thanked God for winning
a Grammy, MTV, or Billboard award. Now, musicians are increasingly
giving Him more than a cursory heads up.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill read from the Bible when accepting her recent Grammy
Award for the album ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' and credits
prayer for the eruption of creativity that spawned the record.
Artists like Puff Daddy, Faith Evans, Lil' Kim, and Mary J. Blige
openly discuss their religious beliefs in interviews.

stopped smoking marijuana because God told her to. And a month

<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Backstreet Boys take the stage at the
FleetCenter tonight (Sept. 21) 18,000 fans will bear shrieking,
swooning witness to the fastest-selling event in that venue's
history. The concert sold out in 8 minutes. Seats for Wednesday's
night's Backstreet Boys show were snapped up in 12 minutes. All
750,000 tickets for the group's 11-week, 39-city US tour sold in
under an hour _ about as fast as they can be printed.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys do, in fact, rule _ and not just in the
hearts of pre-teen girls. The wholesome, harmonizing dance-pop
quintet and a tidal wave of like-minded, like-sounding young stars
who've arrived in the Backstreet Boys' wake dominate the music
industry. Along with 'N Sync, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera,
among others, they're moving product in staggering numbers, with
striking speed, thanks to a new generation of starmaker machinery.
</P>
<P>
   While traditional career-driving forces _ radio, press, and MTV
_ are still prerequisite to mega-success, the increasing use of new
electronic media is pumping up the pace and sheer breadth of these
young artists' careers. The Internet, with its MP3 technology, is
widely hailed as a revolution in music delivery. But record
industry strategists are now recognizing the potential of the
Internet not just as a commerce opportunity, but as a powerful
promotional tool, especially with computer-savvy youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's allowed us to reach many more people at once, and in a
completely new dimension, than print media,'' says Janet Kleinbaum,
vice president of artist marketing at Jive Records, home to Spears,
the Backstreet Boys, and now 'N Sync, which left RCA this month to
join fellow teen sensations at Jive. ``The kids are on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Peeps.com, a Web site developed by the
entertainment company BMG _ which distributes Jive's music _
offered song samples of 17-year-old Spears eight months before her
debut album was released in January. During that time it collected
the names of 100,000 people who said they were interested in her
music; more than 80 percent of them bought the CD when it came out,
and Spears has since sold 6 million copies of ``. . . Baby, One
More Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears's on-line presence has increased in direct proportion to
her skyrocketing career. Britney Spears is the fifth most popular
search term on the Web, according to Searchterms.com _ ranked above
Yahoo!, chat, eBay, and porn _ and on Aug. 30, the singer launched
The Official Britney Spears Web site, www.britneyspears.com, where
fans can post photos they've taken at concerts and autograph
signings, and send an e-mail on Spears' personalized stationary.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the days when Tiger Beat magazine and
television's ``American Bandstand'' were the primary outlets for
marketing an earlier generation of teen idols.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to connect fans with a band in a way that has no
filter,'' says Steve Rennie, president of UBL (Ultimate Band List),
flagship site of the ARTISTdirect Network, one of the earliest and
most successful music sites on the Web. UBL hosted Backstreet Boys
Direct, a worldwide event on the release day of ``Millennium,'' the
Boys' second CD. The show, broadcast live over the Net from Studio
54 in New York, was hosted by a 12-year-old girl from Canada _ the
winner of UBL's contest for the best fan-built Web site dedicated
to the Backstreet Boys. Twenty other contest winners, who wrote
essays explaining why they were the biggest Backstreet Boys fans,
conducted mini-interviews with the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a million-and-a-half page views that day,'' says
Rennie, who was general manager of Epic Records before coming to
UBL. ``That's a 30 to 40 percent increase in traffic on the UBL.''
``Millennium'' sold 1,134,000 copies that week, shattering the
record for single-week sales held by Garth Brooks, and has since
sold more than 7 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a living, breathing example of fans connecting with the
band,'' Rennie said. ``They don't want to see Barbara Walters
asking the Backstreet Boys about their haircuts. When I was at
Epic, from 1994-1998, I told the marketing folks that there's
nothing crazier than a bunch of 40-year-olds trying to think like a
teen. `Go to a chat room. Let's listen and do what they want us to
do,' '' he advised, pointing up yet another facet of the Internet's
promotional potential. It's Business 101, he says. ``It's getting
in touch with the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the other significant new force driving
the teen-pop genre is the Walt Disney Co., perhaps the most
powerful purveyor of children's entertainment and commerce. In
1997, the Disney Channel began televising concert specials and
music videos geared toward kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record labels were stuck in a pattern. There were about
five program directors and one guy at MTV deciding everything,''
says Rich Ross, general manager and executive vice president of
programming and production for the Disney Channel. ``Disney went
out and said, `We're into young performers, we're into pop.' MTV
wouldn't touch 'N Sync.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks of the Disney Channel's July 18, 1998, airing
of ``'N Sync In Concert,'' the group's self-titled debut rocketed
into the Top 40 on the Billboard charts, and ultimately reached No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when MTV and the radio stations circled around,'' Ross
said. MTV now embraces the teen pop acts who were well represented
at this month's MTV Video Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney magic is limited to American bands. UKboy band Five
jumped from No. 127 to 95 to 27 on the Billboard 200 during the two
weeks following its appearance with Irish girl group BWitched on a
Disney concert special last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Channel airs four concert specials a year (LeAnn
Rimes, Brandy, and Johnny Lang are among those teen artists who
have been featured), and repeats each one an average of five to
seven times during the first month it's televised. Fans, of course,
tape the specials for unlimited viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she watches that Disney special one more time . . .''
groans Pascalina Valachi, who was reduced to tears when she won
concert tickets for her daughter, Juliana Iglesias, on MIX 98.5's
morning show giveaway. ``Her bedroom looks like a shrine,'' says
Valachi, who admits she likes the Backstreet Boys, too, but will
probably have to give up the second ticket to one of Juliana's
friends. ``You do so many things for your kids. And that song `The
Perfect Fan,' it's the most beautiful song, about what their
parents did for them. We all dance to it around the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-pop phenomenon is, indeed, a family affair. A massive
youth generation with unprecedented purchasing power is being
supported in their choice of entertainment by their parents _ an
unusual cross-generational consumer opportunity that isn't lost on
the savvy folks at Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are very concerned about what their kids are watching
and listening to,'' Ross agrees. ``Grunge and rap have been sending
hard messages. Parents look at this and support it. They're not
shouting `Turn down that noise!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The network airs approximately 30 music videos each week _ often
custom-edited by labels to meet the Disney Channel's rigorous
standards for a pre-teen audience. ``We didn't play `Livin' La Vida
Loca','' Ricky Martin's hit, Ross explains, ``and you can imagine
the pressure there. I thought it was electric, but you can't
explain to kids about pouring wax on people. There's also a woman
who's not wearing a seat belt. They edited it, but we still weren't
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Channel, like the Internet movers and shakers, is
keyed in to the fans' craving for connection with their musical
heroes. The ``Backstreet Boys In Concert'' special, which had its
world premiere on July 10, is like a fanzine come to life, chock
full of documentary footage chronicling the members real lives: the
Backstreet Boys go shopping, shoot hoops, ride horses, bowl. They
recall memories of their childhood. They reminisce about wearing
hand-me-downs before selling 27 million albums afforded them a
generous clothing allowance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first the label wanted to know why we cut the Backstreet
Boys down to eight songs,'' Ross says. ``We understand their job.
But ours is not to sell records; it's to create programming.'' The
programming does, however, sell records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a powerful marketing tool,'' Ross concedes. ``The boys
tell their stories, things like growing up as one of five kids.
Other kids are dealing with these issues. It's reality programming.
We're breaking this genre for this age group.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio surveys conducted by radio stations, however, show just
how broad the genre's appeal has become. ``The Backstreet Boys have
gone through all the demographics,'' says John Ivey, program
director for Boston radio station WXKS (KISS 108). ``The new album
is really, really good. It's got a 12- to 44-year-old demo, which
is how they can sell so many records.''
</P>
<P>
   WBMX's (98.5) morning DJ, John Lander, concurs. ``This is New
Kids On The Block to the 10th power,'' says Lander, referring to
the phenomenally successful Boston boy band of the '80s. For the
Backstreet Boys' FleetCenter shows, WBMX bought a 125-seat party
box for the station's ticket winners. ``Adult men and women
apologize for liking them, because they're a teen thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Powers, who also won a pair of tickets from MIX 98.5,
discovered the Backstreet Boys while watching a video with her
3-year-old daughter. `` `That's them, Mama,' she shouted, pointing
to the TV. So I bought her the CD, and we listen together. She and
I both like Brian the best. Her second favorite is Nick, and mine
is AJ. I'm trying to potty train her,'' Powers confesses. ``I told
her if she did it, I'd take her to the Backstreet Boys concert.''

BUSING AND BRIDGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was something fitting about Microsoft chief Bill Gates
pledging $1 billion or more for scholarships for minority students
in science, engineering, math, and education the same week that
Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. died. Their lives intersected in Boston
in the autumn of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was a Harvard sophomore the year that Garrity ordered that
Boston's neighborhood schools be abolished to end their de facto
segregation. By all accounts, the bridge-playing college student
paid attention to the world around him. There can be little doubt
that the centi-billionaire's gift to education was related to
Garrity's decision.
</P>
<P>
   When reports of Garrity's death emerged, the question arose: Was
he a figure of national prominence? The answer, of course, is yes _
but not, perhaps, in the way that he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter-century before 1974, the nation had performed
small miracles of integration, especially in the armed forces, and
consciousness of pervasive and damaging inequality was beginning to
spill over into matters of gender. Martin Luther King Jr. had
become a martyr _ and a national hero. Progress was slow but real.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, however, many citizens were weary of the the
relentless pressure to accelerate change. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
who was among the first of the neoconservatives (and one of the few
who never deserted the Democratic Party for the GOP), called for a
policy of ``benign neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Garrity's ruling, Boston's blue-collar neighborhoods
boiled over. The school population had been 51 percent white on the
eve of busing; it dropped to less than 20 percent. The total number
of public school students declined by a third as families moved to
the suburbs or sent their children to private ``academies.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly nine years, Judge Garrity managed Boston's schools
himself, until their middle-class constituency was ground to
nubbins. His willingness to all but destroy a school system in
order to save it became a metaphor, in many minds, for heavy-handed
social engineering. Mistrust of governmental purposes spilled over
into inflation, taxation, corporate governance, and all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   To oversimplify, revulsion at the Vietnam War (at one end of the
spectrum) and the spectacle of Boston's failed busing (at the
other) led within a few years to the election of Ronald Reagan in
1980 and the subsequent Turn to the Right. Reagan's administration
in turn effected a cascade of policy changes. One consequence was
an asset boom that has made Gates the richest man on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Gates's politics have held sway for 20 years, as those of
Garrity waned. His stylized view is that government is all but
superfluous, that technologies, markets, and private philanthropies
will find a way, that ``the world refuses to be governed badly.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, workers on the front lines of poverty and
discrimination long ago concluded that throwing money at problems _
full scholarships all the way through graduate school of the sort
that Gates offered science students last week _ was by itself no
solution. Students who arrive for college unprepared for its rigors
have little chance of success. Hence the widespread interest in the
``bridge'' programs that, along with affirmative action, are the
preferred remedy in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these enrichment programs for younger members of
disadvantaged communities have been under way for years. One of the
most powerful, Math-Science Squared, was developed as a summer
program in the mid-1970s at Phillips Exeter Academy. San Francisco
University High's Summerbridge program has spawned 35 similar
experiments since 1981 _ including the Citybridge program in Boston
and Cambridge, which last June celebrated its fifth anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The principle of these programs is the same: Minority kids
invest six uninterrupted weeks or so in summer school, and often
Saturday mornings and Wednesday evenings, to work with minority
teachers and staffers to build their skills. The foundation-borne
cost is $5,000 or so per pupil.
</P>
<P>
   Seed money for these programs is not the problem now. Know-how
and cadre are. Progress is slow but real. And who is to say that
the pendulum won't swing back toward collective action? That it
isn't swinging now?

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Brian Richardson and Bill Corley may be among the most
hated _ and loved _ guys in construction.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 years ago, union organizers such as Corley and
Richardson had a hard time promising steady work to the jobless
journeymen who flocked to union halls during the recession.
Desperate for a job, some union workers settled for nonunion
positions with lower pay and fewer benefits
</P>
<P>
   The tables have turned.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with promises of higher pay, better benefits, and job
security, union organizers in the construction trades are raiding
small and midsized nonunion contractors of skilled carpenters,
glaziers, drywallers, and electricians, and are offering them to
contractors who have signed union agreements. As a result, shops
are losing employees in a tough labor market where replacements are
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, called ``stripping,'' is being used by organizers
more and more these days to the chagrin of open-shop or nonunion
contractors with fast-track deadlines for residential, commercial,
or public projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tactic almost put us out of business,'' said Jim Marshall,
cofounder of Jupiter Electric in North Reading.
</P>
<P>
   In June, while working at a school in Fitchburg, 21 of
Marshall's 37 electricians, including a foreman, journeymen, and an
apprentice, walked off. The lure? Promises of more than $40 per
hour at union shop job sites in Boston instead of the $32 hourly
wage Marshall was paying electricians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people who went out to lunch and never came back,''
Marshall said bitterly. ``I also lost written plans showing what
work had been done and changes that needed to be made. One of the
workers brought the plans back, but there were delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 3 percent unemployment, there was nobody out there.
Nobody,'' he added. ``I went to the electrical contractors
association and Associated Builders and Contractors and borrowed
eight to 10 people. We pulled through it, but it cost me more than
$200,000 in overtime, mistakes, and new hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Beeman, executive director of Associated Builders and
Contractors in Burlington, which represents more than 400 nonunion
contractors, is disturbed by the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stripping has been around for a while, but it has been turned
around, stepped up a notch or two, and turned into instant
stripping,'' Beaman said. ``The difference now is that people are
pretty much leaving immediately, without notice. The pitch from the
union is, `Come in now, and we'll waive the initiation fee.' We
don't think that's a good way to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, whose union has stripped 100 top carpenters from
nonunion shops this year, concedes that a tight job market has made
stripping a more effective organizing tool. But he rebuts shop
owners' claims that the method is unethical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know of contractors who can go three months without getting
a response to an ad, so for every person we take, they have little
hope of replacing that skilled person right away,'' said
Richardson. ``Does this mean we are taking advantage of the
economy? Certainly. But we're not trying to terrorize contractors.
We're doing it because, in this economy, everybody winds up making
good money except the nonunion carpenter who's making only $11 to
$15 per hour, with no benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The carpenters union has been promising skilled workers as much
as $8,000 more per year in hourly wages, a pension annuity, health
benefits, and job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to get anybody,'' added Corley, an organizer
with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103,
which stripped Marshall of some of his most valuable workers.
``We're just offering union membership and job security, and people
are taking the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to Bill Brodie, owner of Classic Glass in Woburn. The
International Brotherhood of Painters &AMP; Allied Trades, District 35,
in Jamaica Plain, stripped three of the company's five trained
glass workers this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first to go was very skilled and had been with us a number
of years,'' said Brodie. ``He gave me notice. Then, another fellow
who had been with us about six months left. He gave me only three
days notice. The third guy gave no notice at all. That hurt. We're
small. We offer some benefits, but we can't pay the salaries a
union shop can pay. But we also charge the customer less.''
</P>
<P>
   John Laughlin, a spokesman for the painters union, said the
organization has stripped 300 workers from glazing and glassworks
companies over the past 18 months and will probably target more as
demand for workers heats up with the construction next year of
several hotels and the renovation of schools in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the union stripped a company of all of its
glaziers, forcing the firm to shut down its commercial operation
about 10 months ago. The company, Precision Glass of Charlestown,
confirmed that it has lost a significant chunk of its 25-member
staff over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training
estimates that job vacancies in the construction trades will total
20,160 by 2006. Electricians will account for at least 3,500 of
those openings.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is a strong housing market. Last year, for example,
sales of existing and new houses surged. Close to 2 million new
housing units were produced, and more than $128 million was spent
on the renovation and restoration of existing housing stock,
spurring demand for electricians, painters, paperhangers,
carpenters, precision metal workers, and plumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Employment and Training predicts that demand for skilled workers
in the trades will continue for the next six or seven years,
forecasting 3,940 vacancies for carpenters, 2,600 for painters or
paperhangers, 4,470 for precision metal workers, and 2,570 for
skilled plumbers.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the IBEW's Corley. Over the past two years,
IBEW Local 103 has stripped 256 electricians and apprentices from
nonunion commercial and industrial work sites. The union has 179
signatories to its contract, and many are clamoring for
electricians.
</P>
<P>
   But while Local 103 could have filled requests for electricians
quickly in the past, there are no idle electricians at the
Dorchester union hall anymore. The union will need 300 to 400 more
electricians to fill jobs in the Boston area next spring, not
counting work already slated to begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've got overemployment,'' said Corley. ``We went
two weeks recently without being able to fill 470 jobs at union
shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Strapped for workers, 30 nonunion contractors joined the
electricians union over the past year. ``A lot of it had to do with
the fact that we've been stealing their people and they wanted them
back,'' said Corley. ``We had one guy actually come out and say,
`We want our men back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the New England Council of Carpenters in
Boston raided a Rhode Island company doing business at Marina Bay
in Quincy of 19 of its 25 workers over a period of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with the owner and told him there was real interest in
a union,'' said Richardson, ``but he was adamant. He wanted nothing
to do with us. Finally, as demand for skilled people increased, we
took about 19 of their 25 employees. We even petitioned for (a
union) election with the National Labor Relations Board, but we
couldn't wait for an election date to be set.''

THE PIANIST 
The Extraordinary True Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw,
1939-1945 
By Wladyslaw Szpilman (translated, from the Polish, by Anthea
Bell) 
Picador, 222 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wladyslaw Szpilman was performing a Chopin recital on Polish
radio when the first German bombs fell on Warsaw, as World War II
began. Six years later, the Chopin Nocturne he played for a German
officer saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pianist'' is the diary of a season in hell. Szpilman wrote
his book almost immediately after the events in the Warsaw Ghetto
it describes, and it was swiftly suppressed by the Communist
authorities. To this day it has not been reprinted in Poland,
though the recent efforts of Szpilman's son, who lives in Germany,
have led to translations and publications in many languages.
</P>
<P>
   The first American edition unfortunately lacks the small
selection of photographs published in other countries, but the book
nevertheless leaves indelible images. ``The Pianist'' is a great
book, but one so painful that it is impossible to read more than a
few pages at a time. At the same time, cruelties and tragedies on a
scale impossible to comprehend are somehow mitigated by small acts
of human solidarity, which arrive unexpectedly _ ordinary but
radiant.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, Szpilman had studied piano with Arthur Schnabel and
composition with Franz Schrecker before returning to Warsaw to
become a staff pianist for Polish Radio. Once the war began, he
survived for a time by playing in ghetto cafes, some catering to
the intelligentsia, others to wealthy and heedless profiteers.
Szpilman's work supported his family _ his mother, who struggled to
keep up appearances; his father, who played the violin for hours,
``his way of closing the door behind him and returning to that
other world of music, where he was happiest.'' There were two
sisters, the lawyer Regina and the silent Halina. ``I can't say
what she was really like, and now I can never find out any more
about her,'' Szpilman writes, as a matter of fact, but with
ineffable poignancy. And there was a brother who carried an Oxford
edition of Shakespeare with him on the cattle car to Treblinka.
</P>
<P>
   Szpilman and his family were rounded up for ``resettlement.'' In
the trainyard, they scraped together the last of their small
change, and Szpilman's father brought a creme caramel, which he
carefully cut into six parts with his penknife; this was the
family's last meal together.
</P>
<P>
   Szpilman himself was pulled free at the last moment by one of
the hated Jewish police who collaborated with the SS. He survived,
working on labor details in the ghetto; later he escaped into the
Aryan section of Warsaw, where he was hidden and protected by
musicians and music lovers who knew that to shelter a Jew meant not
only their own lives but the lives of their families. Szpilman was
frequently hungry, even starving; sometimes freezing in the winter
cold; always in extreme danger. He contemplated and attempted
suicide. Nearly delirious, he concentrated on mentally practicing
his entire repertory and reviewing lessons in conversational
English. In a bombed-out building, where he was living in the
remains of the attic, he was discovered by a German officer, who
asked him to play something, and Szpilman responded with the Chopin
Nocturne. The officer _ Wilm Hosenfeld, though Szpilman did not
know the name at the time _ brought him food, a coat, an eiderdown,
and found him a place of greater shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Szpilman survived, returned to Polish Radio as its head, wrote
popular songs, and played chamber music; his recital partners
included the violinists Bronislav Gimpel, Henryk Szeryng, Ida
Haendel, and Roman Totenberg. Hosenfeld was not as fortunate: He
perished in a Soviet labor camp in 1952, despite the efforts
Szpilman and other Poles made to rescue the man who had saved them.
``The Pianist'' appears in English with a supplement of excerpts
from Hosenfeld's diary, preserved and cherished by his family.
``Why did this war have to happen at all?'' asks Hosenfeld, a
devout Catholic, in September 1942. ``Because humanity had to be
shown where its godlessness was taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pianist'' is not a literary work, and Szpilman does little
to dramatize events, though he is always alert to irony. The German
poet Wolf Biermann, who contributes an afterword, says the book was
``written in deep shock,'' and it often seems as if Szpilman were
writing about some other person than himself. In Polish, the book
was called ``Death of a City,'' and Szpilman's beloved Warsaw is
one of its principal characters. The book does seem like a kind of
murmured, mumbled exorcism, but there is also an intense quality of
vision and hearing in it. As Szpliman ran down the empty streets
after glimpsing his family for the last time, he was ``pursued by
the fading cries of the people shut up on those trucks. It sounded
like the twittering of caged birds in deadly peril.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why the authorities suppressed ``The
Pianist.'' Qualities of character do not tidily sort themselves
along national, religious, or ethnic lines the way they do in the
movies; the book is full of things that members of groups do not
want to be reminded of, but which every individual needs to hear
and heed.

CARNIVAL TRIUMPH: BIG IN SIZE _ AND FUN, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Carnival Triumph, one of the largest ships afloat, is part
of the Fun fleet of the ever-growing Carnival Cruise Line.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival is so sure you'll have fun that it has trademarked its
slogan, the Fun Ships.
</P>
<P>
   We sail out of New York City on a beautiful August day, admiring
the skyline, paying homage to the Statue of Liberty as we pass her,
then sailing under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, heading north to
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of this four-day itinerary is that you can enjoy
everything there is on a ship, visit a foreign land, and yet easily
work your trip into any schedule. For many, time to get away is
hard to find. Carnival has found its newly expanded short cruise
schedule very popular. And next year the line will also offer
three- to five-day sailings to Canada out of Boston aboard the
Triumph's sister ship, the Carnival Destiny.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here we are on one of the newest ships in the world (its first
sailing was July 27 after leaving the Italian shipyard where it was
built), and are we having fun? Not so surprisingly, yes. It's hard
not to be happy, passing by that magnificent skyline, with lively
music on deck and a party atmosphere all around. All my cares and
concerns were left back on Pier 88.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnival Triumph is in a small group of super magaliners in
the 100,000-plus-ton class. Right now there are only three vessels
in the class, but both Carnival and Princess have more ships this
size on order. These will remain the largest cruise ships in the
world until November when Royal Caribbean introduces the Voyager of
the Seas at 142,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of sailing on such a large vessel with all those
people (the Triumph carries 2,758 passengers, up to 3,473 if all
the upper berths in staterooms are utilized) is horrifying to many
a landlubber. But on the Triumph I encounter few crowds or lines _
mostly at the start of a meal service or along the promenade deck
just as a dinner or show ends.
</P>
<P>
   And, should I feel like escaping, I head back to my stateroom.
It is spacious, nothing plush but comfortably laid out with room
for all my belongings, a place to sit, television, a roomy bath,
and, one of the nicest features the new ships offer, a private
balcony where I can enjoy my room-service coffee, read, or just
relax. One morning I spent the longest time watching a small bird
flying nine decks below me along the water line _ where did that
bird come from? Where was it going? And how long can it keep up
with the ship?
</P>
<P>
   Like all Carnival ships, the Triumph comes with a theme. Aboard
this ship it is the world.
</P>
<P>
   And this is an international cruise. The diversity aboard this
ship is amazing. No Caribbean cruise I've been on has had such a
diversity of passengers aboard _ there is the blending of races,
cultures, and ages. There are partying singles, and groups of
families. Taking a short cruise out of New York is truly an
experience in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The world theme is found throughout the public areas of the
ship. There is Tokyo Underground, a labyrinth of high-tech video
grames. It's next door to the disco, and next to the casino is the
Olympic bar, where sports are projected on multiple TVs and the
walls bear witness to past Olympics. The piano bar's walls and
ceiling, meanwhile, are covered with oyster shells from New
Orleans. The library, a nice quiet spot, is named for Washington,
the lavish theater for Rome, and the dining rooms for London and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain about a Carnival ship: You know you're not
at home. The creativity behind these themes is the result of one
designer, Joe Farcus, who's been doing Carnival ships since day one
_ and that's a lot of ships, with even more on the drawing boards.
It's difficult to catch all the many nuances of Farcus's work, but
Carnival is solving that by adding a short video, shown in
staterooms, featuring Farcus explaining his theme for the Triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival promises fun at sea, offering activities that go from
early morning to early the next morning, long after most other
cruise lines have tucked their guests into bed.
</P>
<P>
   With each new ship, Carnival seems to be evolving and improving.
While the Triumph is similar to the Destiny, the line has managed
to carve out more deck space for the new ship and added staterooms
without affecting the overall spaciousness of the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Even the food service is enhanced. We are quite pleased with the
food and service in the dining room, but are also impressed with
the other dining options. Atop the ship is the South Beach Club, a
casual buffet-style dining area. Here one can enjoy not only
breakfast or lunch, but also have a casual alternative to evening
dining _ no dressing up needed here. (Some fellow passengers,
however, complained that the offerings were not so tempting.)
Adjacent to the South Beach are the Hong Kong Noodle Company and,
opposite it, the N.Y. Deli, serving Asian treats and great
sandwiches. The deli is open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Deckside, there are
hamburgers and hot dogs and 24-hours-a-day pizza service. For late
risers, there's even breakfast service on deck until noon. And, of
course, there's cabin service.
</P>
<P>
   While food is never a problem on a cruise ship, Carnival caters
to all tastes. Each meal calls for hard decisions because the
choices are all tempting _ one night included ziti with Italian
sausage, a catch of the day, sweet and sour shrimp, grilled
boneless chicken breasts, rack of New Zealand lamb Dijonnaise, or
grilled, aged New York sirloin steak. Vegetarian dishes are
available at dinner _ perhaps a Madras-style vegetable curry or
vegetable fajitas _ and deckside. If you're watching your diet, a
daily Nautica Selection is lower in fat, sodium, etc.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of room deckside for sunning, jogging, or
walking, and the pools are heavily used as are the hot tubs. There
seems to be a constant line to use the giant water slide. Deck and
pool games are also held throughout the cruise. As we near Nova
Scotia, the sunny day turns foggy, and all but the hardy head
inside, away from continuous blowing of the foghorn.
</P>
<P>
   But the fun doesn't end. There are games, bingo, casino
tournaments, horse racing, karaoke, a lavish spa, a huge fitness
center overlooking the ocean, game shows, ice carvings, and dance
classes. I am surprised by the number of people learning to fold
napkins or create animal shapes out of towels, just like the cabin
stewards leave in the rooms. There is also a large children's area
on the ship and supervised programs.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment ranges from cabin movies to shows on deck, in the
lounges, a lively piano bar in the Big Easy Bar, lavish Las Vegas
style shows, and comedy (one late-night show was rated R). There
are duty-free shops, art auctions, and a tuxedo rental shop.
</P>
<P>
   While the ship does offer almost nonstop activities, there are
plenty of places to just relax, ranging from the World's Way
Promenade where a delightful Vienna Cafe offers pastries and
coffees to the California Wine Bar to lounges for listening to jazz
or for dancing. I enjoyed meeting friends for a before-dinner drink
in the Oxford Bar with its feel of an old English library, deep,
comfortable chairs, and live classical music.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnival Triumph may not be for everyone, especially for
those who don't like ships with a whole lot of passengers, but it
does offer a world of choices and a vacation that will be
remembered.

DISNEY WONDER: SMOOTH SAILING FOR ALL AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Disney Wonder is the second of two ships from the Disney
Cruise Line. The first, the Disney Magic, arrived last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder and magic is what a Disney cruise is all about.
</P>
<P>
   From Cape Canaveral, we set sail on a four-day adventure that
would take us to Nassau and Disney's own private isle, Castaway
Cay. It's an easy sail, not that great a distance, so Captain Henry
Anderson could take it easy throughout this cruise, providing one
of the smoothest sailings in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has learned a lot since taking to the seas last year.
Then the only way to book a Disney cruise was to take a seven-day
package that included a three- or four-day stay at Disney World
with a three- or four-day cruise, for what Disney called a seamless
vacation. The same credit-card-sized identification issued for your
hotel room at Disney World would also be your stateroom key aboard
ship. With the card you could charge purchases both on land and
sea, and also use it for identification for exiting and boarding
the ship. Now the option of just taking a three- or four-day cruise
is available.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has learned that the name ``Disney'' alone
doesn't guarantee a smooth sailing. Since the Magic's inaugural,
Disney has added a cruise director and a hotel manager, and these
staff additions are noticeable in the way the ship operates.
</P>
<P>
   The Wonder is almost a twin of the Magic; even the naming of all
the rooms is similar. The only differences I detected were the
renaming of one dining room and one lounge, along with an Art
Noveau look rather than the Art Deco of the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Disney does work its magic into these ships, providing countless
hours of pleasure. But we wondered if the Wonder could keep two
mature people happy sans kids. Our four are all grown up and off on
adventures of their own. When they were younger we would always
take them on a cruise with us. The difference between cruising with
kids then and now is amazing. As children, ours would have loved
this ship. But would we find happiness without them, and maybe
surrounded by hordes of other children.
</P>
<P>
   We should never have been concerned. If you have children, bring
them; this is the ship for families (other cruise lines have very
good children's programs, but the Disney touch is a plus). If you
don't have kids to bring, come anyway. This ship caters to you. In
its short existence, the Disney Cruise Line is being credited with
introducing thousands of vacationers to the pleasures of cruising;
most passengers on this and other Disney cruises are first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Wonder looks the way a cruise ship should. It has the
lines of a great ocean liner, not the boxy, top-heavy look of many
a modern cruise ship. It is spacious and well laid out. It has
areas just for kids, others just for adults. Further separating it
from other cruise ships is the fact that it doesn't have a casino.
(If you need gambling and want to feel the pull of slot machines,
take the four-day cruise, which includes a long stay into the wee
hours of the morning in Nassau. Disney has shore packages to
Atlantis, a resort that has to be seen to be believed, with a
mammoth casino.)
</P>
<P>
   For families, there are huge areas of the Wonder devoted to the
fine art of entertaining and caring for youngsters of all ages.
Disney has programs for the 3-to-8 set, another for those 9-12.
When children are checked into the program, parents are provided a
beeper for the length of the cruise in order to stay in touch with
the youngsters. This lets parents enjoy themselves, be in touch
with the children, and never be very far away should they be
needed. Even teenagers can find happiness. Teens on ships, as we
discovered long ago, don't like organized onboard programs; they're
too grown up for that. So Disney offers them their own lounge. No
adults _ and certainly no parents _ may enter.
</P>
<P>
   The Wonder is listed at 83,000 tons and carries 1,750 passengers
(2,400 maximum). Our stateroom was spacious, with a sitting area
featuring a couch that can be made into a bed. There was a TV with
a wide variety of programming, including classic and Disney films _
but no schedule to let you know what's on _ and a refrigerator. We
had a private deck (73 percent of the rooms on the ship are
outside, with 44 percent of those having a deck), which we enjoyed.
Our bathrooms got a mixed reaction. The staterooms come with two
bathrooms _ one with toilet and sink, the other with shower and
sink. While this can be handy for families, it creates two rather
tight rooms. The staterooms also offer a hair dryer, personal safe,
and 24-hour dining service.
</P>
<P>
   While the ship is designed for families, adults sans kids find
more than enough to do and enjoy. There are ``quiet'' areas on deck
and within the ship just for the big people. While there were lots
of children on board this cruise, the little people did not seem to
take over the ship. It was fun to see occasional groups of kids on
a scavenger hunt, or attending an autograph session with their
favorite Disney characters in the main atrium. We even stood in
line to have our picture taken with Minnie, my wife's favorite
mouse. Mary Beth is much happier now that Minnie has more of a role
in the Disney world (before she would complain when Mickey's
birthday was recognized, but not Minnie's, which is on the same
day; all she got to do was serve the cake for Mickey).
</P>
<P>
   For adults, the ship offers a nighttime entertainment district
with three clubs: The Cadillac Lounge, with deep comfortable chairs
for relaxing before or after a show, and the wonderful music of Joy
Wright; WaveBands, with music from country to rock; and Barrel of
Laughs, where talented improvisational comics provide lots of fun.
There's also the Promenade Lounge, a nice place to meet for a drink
or to enjoy a dance. For the sports fans, there's the ESPN Skybox,
hidden in one of the smokestacks, where you can keep up with the
latest action on the fields and courts. Studio Sea has a variety of
entertainment for the whole family. First-run films are shown in
the Buena Vista Theatre, where we caught ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Theatre is a large and lavish showroom featuring
full-scale theatrical productions with good story lines, music,
theatrics, and performers. One show is built around ``Hercules,''
another the sailing of a ghost ship, and another the music of
Disney. All are a refreshing change from the traditional
song-and-dance numbers of other lines.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about taking a cruise is deciding what to do
among the choices provided. And Disney doesn't make it easy,
providing a full plate of fun things. The ship is a very relaxed
one and casual. I wore a jacket only one night.
</P>
<P>
   Another area where Disney shines is in its food service _ a vast
improvement from my first experience on the Magic. The Wonder has
three dining rooms, and guests get to eat in each one during the
cruise. Even the waitstaff moves with you, which is nice. The
setting and the menu may be different, but the staff is the same,
anticipating your likes and dislikes. Our waitresses _ one French,
the other Swedish (more than 60 nationalities are on board) _ were
young, knowledgeable, and friendly. A fourth dining room, Palo, a
gourmet's delight, is available by reservation only, and only for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The ship also has a Beach Blanket Buffet for breakfast and lunch
with seating indoors or out. On deck there are places for hot dogs,
hamburgers, pizza, and ice cream. You won't go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has a large deck area with three pools, one just for
adults, along with a sports area for basketball or volleyball. The
ship's workout area is small but well equipped. Its Vista Spa &AMP;
Salon, however, is large with a variety of ``treatments,'' from
facials and massages, to an interesting Surial Bath. We tried the
bath ($60 per couple), which offers three medicinal muds. You apply
the muds to one another, then relax in the steam room while the
minerals are absorbed, and finally shower. A mud and mineral bath
for two: Was it invigorating? Well, let's say it was interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Trying new experiences is what a cruise is all about. How often
do you indulge in a spa treatment? Or have a whole evening trying
out new clubs and hearing different sounds of music? Taking in a
movie or show? Or meeting new friends? Or trying new culinary
treats? And all this without a care or an extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   While the ship provides just about everything one could desire
in a cruise, Disney's private Bahamas isle, Castaway Cay, is a star
attraction on its own. It's the only private isle for a cruise line
where the ship docks. Thus there is no getting into small boats to
tender in _ just step off the gangway and you're there. The island
offers lots of water sports and activities from snorkeling to
kayaking. There are beaches for families, for teens, and just for
adults. You'll also find a supervised play area for the kids,
beachside massages, music, games, and a large barbecue (OK, but I
expected grilled, not steamed, hot dogs, and hamburgers just off
the grill _ not looking as though they had been sitting around for
a while).
</P>
<P>
   Most people book the cruise along with a stay at Disney World.
For those, Disney promises a ``seamless'' vacation between land and
sea. These vacations begin at Disney World, about an hour's drive
from Port Canaveral, at one's choice of accommodations _ from
modest to lavish. Upon checking in, guests receive a card that
serves as a room key for both the hotel and ship, as a credit card
for all purchases, and as identification for going on and off the
ship. After the three- or four-day stay at Disney World, guests are
bused to the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day cruise portion includes a day in Nassau, as well as
a day at Castaway Cay and a day at sea.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great family cruise, and for those who haven't cruised,
the Disney Wonder is a great introduction to cruising.

HALIFAX: A PORT WORTH VISITING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the constantly expanding cruise-line fleets, new ports are
being sought. Cities such as Galveston, New Orleans, Charleston,
Philadelphia, and Newport News are becoming home ports for some
lines for part or all the year. Boston is fast becoming not only a
favorite port of call for lines, but also the starting point for
many sailings.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend the newest star in Norwegian Cruise Lines' fleet,
the Norwegian Sky, begins its maiden voyages with cruises along the
New England and Canadian coasts. For the last few years the line's
Norwegian Majesty has been sailing a seasonal schedule of weekly
trips to Bermuda from Boston. Next May, Carnival Cruise Lines will
offer sailings out of Boston to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Sailings to Canada from Boston and New York are becoming
increasingly popular. And Halifax, Nova Scotia, is one of the most
popular destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Halifax is a great city to visit any year, but this year is
special because the city marks its 250th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   For cruise passengers on a short visit, the city is easy to get
around. Downtown is within walking distance of the cruise port.
There's a lively pub atmosphere, even a casino, history galore, and
some great values because the US dollar is still strong _ worth up
to $1.50 Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to nearby Peggy's Cove is popular. . After all, it's one
of the prettiest places along the coast _ a tiny village with a
picturesque lighthouse and rocky shore. A lobster boil or salmon
bake is available there.
</P>
<P>
   While trips to Peggy's Cove or the fishing village of Lunenburg
are nice, as is driving the Evangeline Trail, Halifax itself has
more than enough to see and do in a short stay.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Titanic. The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic has a
wonderful exhibit on this famed ship; it was to Halifax that ships
brought both survivors and the dead. Items from the Titanic,
including a large piece of wood paneling, are on view. A replica of
the paneling was used in the final scenes of the film when Kate
clung to it, awaiting rescue. Also in Halifax are cemeteries where
the victims were buried.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also has a gripping exhibit on the Halifax explosion.
In 1917 a ship loaded with munitions exploded in the harbor, with a
force that was said to be the largest and most destructive until
the atomic age. The toll on Halifax was devastating: Thousands were
killed or injured, and homes and businesses were destroyed. Boston
played a major role in helping the city to recover, and to this day
the people of Nova Scotia send a Christmas tree as a thank you. The
tree can be found at Boston's Prudential Center each December.
</P>
<P>
   The ships dock at Pier 21, Canada's Ellis Island, an immigration
center where millions arrived from foreign lands for their new
homeland. Even if you don't have Canadian roots, this is a moving
place to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Halifax: a small city with a lot to offer on even the briefest
visit.
</P>
<P>

Ice skating
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may be in the tropics, but on the Voyager of the Seas you
can not only go ice skating but catch a skating show. The newest
and largest cruise ship in the world, Voyager of the Seas will
begin sailing in November on seven-day Caribbean cruises. It will
be a ship filled with innovative cruise ideas, including a 900-seat
skating rink. The Royal Caribbean International ship's rink will be
featured on an NBC-TV skating special this November with stars
Katarina Witt, Todd Eldredge, and Brian Orser. Other Voyager
features include a climbing wall and a nine-hole putting green.

   The MS Deutschland, one of the newest luxury vessels in the

vessel of Peter Deilmann Ocean Cruises will soon begin a series of
Grand Hotel Voyages. From November through March, the 505-passenger
ship will visit Thailand, Malaysia, Java, Bali, Borneo, Singapore,
Vietnam, Hong Kong, the Philippines, India, and Egypt. The 13- and
18-night cruises will offer free air fare from 37 US gateways to
the ship. Fares begin at $4,370 a person. The Deutschland is
designed to recall the splendor of the Edwardian period and the
1920s in its interior design, decoration, and art works. The ship
is quite spacious and offers three restaurants and bars, a
ballroom, cafe, indoor and outdoor pools, sun decks, shops,
theater, fitness, beauty salon, sauna, and infirmary with a
dialysis center. Travel agents have details or call 800-348-8287.

consistent with all our existing programs,'' said Franck Del Rio, a
Renaissance vice president. The line is also unusual in that it
sells its cruises directly to travelers, rather than through travel
agents. The cruises also offer great value. For example, a Greek
island cruise (January through March) costs from $1,499 a person
for an inside cabin, and includes round-trip air fare from New
York, a five-day cruise, and a four-night hotel package; balcony
cabins begin at $1,799. There are also discounts for those booking
through AARP. For information, call 800-525-5350 or, on the Web,

RUSSIAN FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON -- ``I am optimistic,'' beamed the big-shot
American in Moscow a year ago. ``I believe Russia is going to
thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   That gusher was not from President Clinton. Nor was it his veep,
contrary to the tone of politicians who are suggesting that Al Gore
is to blame for all that is wrong in Russia because of his secret
leadership of the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   It was from George Bush, the father and former president. The
good friend of Russian democracy (and Boris Yeltsin) had been
rented for a reported 100 grand by Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs
to help open the investment bank's Moscow office, out of which it
was feeding Russia's dangerously desperate appetite for debt. Heck,
for that kind of dough, I'd be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Bush glowed for Goldman, the Russian stock market
had tanked, interest rates were pushing three digits, and the ruble
devaluation, official debt default, and financial crisis were 60
days away.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was hardly unique. You wouldn't have to look far to
find wishes outrunning common sense in the words of all kinds of
American big shots in the 1990s, Clinton and Gore included. And
their wishful thinking led to classic political denial that
corruption and mismanagement were nearly wrecking the inevitably
painful change from communism to democracy, occasional quotes to
the contrary notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Russia has been made a political football in the wake
of a possibly unrelated scandal involving the movement of more than
$4 billion of probably hot money through the Bank of New York,
those nonexperts might consider a few facts.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting involves the response of Congress so far
this session to the issue of US aid to Russia, which has been
outrageous. From the headlines and the politicians' talk, you'd
think it was either going right into Yeltsin family pockets, the
Mafia's, or shady Russian financiers'.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Most of the dollars go for a successful effort to help
the Russians dismantle much of their nuclear weapons stash and keep
the rest of it adequately secure. In the last seven years, 5,000
warheads have been defused, three former Soviet republics are out
of the business altogether, security has been maintained at more
than 100 storage sites, 60 tons of enriched uranium have been
purchased, and thousands of redundant nuclear workers have gone
civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the dollars have gone to nongovernment and
local organizations to assist the country's fledgling democracy _
everything from helping finance the infrastructure of elections to
bringing 40,000 Russians here on short-term study projects, to
helping 250,000 small businessmen to aiding new trade unions and
regional TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   You might also think tens of billions of dollars have been
flushed down the toilet. In fact, $847 million will be spent this
year. President Clinton has proposed raising the amount to an even
billion, but the House is considering $725 million and the Senate
is moving toward $780 million. In other words, after a blizzard of
politics about Russia, the Republican leadership is responding by
cutting the efforts that actually work and have huge security
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Still another politically nourished misconception is that there
are suspicions, or worse, that loans furnished by the International
Monetary Fund with US support have been diverted or stolen and are
somehow linked to the suspected money laundering. For the record,
none of these ``suspicions'' has been accompanied by an iota of
evidence, and there is more than a shred to the contrary,
especially a Pricewaterhouse-Coopers audit of a key loan of nearly
$5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the life of me, I can't figure out how the people losing
their heads over the issue on Capitol Hill (from Jesse Helms on
down, or is it up?) could think corruption. Under the IMF's Russian
program ($20 billion thus far), the only purpose of a loan is to
help Russia repay earlier IMF loans (the country's debt burden is
crushing enough as is). To do that, loan proceeds are shifted from
one IMF account to another at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
Yorkwithout ever passing into the Russian banking network.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, release of the next installment of the IMF's
commitment is likely to be delayed pending further investigations _
and properly so. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last week
read the Yeltsin regime the riot act on corruption. It was an
overdue message in terms of its stark clarity and especially
powerful coming from the Clinton administration official with the
least romantic view of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright was just as properly adamant about pushing forward
and scorning those who would waste resources playing games over who
``lost'' a country whose transition will still be occurring 50
years hence.
</P>
<P>
   As she put it,``Russia is not a wallet or a set of keys that can
be misplaced. It is a nation of almost 150 million people that has
for more than three centuries been among the world's major powers.
The suggestion made by some that Russia is ours to lose is
arrogant; the suggestion that Russia is lost is simply wrong.''

ISRAEL TRIPS POSSIBLE FOR ALL JEWISH YOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most ambitious programs of discovery has just been
launched by Birthright Israel, a worldwide initiative to provide a
first Israel experience for every Jewish young person age 15-26.
</P>
<P>
   Birthright Israel provides round-trip transportation to Israel
from designated cities and the first 10 days of programming. The
program, which begins in November, is open to all Jewish youth
18-26 (high school student trips will begin in 2001) in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is the most far-reaching philanthropic effort
ever undertaken by the Jewish community,'' said Michael Papo,
executive vice president of Birthright Israel. ``The Birthright
Israel gift will make Israel accessible to every Jewish youth
regardless of his or her affiliation, nationality, or economic
status.'' Papo said statistics have shown that Jewish youth who
visit Israel at a young age are more likely to retain ties to the
Jewish community, and by introducing them to their heritage and the
culture of the modern state of Israel, they can discover their past
and begin building their Jewish future.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available by calling 888-99-ISRAEL or, on the
Web, visiting www.israelexperience.org.
</P>
<P>
   Birthright Israel was created by funding from philanthropists
Charles R. Bronfman and Michael H. Steinhardt and contributions
from the Jewish community, the state of Israel. Bronfman is
cochairman of the Seagram Co. and Steinhardt, a highly successful
Wall Street fund manger, retired in 1995 to devote his time to
Jewish causes.

Need a Boxster? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From now through March 31, visitors to Great Britain can rent a
Porsche Boxster for four days at a savings of 20 percent through
Avis Prestige Cars. The special rate is about $1,165 and includes
unlimited mileage and all insurance. Also available is the Porsche
911 Cabriolet and coupe. Avis Prestige Cars, based in London,
guarantees a specific car and model within 24 hours of the original
request. Cars can be delivered to any central London hotel. For

SAYING `I DO' AT SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some have been young, others haven't. Some have shown up in
beachwear, others in tuxedos. But all have this in common: They
were married at sea aboard the Grand Princess mega cruise ship.
Since such ceremonies _ the first of their kind in modern times _
were initiated aboard the ship in June 1998, some 117 couples have
said ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The line's program allows couples to be legally married by the
ship's captain in Hearts and Minds, the first and only wedding
chapel at sea. (When launched this November, Royal Caribbean's
Voyager of the Seas will have a wedding chapel, but like many other
vessels will allow marriages aboard only in port.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's the who, what, and ``wear'' of Grand Princess weddings:
</P>
<P>
   --The youngest couple were ages 19 (bride) and 22; the oldest
couple were 76 (bride) and 77.
</P>
<P>
   --Surprisingly, the majority of couples were from Canada. Within
the United States, most couples were from Florida and California.
Other brides and grooms have been from Japan, Australia, and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   --About 60 percent of couples were marrying for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   --Beachwear was the most unusual attire. Most couples wore
traditional wedding attire (suits/tuxedos and gowns).
</P>
<P>
   --Mendelssohn's ``Wedding March'' from ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' was the most requested song. And ``Twelfth Night'' by
Olivia Newton-John was one of the more uncommon choices.
</P>
<P>
   --The largest wedding was held last March when 100 passengers,
including 13 attendants, celebrated the nuptials of a Michigan
couple. (The newlyweds were also the youngest wedded couple
referred to earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   --It's not for nothing that the Princess fleet is known
collectively as ``The Love Boat.'' One couple got engaged on Sun
Princess and married exactly one year later during Grand Princess's
Valentine's sailing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nice things about marrying on this ship is that
romantic honeymoon destinations come with the trip. In summer, the
Grand Princess plies the western Mediterranean, and in the fall,
winter, and spring, the eastern Caribbean. Wedding packages begin
at $1,400 and include fees for the ceremony, registration, and an
official marriage certificate. All reception packages include
music, hors d'oeuvres, beverages, and a three-tiered cake. The
one-hour parties for up to 80 guests begin at $70 per person. For
more information about Princess's wedding program, call
800-421-1700. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of the Grand Princess: When the ship sailed into
Istanbul last month, it was carrying a contribution of $83,629 for
Turkey's earthquake victims. The cruise line donated $50,000, and
passengers and crew gave the rest. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What did the letters ``RMS'' stand for in the RMS
Titanic? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Farewell to Nova Scotia, the seabound coast! Let your
mountains dark and dreary be. For when I am far away on the briny
ocean tossed, will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?'' _
``The Nova Scotia Song,'' sung best by Ian and Sylvia. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Princess Cruises calls its bartenders ``bartisans.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: It is illegal to get a fish drunk in Ohio. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wired: The new MS Norwegian Sky, which was to visit Boston's Black
Falcon Terminal this weekend, has an Internet Cafe that offers
access to AOL and other Internet sites for a mere 33 cents a
minute. Internet access is also available in all cabins for the
same rate, and 10 laptops are available to rent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
That's some aquarium: Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which
will replace the Grand Princess as the world's largest cruise ship
in November, has a unique lounge called the Aquarium Bar. In it,
there are over 56 tons of salt water, hundreds of exotically
colored tropical fish, and aquariums valued at more than $1

DOGGED PURSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Globe has announced the October launch of an early edition
of the Sunday paper, to be sold at retail outlets on Saturdays. In
the industry, this early edition is known as a bulldog _ to the
ongoing puzzlement of the very journalists who use the word.
Conjectures abound, but nobody can say for sure where the bulldog
got its name.
</P>
<P>
   What do we know? Well, bulldog edition is an American term,
probably coined around the turn of the century; its first citation
in the Oxford English Dictionary is dated 1926 _ it's a quote from
The Nation magazine _ but as insider jargon it might well have
escaped official notice for its first few decades of existence. A
bulldog isn't necessarily a Sunday paper, but any early,
hot-off-the-presses edition; in the '80s, the Centre Daily Times in
State College, Pa., published a weekday bulldog as a way to ease
its transition from afternoon to morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   But why bulldog? Here are some of the guesses, educated and
otherwise:
</P>
<P>
   --The dueling-papers theory. The term bulldog edition ``probably
originated in the 1890s, when the New York World and other morning
newspapers published early editions to catch the mail trains and
the newspapers fought like bulldogs to make their deadlines,'' says
Webster's New World Dictionary of Media and Communications, among
other sources.
</P>
<P>
   --The dueling-newsboys theory: A variation on the theme has it
that the kids who sold the papers were the ones duking it out. ``It
being the first edition, newsboys fought for first papers like
bulldogs,'' proposed Charley Stough of the Dayton Daily News in an
on-line etymological discussion. In the variant passed along by Jim
Howley, director of the Globe's fleet of delivery trucks, the
newsboys were fighting not for papers but for the prime
street-corner selling locations.
</P>
<P>
   --The Hearst theory. ``I had always heard that bulldog was
coined by W.R. Hearst who wanted his first editions to have grabber
headlines and `bite like a bulldog,' '' wrote Saul Daniels in the
abovementioned on-line discussion
(nyu.edu/projects/jhistory/jhist.95/).
</P>
<P>
   --The ugly-as-a-bulldog theory. Nobody I know remembers that
typographical errors were once called bulls, but it's part of
newspaper lore, and it inspires yet another explanation: That the
early edition, composed in haste, was full of bulls, or typos. Or
even, submits Stough, that the first edition was ``the ugliest in
terms of type alignment, inking, etc., hence . . . bulldog ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Mack-truck theory. This one _ brought back by a colleague
after an official visit to some bulldog-savvy newspapers in other
cities _ holds that the bulldog edition got its name from the Mack
trucks that delivered papers from the plant to the waiting
newsboys. The Mack's bulldog logo and hood ornament seem just the
thing to capture the imagination of the young hawkers _ you can
almost hear them shouting to each other, ``Here comes the
bulldog!''
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks to this picturesque hypothesis, though. For
one thing, Mack trucks didn't get their ``bulldog'' nickname till
World War I, according to the official Mack history. The company's
version, available on its Web site (go to ``Corporate Information''
at www.macktrucks.com), says English soldiers gave the AC Mack
truck its bulldog moniker _ both for its snub-nosed profile and
because the bulldog was a beloved symbol of British tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   But if this is the source of the newspaper jargon, bulldog
editions couldn't have been part of the New York's 1890s newspaper
wars. The bulldog logo wasn't adopted till 1922, at first as a
nameplate on the door (it showed a bulldog chewing up a volume
labeled ``Hauling Costs''); not till 1932 did the patented bulldog
become a hood ornament.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mack trucks were bought by some newspapers,
according to Sharon Shuman at the Mack museum. The Morning Call of
Allentown, Pa. (Mack's headquarters), bought one, and ``during
1923-24, several AB model trucks and at least one AC model truck
went to Boston to the Hotel &AMP; Railroad News Company,'' she reports.
</P>
<P>
   The search goes on. For instance, there may be clues in the 1936
film ``Bulldog Edition,'' directed by Charles Lamont (of ``Ma and
Pa Kettle Go to Town,'' ``Abbott and Costello go to Mars,'' etc.).
It's a rough tale, says the on-line video vendor, of ``Newspaper
wars! One paper engages gangsters to sabotage the success of the
other.'' (Do they slash the tires of the Mack delivery trucks?)
</P>
<P>
   All the current etymological proposals have advantages and
drawbacks _ and, probably, adherents who are absolutely sure
they're right. But with so many missing links in the chains of
evidence, nobody can say which is most likely. The truth is out
there, all right _ we just don't yet know where.

BRADLEY SLOW TO REACH OUT TO SOUTH'S BLACK ELECTORATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Bradley's passion for improving race relations in
America, a signature issue in his presidential campaign, should
have a home in a thriving black middle-class city like this, flush
with memories of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his
struggle for racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   But every time black voters here look around, Al Gore's in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has been here many times,'' said Randy Willis, a
43-year-old chiropractor, as he waited for friends to finish
touring a museum that chronicles King's life. ``Bradley? I really
don't know much about him except that he was a ball player at one
time.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has courted black voters with intensity, Bradley has
yet to take his message south, to the heartland of the black
electorate. Polls consistently show him getting clobbered among
black voters nationally, and, in a recent Zogby International poll,
Gore held a 71-to-10 percent advantage over Bradley among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say Bradley can't expect to compete with Gore
without going where more than 55 percent of the African-American
population lives and votes _ an increasingly active constituency
that may determine who wins the South and goes on to claim the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bradley is a serious alternative to Gore, you have to ask
then, what is your southern strategy?'' said David Bositis, a
senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, a black think-tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The answer from the Bradley campaign: Give us time.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Dunn, a spokewoman for the Bradley campaign, acknowledged
the obvious that Bradley had not focused on the south so much as
Iowa and New Hampshire, the first-caucus and first-primary states.
But she said that is the result of the bunched primary schedule
which places the early emphasis on California, Iowa and the
northeast. Bradley, she said, would begin campaigning in the South
``as we move forward in the primary calendar. It's going to be very
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The first real test of Bradley and Gore's strength among blacks
will take place here in Georgia, which is scheduled to be the first
southern state to hold a primary, along with Maryland, six months
from now, in a precursor to the real southern showdown a week later
on Super Tuesday, March 14. In Georgia, African-American voters
make up at least 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote, but the
vote has risen as high as 50 percent in various elections.
</P>
<P>
   After black voters showed surprising strength last year, helping
the Democrats cut into the GOP's majority in the House of
Representatives in the November midterm elections, even some
Republican candidates _ most notably millionaire publisher Steve
Forbes, who has given African-Americans high-profile roles in his
campaign _ have sought to expand their outreach to this
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   And there is, in fact, a sliver of an opening for Republicans,
as polls find blacks have grown slightly less fervent in their
identification with the Democratic party over the course of the
decade. Some Democrats hope the Bradley and Gore jostling for the
black vote will energize this key constituency as President
Clinton, an immensely popular figure among blacks, exits the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis B. Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, which tracks voter turnout, said that Bradley
and Gore stand apart from previous presidential candidates in the
intensity of their racial outreach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an avoidance of any effort to mobilize the poor
and minorities communities, and to the extent that may be changing
in this election is healthy,'' Gans said.
</P>
<P>
   But, across Atlanta, and especially here along Auburn Avenue,
where the King family church, the civil rights leader's childhood
home and his museum are located, Gore wins among black voters,
because the questions of who Bradley is, where he has been and what
he stands for have largely gone unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of those voters is Camille Jackson, a 27 year-old recent
law school graduate from Atlanta, who considers herself an
Independent, like some 23 percent of blacks surveyed in a recent
Joint Center poll. That independent spirit is largely a phenomenon
among younger blacks, age 35 and under, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to vote today, I probably would vote for Gore, just
because of the time he has taken and the effort he has made to
include African Americans in different things,'' said Jackson as
she left the King museum.
</P>
<P>
   To the Rev. G.H. Williams, a volunteer guide to visitors at the
Ebenezer Baptist Church, the only thing that seems certain is that
``whoever follows Clinton is going to have to be a real Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   And though he has heard Gore speak at Ebenezer, the 74-year-old
Williams said he has yet to pick his candidate. ``He's a good
speaker,'' Williams said of Gore. ``But like I say, I've heard so
many good speakers. They are just like preachers, they don't
impress me too quick because I hear them preach one good sermon.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Williams, many black elected officials are keeping their
options open. Eighteen of the 38 members of the Congresssional
Black Caucus have withheld formal endorsements of either Democrat.
Most notable among those members still technically neutral are
civil rights stalwarts like Representatives John Lewis of Georgia,
Maxine Waters of California and John Conyers of Michigan, though a
Gore aide said last week an endorsement from Lewis might come soon.
The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson also has not officially taken sides, and
neither has his son, Jesse Jackson Jr., a congressman from
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Jr. said he and other lawmakers were withholding
endorsements because it was too early in the selection process and
because they wanted to hear more from both Gore and Bradley about
their plans for bringing blacks and other minorities and poor
people into the economic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting for a real Democrat to emerge _ an FDR,
Truman, HHH, Kennedy, Johnson Democrat,'' the Congressman Jackson.
``Are either of them willing to put a progressive African-American
on their ticket as VP? That would be one thing that would energize
the country and inspire many of those who are not currently
participating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative James E. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat
who is the black caucus chairman and has endorsed Gore, said: ``I
have talked to people in the caucus who are not yet ready to make
it formal. But I have not talked to anyody who tells me they do not
plan to be for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll released last month by the Joint Center showed that 69
percent of black adults polled held a favorable opinion of Gore, a
perception that has remained unchanged for the last several years.
(Clinton's numbers are about 20 points higher). Only 17 percent
held an unfavorable opinion of Gore, and 8 percent say they don't
know him well enough to have an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bradley scored a 41 percent favorable rating, but
an almost equal number _ 42 Percent of the respondents -- said they
don't know Bradley, while 11 percent were unfavorable toward him.
Similarly, Republican front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush,
who has courted Hispanic voters more than blacks, had a 43 percent
favorable rating among blacks; 34 percent unfavorable and 14
percent who said they don't know him.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bobby Howard, who teaches English at Dekalb College in
Atlanta, explained those numbers this way: ``They don't know Gore
as a leader and they don't know Bradley as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard, an independent who has voted for Bush's father; Clinton;
President Ronald Reagan and supported billionaire Ross Perot in
1992 ``until I realized we had a fool on our hands,'' said he would
vote for the Texas governor. Bush, he is convinced, ``is probably
going to wind up being the most liberal president that the
Republican Party has had since Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, however, Republican presidential candidates only
garner about 10 percent of the black vote nationally, said Bositis
of the Joint Center. The other 90 percent generally goes to the
Democrat, and that vote is no where as strong as it is in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are often a majority of the Democratic vote in
Mississippi, Louisiana and South Carolina, about 20 percent in
North Carolina and Virginia; and between 10 and 20 percent in
Florida and Texas, Bositis said, though nationally, blacks make up
only 10 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reach African-American voters, both Bradley and
Gore, whose civil rights records most regarded as equal and who
have assembled racially diverse staffs, have embraced affirmative
action and called for an end to racial profiling _ in which police
stop motorists based on their race.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gore told applauding delegates to the NAACP
convention, ``If I am elected president, ending racial profiling
will be the first civil rights act of the next century.'' He added,
``Driving while intoxicated is a national crime. But driving while
black is a natural condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in a later speech to the Rainbow/PUSH annual convention
in Chicago, fired back, ``Why wait? Why doesn't he walk down the
hall, put the executive order in front of the president and ask him
to sign it?''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, said Ronald Walters, a political scientist at the
University of Maryland at College Park, and an expert on black
politics, is that ``There is a big disconnect between the rhetoric
and public policy'' that both Bradley and Gore may need to
overcome.

REVVING UP A MEAN GREEN MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Race cars sure don't look like they're saving the
planet. Tearing around a track at 120 miles per hour, they spew
exhaust as they go, guzzling a gallon of gas every six to eight
miles. And, for all the smog they generate, the cars don't actually
go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But there he is, John P. DeVillars, New England's top
environmental official, dressed in full racing gear and crash
helmet on a postcard promoting an auto race to raise money for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   As some environmentalists look on with dismay, the regional
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is preparing
to go mano a mano with another environmentalist driver this weekend
in a benefit for land preservation in western Massachusetts. If the
unusual race goes well, organizers hope it will become an annual
event in which all kinds of environmental groups sponsor a race
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of an effort to democratize the environmental
movement,'' said DeVillars, an accomplished auto racer who finished
third in his first professional race last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be kind of fun to have another wrinkle to
our fund-raising'' that attracts a different crowd than the usual
cocktail party at some posh location, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many environmentalists view the automobile as one of the
world's leading environmental villains.And several of them openly
chided DeVillars, who is normally their ally, over the symbolism of
the auto race for the environment, organized by the Berkshire
Natural Resources Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't equate a 6-mile-per-gallon race car with an
environmental event,'' said Sheila Lynch of the Northeast Advanced
Vehicle Consortium, which promotes cars that run on batteries and
low-polluting fuels. ``It's a fine hobby, but it's not an
environmental program.''
</P>
<P>
   Added James McCaffrey of the Sierra Club, which supports more
fuel efficient vehicles, ``We'd rather see them racing trains (or)
solar-powered cars.''
</P>
<P>
   However, George Wislocki, director of the Pittsfield-based
Berkshire Natural Resources Council, was unapologetic about the
race. In Berkshire County, he explained, environmental groups are
often overshadowed by the major arts groups in fund-raising,
forcing environmental groups to be ``fairly cunning and fairly
artful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wislocki has parlayed the council into Berkshire County's
biggest private land owner, in part by building ties with groups
often overlooked by other environmentalists, especially hunters and
fishermen. Sportsmen for Land Preservation, a subsidiary of the
council, raises $50,000 a year through an outdoor-oriented auction
that includes hunting weapons and other sporting gear.
</P>
<P>
   Wislocki said this Saturday's auto race at Lime Rock Park in
Connecticut grew out of the sportsmen's group. Patrons will pay $50
apiece to see the race, part of a larger 25-car contest known as
the North Atlantic Road Racing Championships.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars will drive a Ford prototype racing car with a 2-liter
engine on behalf of the Sportsmen for Land Preservation, while Jack
Baker, owner of a Connecticut bottled-water company, will represent
the Housatonic Valley Association over the 30-lap, 1.8-mile course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game in fund-raising is to make it fun,'' said
Wislocki. ``A race of this sort is so utterly unique. Let me put it
this way: It would be hard to get people to pay $50 a head to go to
an event where they are racing electric cars.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars, the star attraction, is no stranger to controversy
over his driving. A series of speeding tickets while he was
Governor Michael S. Dukakis's environmental affairs secretary in
1989 forced DeVillars to make a public apology and earned him the
nickname ``Speedy'' on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But DeVillars has never been shy about his penchant for speed,
posing for the cover of the Boston Sunday Herald's magazine in the
cockpit of a souped-up Formula Ford just after the speeding ticket
controversy. Since then, he has raced all over the Northeast,
beating television stars Jason Priestley and Tim Allen last year
and finishing fourth in the North Atlantic Road Racing
Championships the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   As an EPA official who has cultivated a reputation for being
tough on pollution, DeVillars occasionally takes flak over his
choice of hobbies. But he believes people get too hung up on the
symbolism of auto racing, overlooking the fact that he walks to
work each day or that he spends his professional life trying to
clean up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's room enough in this world for auto racing in a clean
environment,'' said DeVillars.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, DeVillars believes that environmentalist disdain for
fast cars reflects the movement's difficulty in connecting with
people who never show up at Tanglewood or other elite places for
traditional fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmentalists should get more engaged in politics,'' said
DeVillars, noting that the Massachusetts Sportsmen's Council has
300,000 members who are often ``viewed warily and suspiciously'' by
environmentalists. Events such as the race for the environment can
help draw more sportsmen into the effort to protect open space, he
contends.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, few environmentalists wanted to be too hard on
DeVillars, who has taken a prominent role in fighting air pollution
and other auto-induced problems. But several scoffed at his
outreach ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are better ways to democratize the environmental
movement than to have car races,'' said Rob Sargent of the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group. ``You can have a bean
supper.''
</P>
<P>
   But one environmentalist, who asked not to be named, feared his
colleagues are caught up in political correctness. ``I'm not sure,
to be a good environmentalist, you have to be in favor of the
abolition of auto racing,'' the environmentalist said. ``If you
added up all the pollution of all the speedways in the US
throughout the year, I don't think it would make an appreciable
difference.''

<P>
   The United States has a hard time with supranational
organizations. It never joined the League of Nations; it has often
sneered at the International Court of Justice; it views the World
Trade Organization as a veiled attack on American sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But all this pales beside its behavior as a member of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not get its act together before the end of the year,
the United States will automatically lose its vote in the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   America owes the U.N. more than $1 billion. Some of this debt
has accrued since the 1980s, when Congress decided to withhold
payment until the U.N. reformed its management and budget
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is money owing from the 1990s, when Congress forbade
the payment of America's agreed share of U.N. peacekeeping
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Those spats are now largely over. Peacekeeping ventures have
been greatly reduced, partly at America's insistence; if the
peacekeepers go in at all, it is only by invitation, currently
Indonesia's. And the U.N. has reformed itself internally, including
giving individual countries a power of veto over budgets they
dislike.
</P>
<P>
   But even after this, the United States has still not paid its
arrears. The Clinton administration, to its credit, has declared
that the money ought to be paid. Under the Balanced Budget Act of
1997, an allocation was set aside. But it has not been authorized
yet, because House, Senate and president cannot agree.
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies mostly in the House, where Chris Smith, a
Republican congressman from New Jersey, keeps trying to link the
payment of arrears to restrictions on American family-planning
programs abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He took this language out of the House bill in July, and the
bill passed; but when it goes to conference, he is expected to try
and get it back in again.
</P>
<P>
   The linking of these two unconnected issues has made America
look like a bigot and a fool on the world stage. But to the likes
of Smith, such epithets are badges of honor.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has done somewhat better with its authorization bill,
but not much. There, Jesse Helms and Joe Biden have pushed through
a bill that is festooned with brattish conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Before it gets its money, the U.N. must promise that American
sovereignty will always be maintained; it must promise not to set
up a standing army; it must give the United States a permanent seat
on the budget committee; it must charge no interest on late
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Such clauses have been added mostly to mollify that section of
American opinion _ not a large one, but loud _ that associates the
U.N. with the whirr of black helicopters and the threat of world
domination.
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to bang heads and insist on repayment _ as he must _
Clinton may have to accept all this. If he vetoes Helms/Biden, the
allocation will lapse, and America will quickly find it has lost
its General Assembly vote.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N., of course, can be a many-headed muddler, and some of
its agencies remain both inefficient and unaccountable. This gives
America reason to watch it like a hawk, but not to refuse to pay
its debts.
</P>
<P>
   This refusal is widely taken as a sign of something much deeper:
a reluctance to take up responsibilities and challenges in the
world as a whole. If America wants to reverse that impression
overnight, it knows what it must do. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Mention youth and crime in America these days, and
people think of massacres like the one at Columbine High School in
Colorado four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction is understandable. Predictably, parents have been
pushing for tighter gun-control laws. On Sept. 11, President Bill
Clinton announced $100 million in community grants aimed at
reducing violence among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools have even been conducting ``lock-down'' drills to
prepare children for armed assaults.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, towns across America have also been
passing curfews to get their children off the streets at night.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cicero, a town near Chicago, passed a law _ aimed at
gang members _ that would allow police to seize the cars of
teenagers out too late.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week the most recent curfew came into force in
Washington, D.C. There, children aged 16 and younger have to be
home by 11 p.m. on weekdays, and by midnight at the weekends,
though it does admit exceptions such as ``work'' and ``church
activities'' (and also, curiously, lets children off if they cite
their First-Amendment rights). If parents are found negligent, they
can be fined or punished themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's crackdown is part of a broader national trend to
tuck children into bed and out of harm's way. Some 300 towns and
cities now have some sort of curfew for minors, and the Justice
Department has expressed its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Curfews sound tough, win votes and please anxious adults. But do
they work?
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Schiraldi of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice
(CJCJ), a nonprofit group in Washington, points out an irony that
suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The crime that children are most often arrested for in America,
he notes, is curfew violation. In 1996, police reported some
140,000 cases of juvenile curfew arrests, more than double the
figure in 1994. That amounts to more than the total arrests for all
juvenile violent crimes put together.
</P>
<P>
   If such measures really did reduce crime, that might be an
acceptable price to pay. But curfews are problematic. For a start,
some critics argue that curfews violate the constitutional rights
of young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are precedents, of course, for forbidding minors to do
some things that adults may do freely: it makes sense to stop them
smoking and discourage them from drinking. But should they also be
forbidden to go out for the late movie? The law is murky on this
point, as the constitutional rights of minors are not clearly
defined.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C. has tried several times over the past decade to
push through a curfew, only to find it thwarted by legal
challenges. But an appeals court recently supported the city, and
so the curfew is back.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger objection raised to curfews is that they may result
in racial bias. Police in several states, most recently New Jersey,
have been caught out using a practice known as race ``profiling,''
which targets minority groups _ typically for traffic offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Art Spitzer of the American Civil Liberties Union insists that
however good the intentions of the Washington curfew, the actual
enforcement will inevitably single out poor, mostly minority,
children in inner cities, ``who usually don't have swimming pools
or air conditioning to go home to.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence from Los Angeles and New Orleans suggests that police
arrest blacks far more often than whites for curfew violations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling argument against curfews is that
there is no evidence they work. Many boasts have been made by
policemen and mayors, says Jeffrey Butts of the Urban Institute, a
think-tank, but most of their curfews have merely been riding the
wave of declining crime rates across America.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that there is no substantive research that shows a
link between curfews and reduced crime. Indeed, the most
comprehensive study on the subject suggests the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Males and Dan Macallair, the authors of that study by the
CJCJ, looked at a variety of curfews enforced throughout California
from 1978 to 1996. They found that counties that had strict curfew
s did not see a decrease in youth crime greater than those counties
without such curfews. These findings held true for all sorts of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, has juvenile crime been declining along with overall
crime rates since the mid-1990s? Social-policy experts are divided.
Some argue that government efforts, such as job-training and
mentoring schemes, nudge errant teenagers back on the straight and
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Others think that the answer lies in the same sorts of measures,
like community policing, that have been effective in bringing down
adult crime.
</P>
<P>
   Still others argue that the biggest force driving down
delinquency among young people could be the country's remarkable
economic boom: with jobs aplenty, crime is less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it should not be so surprising that curfews have little
impact on crime rates. After all, most juvenile crimes have long
been committed between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. _ the hours after school
ends and before many parents come home.
</P>
<P>
   The main point of curfews, it seems, is to make adults feel
better. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mention youth and crime in America these days, and
people think of massacres like the one at Columbine High School in
Colorado four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction is understandable. Predictably, parents have been
pushing for tighter gun-control laws. On Sept. 11, President Bill
Clinton announced $100 million in community grants aimed at
reducing violence among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools have even been conducting ``lock-down'' drills to
prepare children for armed assaults.
</P>
<P>
   More controversially, towns across America have also been
passing curfews to get their children off the streets at night.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cicero, a town near Chicago, passed a law _ aimed at
gang members _ that would allow police to seize the cars of
teenagers out too late.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week the most recent curfew came into force in
Washington, D.C. There, children aged 16 and younger have to be
home by 11 p.m. on weekdays, and by midnight at the weekends,
though it does admit exceptions such as ``work'' and ``church
activities'' (and also, curiously, lets children off if they cite
their First-Amendment rights). If parents are found negligent, they
can be fined or punished themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's crackdown is part of a broader national trend to
tuck children into bed and out of harm's way. Some 300 towns and
cities now have some sort of curfew for minors, and the Justice
Department has expressed its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Curfews sound tough, win votes and please anxious adults. But do
they work?
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Schiraldi of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice
(CJCJ), a nonprofit group in Washington, points out an irony that

<P>
   Ten years ago, 1,200 people lived in New England, N.D. This was
a boom town, if a small one. The nearby railway carried some of the
world's best hard red spring wheat to market.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1990s the railway had stopped coming to town.
Decay spread along Main Street: restaurants and gas stations shut
down, and so did the Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   Today only one restaurant serves New England's 600 people.
Decrepit storefronts gape into the street. Down the road, in Mott,
N.D., the last rural Catholic school in the western half of the
state has just closed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Mott and New England that feel the slow exodus.
All across the Great Plains, small towns are losing their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Crop disease, drought, floods and blizzards have ravaged North
Dakota's farms. Even worse, as the area's anxious farmers will tell
you, is the seemingly limitless fall in the price of grain and
beef.
</P>
<P>
   Record world supplies of grain, and a remarkable dearth of crop
disasters outside America, have made much of the wheat here worth
little more than chaff.
</P>
<P>
   In rural towns across North Dakota, says one farmer, ``There is
a slow acquiescence to fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these towns are peopled by third- and fourth-generation
farmers whose grandparents and great-grandparents settled here as
homesteaders early in the century, when this was still untamed
frontier. They beat the farm crisis of the 1980s, when land prices
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are college-educated; many have advanced degrees.
Yet they cannot live on their farm income alone. Many of them have
second jobs, and their wives work. But even this may not be enough
to keep them going.
</P>
<P>
   In Rolette, in north-central North Dakota, the recent
monsoon-like rain submerged some farmers' crops and spread fungus
among those that stayed above the surface.
</P>
<P>
   One local farmer, Arnell Nelson, talks of the growing lakes in
his fields with a wry fatalism: this will be ``do-or-die year,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   His debt has rocketed, more than trebling in a couple of years
to $60,000. He cannot afford to walk away right now; even if he
sold all his assets, he would still be in debt. The banks, he says,
hesitate to foreclose on loans and mortgages because most of the
farmers he knows are just as badly in the red.
</P>
<P>
   For many farmers like him, the church is the last refuge from
falling rain and falling prices. Father Tom Graner, a local priest,
says that more and more normally reticent and stoic farmers are
coming to him for support. He tries to lighten their load, he says,
but he has to point out that things may get no better.
</P>
<P>
   In Slope County, in south-western North Dakota, amid the vast
and rugged Badlands, cattle ranchers face a similar collection of
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   In a blizzard here in 1997 thousands of cattle wandered off and
died. Cattle prices now are near record lows. The National Forest
Service, from which many ranchers rent grazing land, may require
them to graze fewer cattle, in order to encourage native grasses
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Slope County's only two ordained ministers, Pastors Jerry and
Carolyn Erickson, spend much of their time giving counsel to
anxious and depressed farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry helps cash-strapped farmers with their chores; Carolyn now
distributes gifts of food without asking.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fargo-based Catholic Family Service recently handed out
some $800,000 in aid to farmers around the state, only one county
asked for more than Slope.
</P>
<P>
   John Hanson is one rancher who received help. To survive, Hanson
is slowly building up a herd of bison on his property, has put up
tourist cabins made from his own pine trees, and hopes to attract
visitors who can be taken on photo shoots through the scenic
Badlands.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to overcome the hopelessness he sees among his fellow
ranchers with a renewal of the vigor that brought their families
here in the first place. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some golden ideas'' are needed, he says. One possible idea is
to market the local Angus beef as Idaho has marketed its potatoes _
as a special version of a familiar food, for which a special price
can be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to have more bison, whose meat can bring in a pretty
penny. Yet another possibility is to set up a co-operative through
which local ranchers and feeders can earn money from every stage of
production, as is done by the three big corporations in the
business, Iowa Beef Processors, ConAgra and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   At least two such co-operatives, Dakota Growers Pasta Co. and
the North American Bison Co-op, are doing well elsewhere in North
Dakota. They have begun to manage the entire production process,
from seed and calf to packaged product, earning profits at every
step.
</P>
<P>
   In and around Slope County, ranchers have twice sought to raise
enough money to start their own co-operative. But trying to knit
the solitary ranchers together was ``like carrying a load of
jackrabbits on a flatbed truck,'' says Don Nordby, once a board
member of the aborted Northern Plains Premium Beef Co-operative.
</P>
<P>
   Despite help with research from the state-owned bank, and
finance from a state agency, low cattle prices meant that the
ranchers could never raise enough capital to keep the co-operative
going. Still, the idea remains good, says Nordby. It may be the
only way for farmers and ranchers to survive as profit margins go
on shrinking. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As times get tougher, more and more ranchers and farmers see
that something has to change if they hope to pass on their land to
another generation.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday morning, after services at the tiny Lebanon
Lutheran Church in Amidon, local farmers talked about their plight
with a mixture of exasperation and faint hope. Some of them growled
about the big corporations for wanting low prices no matter what
happens to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nordby, a third-generation farmer and rancher, takes a
milder line: he believes the big companies are only doing what
comes naturally to them. To cope with their competition, farmers
and ranchers need to abandon their rugged individualism and start
to work together.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he adds, America has to protect its farmers, as many
European countries protect theirs, because a country that can't
feed its own people is losing control over its future.
</P>
<P>
   The men who make policy must change the rules, so that America's
farmers are on a level footing with their subsidized counterparts
abroad. &QL;

<P>
   North Dakota's commissioner of agriculture, Roger Johnson, wants
the United States to return to the robust system of price supports
it abandoned with the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act.
</P>
<P>
   He and Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota propose that America
should match the subsidies disbursed by the European Union to its
farmers. That would even the score, they reckon, at the World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle in December.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, an economist, is no enemy of the market. But he thinks
the United States has to decide whether it wants its farmers to
survive. If the market is left to itself, the farmers will be
pushed from the land, and the land itself will go uncultivated. So
the government must help farmers to compete with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Republican governor, Ed Schafer, likes the idea of
co-operatives, and thinks that inheritance and capital-gains taxes
are too big a burden for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But he prefers to talk about a different prospect _ information
technology, and how it could repopulate North Dakota's rural towns.
He thinks government has a part to play in this.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. West is installing Internet hubs in a number of North
Dakota cities. A pilot government program in Watford City has
connected private and public entities with Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer's friend Bill Owens, a former vice-chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, has a large role in the Teledesic project, which
will link the Internet to a new network of satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer hopes that he will one day be able to sit in a rural
school and watch a hologram of the New York Philharmonic play the
music he loves. &QL;

   His debt has rocketed, more than trebling in a couple of years
to $60,000. He cannot afford to walk away right now; even if he
sold all his assets, he would still be in debt. The banks, he says,
hesitate to foreclose on loans and mortgages because most of the
farmers he knows are just as badly in the red.
</P>
<P>
   For many farmers like him, the church is the last refuge from
falling rain and falling prices. Father Tom Graner, a local priest,
says that more and more normally reticent and stoic farmers are
coming to him for support. He tries to lighten their load, he says,
but he has to point out that things may get no better.
</P>
<P>
   In Slope County, in south-western North Dakota, amid the vast
and rugged Badlands, cattle ranchers face a similar collection of
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   In a blizzard here in 1997 thousands of cattle wandered off and
died. Cattle prices now are near record lows. The National Forest
Service, from which many ranchers rent grazing land, may require
them to graze fewer cattle, in order to encourage native grasses
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Slope County's only two ordained ministers, Pastors Jerry and
Carolyn Erickson, spend much of their time giving counsel to
anxious and depressed farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry helps cash-strapped farmers with their chores; Carolyn now
distributes gifts of food without asking.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fargo-based Catholic Family Service recently handed out
some $800,000 in aid to farmers around the state, only one county
asked for more than Slope.
</P>
<P>
   John Hanson is one rancher who received help. To survive, Hanson
is slowly building up a herd of bison on his property, has put up
tourist cabins made from his own pine trees, and hopes to attract
visitors who can be taken on photo shoots through the scenic
Badlands.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to overcome the hopelessness he sees among his fellow
ranchers with a renewal of the vigor that brought their families
here in the first place. &QL;

<P>
   ``Some golden ideas'' are needed, he says. One possible idea is
to market the local Angus beef as Idaho has marketed its potatoes _
as a special version of a familiar food, for which a special price
can be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to have more bison, whose meat can bring in a pretty
penny. Yet another possibility is to set up a co-operative through
which local ranchers and feeders can earn money from every stage of
production, as is done by the three big corporations in the
business, Iowa Beef Processors, ConAgra and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   At least two such co-operatives, Dakota Growers Pasta Co. and
the North American Bison Co-op, are doing well elsewhere in North
Dakota. They have begun to manage the entire production process,
from seed and calf to packaged product, earning profits at every
step.
</P>
<P>
   In and around Slope County, ranchers have twice sought to raise
enough money to start their own co-operative. But trying to knit
the solitary ranchers together was ``like carrying a load of
jackrabbits on a flatbed truck,'' says Don Nordby, once a board
member of the aborted Northern Plains Premium Beef Co-operative.
</P>
<P>
   Despite help with research from the state-owned bank, and
finance from a state agency, low cattle prices meant that the
ranchers could never raise enough capital to keep the co-operative
going. Still, the idea remains good, says Nordby. It may be the
only way for farmers and ranchers to survive as profit margins go
on shrinking. &QL;

   As times get tougher, more and more ranchers and farmers see
that something has to change if they hope to pass on their land to
another generation.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday morning, after services at the tiny Lebanon
Lutheran Church in Amidon, local farmers talked about their plight
with a mixture of exasperation and faint hope. Some of them growled
about the big corporations for wanting low prices no matter what
happens to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nordby, a third-generation farmer and rancher, takes a
milder line: he believes the big companies are only doing what
comes naturally to them. To cope with their competition, farmers
and ranchers need to abandon their rugged individualism and start
to work together.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he adds, America has to protect its farmers, as many
European countries protect theirs, because a country that can't
feed its own people is losing control over its future.
</P>
<P>
   The men who make policy must change the rules, so that America's
farmers are on a level footing with their subsidized counterparts
abroad. &QL;

   North Dakota's commissioner of agriculture, Roger Johnson, wants
the United States to return to the robust system of price supports
it abandoned with the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act.
</P>
<P>
   He and Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota propose that America
should match the subsidies disbursed by the European Union to its
farmers. That would even the score, they reckon, at the World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle in December.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, an economist, is no enemy of the market. But he thinks
the United States has to decide whether it wants its farmers to
survive. If the market is left to itself, the farmers will be
pushed from the land, and the land itself will go uncultivated. So
the government must help farmers to compete with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Republican governor, Ed Schafer, likes the idea of
co-operatives, and thinks that inheritance and capital-gains taxes
are too big a burden for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But he prefers to talk about a different prospect _ information
technology, and how it could repopulate North Dakota's rural towns.
He thinks government has a part to play in this.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. West is installing Internet hubs in a number of North
Dakota cities. A pilot government program in Watford City has
connected private and public entities with Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer's friend Bill Owens, a former vice-chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, has a large role in the Teledesic project, which
will link the Internet to a new network of satellites.
</P>

   Schafer hopes that he will one day be able to sit in a rural
school and watch a hologram of the New York Philharmonic play the
music he loves. &QL;

   CAIRO _ In the latest phase of its decade-long siege, Iraq is
fielding a novel weapon: charm.
</P>
<P>
   From the United Nations to the Arab League to the Vatican, Iraqi
officials are trying to project a kinder, gentler image. Their hope
is to exploit growing fatigue, and queasiness, with sanctions, and
to position Iraq for rehabilitation in a more forgiving world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread sympathy for the Iraqi people, this
public-relations effort will take hard work. Not only does the
leadership style of Saddam Hussein remain a critical liability, but
his major foe, the United States, is mounting its own publicity
campaign to revive international revulsion at Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the differences within the U.N. Security Council over
the embargo, which once were wide, seem to have narrowed lately.
</P>
<P>
   At meetings in London this week, the permanent members most
sympathetic to Iraq _ Russia, China and France _ moved a bit closer
to Britain and America. The three now appear to support continued
close monitoring of Iraq's trade, and of its weapons development,
even if most sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Baghdad's charm offensive has brought some results. It was
only last January that Iraq's foreign minister, Muhammad al-Sahhaf,
stormed out of an Arab League ministerial meeting after his
colleagues refused to condemn sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time since the invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
Iraq has assumed the rotating chairmanship of the 22-member
organization.
</P>
<P>
   When Arab ministers gathered in Cairo last week, al-Sahhaf
surprised observers by steering smoothly through the 46-point
agenda, which had been stripped in advance of controversial topics,
including the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, no Arab country is likely to do what Iraq
wants, and openly flout sanctions. But many are moving in a
direction quite pleasing to Iraq. Several Arab states, notably
Egypt, have sent trade delegations in the hope of cashing in when
commerce opens up.
</P>
<P>
   These join a growing number of visitors to the Iraqi capital,
which recently played host to a Congress of Islamic Peoples
attended by delegates from 50 countries. A trade fair on oil
technology is to be held in Baghdad soon.
</P>
<P>
   The propaganda value of such openings, good as they are, are
minor compared with the possible visit from Pope John Paul II,
which the Vatican says may take place before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The mooted visit has attracted vigorous opposition from America,
Jewish groups and the exiled Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Less controversial is Iraq's offer of aid to earthquake-stricken
Turkey. Since the Turkish government could hardly refuse a gift of
$10 million-worth of oil, the gesture has made it harder for Turkey
to condone the use of its bases for American and British air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, meanwhile, there are persistent rumors of an
imminent cabinet shuffle. Several old-guard figures, it is
whispered, may be replaced by technocrats with more appeal to
potential foreign investors. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   OPEC is back, and it is bigger and badder than ever. Or so it
would seem, to judge by the spectacular surge in oil prices in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cartel met in March to agree to production cuts,
prices have almost doubled, to nearly $24 a barrel. Could the next
OPEC meeting, in Vienna on Sept. 22, pave the way for even higher
prices?
</P>
<P>
   The discipline demonstrated by the cartel, and by Mexico and
Norway, which also agreed to big production cuts, has surpassed
observers' wildest expectations _ including, it must be admitted,
this newspaper's.
</P>
<P>
   Now more upward pressure on prices looms. Asia's economies are
rebounding and America's strong expansion is continuing apace. Some
economists expect hoarding of oil stocks in response to the Year
2000 bug scare. And the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere
should keep demand up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some people think that the current price rise has less to do
with OPEC than with America.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Odell, an oil watcher, argues that America last year
pushed key OPEC members to agree to production cuts for fear that
low prices might bankrupt such important countries as Venezuela and
Russia. ``OPEC,'' he maintains, ``is merely the instrument to bring
these players on board.''
</P>
<P>
   As conspiracy theories go, how plausible is this? ``We never
interfere in prices in any way,'' retorts one American official,
insisting that her government leaves them to be set in the markets.
But she concedes that the United States likes to see oil prices at
between $17 and $21 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   That is a range which she reckons is ideal for stability in the
world market: much lower means producers go bust, much higher might
lead to inflation and consumer unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ask what would happen if prices soar this winter towards $30,
and the reply remains elusive: ``We will do what we can to maintain
stability in the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a warning to the OPEC ministers gathering in
Vienna. In any case, OPEC's newfound unity looks as though it could
be as brief as it was unexpected. Internal divisions have already
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries want to stick with the current agreement, which
sets binding quotas until next March. But two rival strategies
threaten to disrupt the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia and Mexico are suggesting that the focus of the
accord should shift from production quotas to stock levels. They
argue that, once the world's oil stocks have fallen back to
end-1997 levels, countries could safely raise production without
jeopardizing prices.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OPEC is back, and it is bigger and badder than ever. Or so it
would seem, to judge by the spectacular surge in oil prices in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cartel met in March to agree to production cuts,
prices have almost doubled, to nearly $24 a barrel. Could the next
OPEC meeting, in Vienna on Sept. 22, pave the way for even higher
prices?
</P>
<P>
   The discipline demonstrated by the cartel, and by Mexico and
Norway, which also agreed to big production cuts, has surpassed
observers' wildest expectations _ including, it must be admitted,
this newspaper's.
</P>
<P>
   Now more upward pressure on prices looms. Asia's economies are
rebounding and America's strong expansion is continuing apace. Some
economists expect hoarding of oil stocks in response to the Year
2000 bug scare. And the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere
should keep demand up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some people think that the current price rise has less to do
with OPEC than with America.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Odell, an oil watcher, argues that America last year
pushed key OPEC members to agree to production cuts for fear that
low prices might bankrupt such important countries as Venezuela and
Russia. ``OPEC,'' he maintains, ``is merely the instrument to bring
these players on board.''
</P>
<P>
   As conspiracy theories go, how plausible is this? ``We never
interfere in prices in any way,'' retorts one American official,
insisting that her government leaves them to be set in the markets.
But she concedes that the United States likes to see oil prices at
between $17 and $21 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   That is a range which she reckons is ideal for stability in the
world market: much lower means producers go bust, much higher might
lead to inflation and consumer unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ask what would happen if prices soar this winter towards $30,
and the reply remains elusive: ``We will do what we can to maintain
stability in the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a warning to the OPEC ministers gathering in
Vienna. In any case, OPEC's newfound unity looks as though it could
be as brief as it was unexpected. Internal divisions have already
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries want to stick with the current agreement, which
sets binding quotas until next March. But two rival strategies
threaten to disrupt the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia and Mexico are suggesting that the focus of the
accord should shift from production quotas to stock levels. They
argue that, once the world's oil stocks have fallen back to
end-1997 levels, countries could safely raise production without
jeopardizing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents fear that this could clear the way for OPEC's
perennial cheats to throw open the taps. Other countries want to
stop prices from rising too far, because that would upset such
powerful customers as the United States.
</P>

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Economists seek to model reality _ or at least
most do. Many Internet entrepreneurs try to mimic the dismal
science by building ever more perfect marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   First came online auctions. Then Priceline.com let consumers
name their prices for airline tickets or hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Silicon Valley start-up, NexTag.com, has come up with an
even better way of setting prices.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, NexTag's website (http://www.nexttag.com), which
it launched in early August, looks like just another online auction
house for electronic equipment, albeit a big one featuring more
than 150,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm does not let buyers compete by bidding prices up.
It offers the opposite: multiple sellers bid prices down to win a
buyer's business.
</P>
<P>
   The company's site works best for people who know what they
want. They first search for a specific item. A click on its
hyperlink pulls up a list of online stores that currently carry the
product and its prices. A user can then either choose the best
offer or place a lower bid.
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of minutes, sellers reply by accepting the bid
or by making a counter-offer. Recently, for example, eight online
resellers offered the base version of the Rio, a popular device for
playing online music files.
</P>
<P>
   The prices ranged from $145.98 to $193.25, including tax and
shipping. A bid of $140 prompted one seller to lower its asking
price from $152.91 to $145.84. Another offered $169.75 if the buyer
agreed to purchase a leather carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   NexTag, which will make its money from transaction fees and
advertising, supplements its service by providing the information
needed to make the right purchasing decision.
</P>
<P>
   The return policies of sellers _ if they pay the shipping fee,
for instance _ are only a click away. And customers can look at
charts of the pricing history of all products available through the
site. The chart for the Rio shows that it sold for about $190 in
January, but $140 in August.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why buyers would like such a service. But what
is in it for the sellers? So far, the firm has managed to sign up a
dozen online computer stores, among them such well-known names as
CDW computer centers, Egghead.com and PC Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is that they can discount products without having
to lower prices at their own outlets, explains Purnendu Ojha,
NexTag's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Equally enticing, apparently, is the fact that NexTag provides
sellers with free software to automate their responses to bids and
capture data about potential buyers. But if too many buyers cotton
on to the service, the sellers may change their tune. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Economists seek to model reality _ or at least
most do. Many Internet entrepreneurs try to mimic the dismal
science by building ever more perfect marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   First came online auctions. Then Priceline.com let consumers
name their prices for airline tickets or hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Silicon Valley start-up, NexTag.com, has come up with an
even better way of setting prices.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, NexTag's website (http://www.nexttag.com), which
it launched in early August, looks like just another online auction
house for electronic equipment, albeit a big one featuring more
than 150,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm does not let buyers compete by bidding prices up.
It offers the opposite: multiple sellers bid prices down to win a
buyer's business.
</P>
<P>
   The company's site works best for people who know what they
want. They first search for a specific item. A click on its
hyperlink pulls up a list of online stores that currently carry the
product and its prices. A user can then either choose the best
offer or place a lower bid.
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of minutes, sellers reply by accepting the bid
or by making a counter-offer. Recently, for example, eight online
resellers offered the base version of the Rio, a popular device for
playing online music files.
</P>
<P>
   The prices ranged from $145.98 to $193.25, including tax and
shipping. A bid of $140 prompted one seller to lower its asking
price from $152.91 to $145.84. Another offered $169.75 if the buyer
agreed to purchase a leather carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   NexTag, which will make its money from transaction fees and
advertising, supplements its service by providing the information
needed to make the right purchasing decision.
</P>
<P>
   The return policies of sellers _ if they pay the shipping fee,
for instance _ are only a click away. And customers can look at
charts of the pricing history of all products available through the
site. The chart for the Rio shows that it sold for about $190 in
January, but $140 in August.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why buyers would like such a service. But what
is in it for the sellers? So far, the firm has managed to sign up a
dozen online computer stores, among them such well-known names as
CDW computer centers, Egghead.com and PC Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is that they can discount products without having
to lower prices at their own outlets, explains Purnendu Ojha,
NexTag's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Equally enticing, apparently, is the fact that NexTag provides
sellers with free software to automate their responses to bids and
capture data about potential buyers. But if too many buyers cotton
on to the service, the sellers may change their tune. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Weather forecasts on Hurricane Floyd, which has just hit North
Carolina, persuaded state governors along the southeastern seaboard
to urge more than 2 million people to evacuate inland.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1854, when state-sponsored meteorology was born, weather
forecasting has always been recognized as a valuable business _ one
dollar invested in meteorology is said to yield about $15 in terms
of casualties avoided, harvests saved and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Internet has made selling weather information
so easy, the market is being fought over as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasts have become much more accurate over the past
20 years. Today's three-day forecasts are as good as one-day
forecasts were in 1981. Ten-day forecasts are fast becoming the
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The more accurate the forecasts, the more they are worth. Sales
of iced tea multiply by five each time the thermometer rises above
59 degreesF (15degreesC). With a three-day forecast, retailers can
send their orders to their sunniest outlets and soft-drinks
companies can adjust their rate of production.
</P>
<P>
   Movie audiences, medicine consumption and toll receipts all vary
according to the sky. In winter, power companies can save up to
$100,000 a day if they know in advance how high users will turn up
their heating.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of its history, weather forecasting has been
done by national governments, although, since any rain forecast for
London incorporates data collected from as far away as Fiji, they
have to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), part of the United
Nations, organizes the free exchange of data among 185 member
states. But the more accurate _ and therefore valuable _ the
weather forecasts become, the more commercial companies want to get
into the business.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, Europe's weather-forecasting market is
currently worth $150 million and it may soon be worth as much as
$700 million.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned weather forecasters are keen to cash in, but
they remain heavily dependent on their governments. Britain's
Meteorological Office earns more in commercial revenues than any of
its European counterparts, but it brings in only Pounds24 million
($40 million) of its Pounds155 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that commercial companies have been taking an
increasing slice of the weather business in Europe. Over the past
five years, global companies, such as Japan's Weathernews, or
national forecasters, such as the Netherlands's Meteo Consult, have
captured 20 percent of the market from government weather services.
</P>
<P>
   Accuweather, an American company, has been courting European
media, businessmen, mariners and mountain-climbing fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's state-owned weather services complain that the
commercial companies have unfair advantages. Unlike them, the
American Weather Service _ which, according to the rules that
govern it, is not allowed to sell information _ passes on without
charge the data it receives from the WMO to private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, private forecasters can stock up on free American data and
resell it to other markets without investing in costly satellites
or supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, European weathermen, supported by the South Americans,
made the WMO adopt a new rule _ Regulation 40 _ that identifies two
categories of products.
</P>
<P>
   Raw data needed by meteorologists all over the world remain at
everybody's disposal. But weather services may not sell the data
that have the greatest economic value _ forecasts for a particular
city, for instance _ outside their national markets. So naturally
everybody set about circumventing Regulation 40.
</P>
<P>
   Universities, which still enjoy free access to all weather data,
are under suspicion, but the main way around the rules is to use
the Internet, where the notion of national markets, used by
Regulation 40, simply does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies have also complained about government weather
services to the European Commission, claiming that the absence of
competition between them proves collusion. And they say that those
services ``dump'' weather data.
</P>
<P>
   In France, for example, the government weather service, Meteo
France, gets FFr2 million ($317,000) a year from selling forecasts
to TF1, the biggest commercial television station. TF1, meanwhile,
gets FFr1.7 billion in revenue from advertising spots around the
weather report.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the commission has turned a deaf ear and the WMO has
managed to persuade its members to take a united stand.
</P>
<P>
   Too much competition from the private sector would jeopardize
the free exchange of data that allows any country to formulate
forecasts. But the amounts at stake may soon change this. &QL;

<P>
   It doesn't get much better than this _ and that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. economy _ dubbed Goldilocks by many, because
like the perfect porridge it's neither too hot nor too cold _ faces
a number of scares in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three bears _ the Federal Reserve Board, China, and
YK2 _ is likely to be ferocious enough to send the fair-haired girl
tumbling out the window, but together they will be enough to keep
the stock market on edge for at least the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for more volatility as investors hop from sector to
sector and stock to stock trying to find one that's just right.
</P>
<P>
   The current stock market is priced for perfection. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index, for example, traded on July 16 at 36.97
times earnings for the previous 12 months. That record
price-to-earnings ratio fully incorporates what looks like a great
year for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter U.S. equity strategist Peter Canelo,
for one, projects that earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 will increase by 14
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs to search too hard to find the forces behind that
whopping increase. The improving global economy has produced
growing sales volume for those multinational companies that took
the biggest hit in the global crisis of 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to firming prices for the goods they sell and very modest
increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor they buy,
corporations have seen those increased sales volumes multiply by
the time they hit the bottom line as earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Morgan Stanley estimates that non-farm worker
productivity in the U.S. increased by 2.6 percent in the year ended
in June 1999, the best rate of increase in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, because wages haven't climbed much while
productivity has, the cost of a unit of labor increased by less
than 1 percent during the same period. That's the first time in
three years corporations have seen their labor costs rise by less
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This state of perfection can't last much longer _ according to
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after almost a year of looking for the ghosts of
inflation without finding any, the central bankers found enough to
scare themselves into raising short-term interest rates by 25 basis
points (100 basis points equal one percentage point).
</P>
<P>
   In his July 22 testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned that the Fed didn't think one hike would
solve the problem. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which
had fallen below 5.9 percent, rapidly climbed back above 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't seem to make much of a case for a resurgence
of inflation, but a majority of the Fed governors are determined to
shoot first and ask questions later. And for investors, that
matters much more than the quality of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market believes the Fed is serious about raising rates,
and that will put downward pressure on stocks. The pressure is
likely to continue until the bankers remove the uncertainty by
actually doing what investors now fear.
</P>
<P>
   Look to May and June of 1999 as a model for how the markets will
behave _ sinking on the worry and rallying on the news, even if the
news is a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that almost certainly would deter the Federal Reserve
would be a resurgence of the financial crisis that rocked Asia in
1998. The region is clearly not out of the woods yet. The recovery
in Korea and Thailand appears to be real, but fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Japan cannot convincingly shake its recession. And now China
shows signs that it is considering a devaluation of its currency,
the yuan, an act that would send the area back into turmoil. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese could be on the verge of a Japanese-style
deflationary spiral. Consumer prices have fallen in China for 21
consecutive months. At the same time, the Chinese savings rate has
climbed to 42 percent of household income _ people are putting
money away for an increasingly uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, growth in the gross domestic product has slowed in
each year since 1996, and last year China's economy grew by a
lackluster 4 percent, according to non-governmental economists (the
Chinese government claims GDP grew by 7.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The glut of manufactured goods such as televisions is so great
that even price cuts of 25 percent can't clear the market. In some
industries, companies have closed factories for months to reduce a
mountain of inventory. That, of course, just increases fear (and
cuts incomes) and sends consumer spending lower. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devaluing the yuan so that Chinese exports are cheaper is a
tempting short-term solution. It would undoubtedly produce a spike
in exports _ until China's neighbors responded with their own
devaluations and set off a trade war that no side would win and
that would be blamed on the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation would probably kill China's attempt to gain entry to
the World Trade Organization this year or next.
</P>
<P>
   That the Chinese are even willing to consider devaluation is a
sign of how dire the situation is. China's leaders know that a
deflationary spiral, once in place, can last for a decade or more _
all they have to do is look across the narrow sea for proof of
that.
</P>
<P>
   And domestic stability in China depends on strong economic
growth. China needs to add 7.5 million jobs a year just to hold
unemployment steady at the current 10 percent in cities and 30
percent in the countryside. The regime knows that the hope of a
better tomorrow is essential to contain potential unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting what China will do is almost impossible _ the
country's course of action depends on massive political and
complicated internal struggles.
</P>
<P>
   It is that unpredictability that will send the bond market (and
with it parts of the equity market) into a speculative tizzy from
time to time over the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike (or two) nor the
devaluation of the yuan would mean the end of the world, but worry
over those two issues certainly helps set the stage for those who
believe the YK2 problem will cause the demise of civilization as we
know it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what the widespread use of two-digit year dates in
computer software will do to computer systems around the world in
January 2000. The absence of major problems so far _ computer
systems that make payments or order inventory, for example, have
been coping with the dating issue for months now _ makes it likely
that any blowups will be localized.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that no one knows. In that atmosphere of
uncertainty, investors tend to see a monster under every bed. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's the likely effect of these worries on the stock market
during the next several months? In each case, at the moment, the
risk is all on the downside.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is already reflected in the prices of financial
assets; the bad news is just starting to get factored in. In
situations like that, investors tend to sell at the first sign of
real or imagined trouble.
</P>
<P>
   During May and June, that led to an over-sold market as
investors marked down everything. That was followed by a July
rally. And in early August, stocks and bonds took another tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Expect more of the same: lots of action without much direction. &QL;

   Devaluing the yuan so that Chinese exports are cheaper is a
tempting short-term solution. It would undoubtedly produce a spike
in exports _ until China's neighbors responded with their own
devaluations and set off a trade war that no side would win and
that would be blamed on the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation would probably kill China's attempt to gain entry to
the World Trade Organization this year or next.
</P>
<P>
   That the Chinese are even willing to consider devaluation is a
sign of how dire the situation is. China's leaders know that a
deflationary spiral, once in place, can last for a decade or more _
all they have to do is look across the narrow sea for proof of
that.
</P>
<P>
   And domestic stability in China depends on strong economic
growth. China needs to add 7.5 million jobs a year just to hold
unemployment steady at the current 10 percent in cities and 30
percent in the countryside. The regime knows that the hope of a
better tomorrow is essential to contain potential unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting what China will do is almost impossible _ the
country's course of action depends on massive political and
complicated internal struggles.
</P>
<P>
   It is that unpredictability that will send the bond market (and
with it parts of the equity market) into a speculative tizzy from
time to time over the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike (or two) nor the
devaluation of the yuan would mean the end of the world, but worry
over those two issues certainly helps set the stage for those who
believe the YK2 problem will cause the demise of civilization as we
know it. &QL;

   No one knows what the widespread use of two-digit year dates in
computer software will do to computer systems around the world in
January 2000. The absence of major problems so far _ computer
systems that make payments or order inventory, for example, have
been coping with the dating issue for months now _ makes it likely
that any blowups will be localized.

uncertainty, investors tend to see a monster under every bed. &QL;

   What's the likely effect of these worries on the stock market
during the next several months? In each case, at the moment, the
risk is all on the downside.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is already reflected in the prices of financial
assets; the bad news is just starting to get factored in. In
situations like that, investors tend to sell at the first sign of
real or imagined trouble.
</P>
<P>
   During May and June, that led to an over-sold market as
investors marked down everything. That was followed by a July
rally. And in early August, stocks and bonds took another tumble.
</P>

   Expect more of the same: lots of action without much direction. &QL;

<P>
   It doesn't get much better than this _ and that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. economy _ dubbed Goldilocks by many, because
like the perfect porridge it's neither too hot nor too cold _ faces
a number of scares in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three bears _ the Federal Reserve Board, China, and
YK2 _ is likely to be ferocious enough to send the fair-haired girl
tumbling out the window, but together they will be enough to keep
the stock market on edge for at least the remainder of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for more volatility as investors hop from sector to
sector and stock to stock trying to find one that's just right.
</P>
<P>
   The current stock market is priced for perfection. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index, for example, traded on July 16 at 36.97
times earnings for the previous 12 months. That record
price-to-earnings ratio fully incorporates what looks like a great
year for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter U.S. equity strategist Peter Canelo,
for one, projects that earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 will increase by 14
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs to search too hard to find the forces behind that
whopping increase. The improving global economy has produced
growing sales volume for those multinational companies that took
the biggest hit in the global crisis of 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to firming prices for the goods they sell and very modest
increases in the costs of the raw materials and labor they buy,
corporations have seen those increased sales volumes multiply by
the time they hit the bottom line as earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Morgan Stanley estimates that non-farm worker
productivity in the U.S. increased by 2.6 percent in the year ended
in June 1999, the best rate of increase in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, because wages haven't climbed much while
productivity has, the cost of a unit of labor increased by less
than 1 percent during the same period. That's the first time in
three years corporations have seen their labor costs rise by less
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This state of perfection can't last much longer _ according to
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after almost a year of looking for the ghosts of
inflation without finding any, the central bankers found enough to
scare themselves into raising short-term interest rates by 25 basis
points (100 basis points equal one percentage point).
</P>
<P>
   In his July 22 testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned that the Fed didn't think one hike would
solve the problem. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which
had fallen below 5.9 percent, rapidly climbed back above 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't seem to make much of a case for a resurgence
of inflation, but a majority of the Fed governors are determined to
shoot first and ask questions later. And for investors, that
matters much more than the quality of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market believes the Fed is serious about raising rates,
and that will put downward pressure on stocks. The pressure is
likely to continue until the bankers remove the uncertainty by
actually doing what investors now fear.
</P>
<P>
   Look to May and June of 1999 as a model for how the markets will
behave _ sinking on the worry and rallying on the news, even if the
news is a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that almost certainly would deter the Federal Reserve
would be a resurgence of the financial crisis that rocked Asia in
1998. The region is clearly not out of the woods yet. The recovery
in Korea and Thailand appears to be real, but fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Japan cannot convincingly shake its recession. And now China
shows signs that it is considering a devaluation of its currency,
the yuan, an act that would send the area back into turmoil. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese could be on the verge of a Japanese-style
deflationary spiral. Consumer prices have fallen in China for 21
consecutive months. At the same time, the Chinese savings rate has
climbed to 42 percent of household income _ people are putting
money away for an increasingly uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, growth in the gross domestic product has slowed in
each year since 1996, and last year China's economy grew by a
lackluster 4 percent, according to non-governmental economists (the
Chinese government claims GDP grew by 7.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The glut of manufactured goods such as televisions is so great
that even price cuts of 25 percent can't clear the market. In some
industries, companies have closed factories for months to reduce a
mountain of inventory. That, of course, just increases fear (and
cuts incomes) and sends consumer spending lower. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It has important converts among Wall Street's most visible
strategists. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has even
acknowledged that it could be valid. And it clearly does a better
job than the conventional wisdom of explaining how quarter after
quarter of economic growth at better than 4 percent can coexist
with low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect what's known as the New Paradigm to stop the
Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. Even though the
numbers don't make an airtight case for a need to raise rates to
head off inflation, no one among the Federal Reserve's board of
governors wants to go down as a martyr to a new economic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem facing the Federal Reserve _ and investors
trying to map a path through the current turmoil in the financial
markets. Conventional economic wisdom says the economy can grow
only just so fast before it starts to overheat. The exact speed
limit for the economy varies from expert to expert _ some say 2
percent, others 2.5 percent, and a few radicals crawl out on a limb
and mention 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that debate isn't important now, because the economy is
clearly growing at a speed that puts it off the dial. First-quarter
gross domestic product grew by 4.1 percent. And that's just the
latest in a string of quarters all well above the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   By now, according to the conventional wisdom, the economy ought
to be showing serious signs of an uptick in inflation. Wages should
be climbing in a steepening spiral. Prices for everything from raw
materials to capital equipment to consumer goods should be marching
higher day by day.
</P>
<P>
   But through the first third of the year, there were no signs of
those inflationary pressures. Yes, labor markets were tight, but
hourly earnings climbed just 0.2 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum producers continued to plan for lower prices; computer
makers, still struggling with the bottom-line consequences of
$1,000 PCs, worried about prices falling below $800; and consumer
companies were, by and large, cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional economics at a loss to explain the persistence
of above-the-speed-limit growth and low inflation, more and more
economists are willing to give the New Paradigm a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on in the U.S. economy right now makes sense, this
theory holds, once you consider some of the consequences of the
profound changes in the U.S. economy in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, is the effect on domestic inflation of the
transformation from a manufacturing economy into a service-based
one? The New Paradigm answer: First, since imports of manufactured
goods make up a bigger slice of domestic consumption, excess global
industrial capacity reduces the inflationary effect of any U.S.
bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   If a U.S. manufacturer can't keep up with demand, a foreign
supplier probably can, so there should be no price hikes because of
scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the increasing percentage of U.S. goods coming from
overseas plays into the recent improvement in the distribution
infrastructure in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Just-in-time inventory, computerized stocking and delivery
systems, the Internet, superstores, and more have all worked to
reduce the costs of getting stuff to U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Third, productivity in service industries in the U.S. may
finally be starting to pick up after years of investment
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   In area after area _ the increased flow of pricing information
to consumers because of computer systems and the Internet, the new
global wage competition even in service industries, the increased
efficiency of financial markets _ the New Paradigm argues that
things are different now.
</P>
<P>
   In his May testimony to Congress, Alan Greenspan even
acknowledged that the New Paradigm might be onto something. But, in
retrospect, that was the high-water mark for the theory, at least
in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The economic numbers in May were just troubling enough to swing
the balance at the Fed back toward the conventional wisdom. For
example, the National Association of Purchasing Management's
Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 55.2 for May _ way above
April's 52.8.
</P>
<P>
   New-home sales soared 9.2 percent in April _ total numbers were
just shy of November's record _ and the average price climbed 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers aren't infallible harbingers of inflation. The
NAPM index has jumped like this before without producing inflation
at the wholesale or consumer level. (Anything above 50 indicates
prices are climbing.)
</P>
<P>
   The surge in housing sales and prices is at least partially a
reaction to rising interest rates _ consumers jump to buy when they
fear mortgage rates are headed up.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the bond market was spooked: The yield on the
30-year Treasury bond hit 5.96 percent on June 2, up from the low
of 4.72 percent in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And that has put the Fed in a tough political position. If the
central bankers decide not to act after the bond market has clearly
signaled it sees signs of inflation, they risk losing part of their
hard-won credibility as inflation fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that the Fed has gone soft would, perversely, send the
bond market lower and set interest rates above the levels that Fed
would prefer.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-basis-point hike this summer would, on the other hand,
demonstrate the Fed's toughness and reassure the markets. And such
a hike might even actually fend off inflation _ just in case the
conventional wisdom about the economy is right.
</P>
<P>
   So let's calculate the odds. On the side of an interest rate
hike: a need to protect Federal Reserve credibility, a desire to
calm the U.S. bond market, some worrisome statistics indicating
that inflation may be kicking up, and the conventional economic
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Against the rate hike: the potentially correct _ but ultimately
untested _ theories of the New Paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't sound like much of a contest, does it? &QL;

RICHARD THOMPSON'S `MOCK TUDOR' SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY FINN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His fans constitute as devoted a cult as any in music, and many
of his more celebrated peers openly worship his work as both a
songwriter and rock guitarist. All that praise and envy, however,
only perpetuate Richard Thompson's title as the most popular
musician no one's heard of _ even, it seems, in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``No review of a Richard Thompson album is complete without a
plea for a larger audience to discover his rare virtues,'' wrote
Anthony DeCurtis in his recent Rolling Stone review of Thompson's
new record, ``Mock Tudor.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has plenty of virtues, though they aren't necessarily
all that rare. ``Mock Tudor'' is yet another strong, smart,
well-produced Thompson record. It's spiked with the kinds of tart,
aromatic traits that never get by the guards' desks at most
commercial//Top 40 radio stations: irony, commentary, misery,
politics, sarcasm and wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a choice,'' Thompson said recently from Eugene,
Ore. ``I'm not commercial. I don't play mainstream American music,
so I'm sidelined slightly. The audience has to make an extra effort
to find my music, and I have to make an extra effort to find my
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the past 10 years alone, Thompson has put out at least
as many acclaimed studio records as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen or
Tom Petty, artists who sell out arenas and amphitheaters but don't
need to spend half a day in a hotel (registered under their given
names) taking redundant phone calls from music journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Thompson's) career,'' music commentator Tim Riley once wrote,
``is a lesson in how even major labels falter with even the
greatest pop talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Britain, where Thompson helped invent folk rock 30 years
ago as a founding member of Fairport Convention, he doesn't get the
recognition he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   The cover story on the August issue of Q, a British pop music
magazine, was titled ``100 Greatest Stars of the 20th Century _ As
Voted by You!'' John Lennon (No. 1) and Paul McCartney (No. 2) were
on the cover. Inside, however, among a list of artists that
included George Michael, Oasis and Liam Howlett of Prodigy,
Thompson's name is absent. Granted the list includes lots of
ephemeral pop stars, but it also includes many ``prestige'' artists
such as Bob Dylan, Nick Drake, Patti Smith, Lou Reed and Ravi
Shankar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, George Michael: There you go,'' Thompson said, chuckling
dismissively. Though later, he said, ``I'd like to see a copy of
that list.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's low profile in America is less baffling. He is a wry,
low-key, well-educated Englishman. ``I don't really have an
image,'' he said. ``Perhaps I should work on one.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, his music style is ecumenical, blending folk,
rock, blues, jazz and Celtic music, and his tunes can get pretty
epic, acerbic and indulgent, even for some of Thompson's most loyal
fans. ``No recent Thompson albums have been free of clunkers,''
wrote a Dirty Linen critic in a positive review, ``and `Mock Tudor'
is no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of Thompson's best songs, particularly his ballads like
``Tear Stained Letter,'' ``Dimming of the Day'' and ``Withered and
Died,'' set dark, simple lyrics afloat on stunning pop melodies, a
formula that can easily evoke a Top 40 aroma.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was to ever have a hit,'' Bonnie Raitt once said, ``it
would mean that the bar of excellence would have been raised so
much in pop music that I would lay down and flop like a fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its pop virtues, ``Mock Tudor'' isn't likely to set her
flopping. It's a concept album of sorts, split into three,
four-song segments, each addressing a different phase of life in
suburban London. However, it does include several tunes that would
fit perfectly in several radio formats.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping they'd help him produce something a bit more
``accessible,'' Capitol Records suggested Thompson hire fashionable
producers Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf, who have worked with
younger, successful artists like Beck, the Foo Fighters and, most
notably, Elliott Smith, a singer-songwriter whose style is as
eclectic and distinct as Thompson's. The results are very
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sibella'' will oblige anybody fond of the melodic
pop//roots-rock styles of guys like Petty or John Mellencamp;
``Bathsheba Smiles'' is a brisk folk-rock tune built on a twist of
the bass line from the Police's ``Every Breath You Take''; the
opener, ``Cooksferry Queen,'' is a folkabilly jaunt studded with
tasty bits of rock guitar and blues harp; and ``Walking the Long
Miles Home'' is a sweet bone for the country-folk crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Overall Thompson has produced a record with lots of durable,
``accessible'' pop sounds and textures without compromising his
standards or corking his intellect.
</P>
<P>
   He still drops in highfalutin, academic words and phrases like
``oracles'' and ``pre-Raphaelite hair'' and references to people
like Jack Kerouac and Marie Antoinette; he still musters clouds of
gloom, doom and presuicidal dread; and he still composes the
occasional long, gray acoustic-folk tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose there's music that I want to hear that I don't hear
other people doing,'' Thompson once told Dirty Linen magazine,
``and because it doesn't exist, I have to do it. Or else become a
seething psychopath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mock Tudor'' has less of that kind of psychopathology than
other Thompson records. Nonetheless, so far it has prompted a
typically faint commercial response, less of one, even, than new
records by John Prine and Nanci Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson seems pretty weary of that kind of talk _ about why so
much of his fine music has found a relatively small audience; or
why at times he is so maddeningly forgotten and peripheral.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Rolling Stone ran a list of ``200 essential rock
records.'' Though the Rolling Stone Album Guide ranked several of
Thompson's albums between ``excellent'' and ``classic,'' none made
the magazine's Top 200 list. Jackson Browne's ``Late for the Sky''
and Billy Joel's ``Greatest Hits'' both made the Top 200 list,
though both received fewer stars in the Album Guide than several
Thompson records. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's ambitious,'' he said. ``Everyone wants to sell more
records and get more people into the clubs. It's great to have the
very loyal fans I have. Bless 'em all. And, yes, it's always great
to hear that other musicians like my music. Frankly that's the
highest form of praise: respect from your fellow musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe David Byrne, a fellow musician who is also a devotee,
found the right perspective when he said a while back:
``Personally, being somewhat envious of Richard's songwriting and
guitar playing, it's somewhat satisfying that he's not yet achieved
household-name status. It serves him right for being so good.''

BORN YESTERDAY? NO, BORN IN '81 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM JANICKE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ponder this:
</P>
<P>
   To the average 18-year-old college freshman, John Lennon and
John Belushi are just as dead as Johann Sebastian Bach. In fact,
the average freshman might never have heard of Lennon or Belushi.
</P>
<P>
   During this freshman's life there has always been a woman on the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And there has always been a disease called AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   You see, today's 18-year-old doesn't use the same cultural
calipers that baby boomers do. Today's freshman wore Underoos and
Swatch watches, played with Cabbage Patch dolls and watched
``Family Ties,'' ``Inspector Gadget'' and ``Diff'rent Strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Talkin' 'bout my g-g-generation?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. These young'uns put the Who's Pete Townshend in the same
dustbin with Pete Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with this generation gap, tiny Beloit College (1,200
students) in Beloit, Wis., has compiled a list of the ways in which
freshmen differ in their frames of reference from teachers as well
as from those just a few years older than they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Nief, public affairs director of the college, says the list
was compiled informally two years ago and originally circulated by
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently it slipped over the edge of campus,'' Nief said,
``and out into the Internet world.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Nief and others polled faculty, staff and students and
built a new list, called the Class of 2003 Mindset List.
</P>
<P>
   That Lennon and Belushi are almost unknown to the current
freshman class does not surprise Nief that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``But talk about Kurt Cobain, and that's their touchstone,''
Nief said. ``For them, that's the day the music died.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Newsweek have published
the list. A Beloit faculty member appeared on ``Today'' earlier
this month to explain it. Marketers, churches, missionaries and
members of the military have begged copies of the list.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, The Star decided to test the list by convening a
very informal focus group: four freshmen from the University of
Missouri-Kansas City. The students, all 18, volunteered to help The
Star dissect the Beloit list. These freshmen, Tosha Carter, Michele
Mazzara, Aaron Beck and Amanda Lehenbauer, argued that some of the
Beloit entries should be changed, others eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   All four drew a blank when confronted with names of Lennon and
Belushi, although a light gradually came on when one remembered
reruns of Belushi on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon, however, was fuzzier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of him,'' Lehenbauer said. ``Isn't Lennon, like, a
singer?''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether anyone could hum the theme from recent
motion picture ``Inspector Gadget,'' the four broke into a chant:
</P>
<P>
   ``Da da da da dat, duh, dat duh, dat duh ... ''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a condensed and refined version of the Beloit
lists of '98 and '99 as modified by The Star and the UMKC students.
In addition, the student group helped define The Star's list of
Kansas City cultural anomalies for 18-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the class of 2003, this year's college freshman class,
was born in 1981. Consider these facts about them:
</P>
<P>
   1. To them, John Lennon and John Belushi have always been dead.
</P>
<P>
   2. There has always been a woman on the Supreme Court, and women
have always been traveling into space.
</P>
<P>
   3. They have never heard Walter Cronkite say ``That's the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   4. They were born and grew up with desktop computers, NutraSweet
and fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Cats'' has been on Broadway all their lives.
</P>
<P>
   6. They never heard anyone say, ``Book 'em, Dano,'' ``Kiss mah
grits'' or ``I'd walk a mile for a Camel.''
</P>
<P>
   7. They barely remember Madonna when she was ``Like a Virgin.''
</P>
<P>
   8. To them, ``adult'' usually means ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   9. They don't understand why Solidarity is spelled with a
capital s.
</P>
<P>
   10. They don't think there is anything terribly futuristic about
2001 and were never concerned about the year 1984.
</P>
<P>
   11. They have never seen white smoke over the Vatican and do not
know its significance. There has been only one pope.
</P>
<P>
   12. They do not remember the Cold War but recall the breakup of
the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   13. For them, there has always been AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   14. They've witnessed the demise of vinyl: The compact disc was
introduced when they were 1 year old.
</P>
<P>
   15. They have never played Pac-Man and have never heard of Pong.
</P>
<P>
   16. The special effects in ``Star Wars'' don't impress them.
</P>
<P>
   17. They have always had a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   18. They don't remember Vietnam, but it's not as ancient to them
as WWI and WWII because they know Vietnamese immigrants or their
children and veterans who fought there.
</P>
<P>
   19. They do not care who shot J.R. and have no idea who J.R. is.
</P>
<P>
   20. They are the first generation to be born into Luvs, Huggies
and Pampers.
</P>
<P>
   Reminisce with the old-timers born in 1981. The class of 2003:
</P>
<P>
   1. Can explain ``cha-ching.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Knows the profound meaning of ``Wax on, wax off.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Knows who Tina Yothers is.
</P>
<P>
   4. Can hum the theme to ``Inspector Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Wanted to be on ``Star Search.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Wore banana clips or knew someone who did.
</P>
<P>
   7. Owned Cabbage Patch dolls.
</P>
<P>
   8. Knows what Willis was ``talkin' 'bout.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Holds a special place in its heart for ``Back to the
Future.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1. The cat snuggles under the covers instead of sleeping at the
end of the bed.

in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   3. We see our breath as we leave for school.

gloves?''
</P>

beautiful fall colors on the way.

FIGHT BROWN PATCH WITH GOOD CULTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: What can I use on my St. Augustine lawn for brown
patch?
</P>
<P>
   A: Brown patch, ``Rhizoctonia solani,'' is a fungal disease that
mars many a lawn when day temperatures cool to the 75- 85-degree
range and night temperatures drop below 68. Rainfall encourages the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms on warm-season grasses such as Bermuda grass or St.
Augustine include circular to irregular patches of light brown,
thinned grass. You'll notice a grayish ``smoke ring'' of wilted
grass at the edges of the infected area. Leaf sheaths become
rotted, and the blade will separate from the runner with a gentle
pull.
</P>
<P>
   The patches may enlarge to several yards in diameter. And as the
disease spreads, new green leaves may emerge in the center of the
patches.
</P>
<P>
   The best treatment for brown patch is good culture to lessen the
severity of the disease:
</P>
<P>
   _ Water only as needed and early in the day to allow the grass
to dry quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Overwatering can promote the fungal disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ Apply a slow-release or organic fertilizer in spring when the
grass greens and begins to grow. Apply a slow-release or organic
fertilizer in the fall to encourage good root growth over the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Overfertilizing also can promote the disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improve the turfgrass root system with good drainage and
aeration to reduce damage caused by brown patch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use bio-stimulants to boost the population of beneficial
organisms in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mow at the proper height _ about 2 1/2 inches for St.
Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mow frequently, removing no more than a third of the blade
height.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leave clippings on the lawn to break down and replenish
nutrients. However, remove if there are large accumulations
resulting from infrequent mowing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid thatch buildup. Fungicides destroy beneficial soil
organisms that would otherwise help eliminate thatch.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners use the following baking soda treatment to
discourage brown patch:
</P>
<P>
   Mix 4 teaspoons baking soda per gallon of water. Add 1 teaspoon
liquid soap or vegetable oil to the mixture. Spray on the foliage
only _ avoid soil contact as much as possible. Baking soda is made
of sodium and bicarbonate, both necessary soil elements, but only
in small amounts.
</P>
<P>
   There are several fungicides that target brown patch; ask your
nurseryman for suggestions. And please avoid polluting runoff if
you do use a fungicide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What hardy flowers can I plant for winter in shady and
filtered light areas? Pansies got leggy last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asian jasmine was planted in a 15-foot by 20-foot area early
this spring. It is spreading nicely but has not gotten to the thick
mat stage. When and what do I feed it?
</P>
<P>
   A: My favorite cool-season flower is ``Primula obconica,'' a
primrose available in subdued shades of blue, rose, lavender and
white. It actually is a short-lived perennial here. Those I planted
last fall bloomed until it got hot. The annual, jewel-toned
primroses, ``P. polyantha,'' are usually more readily available.
</P>
<P>
   You could use sweet alyssum with either of these or the
low-growing but brilliantly colored edging lobelia.
</P>
<P>
   I have enjoyed dianthus in partial shade. It likes an organic
soil and needs good drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclamen could be added in late fall. Ask your nurseryman for
those appropriate for the garden. I like those in the `Laser'
series.
</P>
<P>
   Plant high. A sandy loam is ideal, and good drainage is a must.
While the plants like a soil on the moist side, avoid overwatering.
Remove spent blooms and foliage. Sweet alyssum and maidenhair ferns
are good garden companions.
</P>
<P>
   It takes awhile for the jasmine to thicken. It is most vigorous
spring into summer, so I would apply a water-soluble, balanced
formula just before growth really takes off and perhaps again in
May. However, if it is growing well, I would not overfertilize.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture during dry periods will help. You can use an organic
mulch to cover any bare spots and encourage good soil health.
</P>
<P>

THE LAST FRONTIER ISN'T THE SAME PLACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Just back from a cruise vacation in Alaska, I'm
thumbing through scrapbooks and rekindling fond memories.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a photograph of an all-but-deserted main street _ the
only real street _ in Skagway, once the center of Klondike
gold-rush fever but with a permanent population now of only about
900.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the legendary Red Dog Saloon in the heart of Juneau, the
unlikeliest of state capitals with a glacier in its back yard and
no accessibility by road
</P>
<P>
   And if ever the cliche ``quaint'' is appropriate, it applies to
Ketchikan's Creek Street, seen as essentially a walking path beside
a creek in which thousands of salmon swim unbothered.
</P>
<P>
   America's ``Last Frontier,'' Alaska is dubbed. My scrapbooks
attest to that billing.
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem: The scrapbooks are 14 years old. I've dusted
off their covers to make certain that my mind isn't playing tricks.
</P>
<P>
   With only a sprinkling of cruise ships plying the waters of
southeast Alaska's Inside Passage in 1985, those of us arriving on
Cunard's Sagafjord were as much a novelty to the residents of
Skagway, Juneau and Ketchikan as they _ and their peaceful
communities _ were to us. Natives were thrilled at the chance to
show off their authentic treasures. They cared more about our
appreciative smiles than the greenbacks in our wallets.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned four years ago on a work assignment, I found
considerable change, inevitable given the fast-developing cruise
market. Even the Red Dog Saloon had moved closer to the dock so
that tourists could make it a convenient first _ and last _ stop in
Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that experience didn't prepare me for what I discovered
on this vacation.
</P>
<P>
   A combined 3,700 passengers from Celebrity's Galaxy and Mercury
cruise ships _ more than four times the town's population _
literally took over tiny Skagway, jamming its shops and sidewalks
and giving it more of a theme-park personality than that of a
frontier village.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days are even busier,'' said one storekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   A midday departure on the scenic White Pass &AMP; Yukon rail route
was in such demand that 28 passenger cars were required,
necessitating two trains each propelled by three diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   The first shops passengers now encounter _ if you don't count
the discount barns newly erected beside the dock _ are Starbucks
and Little Switzerland, an outlet specializing in jewelry, crystal
and fragrances, and familiar to anyone who has sailed in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Many other establishments are managed by seasonal residents only
to capitalize on the tourist trade and primed to return to the
``Lower 48'' when the Alaska cruise calendar ends this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchikan, a town of 14,000 residents invaded by four ships with
a combined 8,000 passengers on the day of my visit, brought more
surprises. Creek Street remains an attractive lure. So does the
town's collection of beautiful totem poles. But they are now
surrounded by shops that include Diamonds International, Tanzanite
International, Colombian Emeralds International and Princess World
Jewelers. Indeed, 14 of 17 businesses listed in the Galaxy's
``Recommended Shopping'' guide specialize in some sort of glitter.
</P>
<P>
   Is this really the Last Frontier? Or was I strolling the streets
of towns on many Caribbean islands whose distinct individual
attributes too often become lost amid a frenzied competition to
capture the biggest share of a traveler's spending dollar _ even if
it means hanging out shingles that say as much about the native
culture as Kmart and Wal-Mart reveal about Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm jaded. I've long resented people who possess a
``Nothing's as good as it used to be'' attitude; but am I also
living too much in the past? Most passengers from the Galaxy
flocked into as many jewelry stores and T-shirt shops as time
permitted. I heard few complaints. More than 30 cruise ships now
traverse the Inside Passage each summer, and seldom does one depart
without a capacity load.
</P>
<P>
   These cruises have introduced Skagway, Ketchikan and Juneau to
millions of travelers who likely would never visit otherwise. John
Mazor, president of the Juneau Convention and Visitors Bureau,
recently told the New York Times that passenger arrivals this year
in his city of 30,000 residents will total about 590,000, quadruple
the number at the start of the decade. This accounts for most of
the estimated $75 million annually that Juneau businesses earn from
tourist expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska cruise remains rewarding, too, especially if your ship
visits Glacier Bay National Park _ where a strict permit system
curbs mass visitation _ or Prince William Sound, spectacular
retreats far removed from the crowded ports.
</P>
<P>
   The ``real Alaska'' also remains on vivid display during scores
of optional shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise land tours.
Touch down on a remote glacier by helicopter. Visit a bald eagle
preserve. Spy for whales and bears. Fish for salmon (but not on
Creek Street, at least not yet).
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, however, are signs of the times. Dollar signs. Some
popular excursions now cost $200 or more per person. And these are
not included in the basic cruise fare.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while helicopter tours are embraced by tourists, their
impact on the environment is a continuing concern. According to The
New York Times, the U.S. Forest Service limited landings on the
Juneau Ice Field to 400 when it first issued a permit in 1984. Now,
four helicopter companies are allowed a total of 19,039 landings
per year, and have petitioned for twice that. The Forest Service is
studying the effects these tours have on wildlife and noise
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   As many Caribbean islands already have learned, the huge
economic benefits of mass cruise tourism must be weighed against
the toll taken on the local citizenry, culture and natural
environment.
</P>
<P>
   If travel along the Inside Passage continues to escalate, folks
in southeast Alaska may have to ask themselves some tough
questions. Otherwise, how sad if the frontier spirit is relegated
to photographs in a scrapbook.

EDUCATIONAL CRUISES LET GUESTS WRAP MINDS AROUND THE WORLD _ AT
ECONOMY PRICES 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jules Verne's Phileas Fogg made literary history when he
traveled ``around the world in 80 days'' in 1873.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, we can make the journey in a much shorter time.
But why try? The essence of travel involves much more than getting
from Point A to Point B, or, in the case of world travel, from
Point A to Point Z.
</P>
<P>
   We are more of the mind of Lord Chesterfield, the English
statesman, who wrote, ``Those who travel heedlessly from place to
place, observing only their distance from each other, and attending
only to their accommodation at the inn at night, set out fools, and
will certainly return so.''
</P>
<P>
   Chesterfield's words, written in 1747, could serve as a motto
for World Cruise Co., a new enterprise specializing in
circumnavigations of the world. Its itineraries, which will begin
in November, focus on intriguing ports of call, cultural
interaction and educational enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Sam Blyth likens his vessel to a floating
university. Crew members are explorers and teachers, and the staff
is complemented by a team of specialists who will share their
expertise on subjects ranging from botany to archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no division between staff and lecturers and guests,''
explains Blyth, a Canadian who also founded Marine Expeditions.
``Travelers get to know everyone on the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   And while several cruise lines boast around-the-world
itineraries, World Cruise Co. also distinguishes itself by its
pricing: Fares generally will be one-half to two-thirds those of
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started World Cruise Co. because we wanted to provide the
best educational cruise programs at an economical price,'' Blyth
says.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy has served Blyth's Marine Expeditions well.
Since its founding in 1993, the company has become the leader in
travel to Antarctica, taking about 7,000 passengers a year to the
ends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   World Cruise Co.'s lone vessel isn't new: The 20,000-ton Ocean
Explorer I made its debut in 1944 as a World War II troop ship. In
the interim, it has been known by several names, most notably the
Emerald Seas during years of popular twice-weekly sailings from
Miami to the Bahamas. The ship served as a floating hotel during
the 1998 World Exposition in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   It has been completely refurbished for these long-distance
voyages and boasts 385 staterooms (with an average size of 240
square feet, larger than on most ships), a dining room for
open-seating meals, a boutique, a hair salon, a fitness center,
four lounges, three bars, a heated outdoor pool, a 150-seat cinema
and a large library with computers for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   One of the company's more ambitious programs is its ``Year at
Sea,'' which will comprise 361 days, seven continents, 55 countries
and 103 ports. Prices start at $35,947, or just under $100 a day,
including air fare from New York.
</P>
<P>
   This year-round adventure, which will include visits to
Antarctica and the Arctic, will set sail Nov. 20 from Athens,
Greece. Other trip highlights include Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Bora
Bora; Australia's Great Barrier Reef; the Suez and Panama canals;
Ho Chi Min City, Vietnam; Reykjavik, Iceland; and Alaska's Inside
Passage.
</P>
<P>
   A unique feature of the ``Year at Sea'' is the scheduled
vacation from your vacation. Midway through the year, passengers
will be able to fly home (or as close as New York City) free from
Trinidad, then rejoin the ship two weeks later in Lima, Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The line also offers several cabins for cruisers' friends and
family members, who will get low rates for short-term stays aboard
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers can choose from more than 450 shore excursions during
the year, many priced as low as $30.
</P>
<P>
   For adventurers who don't have a year to spare, the line's
inaugural season features three segments of the ``Year at Sea''
with diverse around-the-world itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   The first is ``Last Frontiers,'' a 127-day cruise that will call
on 22 countries and Antarctica. Departing with the year-round
cruisers Nov. 20 from Athens, passengers will celebrate New Year's
Day in Chile before heading to the game parks of Africa. Prices
start at $12,995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Worlds,'' a 116-day tour departing Athens on March 26,
will explore the mysteries of past civilizations, including those
of Peru, Vietnam, Egypt, Israel and Easter Island.
</P>
<P>
   Departing Athens on July 20, the 118-day ``Northern Exposures''
will take passengers to destinations such as Norway, Russia, India
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for these cruises start at $11,890.
</P>
<P>
   (By comparison, brochure prices for the Crystal Symphony's
104-day world cruise in early 2000 start at $39,660 and peak at
$180,840 for the exclusive Crystal Penthouse; prices for a 96-day
voyage to 38 ports beginning in January aboard Holland America's
new Rotterdam range from $27,135 to $138,225; and fares for a
104-day sailing to 37 ports starting that month aboard Cunard's QE2
start at $27,020.)
</P>
<P>
   Solo cruisers accustomed to paying high single supplements will
appreciate the 40 Ocean Explorer I cabins set aside just for them.
</P>
<P>
   One factor to keep in mind: Like the shore excursions, port
charges and gratuities are not included in the base fares and can
add significantly to the cost of the long cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge University graduate Blyth is especially proud of his
new line's educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to lectures on topics ranging from investing to wine
tasting, Blyth says, ``At any hour, there will be about five
activities from which to choose. We'll have 30 full-time faculty
aboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Blyth says he sails on his Marine Expedition ships ``a couple of
times each year'' but spends most of his time traveling around
North America and visiting with prospective and past cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educating the traveler is a big factor in our success,'' Blyth
says. ``These people effectively are living with us for three or
four months, so it is important that they know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with clients also gives Blyth ideas for future projects,
such as an upcoming Pole-to-Pole World Expedition. This 110-day
itinerary with Marine Expeditions will depart New York by air March
2. Participants will board the 128-passenger Marine Discovery in
Ushuaia, Argentina, often called the End of the World.
</P>
<P>
   After stops in Antarctica, the expedition will sail on to
Australia's Macquarie Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Seychilles,
Kenya and the Suez Canal. Other ports of call will put cruisers in
Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Iceland. The final port will be
Sondre Stromfjord in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of this trip starts at $13,775, including air fare from
New York.

AIRLINES' NET OFFERINGS HAVE OPENED UP SKIES TO EVERYDAY TRAVELER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A recent air fare sale by major airlines came with an
Internet-inspired twist.
</P>
<P>
   The industry-wide sale in early August began the way such sales
always do. One carrier launches an across-the-board markdown, and
others, saying they must compete, follow. In this case, Northwest
Airlines announced 25 percent discounts and other carriers matched.
</P>
<P>
   However, Delta Air Lines jumped in with something new: Buy
tickets through its Web site and get an extra discount of up to 10
percent. As with the traditional discounts, other airlines followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the past few years getting its Internet legs, the
industry is stepping up efforts to get travelers to buy tickets
from airline-owned Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are offering a variety of promotions, including
discounts or extra frequent flier miles, for booking on their Web
sites. Last-minute deals are hawked through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites sell vacation packages or let travelers make hotel
and car reservations. A few airlines even let passengers buy
tickets on other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Sites also are being tapped as customer service tools.
Itineraries, seating charts and frequent flier information may be
available, depending on the carrier.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, customers can expect faster and easier use of the
sites. Carriers are likely to expand offerings, allowing users to
buy event tickets or make restaurant reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've opened the door a little bit and realized, oh my God,
there's a huge world out there. There's so much to do,'' said
Michael Cavanaugh, who oversees distribution and planning for
United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines embrace the Internet because sales through their sites
cost them less than those by travel agents, who still handle the
bulk of ticket transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic highway also gives carriers new ways to sell
seats that otherwise might go empty.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some debate, though, about whether, in the early
stage, the Internet actually hurts carriers' revenues. It remains
an open question.
</P>
<P>
   However, airlines aren't the only ones online. With virtual
travel agents such as Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) or
Microsoft's Expedia (www.expedia.msn.com) apparently here to stay,
airlines are investing in or forming partnerships with them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early players on the electronic commerce scene,
airlines began putting up Web sites in late 1994 and 1995. However,
for the most part, major carriers didn't let travelers buy tickets
online until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications, a New York-based Internet research
company, &UR;  &LR; projects online consumers this year will spend more than
$3.2 billion on airline reservations, with the number hitting $9.8
billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. airlines now collect an average of 3 to 5 percent of total
revenues from online channels, with the lion's share coming from
their Web sites, according to a recent Salomon Smith Barney report.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same for bookings: Airlines are logging an average of 3
to 5 percent of bookings from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are rising fast. Revenues and bookings from airline
sites are shooting up 200 to 500 percent year-over-year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing faster than we were able to predict,'' said John
Samuel, vice president of interactive marketing for American
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In its budget this year, American projected $320 million in
gross revenues would come through bookings on AA.com. It's on track
to hit $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest Airlines put up its site at the end
of 1995, adding a booking component in early 1997. The carrier did
$80 million in sales through nwa.com last year, and expects to
reach nearly $200 million for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty big jump,'' said Al Lenza, Northwest's vice
president of distribution. ``We certainly didn't expect it to grow
this fast, to a $200 million channel in 2 1/2 years.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's sales through continental.com, the Web site of
Houston-based Continental Airlines, hit the $100 million mark Sept.
9, showing a 186 percent year-to-date increase over 1998's $35
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet appeals to airlines for a variety of reasons. It
allows them to lower costs, add sales and reach customers in new
ways.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; For purchases through the carriers' sites, airlines don't pay
travel agent commissions or fees charged by computer reservations
systems used by agents, who still handle as much as 75 to 80
percent of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   With sales made through virtual travel agents, carriers pay
cheaper commissions but still pay reservations system fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most carriers are saving $20 to $40 per ticket compared with
non-online sales, the Salomon Smith Barney report said. As time
goes on, the savings could jump another $15 or so per ticket, the
report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Those buying online also are more likely to get electronic, or
paperless, tickets, which cost carriers less.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines also are tapping their Web sites to boost sales with
special Internet deals. Each carrier has its own program,but
generally customers register to be notified about the Internet
deals by e-mail, or the airline announces them on its own site.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers generally must take the trips within days, but a few
carriers have stretched the windows. Passengers are restricted on
when they can travel.
</P>
<P>
   Continental e-mails domestic specials on Wednesdays. Takers must
leave that Saturday and return Monday or Tuesday. A recent offer:
Houston-Indianapolis, $139 round trip.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail specials spur people to fly who otherwise wouldn't
have, said Jim Young, Continental's director of distribution
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, though, recently have questioned whether the
Internet has hurt revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The theory goes that since consumers have information available
directly to them, they can make better decisions about what they
will pay. There is no travel agent or airline reservations employee
to filter details.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has almost overnight downloaded near-perfect
information to the end users,'' said PaineWebber airline analyst
Sam Buttrick. ``Their decisions aren't going to be to spend more,
typically.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the Internet is a modest negative to the industry's
bottom linehbut hopes that within five years cost savings will
outweigh harm and it will switch to a modest positive.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines counter that consumers already can find the best
fares through travel agents or the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   A good agent can save travelers a lot more money than a Web
site, maintains Colorado-based aviation consultant Michael Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Internet is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any airline has a choice except to
participate,'' said Alan Bender, a professor of aeronautical
science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida.
``Consumers expect there to be a wealth of information on Web
sites.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if airlines don't offer their wares online, virtual travel
agents gladly would take the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're growing this channel aggressively because that's where
the customers are going,'' said William Reeves, general manager of
electronic commerce for Atlanta-based Delta. &QL;

HOUSTON: Atlanta-based Delta..
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airlines keep trying new ways to get passengers to their sites.
Even if lookers don't book immediately, carriers hope they will get
used to the sites and do so eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Delta tried a $2-per-round-trip surcharge for
tickets not booked through its Web site. Facing strong negative
reaction, the airline dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers give extra frequent flier points for booking
through their Web sites and offer discounts aimed at specific
markets or regions. Tempe, Ariz.-based America West, for example,
recently offered a discount for booking trips at its site to and
from a half-dozen Texas cities. Continental matched the deal.
</P>
<P>
   While airlines continue to offer narrow promotions, travelers
can expect to see more system-wide markdowns like the one Delta
initiated.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers also are constantly tinkering with their sites. Some
have made two, three or four major revisions. They aim for sites
that are easier and quicker to navigate, allowing passengers to
book travel with as few clicks as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The functionality and the technology is just now getting to
where it's customer-friendly,'' Reeves said. ``I would say we're
early in the cycle, and there's a lot coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers want more information without having to punch in
passwords, Continental's Young said. The airline responded by
moving the ability to check schedules up front, out from behind the
site's firewall.
</P>
<P>
   Continental, American and Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, like
others, also are moving their frequent flier programs online.
</P>
<P>
   As of this month, Southwest's Rapid Rewards members can enter a
password-protected area of the low-fare carrier's site to review
and update account information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly heard loud and clear our customers want more
access and better access to their frequent flier information,''
said Kevin Krone, director of marketing automation for Southwest.
``We think, we hope, when they're checking their account balance,
if they have a trip to purchase, they'll go ahead and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When members of American's frequent flier program log on to
personalized home pages, mileage totals appear automatically.
Members soon will be able to book flights online earned with
frequent flier points.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Continental's OnePass also can check account totals,
and Young said the carrier is looking into offering the ability to
book travel awarded through the program.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest buzzwords is personalization: Carriers want to
treat customers as individuals and market to them that way.
</P>
<P>
   At American, for example, frequent fliers can choose up to 10
cities or airports, and when they log on to their home pages, they
get messages about specials for those cities.
</P>
<P>
   Delta customers can get weekly e-mail specials for every market
or choose up to five departure cities.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers' targeted marketing efforts are just getting off the
ground, and airlines are likely to expand into tailoring e-mails by
using information gleaned from buying patterns of online customers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the initial Internet focus has been on reducing
distribution costs, but American's Samuel predicts that, in three
to five years, marketing will be the dominant topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the early stages of a real change in how marketing is
done for the airlines,'' Samuel said. The Internet ``facilitates
less-homogeneous marketing, and that is a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Carriers also are expanding their sites' offerings to allow
travelers to obtain details on flight itineraries or meal
selections; make hotel and car reservations; or get airport maps.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At the site for Elk Grove, Ill.-based United, travelers
searching for flights can select airlines other than United and
book tickets on them.
</P>
<P>
   United, figuring people coming to its site would be predisposed
toward United, decided to offer as a service the ability to book on
other carriers if it couldn't meet someone's needs, Cavanaugh said.
He said United also thought it important to provide a comparison of
fares.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 -30 percent of those booking through United's site
choose competitors, he said, a statistic United is satisfied with.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Harding, a marketing professor at California State
University, Long Beach, envisions that airline sites eventually
could offer everything from tickets to Broadway shows or sporting
events, to restaurant reviews and reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's sell everything we can sell since we've already got the
customer in the store,'' said Harding, an airline consultant.
``What the airlines are going to become is travel merchandisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines share the Internet with virtual travel agents.
Carriers view online agents as competition, models and partners. As
in the physical world, they realize some travelers aren't loyal to
brands and want easy comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different customers have different needs and, therefore, they
go to the channel that best suits these needs,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Turley of League City goes to Southwest's site for business
and personal trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's convenient, I go with Southwest on the
Internet,'' he said. ``I'm on the Net every day, so it's easier for
me to do than to pick up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Booking through Southwest's site, he said, also gets him extra
frequent flier credits, ``a major bonus'' for someone who flies two
or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie King, travel coordinator for Houston general
contractor US Builders, typically books four or five trips a week
via the Internet. Seventy-five percent are booked through
Continental's site because, she said, the employees like flying on
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers the Internet over a travel agent, which the office
previously used. It takes her less time and it is easier for her to
find the flights she wants, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to deal with anybody else,'' she said, adding
that she believes she's getting better deals.
</P>
<P>
   For Jason Presley of Houston, who typically buys tickets three
or four times a year, Travelocity makes more sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travelocity gives me the option of seeing the best price,'' he
said. ``That way, I don't have to go to Southwest's site, to
Continental's site, to American's site.''
</P>
<P>
   In its May report, Jupiter Communications concluded that
airlines, for the most part, lag online travel agencies in
investing in ``functionality, services and marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines look to online agencies for ideas on how to improve
their Web sites, said Melissa Shore, a digital commerce analyst at
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that airlines have a lot of potential to drive a
lot of traffic to their space. Brand is very important,'' she said.
``We are somewhat hesitant to say that they're performing as well
as they could have.''
</P>
<P>
   One way for carriers to see what would-be competitors are doing
is to join them.
</P>
<P>
   United and Internet retailer Buy.com recently announced they
will jointly create an online travel store to be called
BuyTravel.com.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Rosenbluth International, a business travel
management company, acquired Biztravel.com, a full-service business
travel agency. In the deal, Continental bought a minority stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us access to technology. It allows us to essentially
get in at the developer level,'' said Young of Continental. ``It's
a place we can go to understand where the technology is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's Lenza said carriers don't want to be left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to kind of cover your bases,'' he said. ``Nobody
knows who is going to be the winners and losers.''

 &HT;    CLINTON DEFENDS ACTIONS IN KOSOVO, URGES MORE U.N. ACTION TO
AVERT MASS KILLINGS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton defended the U.S.-led NATO air
campaign to end repression in Kosovo Tuesday, responding to
criticism that the action lacked the backing of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York,
Clinton said the NATO air strikes were consistent with ``several''
U.N. Security Council resolutions condemning Serb atrocities in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to act would have undermined U.N. principles, said
Clinton. He then took a swipe at his U.N. critics, suggesting that
theory is no substitute for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world,'' Clinton said, ``principles often collide,
and tough choices must be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks came a day after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan raised concerns over the NATO action in his own opening
address to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   NATO acted without a U.N. mandate in its 78-day air war against
Yugoslavia last spring. Of the five permanent U.N. Security Council
members, two _ Russia and China _ were opposed to NATO air strikes
against Serb-led Yugoslav troops and paramilitary gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming that those countries would have used their votes to
block a U.N. mandate for the mission, NATO opted to act alone
rather than risk a rebuff at the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there not a danger of such interventions undermining the
imperfect, yet resilient, security system created after the Second
World War,'' Annan said on Monday, ``and of setting dangerous
precedents for future interventions without a clear criterion to
decide who might invoke these precedents and in what
circumstances?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded that those risks were outweighed by the risks
of failing to act in Kosovo, where the majority ethnic Albanian
population was under attack by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we chosen to do nothing in the face of this brutality, I
do not believe we would have strengthened the United Nations,''
said Clinton, addressing the second day of the General Assembly _
and heads of state from most of the U.N.'s 188 member nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' said Clinton, ``we would have risked discrediting
everything it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also responded to Annan's long-standing criticism that
the international community _ and chiefly the United States _ did
little to stop the massacre of an estimated 800,000 civilians in
Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Without singling out the United States, Annan referenced the
tragedy, saying ``the genocide in Rwanda will define for our
generation the consequences of inaction in the face of mass
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also frequently cites Rwanda as a tragic example of
inaction. Tuesday, though, he said there were limits to what the
United States can do to counter violence in a world where more than
two dozen ethnic or regional conflicts continue to afflict
civilians and combatants alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that some are troubled that the United States and
others cannot respond to every humanitarian catastrophe in the
world,'' Clinton said. ``We cannot do everything everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton, who was criticized in some quarters for not acting
sooner than he did to end fighting in Bosnia, also cautioned
against lending false hope to embattled people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to say, 'Never again,' but much harder to make it
so,'' Clinton said, as the chief architects of his Balkans policy _
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National Security Adviser
Samuel Berger, and U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke _ looked on
from the cavernous General Assembly chamber at U.N. headquarters in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promising too much,'' Clinton said, ``can be as cruel as
caring too little.''
</P>
<P>
   With the U.N.'s latest peacekeeping operation _ the 50th such
mission in U.N. history _ entering its third day in East Timor,
Indonesia, the contentious themes of when and under what
circumstances the U.N. should support such missions dominated
Clinton's speech.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for increased efforts to address some of the
underlying factors in ethnic and regional conflict, challenging the
international community to ``wage an unrelenting battle,'' against
world poverty and its attendant ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still squandering the potential of far too many,'' said
Clinton, adding that ``1.3 billion people still live on less than a
dollar a day. More than half the population of many countries have
no access to safe water. A person in South Asia is 700 times less
likely to use the Internet as someone in the United States. And 40
million people a year still die of hunger, almost as many as the
total number killed in World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``We must refuse to accept a future in which one
part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy while
the other lives at the knife-edge of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's prescription, he said, would combine increased global
trade with aid increasingly targeting the world's poorest citizens
through micro-loans, education funding and assistance for mothers
and children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has asked Congress for $100 million for AIDS
prevention, counseling and care in Africa next year, said he plans
to convene a White House conference grouping public health experts,
pharmaceutical executives, members of Congress and others to find
ways to step up the provision of vaccines to developing countries
still suffering from epidemics of malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia
and other diseases all but banished from the industrialized world.

GETTING THE MOST FROM THE INTERNET: BETTER SHOP AROUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If you're looking for the best air fare deals, you
might not find them on the Internet. Then again, you might.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting the cheapest fares, experts say, is not to
lock yourself into one way of doing things, be it an airline's Web
site, a reservation call center, a flesh-and-blood travel agent or
an online agent.
</P>
<P>
   Getting good deals online can require time to comparison-shop
and research, say Laurie Berger, editor of Consumer Reports Travel
Letter, and Tom Parsons, editor of the travel Web site
Bestfares.com.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said travelers won't necessarily find cheaper fares
online unless they're booking last-minute deals offered by
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the September issue of the Travel Letter, she wrote a column
about Internet discounts headlined, ``What's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Many online deals, she wrote, are markdowns off rates few ever
pay, and often don't stack up to the prices obtained by shopping
around.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to restrictions and consider if an online
transaction is worth the hassle, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   To see if a Web-only fare is real, comparison-shop. She cited
Microsoft Expedia's Fare Compare, which she said charts the lowest
prices for any given itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers should go online, she said, because airlines are
experimenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to get the best deal is to really shop around,''
she said. ``Ask airlines directly. Ask travel agents. Look online.
Check around.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons agreed, saying the Internet isn't the 100 percent
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't solely depend on the Internet and you can't solely
depend on a travel agent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers should be aware that many booking search engines will
often search first or direct flights, which can be more expensive,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before being lured by free bonus points for booking on an
airline Web site, consider whether it's worth it, he said.
Researching online takes time initially, until you get familiar
with sites and services and how they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I like; the Internet can inform you at your pace,
on your time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he cautioned, don't lock yourself into one site. Others
are constantly adding new benefits and features.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Parsons points out his site posts continuous
lists of ``snooze, you lose deals'' that detail temporary fare
breaks offered by one or more airlines on specific routes.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, he said: ``If you see a stealin' deal, take it.''

 &HT;    Ministers bring message of change to Ohio with prayer breakfast
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Rev. Jimmy Adcox and the Rev. Laird Duran
aren't itinerant preachers by choice. ``We're just a couple of
local ministers who want to go back home,'' Adcox says.
</P>
<P>
   But ``home'' is Jonesboro, Ark., and because they were in the
wrong place at the right time, they now reluctantly find themselves
in demand.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, 1998, two boys at Westside Middle School pulled the
fire alarm and waited in a nearby woods as students and teachers
filed outside. Then they shot at them, killing four students and
one teacher.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Adcox, Duran and other Jonesboro ministers were
called upon to plan a memorial service, and they began to learn
what it takes to heal a grieving community.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson they shared Tuesday at the fourth annual Dayton
Prayer Breakfast, held in the Dayton Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The event drew 1,750 people, down from last year, when 3,000
attended. Event organizers said the decrease might have been
because the event was moved this year from spring to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for this year's breakfast was ``No Greater Time Than
Now: Prayer for the Youth of our City'' _ a fitting topic given
recent national tragedies such as the shootings at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., in April, said Dayton Mayor Mike
Turner, who hosts the event and chooses the guest speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Duran and Adcox were asked to come to Littleton to
assist clergy and counselors. This is only the third time they have
spoken publicly about their experiences, and they had mixed
feelings about speaking in Dayton, concerned that anyone might
think they are capitalizing on the tragedy. Another member of the
Jonesboro clergy scheduled to speak _ the Rev. Jack Harris _ pulled
out at the last minute. ``He feels an incredible closeness to the
kids at Westside, and he didn't want to be perceived as betraying
their trust and confidence in any way,'' Adcox explained.
</P>
<P>
   Duran described Jonesboro's Westside neighborhood as
country-turning-suburban, ``one of those places that is safe.''
When he heard about the shootings, he remembered thinking, ``This
isn't happening in my little town.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other clergy worked as a team, finding ways to help
friends and family members begin the hard work of healing, which
continues today. Some clergy still visit the school regularly.
There was never a trial _ the attackers were juveniles. So parents
were left to deal with their anger: ``Their child was dead, and
nothing happened.'' Helping them deal with anger became part of
Duran's ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them what to tell the people of Dayton,'' Duran said.
``One woman said, 'Tell them it's not the '50s anymore.' The world
has changed, and we need to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find new ways to minister. I used to think that
Lutherans did their thing, Baptists did their thing, and so on. But
we have our faith in common. These are all our children. We are
church. And we are called to look after all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Adcox praised the concept of a prayer breakfast, ``but it's not
enough to come together and pray. Prayers have to have feet and
hands.'' He urged the audience to make a difference in the life a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to be paralyzed by the spiritual devastation all
around us. Tell yourself, 'I can't do everything, but I can do
something. God, how can you use me?' ``

BUTTERSCOTCH CASHEW BARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the second of eight columns by Amy Scherber of Amy's Bread
in Manhattan. These columns are being written with Dorie
Greenspan.) 
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a child, my mother made lunch boxes that were the
envy of my friends, mostly because they always included a homemade
cookie, often these butterscotch cashew bars.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, I liked these cookies simply because they were
sweet. But as a professional baker, I appreciate them for the
contrasts they set up as the butterscotch almost fuses with the
nuts in the topping. The taste of salty toasted cashews against the
foolproof caramel topping is one delightful counterpoint, and the
texture of the lightly crumbly crust against the firm and chewy
topping is another. My grown-up self sees the bars as a
sophisticated sweet, while the kid in me sees a great snack.
</P>
<P>
   For all their character and appeal, these bars are quick to
make. The crust is really just a brown-sugar shortbread and can be
made by hand or in a mixer. The trick is to mix the dough only
until it is crumbly, not until it forms a ball. Similarly,
restraint is key when pressing the crust into the pan. Don't pack
it, just pat it, so that it keeps its crumbliness and maintains its
melt-on-the-tongue tenderness. If you press the crust down too
tightly it will be tough.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the shortbread crust crisp, bake it on its own, without
the topping, until it is lightly browned and just firm. As it
cools, combine the topping ingredients in a saucepan and cook;
then, spread this mixture over the crust and scatter it with salted
cashew pieces or, if you're really feeling flush, whole nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the nuts doesn't matter, but the salt does. It's the
salt in the recipe that creates the surprising contrast of flavors,
the one that makes this cookie fresh and fun.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm a purist, I use store-bought butterscotch chips for
their flavor and the way they melt so smoothly. And since we have
never been able to find a wholesale supplier for the chips, we have
to make a run down to the store for them. It's not the most
economical way for us to produce these cookies, but they are worth
the extra expense and, as the Michelin Guide would say, the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CASHEW BUTTERSCOTCH BARS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   { pound (2 sticks) plus 5{ tablespoons unsalted butter,
softened, plus butter for greasing pan
</P>
<P>
   } cup plus 2 tablespoons (packed) light-brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1} teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2{ cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces butterscotch chips, preferably Hershey's
</P>
<P>
   { cup plus 2 tablespoons light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   2{ cups salted cashew pieces.
</P>
<P>
   1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350
degrees. Butter a 13-by-18-inch jellyroll pan, including sides.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make the crust: in a mixer with a paddle, or in a bowl
with a rubber spatula, beat { pound plus 2 tablespoons butter and
all the brown sugar together until smooth. Stir salt into flour,
then add flour to butter and sugar mixture. Mix until dough is well
combined but still crumbly; if dough is mixed until a ball forms,
crust will be tough.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pat the dough evenly along bottom of buttered pan, taking
care not to pack the dough down. Place pan in oven, and bake 5
minutes. With a fork, prick dough deeply all over. Return pan to
oven to bake until dough is lightly browned, dry and no longer soft
to the touch, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack; do not
turn off the oven.
</P>
<P>
   4. To make butterscotch topping: In a large saucepan, combine
remaining 3{ tablespoons butter, butterscotch chips, corn syrup and
1 tablespoon plus 2{ teaspoons water. Place over medium heat, and
cook, stirring constantly, until butter and butterscotch chips are
melted, about 5 minutes. Pour topping over crust, using a spatula
to spread evenly all the way to the corners. Sprinkle cashew pieces
on top, pressing down lightly.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bake until topping is bubbly and cashews are lightly browned,
11 to 13 minutes. Transfer to a rack, and cool completely before
cutting into two-by-three-inch bars.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 36 bars.

FOR CHICKEN, A QUICK TRICK FOR ROASTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roast chicken is one of the most basic dishes in home cooking,
but most cooks have problems with it. Indeed, there are a couple of
very real challenges: You need high heat to brown the skin, but
superhigh heat may burn it. You need to cook the thighs and legs
through before the breast dries out.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are interested in minimalist cooking, you must
accomplish all this without a lot of fuss, and with no tricks, like
turning the chicken over three times, or searing it on top of the
stove before roasting, or constantly adjusting the oven
temperature. And you want to do the whole chicken as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   I have found an easy solution, though. Lay the chicken in a
preheated heavy skillet, and roast it in a very hot oven. If you
start with a high-quality bird, you can dispense with all
seasonings except salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   The hot skillet causes two good things to happen. First, it
jump-starts the cooking process. In normal roasting, the top half
or three-quarters of the chicken begins cooking when it comes in
contact with the oven's hot air, but the bottom quarter is
protected by the pan. Only when the pan becomes hot does that part
of the chicken really start cooking. That takes 10 minutes, by
which time the breast is already partly cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Preheating the pan gets the bottom of the bird cooking first and
fastest. Quite fortuitously, that's the part _ the meaty thigh _
that takes the longest to cook. With the hot pan, the thigh
finishes cooking at the same time as the breast. For a
three-and-a-half-pound bird, that means about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For efficiency's sake, I preheat the skillet in the oven, but
you can do it on top of the stove. The burner method has one
advantage: You can get the pan blazing hot, and it is marginally
easier to lay the chicken right into it because you don't have to
wrestle with pulling a hot skillet out of the oven. No matter how
you heat it, though, once you add the chicken there will be volumes
of smoke almost instantly, so get that skillet into the oven right
away.
</P>
<P>
   Although few foods are as good as unadorned roast chicken, you
can enhance this one easily before roasting it by stuffing the
cavity with a cut lemon or onion, or with a handful of herbs like
parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme or chervil. Or sprinkle the skin
with chopped herbs _ tarragon and rosemary are especially good. You
can make a quick pan gravy after the chicken is moved to a carving
board. Pour out most of the fat in the skillet, place the pan on a
burner over high heat, and add a cup of chicken stock, wine or
water. Cook until half a cup of liquid is left. Season with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   FAST ROAST CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 whole chicken, 3 to 4 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees, and place a cast-iron or
other heavy, ovenproof skillet on a rack set low in the oven. (Or
put the skillet on a burner over high heat.) Season the chicken
with salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   2. When the oven is hot, carefully place the chicken, breast
side up, in the hot skillet. Roast, undisturbed, for 30 minutes, or
until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the meaty part of the
thigh registers 155 degrees. Remove from the oven, then let rest
about 5 minutes, as the temperature climbs 5 degrees. Carve and
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

GOP POLLSTER SAYS CLINTONS' THANKSGIVING PLANS SIGNAL SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: FILED in the ``p'' and ``w'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the latest version of reading political tea
leaves, a Republican adviser to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
insisted Tuesday that the first family's Thanksgiving plans will
indicate whether Hillary Rodham Clinton is going to run for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Frank Luntz, head of the Luntz Research Companies here,
said the Clintons face a politically important decision on whether
to spend the Thanksgiving weekend in Washington or at their
recently purchased home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving is when you go home,'' Luntz told reporters in
remarks that sought to rekindle the ``carpetbagger'' issue
shadowing the first lady's exploratory Senate bid. ``You don't go
on vacation during Thanksgiving. You go home. Are they going to
spend Thanksgiving in Washington or New York?''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz called the Clintons' choice ``the great indicator'' of
whether Mrs. Clinton will formally announce her candidacy to
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's running, they will spend Thanksgiving in their new
home in New York,'' Luntz said. ``If she's not running, they'll
spend it here (in Washington).''
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton signed a contract Sept. 2 to buy
the $1.7 million, five-bedroom house in Chappaqua, a Westchester
County suburb of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Luntz's remarks, Marsha Berry, the first lady's
press secretary, said the first family will again spend
Thanksgiving at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains about 60 miles northwest of the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't close on the house until Nov. 1,'' Berry said.
``There's a lot of work that needs to be done to get a house ready
for a president. They're looking forward to moving in as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton will be overseas for almost two weeks before
Thanksgiving, leaving for Israel and Jordan several days after
closing on the couple's new home, and then joining the president
for a trip to Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, and Italy. They will return
to Washington on Nov. 24, the day before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons traditionally have gathered with family members at
the Camp David retreat for the Thanksgiving weekend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Luntz, who helped mastermind Giuliani's re-election drive in
1997, declined to say whether he was working with Giuliani's
exploratory Senate campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The latest public opinion survey in New York, the Quinnipiac
College Poll completed Sept. 13, showed the Clintons' purchase of
the Chappaqua house has only slightly eased New Yorkers' concerns
about Mrs. Clinton's outsider status.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed 49 percent of the New Yorkers surveyed said it
bothered them that Mrs. Clinton was ``not currently a resident'' of
the Empire State. A similar Quinnipiac poll completed July 29 found
52 percent of those questioned said they were bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Giuliani remain in a statistical dead heat among
registered voters, according to the survey. Clinton led Giuliani,
45 percent to 44 percent in a survey of 911 registered voters that
had a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.

DISNEY'S `E TICKET' GOOD FOR LOTS OF WHEEEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``E-ticket ride''?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.D., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The term, used to describe something thrilling, originally
referred to a ticket used at Disney theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland, Disney World and some of the company's other parks
sold ticket books with five sets of tickets, each marked with a
letter: A, B, C, D or E. The letter noted which rides the ticket
could be used for.
</P>
<P>
   E-ticket rides were the most popular attractions, including
Space Mountain, the Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the
Haunted Mansion. Today, Disney parks sometimes sell E-ride tickets
that allow several thousand guests to stay for three hours after
the normal closing time to ride popular attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the sports announcers Bob and Mike Golic related?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.K.K., Azle, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The Golics are brothers, and they both have worked as sports
broadcasters after playing for the NFL and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Golic, 36, hosts the ``ESPN Morning Show'' for ESPN Radio
and has been an NFL reporter for ESPN since 1995. He played
defensive tackle for the Houston Oilers, Philadelphia Eagles and
Miami Dolphins during a nine-year NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Golic, 41, is a former Prime Sports Radio host, sports
broadcaster and actor who was a cast member of ``Saved by the Bell:
The College Years.'' The defensive lineman played 14 years for the
Oakland Raiders, Cleveland Browns and New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a third brother who played for the Fighting Irish:
Greg Golic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who used the Meredith Wilson song, ``May the Good Lord Bless
and Keep You,'' as the closing song each week on a radio or TV
show?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.P., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: That song closed each episode of ``The Big Show,'' a radio
variety show hosted by Tallulah Bankhead that aired from 1950 to
1952.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson handled the music for the NBC program, which often
starred Fred Allen, Eddie Cantor, Groucho Marx and Jimmy Durante.

RECONSIDERING THE RADISH: NEW WAYS TO TAME ITS BITE

 By JACK BISHOP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Radishes have been cultivated for so long that they actually
predate written history. By the time Confucius wrote about them in
the fifth century B.C., they were a staple crop in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, radishes turn up in Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Japanese,
Thai, North African, French, Italian and Russian cookbooks, but
they are barely on the culinary radar in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In France roasted radishes are a delicious addition to a
vegetable ragout with carrots and white beans. In Japan, radishes
are braised in dashi, sake and soy sauce as a bracing side dish for
fish or meat. In India, shredded radishes are seasoned with
chilies, ginger and toasted spices to make a filling for paratha.
</P>
<P>
   Even when used raw, radishes get better treatment elsewhere. In
Mexico, they are paired with avocado and lime juice in a simple
salad of contrasting flavors and textures. Greek restaurants offer
sliced radishes with fennel for scooping a feta cheese dip.
</P>
<P>
   Radishes are thought to have been cultivated in Europe since the
late Stone Age. The ancient Egyptians grew them for the oil that
could be pressed from the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this history, Americans barely bother with radishes.
Although the consumption of fresh vegetables is on the rise over
all in the United States, sales of radishes have actually declined
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much pressure to get exotic fruits and vegetables
on store shelves that the radish is being squeezed out a bit,''
said Ron Schut, the president of Miedema Produce in Hudsonville,
Mich., one of the country's largest radish wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   This is surprising considering that radishes are available
year-round, with local supplies in summer and crops from Florida
and Arizona in colder months. And specialty radishes are turning up
more often. Farmers' markets this time of year sell every type,
from dainty French breakfast radishes, elongated versions that
shade from bright red at the stem end to white at the root, to the
sturdy daikon, which can grow to a foot or more and weigh more than
two pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the very mild Easter egg radishes, which come in
various shades of red, pink, purple and ivory. Icicle radishes are
white like the daikon but much smaller, usually about the size and
shape of your thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these are good raw, with a little salt or butter, eaten
out of hand or on bread. But cooking literally transforms them,
eliminating any pepperiness. When braised for 10 minutes, even the
hottest radish loses its sting. What's left is pure radish flavor.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, the alabaster flesh of the standard red
radish turns rosy pink. Pairing radishes with sauteed shallots and
a drop of honey actually makes them taste sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Like other root vegetables, radishes also take well to roasting.
Radishes emerge caramelized and tender from a hot oven. Tossing the
radishes with a little soy sauce as they finish cooking creates a
syrupy glaze and seasons them perfectly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raw radishes are often as peppery as a chili, especially in
summer. The heat comes from mustard oils, or isothiocyanates, not
capsaicin, the fiery substance in chilies.
</P>
<P>
   Mustard oils, compounds that provide flavor and aroma, are found
in varying amounts in all cruciferous vegetables, a family that, in
addition to radishes, also includes kale, broccoli, cabbage and
turnips. Isothiocyanates are most prevalent in radishes,
horseradish, mustard greens and turnips.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Brecht, a professor of postharvest physiology at the
University of Florida in Gainesville, said the compounds are
volatile and their effect lasts only a few seconds. ``Cooking
drives off the isothiocyanates very quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even raw radishes can be tamed, though. Try mixing several cups
of sliced radishes with chopped oranges, a little extra virgin
olive oil and some paprika to make a juicy Moroccan salad, perfect
with grilled fish or chicken, or with sandwiches at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an hour or so, turn radishes into quick
Asian-flavored pickles: first salt them to draw out their bitter
juices, then marinate them in a rice vinegar and sugar mixture.
These sweet-and-sour radish pickles perfumed with a drop of sesame
oil are an unusual accompaniment for cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   For a five-minute appetizer, layer sliced radishes over pieces
of buttered bread and then sprinkle them lightly with coarse salt.
French cooks would use a baguette, but for an Eastern European
flavor, try buttered black bread.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for radishes, try to buy them with healthy-looking
greens still attached, a good indicator that the radishes have been
freshly dug. The trimmed radishes sold in plastic bags are not
necessarily bad, but they may lose some flavor as they sit in the
produce aisle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Radishes should be smooth, brightly colored and firm, never soft
or spongy. Really large red radishes can be woody in the center;
anything bigger than a golf ball is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED RED RADISHES WITH SHALLOTS AND HONEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>

<P>
   2. Meanwhile, bring vinegar and sugar to a boil in a small
saucepan, stirring just until sugar dissolves. Remove pan from
heat, and cool mixture to room temperature. Whisk in oil.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour vinegar mixture over drained radishes. Marinate,
stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Drain radishes, if desired
(they are less messy to eat this way). Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings when used as an hors d'oeuvre. &QL;

STILL CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cakebread Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley, Rutherford,
Calif. About $34.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, it seems, there are three or four new wineries in
the Napa Valley that, we are told, are redefining the meaning of
great cabernet. Good luck to them. It's nice to know there are
people out there who have been making cabernet for a long time and
somehow almost always get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Take this classic from Cakebread Cellars. There are grapes from
the Stag's Leap and Oakville appellations in this wine, along with
grapes from Cakebread's own vineyard in Rutherford. About 15
percent of it is merlot, there is a little cabernet franc and even
a touch of syrah.
</P>
<P>
   The final blend, after 15 months in French oak, produced a
smooth, elegant wine, an evocation of all that's good about the
Napa Valley.

NEW SOLO ALBUM SHOWS ANOTHER SIDE OF CHRIS CORNELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the lead singer of Soundgarden, Chris Cornell helped reinvent
hard rock.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from heavy metal and punk, the Seattle band joined
Pearl Jam, Mudhoney, Nirvana and other local groups in creating a
sound that turned the city into an alternative-rock mecca in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from an era in music that had no rules,'' Cornell said
in a recent phone interview from Los Angeles. ``The idea was that
you can do whatever you want as long as you're inspired by it and
it's natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape of music and what's possible is just enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Seattle resident continues to explore that
landscape on his first solo album, ``Euphoria Morning,'' just out
from A&AMP;M Records. The first single, the seductive ``Can't Change
Me,'' was released a few weeks ago and is already a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime fans of Soundgarden, which broke up in 1997 after
selling 10 million albums, will discover another side of the
group's imposing former frontman _ the tall prince of Seattle rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Euphoria Morning'' is more of a singer-songwriter's album than
anything Cornell ever recorded with guitar-heavy Soundgarden. The
vocals soar, and the lyrics are clear and powerful. Cornell
stretches his creative muscle too, combining elements of rock, soul
and R&AMP;B with experimental textures while remaining accessible to
Top 40 sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty unusual record in a way,'' said the affable,
low-key musician. ``There was no focus in terms of musical identity
because it's not like I have the ability to step outside of myself
and think, `What kind of songs should this guy sing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell scrapped his original idea of reworking songs he had
written but never recorded during the Soundgarden era, choosing
instead to start anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something isn't happening and you're not happy with it, you
should just move on to something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell wrote songs with a guitar, experimenting with sounds and
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't worry about looking into the future and imagining
what my record would sound like,'' he said. ``It was more a case of
doing one song at time and having fun and just playing around with
different influences and not worrying about when it would be done
or how it would turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of producers and longtime friends Alain Johannes
and Natasha Shneider of rock band Eleven, Cornell recorded a
remarkably strong debut solo album. Contributing were Jason Falkner
and former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, now playing with Pearl
Jam.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Johannes and Shneider came naturally. Cornell has
been a fan of Johannes since the mid-'80s. Ten years later, Eleven
joined Soundgarden on tours of the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the couple invited Cornell to hang out with them at
their home studio in Los Angeles. The visit resulted in a
collaboration that yielded ``Sweet Sunshower'' for the ``Great
Expectations'' soundtrack and a version of ``Ave Maria'' for an A&AMP;M
Records Christmas benefit album.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell's relationship with Johannes and Shneider was so
productive that he decided to work with the couple on his solo
album.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a last-minute idea that dawned on everybody,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's rock scene has produced dozens of successful bands,
but few high-profile solo artists. This could change with the
release of ``Euphoria Morning,'' an eclectic, 12-song collection
that explores a variety of styles, textures and emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-rocking ``Mission'' recalls Soundgarden (Cornell used
an electric drink mixer on the guitar strings to produce a jarring
effect), while ``Disappearing One'' (which opens with a
retro-sounding bass clarinet) is bluesy, almost spiritual. The
sense of anguish and melancholy hangs from every word on ``When I'm
Down,'' which casts Cornell in the role of white-soul crooner.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet but sorrowful ``Wave Goodbye'' is a tribute to the
late singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley, son of '60s folk legend Tim
Buckley. ``I guess what bothered me the most about Jeff's death is
that people wouldn't get a chance to hear what he did, which was so
unique,'' Cornell said.
</P>
<P>
   The album's first single, ``Can't Change Me'' made its debut on
radio earlier this summer and is currently in the Top 20 of
Billboard's two rock charts.
</P>
<P>
   The song's signature line, ``She's going to change the world,
but she can't change me,'' has caused some local listeners to
wonder if the song is autobiographical (Cornell is married to
Soundgarden's manager, Susan Silver).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my songs are about characters in a sense,'' Cornell
said. ``So no one's going to know what's autobiographical and
what's fiction. I guess that's the beauty of words put together.
Everyone can have their own interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell will begin his ``Euphoria Morning'' tour in Europe. The
U.S. portion will include a Seattle show in November or December.
</P>
<P>
   Backing Cornell will be Johannes on guitars, Shneider on
keyboards, Ric Markmann on bass and Greg Upchurch on drums.
Johannes and Shneider will add background vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell said rumors of a Soundgarden reunion are false. But he
describes his former bandmates as family and regards ``Down on the
Upside'' as the group's best album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got closer to the way I wanted us to sound on that
record than any other,'' he said. ``It just sounds more naturally
like how I imagined we sounded live.''

SOME SURPRISES FROM SOUTHERN ITALY

 By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I spent a substantial portion of Labor Day weekend cooking from
``Regional Foods of Southern Italy'' by Marlena de Blasi (Viking,
$28.95) but could have devoted a week to it. Both the evocative
text and the recipes promise much and deliver more.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Blasi moves far beyond the red sauce and ricotta cliches
of the well-traversed terrain of southern Italy, especially in
dishes like braised forest mushrooms, and beyond dry directions,
with recipe instructions that read, ``Over a gentle flame, allow
the mushrooms to reabsorb their juices and to drink in the wine.''
</P>
<P>
   The result in this case is an intensely flavored stew from the
Basilicata region with succulent wild mushrooms made piquant with a
pinch of the typical hot red pepper of the south.
</P>
<P>
   This highly personal region-by-region survey of the southern
half of Italy's boot begins in Lazio, the province that encompasses
Rome, then travels south, alternating between the east and west
coasts, as far as ``the tiniest, last pieces of Italy that crumble
into the Mediterranean.''
</P>
<P>
   These are impoverished regions where no Medicis reigned and
where a sly ``cucina povera'' includes dishes like ``thin strings
of pasta with escaped clams,'' meaning no clams were available and
one had to make do with tomatoes, a bit of pancetta and a few
chilies. A salt cod salad with artichokes and olives is called a
``salad of fish in a place where there is no sea.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. de Blasi journeys, she tells of the food, the people who
lovingly craft it and the customs they observe to consume it. Olive
oil warmed with a freshly made paste of garlic and herbs is the
opening shot for many of the recipes, and a scattering of crunchy
bread crumbs sauteed in fragrant olive oil sometimes provides the
dashing finish.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Blasi, who lives in the Umbrian hill town of Orvieto,
also wrote ``Regional Food of Northern Italy,'' published in 1997
by Prima. Although the book was nominated for a James Beard award,
its recipes were less surprising and the writing less alluringly
ripe than in the new volume.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Ms. de Blasi has lived with her Italian
husband, Fernando de Blasi, in Venice and Tuscany, and they now run
the Company of the Cauldron, a cooking and tourist service for
visitors to Italy who rent houses.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Regional Food of Southern Italy,'' the dishes all get an
anecdotal history taken from the home cooks, chefs and food vendors
Ms. de Blasi has met in her travels.
</P>
<P>
   Among the finest of her discoveries is veal braised with
sun-dried tomatoes, wine and olives. She labels it ``leg of veal in
the manner of the roving meat cooker,'' a dish that one could buy
by the slice from a carnacottaro, an itinerant vendor in Campania,
near Naples.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the dishes she includes are best when cooked over a
wood fire or simmered in a terra-cotta casserole, but those will be
the biggest challenges for home cooks.
</P>
<P>
   As for that braised mushroom dish, she included a variation in
her first book but said this one is a lunch stew served after a
mushroom hunt in the area of Vulture. Never mind the possible
poetic license she took in adapting it; the recipe is terrific.
</P>
<P>
   Among her other great dishes are pasta in a creamy ricotta and
sheep's-milk sauce, or in a well-spiced sauce of green tomatoes,
and mussels and clams steamed in an uncompromisingly garlicky and
peppery broth known as crazy water.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``A model with a womanly body _ that made me a
first,'' says Emme in a 15-second television spot for Revlon's
ColorStay makeup that shows closeups and full-length poses of the
plus-size model.
</P>
<P>
   She notes in the ad that the introduction of the compact version
of the brand's long-wearing foundation is another first.
</P>
<P>
   It's been seven months since Revlon broke ground as the first
major cosmetics firm to feature a large-size model in its ads,
taking diversity in cosmetics advertising to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   Emme's spots launched in February and gained widespread
attention during the Academy Awards broadcast in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we constantly put one image of beauty out there, we don't
do anyone any service,'' said Emme, the host of the E! Channel's
``Fashion Emergency'' and author of ``True Beauty,'' a guide to
positive self-image, during a recent interview at Revlon's
headquarters here. ``We should celebrate the differences in
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emme has broken a lot of amazing ground since getting this
contract,'' said Gary Dakin, an agent for the 12 Plus division at
Ford Models, where Emme was once represented.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work for plus-size models is still in fashion, he
noted, not cosmetics. ``I think everybody is waiting to see what
Revlon does and what response they get.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new Isabella Rossellini's Manifesto line, which launched
in limited distribution in September, features a range of models in
its ads, including large-size model Kate Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   And Cover Girl _ rumored to have eyed Emme before she was
snatched by Revlon _ may be on the lookout for new talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to use models in our Cover Girl campaigns that
represent the multi-dimensionality of all women. This includes
diverse personalities, ethnicities and life stages _ and may at
some point include full-figured women as well,'' said Anne Martin,
global designer and North American marketing director for Cover
Girl.
</P>
<P>
   Emme, who states her size as straddling 14/16, is quick to point
out that the majority of American women _ more than 60 percent _
are a size 12 and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't see diversity and only one type of image, it
makes consumers say to themselves, `There is something wrong with
me,''' said Emme, who reveals some of her own struggles with body
image in her best-selling book. ``You draw in more women with
acceptance than exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   A personal goal of hers is to ``break the notion that there is
one singular image of beauty,'' said Emme, who speaks to school
groups about body image, self-esteem and dieting. ``Revlon has
taken a giant step in breaking that mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Mandor, executive vice president of Revlon's brand equity
development group, said the company did not intend to start a trend
when it signed Emme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about Revlon going out and making sure women can see
themselves on a page. We are about making women feel like women and
making them feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mandor, Emme has been entrusted, along with Cindy
Crawford, to represent one of the company's hottest properties _
ColorStay foundation, a top seller in the category.
</P>
<P>
   At Revlon, the ads are written to highlight the product, then an
appropriate spokeswoman is assigned, noted Mandor.
</P>
<P>
   While next year's plans are still being made, it is likely Emme
will remain on ColorStay, she added.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Syracuse University, Emme, now 35, had a
brief stint as a TV reporter. Almost on a whim, she presented
herself to a New York modeling agency for possible plus-size
fashion assignments and was quickly embraced.
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by her TV show, Revlon contract and book deal, her
career quickly branched out beyond fashion modeling and she is now
represented by the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Emme recently signed a TV deal with ABC that could include her
own show and appearances on sitcoms or talk shows, said her agent,
Brian Dubin, senior vice president and head of the commercial
department at William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   He also is submitting her name for a movie role that he thinks
is ideal for her.
</P>
<P>
   Emme has been taking acting lessons and would like to break into
movies, with an eye to breaking some casting stereotypes. And she
is considering a second book, with a focus on health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revlon took a step in the right direction to make women feel
good about themselves and not bad about themselves,'' said Emme,
who adopted the singular name when her modeling career began to
take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to initiate change. If we can just get over the
stringent, tightly focused idea of beauty, we can relax a lot of
pressure and stress that women feel today.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's a sunny Saturday morning in Manhattan and the Pierre Michel
Salon on the Upper East Side is abuzz: blow-dryers, cappuccino
makers and a Janet Jackson soundtrack electrify the massive beauty
emporium.
</P>
<P>
   Clustered near the reception area is a group of giggling clients
awaiting a turn at beautification.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Edward Greene, the salon's artistic director, hushes
the group to attention. The first stop, he explains, will be the
manicure station on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Upon spotting a real, live manicurist, the group breaks into
squeals of delight.
</P>
<P>
   Such enthusiasm may not be unusual in a temple of beauty, but
its source certainly is: a raucous bunch of 9- to 11-year-olds,
here to celebrate their pal Brittney's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   That a beauty salon would be considered an ideal setting for a
preteen birthday party offers a glimpse into how girls are being
given an increasingly early introduction to the world of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spice Girls got us in so much trouble,'' Greene jokes with
a sigh. ``They liberated little girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberated'' is right. In between careful sips of iced tea and
decaffeinated cappuccino, Brittney's posse pauses to engage in
beauty dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming here since I was 9,'' says Marisa _ now all
of 10 years old _ summing up with a shrug the prevailing attitude.
</P>
<P>
   For the girls, getting the royal treatment at mom's beauty salon
is pure fun, but for the salon owners, grooming a new generation of
clients is _ despite the occasional migraine _ just smart business.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age girls spend an average of almost $200 a month on
clothing, jewelry and beauty. They are plugged in to the latest
trends, and for those who attend elite private schools, the
pressure for high-maintenance conformity is even greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a child, your parents take you to the dentist that
they trust. It's the same thing with your hairdresser,'' Greene
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was that age and I would bleach my hair. I
didn't want her to rebel and try to do that,'' explains Sandra
Green, the birthday girl's mother. ``I told Brittney that even if
she wants blue hair, then she'll see my colorist and have blue hair
done nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Lia Schorr, a skin-care specialist who owns a skin-care salon
and training center in Manhattan, reports that she regularly sees
clients as young as 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother brings them because she's the obsessed one,'' she
says. ``But the kids,'' she quickly adds, ``are fine about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakouts, the most common reason for the visit, are usually
treated with a 35-minute mini-facial.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in California, where early grooming is as inevitable
as good weather, salons go way beyond the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Balloon, a children's hair salon with five locations,
caters to the offspring of a number of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of manicures and highlights on 10- to
14-year-olds,'' reports Jason Douglas-Hiley, the salon's manager.
</P>
<P>
   The salon also hosts ``Glamour Parties'' on the weekends, where
the girls are treated with intricate hairdos and makeup
applications and are sent home clutching their portraits.
</P>
<P>
   But for the serious supermodel in training, Olivia's Dollhouse
Tea Room in Los Angeles might just offer the ultimate service:
full-blown fashion shows or, for budding socialites prepping for
the benefit circuit, dress-up tea parties. &QL;

FROM POUSSIN TO CAPON, A CHICKEN IN EVERY SIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be a farmer to know that chickens come in
various sizes. Even cooks who know these birds as only
plastic-wrapped packages in the supermarket can distinguish a
three-pound broiler from an eight-pound roaster.
</P>
<P>
   But there is so much more to chicken than these oh-so-familiar
sizes and cuts. If ``poultry is for the cook what canvas is for a
painter,'' to quote the 19th-century French gastronome
Brillat-Savarin, why paint the same painting over and over again?
</P>
<P>
   More and more, chickens of various types and sizes are showing
up not only on restaurant menus but also in markets and home
kitchens. From the diminutive poussin to the opulent capon, these
birds have distinctive characteristics that make them not only very
tasty but also fun to cook.
</P>
<P>
   The basic difference among most of these types of chicken is
their age, reflected in both their tenderness and their flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest commercially available chicken is the poussin,
usually less than 24 days old and weighing slightly less than a
pound. This tiny bird is not particularly flavorful, but many cooks
are wild about its soft, delicate texture. The legs are the best
part of the poussin, since the lack of muscle development makes
them much more tender than those of an adult bird.
</P>
<P>
   Poussins are sold at Greenmarkets, high-end food stores and some
supermarkets in New York, but in some parts of the country they can
be hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   A more readily available choice for a one-bird-a-person meal is
the Cornish game hen. This somewhat exotic-sounding fowl is
actually an American breed created by crossing a White Rock hen
with a Cornish game cock. Most game hens are about 1 month old and
weigh between 1 and 1{ pounds, although some are as much as 2
pounds. Because they are more mature and are specifically bred for
early slaughter, they have more flavor than poussins.
</P>
<P>
   Game hens and poussins are both great for cooking over live
fire. We like them either grill-roasted intact or butterflied and
grilled. No matter how you cook them, though, the best part is that
each guest gets his or her own whole bird, which somehow seems both
celebratory and a bit decadent.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet for roasting is a capon, which you will probably
have to order from your butcher. This bird was originally developed
by Romans in the second century who were looking to circumvent the
so-called famine laws that were put in place to save grain.
</P>
<P>
   One such law made it illegal for Romans to eat fattened hens.
Unwilling to give up their poultry feasts, some crafty Romans began
castrating young roosters and feeding them grain. This process
caused the roosters to put on so much extra fat that they grew to
almost twice their normal adult size _ and proved even tastier than
fattened hens.
</P>
<P>
   Capons are usually killed at 4 months, when they weigh 6 to 9
pounds. Because of their high fat content, they are particularly
juicy and flavorful and still quite tender. A roast stuffed capon
is a thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you live near a chicken farm, you probably won't be able
to find a stewing hen, but this bird is worth mentioning, if only
for historical perspective. This is a laying hen that is no longer
prolific and is therefore killed for food. Usually about 15 months
old and weighing 5 to 6 pounds, this hen is tough and stringy _
about as far from today's supermarket chicken as you can get _ but
has great flavor. In earlier days, it was the Sunday roast chicken
of farmers, but in chicken soup it is unsurpassed.

PORK WTH A PEDIGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week, for only the second time in my life, I
tasted pork so delicious it needed no seasoning beyond salt and
pepper. Both times the meat was superior heirloom pork, suffused
with a bright, clean flavor, with none of the unpleasant aftertaste
pork often has.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, both pieces came from pigs raised in a
manner vastly different from that of ordinary supermarket pork.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I had heirloom pork was at Cabbage Hill Farm in
suburban Westchester County, which is dedicated to saving historic
breeds. The pork I had last week, at Gramercy Tavern, is available
by mail and will eventually be in some New York City grocery
stores. Sold under the brand Niman Ranch, which is known for its
fine beef, the pork had first been described to me several months
ago in terms of its environmental soundness rather than its taste.
</P>
<P>
   The pigs are raised on small family farms, not indoors at
factory farms that are similar to modern-day chicken houses, with
thousands of animals kept close together. The stench from these
large-scale hog farms is so great that neighbors' complaints have
made news across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Niman pigs are raised in pastures instead of
indoors, their waste products return to the soil naturally, instead
of creating environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   These are all good reasons to choose this heirloom pork, but it
took a few tastes to make me a convert.
</P>
<P>
   Most pork today is leaner than in the past, but in the process
of breeding out the fat, the flavor went, too. The low fat content
also means that the pork becomes tough very quickly when it is
cooked. And the factory pork releases a lot of liquid in cooking
because the animals have been given hormones to increase their
weight through fluid retention.
</P>
<P>
   The Niman Ranch pork remains tender and releases little liquid.
The Midwestern hog farmers who raise pigs for Niman have agreed to
follow certain rules, and their pigs are fed no animal byproducts
or antibiotics. For this new ``old'' pork, they are guaranteed 37.5
cents a pound plus a 6-cent premium. Prices for conventionally
raised pork were as low as 11 cents a pound earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other Midwestern farmers are going a step further and raising
certified organic pigs. The sample of the meat I tasted was not as
tender as the Niman Ranch pork. Sold under the Valley's Family
label, it will be available in mid-October in Manhattan at Fairway,
2127 Broadway (74th Street); Lifethyme, 408 Avenue of the Americas
(Eighth Street); Healthy Pleasures, 93 University Place (12th
Street), and West Side Health, 2568 Broadway (96th Street), and in
Brooklyn at Back to the Land, 142 Seventh Avenue (Carroll Street),
and Perelandra, 175 Remsen Street (Court Street). It is expected to
sell for about $5.75 a pound for tenderloin and boneless chops.
</P>
<P>
   Niman Ranch pork is also served at Savoy, Lutece and Beacon in
Manhattan. It will soon be available at retail nationwide. Until
then, D'Artagnan, (800) 327-8246, can supply it with three or four
days' notice. The tenderloin is $11 a pound; boneless loin chops,
$8 (shipping extra).
</P>
<P>
   Once again, small is beautiful.

HORATIO HORNBLOWER'S CREATOR IS MARKING 100TH BIRTHDAY, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the Hemingway centennial is solemnized by formal literary
occasions, fans of another esteemed ``man's author'' may not
realize that 1999 also marks the 100th birthday of their guy, who
at the very least is Ernest Hemingway's equal in the measure of
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   He's Cecil Lewis Troughton Smith. Well, he was that, until he
changed his name legally to Cecil Scott Forester. He's identified
literarily as C.S. Forester, but the name on his calling card is
forever Horatio Hornblower. As Arthur Conan Doyle is to Sherlock
Holmes, so is Forester to Hornblower.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, we know, came to despise his most famous creation, sought
to abandon him, but yielded to that mighty warrior, Public Demand,
and kept the Holmes yarns coming. There's no clear evidence that
Forester regretted his horn-blown success, but one may wonder. In
his spirited autobiography, ``Long Before Forty,'' he asserts that
he might have realized keener fulfillment as a military and naval
historian. That was Forester's objective when he commenced a
writing career, after he forsook the study of medicine. He
despaired of most historical accounts, finding them deficient in
narrative vitality. He believed history should be read as one reads
a novel, and his venture into fiction was calculated to prepare him
as a ``serious'' historian.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't explain his first novel, the ironic ``Payment
Deferred'' (1926), which later was successfully dramatized. Charles
Laughton acted _ on both stage and screen _ the timid clerk who
gains wealth by murdering his landlord and is convicted instead of
murdering his wife, something that he did not do. ``The Gun''
(1933) was landlocked military history in a guise of fiction. It,
too, was filmed, much later, as ``The Pride and the Passion,'' and
not even Cary Grant could save it.
</P>
<P>
   The movies, though, were mostly kind to Forester. His World War
I adventure novel ``The African Queen'' (1935) emerged 16 years
later as one of our most cherished films. There was also a
Hornblower movie, with stolid, stalwart Gregory Peck as ``Captain
Horatio Hornblower.'' And that was the collective title for the
trilogy originally intended as the start and finish of the
Hornblower saga, consisting of ``Beat to Quarters'' (1937), ``Ships
of the Line'' (1938) and ``Flying Colors'' (1939). Forester's
wartime bestseller ``The Ship'' was maritime adventure minus his
resourceful hero; but postwar popularity of the Hornblower books
put pressure on Forester to deliver more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the Hornblower series eventually stretched to
an even dozen novels, not including ``The Hornblower Companion,''
the author's 1964 account of the genesis and development of the
works that advance Horatio from midshipman to admiral. Ultimately,
he is ``Lord Hornblower.'' Forester in late career did manage some
sturdily historical nonfiction with ``The Story of the Naval War of
1812'' and ``The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck'' (the latter
filmed as ``Sink the Bismarck!'').
</P>
<P>
   Forester's death in 1967 effectively scuttled other similar
projects he had blueprinted. In the realm of adventure fiction,
C.S. Forester must rank near the very top. Seamanship is an
evolving technology, and Forester's mastery of the arts and
sciences of seafaring during the Napoleonic Wars is what earned for
him a devoted readership. Today's advocates of the Tom Clancy
high-tech thrillers respond to the same impulse. From what I'm told
(having not read any of the later Hornblower tales), Forester rose
above that well-known law of diminishing returns. Each title seems
to have been received respectfully, and sales never sagged. Even
today, they're healthy in the marketplace in various editions.

<P>
   RUTHERFORD, Calif. _ A Gustin Huneeus was between jobs, and
enjoying it thoroughly. He had just sold Franciscan Estates, his
Napa Valley winery, for $220 million to Canandaigua Brands, an
upstate New York wine and spirits conglomerate. And once again, he
was about to embark on a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Since Huneeus, 66, is known as one of the more perceptive _ and
successful _ people in the wine world, it seemed an appropriate
time to pose some questions about his future and that of the wine
business at the dawn of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Franciscan by Huneeus and his partners also included
Mount Veeder, another Napa Valley winery; considerable vineyard
acreage in California, and two-thirds of a winery and vineyards in
Chile. But Huneeus (pronounced hoo-NAY-us) retained more than
enough to keep him busy: the Quintessa vineyard in the heart of the
Napa Valley, the 1,000-acre Veramonte estate in Chile, a vineyard
in the Alexander Valley in Sonoma County and another recently
acquired vineyard near the city of Napa called the Lewis Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to reinvent my life,'' he said with no particular sense
of urgency. In fact, reinventing his life is something Agustin
Huneeus has always done well. He was born into an influential
family in Chile and raised there and in the United States. His
great-grandfather was a founder of the prominent Chilean winery
Concha y Toro. At 24, while running a modest fish exporting
business in Chile, Huneeus jumped at a chance to buy back Concha y
Toro, which the family had sold.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, after Salvador Allende was elected president of Chile,
the winery was nationalized. Tipped that he was to be arrested as a
subversive, Huneeus fled to Buenos Aires on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   There he ran Joseph I. Seagram &AMP; Sons' Argentine companies. But
Argentina was also in political turmoil. ``After a couple of years
of riding in three-car caravans with machine guns, I went to New
York,'' Huneeus said, ``to run all of Seagram's international
operations.'' Realizing that he was not cut out for corporate life,
he resigned in 1977 ``as soon as I got my green card,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing he did was to invest in a company growing grapes
for jug wine in California's Central Valley. Then, with a Chilean
friend, Sergio Traversio, he invested in the old Concannon Winery
in Livermore, Calif. When he sold that in 1983, he retired, so the
speak, at 50. But only for a couple of months. He was then asked to
help reorganize Souverain Cellars, a big Sonoma winery once owned
by the Pillsbury Company but then in the hands of some 40 feuding
grape growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality had nothing to do with the operation,'' Huneeus said.
``It was strictly a home for their grapes.'' Frustrated by so many
warring factions, Huneeus abandoned the project (Souverain later
went bankrupt and was sold to Beringer Estates). Two years later,
in 1985, the Eckes family, who had bought Franciscan Vineyards in
1979 for about $15 million, offered him a chance to buy in. ``If
you join us, we'll give you half,'' they told him. His response:
``Only if you let me run it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eckes family was the unfortunate winery's fifth owner in the
six years since its opening in 1973. In fact, the undercapitalized
first owners were gone before it even opened.
</P>
<P>
   In a relatively short time, Huneeus brought about a stunning
reversal of Franciscan's fortunes. He pared expenses, set cost
controls and established a highly successful second label,
Estancia, which allowed him to concentrate on the quality of the
Franciscan line. And early on, he invested in Chile, whose wine
business he knew well. Since 1995, Franciscan's sales have grown
more than 17 percent a year. Now, Franciscan will remain as a
separate entity within the Canandaigua group.
</P>
<P>
   Huneeus (friends call him Cucho) is understandably upbeat about
California wine's future. But he is wary about making predictions.
``Look at the success we are enjoying today,'' he said. ``Who could
have predicted this? No one.'' Still, he can see a few dark clouds.
``The trend is to bigness,'' he added. ``Little wineries can't find
anyone to distribute their wines, and the big wineries are becoming
anonymous corporate entities _ negociants rather than winemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, some of the big wineries could suffer the
fate of wine companies of the past, like Paul Masson. ``Once they
were in every shop, every restaurant; then they collapsed,'' he
said. ``Robert Mondavi is the current Paul Masson. If they don't
take care, they'll grow bigger and bigger and then fall on their
face, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Huneeus takes a dim view of the current obsession with ratings.
``Everything is ratings, ratings, which is an artificial way to
enjoy wine,'' he said. ``People won't drink a wine unless it has a
high rating. It's nonsense. They give up the right to make their
own judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   His strongest criticism was aimed at the American practice of
identifying wines by the grape from which they are made. ``The
varietal market is not truthful,'' he said. ``It's a fantasy
market.'' Varietal designations came into vogue in the years after
World War II, when most California wines were identified by names
like ``burgundy,'' ``chablis'' or ``chianti.'' Then, beginning in
the 1950s, good wines started to be identified by the grapes from
which they were made, like chardonnay. But not all chardonnay or
cabernet is good wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it's chic to order merlot,'' Huneeus said. ``Why,
50 percent of the merlot we're using around here now comes from the
Central Valley. It's not quality wine. It's not merlot I want, but
merlot from a certain place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great wines,'' Huneeus said, ``come from specific vineyards. I
hope that the future will be properties, not grapes. People drink a
wine from Chateau Latour because it comes from Chateau Latour; they
don't even ask what the grapes are.''

   TAIWAN-QUAKE (Taipei, Taiwan) _ With the death toll from Tuesday
morning's earthquake rising by the hour, rescuers worked throughout
the day and night to free thousands of people trapped in the rubble
of high-rise apartment buildings and houses that crumbled under the
force of the mighty temblor. At last count, the Interior Ministry's
disaster management center reported that 1,712 people were killed
in the earthquake and at least 4,408 injured with some 2,820 people
still trapped in debris or missing by late evening. By Calvin Sims.

   U.N.-CLINTON (United Nations) _ His authority undercut by the
failure of the United States to pay what it owes the United
Nations, President Clinton went before the General Assembly and
sketched out three goals for the coming century: eradicating
poverty, preventing mass slaughter and displacement, and stopping
the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. But in a
generally lackluster speech, Clinton offered no new proposals
beyond saying that he will convene a White House meeting of
pharmaceutical company executives, foundation representatives and
members of Congress to develop vaccines for combatting malaria,
tuberculosis, AIDS and other serious diseases and to send them to
developing countries. By Christopher S. Wren.

release would re-invigorate terrorist organizations in Puerto Rico.

national politics appears to have changed in fundamental ways.
After years as one of the most financially generous but
underrepresented ethnic minorities in American politics, many Asian
Americans are nursing deep wounds from what they regard as a string
of insulting scandals. And this time, they say, things will be
different. There will be less interest in photo opportunities with
the candidates, they say, and in its place a focus on getting more
Asian Americans appointed to positions in Washington and to
judgeships around the country and to bolster government efforts to
fight hate crimes and discrimination. By James Sterngold.

IRELAND LAUDS A NOVELIST WHO DISMANTLES NATIONAL MYTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Time moves swiftly in Ireland these days. Five
years ago Roddy Doyle caused an uproar with a hard-hitting
television series called ``Family'' that portrayed domestic
violence and alcoholism among the Irish working classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my old teachers' union complained that I had a teacher
striking a child,'' he recalled. ``But I'm fairly convinced that if
`Family' were broadcast tonight, it wouldn't cause half the fuss
that it did in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof may be Doyle's acclaimed new novel, ``A Star Called
Henry'' (Viking). In it he has done no less than dismantle some of
the founding myths of 20th-century Irish nationalism. And so far he
has heard nothing but praise for it here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did expect at least one person to stand up and object,'' he
said softly. ``But there seems to be a self-confidence that wasn't
there in the past. A lot of the old statues have come tumbling
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, 41, has now knocked down a few more, not least that
Ireland was actually a better place after its war of independence
against Britain led to creation of the Irish Free State in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the newly prosperous Ireland of the 1990s such a notion
is no longer treasonable. Money, rather than memory, is the new
Irish obsession. And with the present breaking free at last from
the past, history is now available to become raw material for
Doyle's fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, described as Volume I of a trilogy called ``The Last
Roundup,'' follows Henry Smart's first-person account from his
birth in a Dublin slum in 1901 to an alcoholic mother and a
one-legged bouncer-cum-murderer father, until 1921.
</P>
<P>
   His early years are miserable as he lives on the streets with
his younger brother. As a teen-ager he joins the Citizen Army and
helps seize the General Post Office during the abortive 1916 Easter
Rising. The rebel leader Michael Collins then has him bumping off
traitors and training young revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   But when the war ends, Henry feels betrayed by the Irishmen who
have seized power. His own life now threatened, he leaves Dublin
for Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   For Doyle, who cuts a distinctive figure with his shaven head,
wire-rimmed glasses and pierced left ear lobe, the book marks a
dramatic change from his narrative close-ups of the past. He made
his name in the 1980s with his Barrytown trilogy _ ``The
Commitments,'' ``The Snapper'' and ``The Van'' _ affectionate and
humorous looks at working-class life in a Dublin suburb that were
all made into movies.
</P>
<P>
   His next novel, ``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' which won Britain's
Booker Prize in 1993, is a 10-year-old boy's account of his
parents' crumbling marriage. Two years later, in ``The Woman Who
Walked Into Doors,'' the narrator tells of her struggle to rebuild
her life after a violent marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, variously inspired by Charles Dickens, Peter Carey, Gunter
Grass and Salman Rushdie, Doyle is reaching out to embrace a
nation's history through the best part of a century. If things go
according to plan, the second volume of ``The Last Roundup'' will
follow Henry Smart to the United States to live the Irish immigrant
experience, while the third installment will return him to a
different Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradually, in the writing and the planning, the big history
began to become real and big to me,'' Doyle said in an interview.
``At first I saw Henry as a bit of a liar, chancing his arm through
the 20th century, claiming he'd done things and seen things. But
when I started describing his childhood, the lying element became
less important. Although it's not exactly realistic, I felt that
essentially Henry is telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, like that of many of his generation, Doyle's knowledge
of Irish history was anything but reliable. At primary school, he
recalled, the distinction between legendary and mythical figures
like St. Patrick and ``the real lads who came later'' was blurred.
</P>
<P>
   When the ``troubles'' began in Northern Ireland in the 1970s,
with Doyle now in a high school run by the Christian Brothers, the
passions of the war of independence returned, with the Irish
Republican Army again the heroes. ``Then the heirs to the idealism
of 1916 started planting bombs in restaurants and pubs in
Belfast,'' he said, ``and suddenly history disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   So he had to do his own digging. At the end of ``A Star Called
Henry'' Doyle lists a score or more books whose authors he thanks
for ``the information, ideas, images, phrases, maps, photographs
and song lyrics'' that helped him in his writing, not only in
understanding the early Republican movement and its assorted
socialist and nationalist factions and in portraying figures like
Collins, James Connolly, Padraic Pearse and Eamon de Valera, but
also in getting a feel for slum life in Dublin at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   One book in particular, ``Dublin Tenement Life: An Oral
History'' by Kevin C. Kearns, proved invaluable. From it Doyle
learned that many working-class women were known as ``shawlies,''
for the shawls they wore. He discovered that rat catchers would
make a ``soup'' of baby rats that they rubbed on their arms to
bring rats rushing out of their hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   And most crucially he was reminded of the popular belief that
dead babies became stars. In the title of Doyle's book, the
``star'' is Henry's dead brother, whose name he was given and whose
star he learned to identify.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A book of maps provided Doyle with a key to the myriad rivers
flowing beneath Dublin, rivers where Henry's father dumped bits of
the bodies of his victims, rivers that his wooden leg (which Henry
inherited as a lethal weapon) could divine from street level, and
rivers that Henry himself used for escaping from trouble. This
being fiction, though, Doyle excused himself from actually
exploring subterranean Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read as I wrote,'' he recalled of his three years' work on
this book. ``I have always done that when I have done research. I
wouldn't have the ability or the mind to read for a year and then
sit down and write. I have to work away. I read for verification or
for a new idea. But if I have always tried to be realistic until
now. This time I was quite happy that the reality be seen in a
distorted sort of way.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not every narrator remembers his birth, as Henry Smart
does. Not every hero is 6 feet 2 inches tall and irresistibly
handsome at age 14. Not every young lover carries ``two nipple-made
pockmarks'' on his forehead as a trophy. No wonder more than one
critic has noted the ``magic realism'' in this book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historical novels run a constant risk of lurching into costume
drama,'' Roy Foster wrote in The Guardian of London. ``Doyle,
however, avoids creaky verismo by using a carefully gauged
admixture of magic-realist techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said he suspected that someone would bring up ``magic
realism,'' although he confessed that he did know exactly what it
meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a fairly well-read person, but not in terms of magic
realism,'' he said. ``The nipple indentations were just part of the
fun. It was a joke that I can reintroduce if I feel like on page
732 of the next volume, when everyone has forgotten about the marks
on Henry's forehead.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ivan Reynolds, the character in this book who
comes to personify the post-1921 Ireland, is fictional but all too
real because, as Doyle puts it, ``he represents the men on the
make, the men `whose time has come,' as they described
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruited into the revolution by Henry, Ivan has become a
corrupt rural warlord by 1921, when he tells the disillusioned
Henry what the fighting was all about. ``It wasn't Ireland,'' he
explains. ``Ireland's an island, Captain, a dollop of muck. It's
about control of the island, that's what the soldiering's about,
not the harps and the martyrs and the freedom to swing a hurly. Am
I right, d'you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle would appear to agree, at least, that things turned out
that way, that for decades after 1921, as Ireland wallowed in
poverty and its sons and daughters emigrated in search of jobs,
politics here became an extension of the civil war that erupted
among the Irish once the British had left, about control of the
island. And these lines remained drawn, more through tradition than
conviction, until the Ireland of the 1990s discovered that there
was an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe that now the old preconceptions have been
rattled in the last five or six years, there's a generosity that
wasn't there before,'' Doyle said. ``There's a genuine curiosity
about what went on. People have asked me, how will anyone outside
Ireland understand the book? To be honest, people in their 20s and
30s in Ireland will have as much difficulty in some ways because
that part of our history was bypassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Irish critics see the book as accelerating Ireland's
process of understanding itself. ``It exposes each of the
ideological underpinnings on which the state rests and then
demolishes each in turn,'' Carlo Gebler wrote in The Irish Times.
``In other, less forgiving climes (say, the Soviet Union), Doyle
would be put on a cattle truck and sent away. Forever. There is no
higher praise, I believe, than to say a book is that dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, though, seems to be just as pleased to celebrate yet
another Irish writer whose work is applauded abroad, with Irish
officialdom happy to point to this country's booming arts as
further evidence that something new is afoot here. But Doyle still
sounds a tad skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a staggering amount of quality writing being done here
now,'' he said, ``But it seems we're always trying to live up to
some sort of image. The ol' Paddy dancing at the crossroads has
just been replaced by a sexier version.''

book jacket.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RIDLEY REVIEW: John Ridley's ``?Everybody Smokes in Hell''
is the best B-movie you'll read this season. It's a headlong dive

(Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket.)
</P>
<P>

Fred Chappell at his best. The fourth and final chapter of the
Kirkman family story cycle _ which has unfolded in the luminous

TROUBLE IN PARIS? DUCASSE SAYS NO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Alain Ducasse, the only chef with two restaurants given
top ratings of three stars by the Michelin Guide, said Tuesday that
there was no truth to persistent rumors that his Paris restaurant
was losing money and that he might have to move it from the posh
Hotel Le Parc on the Avenue Raymond Poincare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been making money, and we're taking reservations for
next year,'' Ducasse said in a telephone interview from New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The possible move, or maybe even the demise, of the Restaurant
Alain Ducasse has been the talk of the food world both here and in
New York since an article last month in Le Figaro reported trouble
between Ducasse and the new owners of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Demeure hotel chain, which owns Le Parc, was acquired from
Vivendi last spring by the Accor group of France and two American
pension funds, Colony and Blackstone.
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Claire Camus, a spokeswoman for Accor, said, ``There is no
disagreement of any kind between Accor and Ducasse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse stated that the article in Le Figaro, which said that
Accor was unhappy with the financial situation of the two
restaurants Ducasse is involved with in the Hotel Le Parc, was a
scoop that wasn't one at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no disagreement with Accor and no economic worries,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other three-star restaurant of Ducasse is the Louis XV,
which is in the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo.

GREAT _ AND NOT SO GREAT _ EXPECTATIONS FOR FALL TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We aren't strangers to walking the prediction plank. It's fun,
it makes for testy e-mails, it sparks interoffice and living-room
debate. But it's a lose-lose situation: People will always think
you're an idiot for wagering your credibility on the success of
this or that, like the Olsen twins' ``Two of a Kind.'' (``It's a
can't-miss!'' we beamed last season. Then it did. Miserably.)
</P>
<P>
   Ten shows return from last year's batch of 36. We fingered 12
shows ``worth watching.'' But ``worth watching'' doesn't always
jibe with what actually gets watched.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the inexplicably popular ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   This season: 37 series are on tap. Dramas are up, comedies are
down, dramedys are in. We have more Love (as in Jennifer Hewitt),
more Heather (as in Locklear), more Mohr, (as in Jay), as in that
``Jerry Maguire'' sleazebo, now in ``Action.'' We have teen-age
alienation and teen-age aliens, a ``Ladies' Man,'' an ``Odd Man
Out,'' and ``Grown Ups'' toiling about in ``The West Wing'' for
``Love or Money.''
</P>
<P>
   There's ``Malcolm in the Middle'' and ``Jack and Jill,''
``Angel'' and ``Ally'' all searching for the ``Safe Harbor'' of
cushy ratings.
</P>
<P>
   There are more spinoffs this season, with David Boreanaz bolting
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' for ``Angel,'' Hewitt exiting ``Party
of Five'' for ``Time of Your Life,'' and Countess Vaughn
hip-hopping out of ``Moesha'' to ``The Parkers.''
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, we'll get more from fewer minds. The short
list: Aaron Sorkin (''Sports Night,'' ``West Wing''); David E.
Kelley (''Ally McBeal,'' ``Ally,'' ``Chicago Hope,'' ``The
Practice,'' ``Snoops''); Dick Wolf (''Law &AMP; Order,'' ``Law &AMP; Order:
Special Victims Unit''); Kevin Williamson (''Dawson's Creek,''
``Wasteland''); and Chris Carter (''The X-Files,'' ``Harsh
Realm''); John Wells (''ER,'' ``Third Watch'').
</P>
<P>
   Are networks still programming by fear? Are we seeing shows
based more on economics than quality? Are we getting the same thing
we got last season and the season before that?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Certainly. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   That said, let's stroll the plank, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   Great: ``Once and Again'' (ABC), ``The West Wing'' (NBC),
``Freaks and Geeks'' (NBC), ``Malcolm in the Middle'' (Fox).
</P>
<P>
   Good: ``Judging Amy'' (CBS), ``Roswell'' (WB), ``Action'' (Fox),
``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' (NBC).
</P>
<P>
   Promising: ``Grown Ups'' (UPN), ``Angel,'' (WB), ``Family Law''
(CBS), ``Get Real'' (Fox), ``Popular'' (WB), ``Now and Again''
(CBS).
</P>
<P>
   Stinkers: ``The Parkers'' (UPN), ``The Mike O'Malley Show''
(NBC), ``Shasta McNasty'' (UPN), ``Wasteland'' (ABC), ``Manchester
Prep'' (Fox), ``Odd Man Out'' (ABC).
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what'll stick, what won't. Figure in: days, times,
competition, whether a show's producer has ticked off a network
president. ``Once and Again'' and ``Judging Amy'' go head-to-head,
``Action'' is on Thursdays (where NBC still reigns, remember?),
``Freaks and Geeks'' is so dead-on it could turn off teens looking
for fantasy and adults unwilling to relive their own geekdom.
</P>
<P>
   Be selective. Be critical. Sample stuff you don't normally
watch. See what life is like outside the NBC Thursday universe,
away from WB's fountain of youth.
</P>
<P>
   You may just find something you love, something you desire,
something you rush home to catch each week.
</P>
<P>
   Until they cancel it.
</P>

DOCTOR SAYS PRAYER GAINING WIDER ACCEPTANCE AS A HEALING POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dr. Larry Dossey began practicing as an internist in Dallas
several years ago, he was an agnostic who never considered praying
for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical of all this religious stuff,'' Dossey said.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Dossey, a highly respected physician who was chief of staff of
Medical City Dallas in the 1980s, now is the nation's most
passionate advocate of combining faith and the practice of
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data was just too strong to ignore,'' Dossey said this
week. His own experiences with inexplicable ``miracle cures,'' and
studies showing that prayer and faith can be a factor in whether
someone gets well, finally convinced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that grabbed me by the ears were the studies,'' said
Dossey, who received his doctorate from the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Dossey's bestseller, ``Healing Words: The Power of Prayer and
the Practice of Medicine,'' and his ``Prayer Is Good Medicine''
told of his change of heart and cited convincing studies indicating
that prayer can help heal.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a new book, ``Reinventing Medicine: Beyond Mind-Body
to a New Era of Healing,'' which updates the minirevolution going
on in which physicians and other healers are beginning to take
spirituality seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has its critics _ those who say the studies are
flawed or not extensive enough. But they are not going to slow down
the trend, Dossey believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have a cynical attitude toward this movement are
picking on the most superficial studies and avoiding the strong
ones,'' he said. ``They seem to be oblivious to the good this can
do. But they are doing nothing to slow down this rapidly evolving
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reinventing Medicine'' goes a step further, declaring that
so-called isolated incidences of miracle happenings in medicine are
an example of a higher spiritual force at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought another look at this was in order,'' Dossey said.
``When I wrote `Healing Words' in 1993, no medical schools had
courses in this. Now more than 60 medical schools have courses in
spirituality and healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dossey's new book again cites studies from Duke University
Medical School and other respected institutions indicating that
prayer, even long-distance prayer, can have a salutory effect on
healing.
</P>
<P>
   But he goes even further in suggesting that the spiritual
dimension should be a major part of medical practice. He urges
doctors to consider use of dreams, intuition and even ``hunches''
given to them by patients in diagnosing and treating illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get more outrageous,'' Dossey said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a study from the Southwest SIDS (Sudden Infant Death)
Center near Houston indicating that 21 percent of parents who lost
a child to sudden infant death syndrome had strong feelings that
their child would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I believe is that there is some faculty _ I call it the
`non-local' mind _ which sometimes causes us to see into the
future,'' he said. ``I know we have ridiculed it and scoffed at it
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Dossey said that in his own practice, he once had a woman who
dreamed she had three white spots on her left ovary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The radiologist laughed at her until his sonogram proved she
was right,'' Dossey said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he admits that not all of his conclusions are backed by
solid studies, Dossey declares in his new book that it is time for
physicians to use some of the same techniques physicians used in
earlier eras of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even 100 years ago, most doctors were comfortable with using
prayer in medicine,'' he said. ``There wasn't a hell of a lot
doctors could do at that time, so they had better pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Dossey said that doctors should use spiritual forces as a matter
of practicality to help improve the chances of recovering from
heart disease or cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the biggest payoff that can come from these studies is the
realization that there is something about human beings that goes
beyond the brain and the physical,'' Dossey said. ``I don't know
any other way to slice and dice this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he realizes he is mixing science and theology, Dossey
is convinced that the mysterious effects of spirituality on healing
can only lead to the conclusion that humans live beyond their
physical lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I have a soul meter,'' he said. ``But I believe
there is something about us that is eternal.''

`THE TRUST': A FAMILY AND A NEWSPAPER ENTWINED 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ky., Tenn.) (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER OGDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the Reagan administration's
power, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, then publisher of The New York
Times, was invited to a private White House lunch with the
president, the vice president and the secretary of state. When it
ended, he hurried to The Times' Washington bureau and, elated,
called his mother, Iphigene. ``Mom, guess who I had lunch with?''
</P>
<P>
   How wonderful, the family doyenne replied after he told her,
adding with exquisite timing, ``What did they want?''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents, nations, corporations, causes and citizens have all
wanted something _ ideally approval or at least recognition _ from
the world's most influential newspaper. Then in his third decade as
publisher, Punch Sulzberger, as he has always been known,
understood that as well as his mother did. She was the daughter of
Adolph S. Ochs, who had bought the bankrupt paper in 1896, and was
the wife of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who succeeded Ochs in 1935 and
served as publisher for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   The authority of the Times remains unequaled today, two years
after Sulzberger stepped aside as chairman, ceding the crown of the
multibillion-dollar public company to his son, Arthur Sulzberger
Jr., in an exercise of divine right that Arthur of Camelot would
have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Such primacy does not just happen, nor is it easily sustained, a
reality few comprehend better than the wife-husband writing team of
Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones. Their 1990 book ``The Patriarch:
The Rise and Fall of the Bingham Dynasty,'' examined three
generations of the powerful Kentucky family that built a great
publishing company only to have it collapse in a tangle of greed
and jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   In their new book, ``The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family
Behind The New York Times,'' Ms. Tifft and Jones made the most of a
larger canvas and a biographer's dream situation: full access to
the Sulzbergers and archives of the Times with no family control
over what the authors wrote. (Jones covered the press for The New
York Times from 1983 to 1992.) The result is a riveting family
story. In seamless authoritative prose, with rich, uncluttered
detail, precise characterizations and a solid sense of historical
context and social dynamics, the authors relate how four
generations of Ochses and Sulzbergers built the Times while, not
incidentally, avoiding the fate of the Binghams.
</P>
<P>
   The tone is admiring but realistic. No hagiography this. And
yes, there is a pile of dirty laundry fairly sorted, from drug
abuse and extramarital affairs to brutal office battles and
stunning incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens in 1996 at a party at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art celebrating the centenary of the purchase by Ochs, the
patriarch. He was the son of a poor German Jew, a dreamer who
immigrated to Louisville, Ky., and a rigid Bavarian mother. He grew
up with an affinity for balance and a love of newspapering. At 20
he bought The Chattanooga Times and 18 years later, with backers'
money, he purchased the insolvent New York Times, whose greatest
value, he said, was its ``good name.''
</P>
<P>
   A nonreligious Jew and journalistic visionary, Ochs was
determined that The New York Times not be a ``Jewish newspaper,''
but a newspaper of record, which it became during World War I by
printing uncut official documents from all sides. Ochs' failure to
press editorially for an unconditional German surrender, though,
prompted criticism that the paper was treasonous. Distressed, he
suffered a breakdown, which, combined with angst about the rise of
Hitler and succession at the newspaper, plunged him into manic
depression.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Iphigene, the ``institutional gyroscope'' of the
family and, by extension, of the Times, effectively picked her
husband to succeed her father. During the next quarter-century,
more analysis and photos, larger headlines and columns with bylines
pushed daily circulation up 40 percent; Sunday sales nearly
doubled, rising by 600,000. Staff size doubled and, of greater
significance as the Sulzbergers produced three daughters and Punch,
the newspaper became an overwhelming presence in the family's life.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that meant a two-ton rhinoceros in the living room;
for others, a role at the Times became all-important. Ms. Tifft and
Jones write that all considered themselves stewards of a public
trust, not a private possession, and recognized that the Times was
shaping their destiny as well as the nation's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Such noblesse oblige had its drawbacks. The family wanted
quality but hated discussing finance. With no budgets and little
planning, the company operated for decades more as a foundation
than as a commercial enterprise. The overpowering sense of
responsibility drove Arthur Hays Sulzberger to an addiction to
prescription drugs. Orvil E. Dryfoos, husband of Marian, the eldest
child of Iphigene and Arthur, lasted only two years as publisher
before the pressure, intensified by the crushing 114-day newspaper
strike of 1962-63, brought on a fatal heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Punch Sulzberger appeared hopelessly unready when he took over
in 1963. He lacked charisma and intellectual credentials but was
saved by common sense and solid Ochsian instincts, certainly not
innate news sense. As a reporter in Paris, he attended a race at Le
Mans on his day off and saw a car fly off the track and kill 83
spectators but never thought to call in the story. Fortunately, he
exercised a light hand over the newsroom, where he installed the
brilliant and mercurial A.M. Rosenthal as editor.
</P>
<P>
   All the larger-than-life newspaper figures are here, plus the
big news stories, analyzed without fear or favor, in the words of
the credo Ochs declared in his first editorial: the mishandled
Teapot Dome scandal, the Bay of Pigs invasion, which the Times knew
about in advance but did not report, and pained efforts to cover
the rise of gay culture in the 1990s. Finest hours, like the
publication of the Pentagon Papers, are clearly presented, but so
are the worst moments, including the Holocaust, which the paper
scarcely deigned to note, and the front-page story on the
liberation of Dachau that never mentioned the word Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Technically ``The Trust'' is a biography, but at heart this is a
love story about a family and the unique institution it created and
nurtures. Little wonder that the current publisher, Arthur
Sulzberger Jr., challenged by the Internet and an industrywide
decline in newspaper readership, feels pressure too. ``Deep in
Arthur's soul,' an editor explains, ``he believes that if he blows
this, he will burn in hell.'' Given the younger Sulzberger's family
history, Hades ought to be the least of his worries.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ How quickly has this event grown? Consider
that the PGA of America will issue roughly 1,200 media credentials
for the matches at The Country Club, and USA and NBC will combine
to televise 27 hours of competition over the three days. To put
that growth in perspective, the 1983 Ryder Cup at Palm Beach
Gardens in Florida attracted a handful of media members (most of
them from the British press) and a local ABC affiliate shooting
highlight clips. Live coverage did not begin until 1989, and then
only on cable.

<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady. In her 60s, she was still a
voice to be heard, particularly in support of women and children,
struggling to advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of
post-communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   We spoke in June 1998 at Boston's Copley Plaza Hotel. At the
time Mrs. Gorbachev was full of energy. The translator was the
Gorbachev's longtime personal aide, Pavel Palazchenko.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: We really didn't have first ladies, in the
traditional sense of that term. In many civilized countries _ say,
the United States or Germany or France _ there are laws or
traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and rights of
the wife of the head of state. In Russia, we did not have that.
There were czarinas, there were empresses. Lenin's wife surely had
her own personality, but then came Stalin, and after Stalin, we
very simply did not have any role for the wife of the head of
state. No one knew them, they were invisible and basically
nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the FIRST first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She shows a lot of dignity and
professionalism _ this is an element of character one has to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about my project, Raisa Gorbachev's
Club, a civic group that has been active for almost a year. It was
created by me and a number of wonderful women: authors,
journalists, some members of the State Duma and women who are
social scientists. We aren't an elite club for socializing and not
a political club either. We are a discussion forum to debate the
urgent issues. We are focussing now on an important problem that
has not been properly addressed by government, so we are looking
for support from other people to try to address it: the plight of
Russia's homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the
streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross. He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that
today the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and
creating a kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and
mistreating him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She shows a lot of dignity and
professionalism _ this is an element of character one has to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about my project, Raisa Gorbachev's
Club, a civic group that has been active for almost a year. It was
created by me and a number of wonderful women: authors,
journalists, some members of the State Duma and women who are
social scientists. We aren't an elite club for socializing and not
a political club either. We are a discussion forum to debate the
urgent issues. We are focussing now on an important problem that
has not been properly addressed by government, so we are looking
for support from other people to try to address it: the plight of
Russia's homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the
streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross. He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that
today the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and
creating a kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and
mistreating him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

SECRET'S IN THE MARINADE FOR TECH-STYLE CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to fix coding) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in peacetime, Mark Miller can't talk much about his job.
</P>
<P>
   He works in a laboratory at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and
what he does is secret.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is a professor of meat science and muscle biology and
right now he is applying his knowledge and expertise toward the
making of a really good, tasty, uniform chicken-fried steak.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the need for stealth.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, we already have some pretty good
chicken-fried steak in Texas. And secondly, not everyone agrees on
how a good chicken-fried steak tastes. Some people like the
deep-fried kind, others prefer pan-fried. No one likes those frozen
little wafers sold in chain grocery stores, and let's not even talk
about cutlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a pretty secret kind of development over the last
couple of years,'' Miller said of his research. ``We've been
working on it for two years and we think we can have the program up
and running by the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Miller and the people in the food lab at Texas Tech
have been working on more than just chicken-fried steak. The
project involves other cuts of steak like tenderloins, rib-eyes,
and strip loins. They even have some oven-ready roasts.
</P>
<P>
   But the chicken-fried steaks are where the real glamour lies.
They are literally the toughest cuts to master.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a proprietary, patented process,'' Miller said. ``We
marinate cuts of meat from the chuck and round _ normally tough and
dry and lower quality. We make it juicy, flavorful and tender.''
</P>
<P>
   The marinade is the secret part. Don't expect a quick wash in a
store-bought teriyaki sauce to work. It takes a good deal more.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and the folks at the food lab are working with Texas
T-Bone Express, a consortium of cattle raisers and feedlot
operators in Amarillo who will eventually market the product. Texas
T-Bone has put up the money for research and Tech put forth some of
its students as tasters.
</P>
<P>
   It was clearly an equitable trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a sensory panel here at the lab,'' Miller explained.
``We actually eat the meat and determine how much, or little, we
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some pretty bad efforts, he said. Some of the
early tests were tough in texture and bad in taste.
</P>
<P>
   But the final products are good, he insisted. ``We're ready. All
we need is a couple of million bucks to turn on the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Texas T-Bone Express believe that the biggest problem
with beef these days is its varied quality. Beef producers claim
you can't tell one chicken from the other _ they all taste the same
_ but the same can't be said of beef.
</P>
<P>
   The marinade process will take care of that, they believe.
Whether you buy your steak at a restaurant, a wholesaler or
retailer, it will always taste juicy and tender. No matter the
cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't say what's in the marinade right now,'' Miller said.
``But it is something that offers quality consistency in beef
products.''
</P>
<P>
   That really leaves only one additional problem. Who's going to
make the gravy?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not our problem,'' Miller said. ``We'll leave that to
someone else.''

 &HT;    A rock-solid source of healing for spirit
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 23.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Call it the Rorschach rock: Look at it, and
you see so much more than a hunk of stone jutting from the earth,
halfway down the hill from the cabin toward Fightingtown Creek.
Like an ever-changing inkblot, this rock is a topographical wonder,
a garden feature, a place to sit and lie and be. And for me it is,
now more than ever, a dispenser of much-needed medicine.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, The Rock is one great piece of stone. Shaped like a
half-moon, with ruffled edges resembling flower petals on the
curved side, it measures some 20 feet across and 10 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Starting a year ago, it grew more and more impressive as Lyn, an
avid archaeologist by love, if not training, and I began shoveling,
hacking, snipping, pulling, scraping, chopping, sawing and sweeping
away layers of dirt, mosses, lichen, brush, weeds, saplings.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from under those stubborn layers were more than a dozen
mysterious markings _ gashes pointing toward the creek. The
indentations, up to about an inch deep and 6 inches long, intrigue
all who venture onto The Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Do these markings belong to Cherokees who held council meetings
on this great stone? Do they have meaning, mystical or ordinary? Or
do they simply result from chops with a tool of some sort? Seeking
answers, I arranged for The Rock to have a visitor: Tommy Charles,
archaeologist at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. He
spent some time one steamy day examining the big outcropping of
gray stone, during his summertime tour of North Georgia
petroglyphs.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's visit was part of my threat to garden on the side of the
cabin that faces the creek _ a daunting task, considering the
land's stumps, roots, rocks and death-defying steepness. Still, it
must be done, as I need my stamp on the land. So, as I reached
near-saturation after planting furiously on the road side, I began
planning my plantings on the aerobic slope down to Fightingtown.
Uncovering The Rock necessarily had been the first step, as this
piece of stone is the focal point of all focal points, no matter
what flora I put in. On the creek side, all design flows from The
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we humans have an undeniable need to mark any piece of
land we light on, planting trees, shrubs, flowers, even in spaces
as abundant with natural beauty as the Blue Ridge, we also have an
insatiable desire to know intimate details of our spaces. Who lived
here? What signs of their existence did they leave? What does it
all mean to me? Thus, my invitation to Tommy Charles.
</P>
<P>
   With neighbor friends Ethelene Dyer Jones and her husband, the
Rev. Grover Jones, we climbed down the slope toward The Rock. The
closer we got, the more we saw, although we did not necessarily see
the same sights.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at one marking whose shape was particularly distinctive,
Ethelene, a gifted poet with the eye of a romantic, likened it to
``a bird in flight.'' The grooves remind me of birds, too. The
tracks of birds, large, winged creatures with feet of fire that lit
on this stone and burned in their footprints.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy conceded the grooves are unusual, and he understood our
temptation to romanticize them, to ascribe their existence to those
who belonged to the land before us.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he was honor-bound to offer the most plausible
explanation, based on his examinations of many, many rocks and his
consultations with geologists over the years: ``Water is the
biggest culprit,'' he said. ``Ice is part of it, too, with the
freezes and thaws.'' During this process, he said, some material,
soft rock, maybe, or chunks of quartz, gets pushed out of the rock,
leaving the gashes.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy painted a picture of a world within The Rock filled with
creative chaos: ``The rock splits, and hot gases and water come
through it; residual quartz is left to bind it back together again.
All kinds of weird things go in rock. They appear cultural but are
really natural. Nature's still the champ'' in designing, whether on
a rock or in a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Though I had counted on learning that people made the scars, I
take natural comfort in knowing the gashes may be yet another
result of a beautiful power that always awes and inspires.
</P>
<P>
   And heals. In fact, whatever else The Rock is, it is a healing
place. For body and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   I will use it much in the coming months as I take strong,
wearying, doctor-prescribed medicines to recover from an illness.
During that time my column _ beginning with this one _ will appear
every other Thursday.

 &HT;    Tulipmania! Crazy or not, fall's the time to think spring
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 23.
 &HT;    B y Danny c . Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop what you're doing. Stick a note on the fridge. Tie a string
around your finger.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't forget to plant tulips this fall.
</P>
<P>
   If you do, come March, as you emerge from months of wintry
blahs, you'll miss out on that first burst of seasonal color _ the
simple reassurance that spring is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, people forget to plant spring bulbs in the fall,
and we get this flurry of phone calls in January from people saying
they bought them but never got around to planting them and is it
too late,'' said Sally Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the Dutch bulb
industry. ``Then the next wild run of calls comes in April and May,
when they want to know where they can buy bulbs to plant for that
spring. People are so sad when they find out it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Fall begins today, and spring bulbs are popping up daily in
garden centers and mail-order catalogs and on Web sites. More than
half a million will be sold in the United States, and this fall
shoppers are expected to flock to tulips in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling their interest are half a dozen new books and even a
Hollywood film about the simple bulb's rich history. Steven
Spielberg's DreamWorks studio has optioned the rights to Deborah
Moggach's romantic novel ``Tulip Fever,'' set in 17th-century
Amsterdam against the backdrop of Tulipmania _ the speculative
stock market scandal that arose in the Netherlands from
astronomical prices demanded for tulip bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1600s, the bulbs _ native to the eastern
Mediterranean, not the Netherlands _ were sold by weight, usually
while still in the ground. Traders earned as much as 60,000 florins
a month (about $44,000 by today's standards), and people rushing to
cash in traded family homes, small businesses and even dowries. By
1637, the bottom fell out, and thousands met financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating,'' said Ferguson, who works at the
Netherlands Flower Bulb Information Center in New York. ``Beyond
the Dutch economy, the economy of Europe faltered as well, because
it really had big ripple effects.''
</P>
<P>
   So why the Tulipmania mania? Some economic experts believe angst
over Internet stocks _ many of which are considered grossly
overvalued _ may mirror the earlier episode, Ferguson said. Others
believe there's more to it than comparing financial frenzies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just such a simple, elegant flower, with tight buds, and
is good for cutting,'' said Chris Hansen of Wayside Gardens, a
mail-order nursery in Hodges, S.C. ``Plus, there's the fact that
they bloom when nothing else is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many adults were first exposed to tulips in kindergarten, when
the bud's pure classic shape made it a favorite for Crayola
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Others are fascinated by the flower's ``movement'' in the garden
or vase. ``They almost dance,'' Ferguson said. ``After they're cut,
they can grow an inch taller because they follow the light and bend
with gravity. You never see them as stiff little soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the critical planting time. The autumn ritual of
buying and planting bulbs is a means for cleansing the gardening
slate of last summer's failures and looking ahead to spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some points to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How to buy: About half of all bulbs are sold by mail-order
catalogs, published in summer; the rest are available at garden
centers in early fall. Catalogs offer more variety than retailers,
but bulbs can cost more because of shipping expenses. Regardless,
buy early while selection is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What to buy: Nearly all tulip bulbs sold by the Dutch are
propagated and grown in the Netherlands. Currently, more than 3,500
hybrids and species are available. Yet many gardeners opt for the
varieties grown nearly four centuries ago, such as Rembrandts
(circa 1610), the famous mottled tulips that launched the trading
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   New tulips drawing wows include three late bloomers _ Dordogne,
with a raspberry-edged tangerine flower; Toyota, rosy red-edged in
white; and Avignon, dark rose edged in orange _ said Gerald Suhonen
of Van Bloem Gardens, a wholesale bulb and perennial distributor in
Alpharetta. ``Orange has become more and more popular, especially
when combined with blues and purples,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When to plant: Late October to mid-November, while soil is
still warm enough to encourage root growth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How to plant: Choose a sunny location and loosen the soil at
least 6 inches. Amend with compost and 10-10-10 fertilizer, mixing
thoroughly. (Feed tulips again in spring once leaves emerge.)
Slightly mound the soil to promote good drainage. Plant bulbs, tips
pointing up, about 6 inches deep, spaced about one bulb's width
apart. For best effect, plant in masses, not rows. Cover the bulbs,
water and top with about 2 inches of mulch.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How to use: Because tulips need about three months of cool,
sunny weather after blooming to rebloom a second year, treat them
as annuals in this climate. Combine them with violas, muscari,
hostas or winter vegetables, said Mildred Pinnell, horticulturist
at the Atlanta Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to use tulips so they come up through a ground cover
of parsley, evergreen thyme or oregano,'' said Dottie Myers, an
Atlanta landscape architect. ``Since you plant pansies earlier than
bulbs, you can go back and plant tulips between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pansies? Make a note of it.

 &HT;    `West Wing' chaos on the money, Blitzer says
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNN's Wolf Blitzer was a White House correspondent for seven
years. Although he's now an anchor, he says that during his tenure,
``I spent more time in the West Wing of the White House than I did
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   So we gave Blitzer a tape of the pilot of NBC's ``The West
Wing'' for a reality check. How well does it capture both the feel
and the details of life in the White House? His reaction:
</P>
<P>
   ``This White House reminds me of the first year of the Clinton
administration. It was chaos, a real mess. You had all these close
aides from the campaign without a whole lot of experience in
government, and it was like a little kids' soccer game: Everybody
just goes after the ball. I think they were trying to re-create
that mess.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the details:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Everyone referring to the president as POTUS, an acronym for
President of the United States: ``That is widely used. The White
House has this paging system, and on that paging system it's always
POTUS: `POTUS will be in the Oval Office in 10 minutes.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ubiquitous beepers: ``That's true. In this White House the
beeper is a very powerful communicator. But most (aides) have them
vibrating on their belts so you don't hear them going off. People
are always looking down at their belts and grabbing them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The physical layout: ``There were some serious flaws. When you
walk into the West Wing the lobby is really small. They made it
look huge, with huge marble floors. The Roosevelt Room has no glass
on the doors, and they made it look bigger than it really is. In
the press briefing room, the presidential seal behind the podium
was smaller than it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The speech: ``They mention the president giving his Sunday
morning radio address. It isn't Sunday, it's a Saturday morning
radio address.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The press: ``I was sort of dreading that they'd have some
fictitious guy from a cable news organization with a beard and a
weird name.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Overall: ``Some of it was silly. Some of it was pretty
authentic. I thought as a TV show it was not `The Sopranos' or
`ER,' the ones I really like. It kept my interest. I think people
in Washington will like it, but people outside the Beltway might
not follow it too easily.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   An autumnal air mass will cover the Eastern states as a frontal
system shifts off the Atlantic seaboard. Farther west, unseasonable
warmth will spread from the Northwestern states to the northern and
central Plains. While most of the nation will be dry, moisture from
the remnants of Pacific Tropical Storm Hilary will bring numerous
showers to the Southwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a few sprinkles will linger from the Appalachians to
the Middle Atlantic and Northeast coasts early Wednesday in the
wake of a cold front. Showers will linger through midday in
northern New England and near the North Carolina coast where
onshore winds will persist. Meanwhile, cool breezes from the north
and northwest will gradually deliver drier air to the region
resulting in some afternoon sunshine from the interior Northeast to
the Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly dawn, a mild day with abundant sunshine will
develop from the southern Plains to the interior Southeast. Patchy
clouds and a few showers will occur near the eastern and southern
shores of Florida as a cold front moves into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western states, high-level winds from the south will draw
tropical moisture north through the deserts of the Southwest into
central parts of California and Nevada. As a result, there will be
variable clouds and scattered showers. A few afternoon
thunderstorms will form, especially over the mountainous terrain.
Farther north, a sprawling zone of high pressure will sponsor
mainly sunny and very warm weather in most of the Northwestern
states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Distant Danger
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, Hurricane Gert passed 100 miles east of Bermuda
where winds gusted to 74 mph. But nearly 1000 miles away in Puerto
Rico, residents were being warned of danger from the storm as waves
up to 18 feet were crashing along the northern shores. The large
swells were spawned by the hurricane during the last several days
as it moved gradually north, churning the waters of the central
Atlantic. When the wind stirs the open sea, a wide spectrum of wave
sizes are generated. In time, smaller waves disperse, leaving
larger swells to carry on toward distant shores.

 &HT;    FLOODWATERS SPREADING POLLUTANTS, CONSERVATIONISTS WARN
 &HT;    By BOB DART and EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Contaminated floodwater from Hurricane Floyd is
spreading farm wastes and other pollutants into surrounding
waterways, conservationists warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovering from a hurricane is tough enough without this major
water pollution crisis,'' said Carl Pope, executive director of the
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of gallons of hog waste have washed out of giant
lagoons used to hold the excrement on North Carolina pig farms. On
Maryland's Eastern Shore, tons of chicken waste have floated into
the Chesapeake Bay. In addition, the floodwaters have been tainted
by carcasses of an estimated 2.4 million dead chickens, 500,000
dead turkeys and 100,000 dead hogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wastewater treatment plants have failed. Septic tanks have
failed. Hog lagoons have been overrun. And swamps have emptied,''
said Dennis McBride, North Carolina's health director. ``That means
that all of the floodwater has the potential to have contamination
of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Floodwaters ``could harbor bacterial disease,'' McBride said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Polluted floodwaters could also cause widespread environmental
damage as they mix into river systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the flooding, the Sierra Club urged the
Environmental Protection Agency to ban the lagoons used to store
animal waste and to prohibit ``factory farms'' from operating in
flood plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental disaster caused by the inundation of hog
lagoons and massive hog and chicken farms in North Carolina and
Maryland is a wake-up call for tough national rules on industrial
livestock operations,'' said Pope.
</P>
<P>
   However, Beth Anne Mumford, a spokesperson for the North
Carolina Pork Council, said it is too early to assess the
environmental damage. There has been no confirmation of the state's
estimate of 100,000 dead hogs, she said. ``Farmers are still out in
boats trying to save their animals.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is the nation's largest producer of turkeys, its
second-largest producer of hogs and its third-largest producer of
chickens. Environmental activists have long urged stronger
regulation of large pork and poultry agribusinesses.
</P>
<P>
   These operations are more like ``a factory than a family farm,''
said Ed Hopkins, the Sierra Club's senior Washington
representative.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, in ``giant hog barns,'' the waste of
thousands of animals is flushed out into lagoons stretching across
several acres. The liquid portion of the waste is eventually
sprayed onto hay fields as fertilizer. The remaining sludge
decomposes _ ``giving off tremendous odors'' _ but eventually
builds up until a new lagoon must be dug.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's floodwaters have overflowed some of these lagoons. The
result is not only possible contamination of drinking water from
wells but also large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous being
flushed into rivers. These chemicals ``basically kill rivers,''
said Hopkins, by spurring algae growth. Oxygen is depleted, so fish
die.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is the same when waste from chickens and turkeys is
washed into the Chesapeake Bay, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of this magnitude is the worst possible scenario for hog
waste lagoons, said Marion Smith, executive director of the Neuse
River Foundation, a North Carolina environmental protection group.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many words for disaster do you know?'' asked Smith. She
described aerial photos showing pink ribbons of pig waste streaming
from some barely flooded lagoons. On completely submerged farms,
the waste water is completely mixed and indistinguishable from the
surrounding floodwaters, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neuse riverkeeper Rick Dove said a disaster like this was
inevitable. ``It's never been a question of if. It's always been a
question of when,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gaskins, a hog farmer in Black Jack, N.C., said Tar
River flooding has not been a problem for his operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just got through pumping my lagoon down where it was
supposed to be'' before Floyd struck, he explained. When rains came
and the lagoon threatened to overflow, he called the state Division
of Water Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me permission to pump it back down,'' he said.
Normally farmers are not allowed to spray the liquid waste onto
already soaked fields.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in North Carolina, an immediate health concern is the
disposal of rotting livestock carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said two portable incinerators were already
burning dead hogs and that 10 more will be brought in from Florida.
Above-ground composting is being considered for poultry carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture commissioner Jim Graham notified the EPA that the
state plans to use several insecticides approved for other uses to
kill blowflies that feed on livestock carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly populations could become a huge public health menace,''
Graham told the Associated Press. The insecticides will be applied
to hog, turkey, chicken, cattle and horse carcasses before they are
buried or burned.
</P>
<P>
   The polluted floodwaters pose ``all kinds'' of health risks,
said Debbie Crain, a spokeswoman with the North Carolina Public
Health Service. For instance, drinking the contaminated water could
cause gastrointestinal diseases, she said, and getting it on the
skin could cause infections.
</P>
<P>
   However, floodwaters are not associated with hepatitis A or
typhoid fever, she said, and the agency is not recommending any
special immunizations _ except a tetanus shot for those who haven't
had one in the past 10 years.

   NEW YORK _ As a diner in search of the extraordinary at
Lespinasse, you could easily overlook it on the menu. But it is
there, poulet roti a la broche, chicken roasted on a spit, without
pretense and without apology.
</P>
<P>
   If you should dare to order something so plain, a thrill is in
store. A waiter will appear before you with a whole chicken, brown
as nutmeg, with skin like a fragile shell shadowed with flat chips
of truffle. The waiter will carve it, cutting through the bird as
fluidly as if it were pie, and set it on your plate with a small
heap of spinach salad and white asparagus as thin as shoestring.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be an anomaly? A flight of whimsy on the part of the
chef?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Daniel, Lutece, Le Cirque 2000, Bouley Bakery and
Chanterelle serve roast chicken, too. Long the dish of bistros and
home cooking, the safe bet of wary diners, roast chicken has become
a staple on top menus. It is a dish to please the masses and
challenge the masters.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco DiSpirito, the chef at Union Pacific, compared roasting a
chicken to cooking an omelet. ``It's a yardstick by which you can
measure a chef's talent,'' he said. Any chef can impress diners
with luxury foods like foie gras and caviar, but the chef who can
turn a humble, bony bird like chicken into something exquisite has
talent, and most likely a following.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, of course, that as hungry as New York diners are
for the latest in cooking, many go out enough to want something
simple occasionally. Savvy diners may choose a restaurant because
they know the chef can perform miracles with sweetbreads, but all
they may really want to eat is chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Eberhard Mueller, the chef at Lutece, learned that the hard way.
When he was hired at the restaurant, he took roast chicken off the
menu. ``It just seemed a little too ordinary,'' Mueller said. The
regulars sent out a collective shriek. As a compromise, the
restaurant now keeps chickens in the house at all times and roasts
them by request.
</P>
<P>
   These restaurants are offering chicken as comfort food, but
plain roasted chicken it is not. At Daniel, it is slowly browned on
a rotisserie, basted with lightly salted French butter or duck fat
and served with large soft pieces of chanterelles and porcini.
Milk-fed baby chickens are pan roasted at Gramercy Tavern and set
on a sauce thickened with liver and a fondue of leeks. These roast
chickens are full flavored like game: moist, toothsome and, yes,
elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs have raised the bar, demanding better chickens to work
with and tossing aside classic roasting techniques to develop
better ones. Which is much of the reason that chefs now serve
chicken with as much confidence and frequency as for foie gras.
``We were much more pretentious chefs a decade ago,'' DiSpirito
said. ``And a decade ago, I don't think we had the same quality of
birds.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the mid-1980s that New York chefs began using organic
chickens. In 1986, when the Quilted Giraffe, then one of the city's
most expensive restaurants, put chicken on its menu, it raised
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, said Barry Wine, an owner of the restaurant, chicken
didn't qualify as fine restaurant fare. ``The impetus for putting
chicken on the menu at a restaurant like the Quilted Giraffe was
trips to France,'' he said. ``Wherever we traveled in France, in
the three-star restaurants, there was chicken on the menu. When
free-range chickens came along here, we saw it as the opportunity
to be like France, to have chicken on the menu, but chicken we were
proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, restaurants have moved toward higher-quality
products. Chefs began seeking free-range chickens just as they
looked to buy organic vegetables, locally caught fish and cheeses
from small farms. The movement has altered the spectrum of
restaurant food. The improved quality of chickens has captured the
fascination of chefs. ``I have it because this chicken is so good
it's worth being on the menu,'' said Tom Colicchio, the chef at
Gramercy Tavern, who uses organic, free-range chickens raised for
D'Artagnan at Eberly Poultry, in Lancaster County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The best restaurants, like Jo Jo and Lespinasse, use Eberly
chickens, which are free of antibiotics or growth stimulants and
are fed organic grains and well water.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Eberly, an owner of the farm, said his chickens have more
flavor because it takes longer for them to grow to full size. They
reach three pounds in seven to eight weeks, while commercial
chickens take only five to five and a half weeks. The added time
allows their muscles to develop more fully, and hence their flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, some chefs are looking for even more in a chicken.
Restaurants like Gramercy Tavern and Daniel want chickens from Four
Story Hill Farm, in Honesdale, Pa., which feeds its chickens milk
to flavor the flesh like veal and give it more gelatin. Union
Pacific uses chickens from New Yuen Roy Live Poultry Market in the
Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, which gets organic chickens from
Lancaster County, Pa., and then slaughters them using Buddhist
methods.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between these chickens and those from commercial
farms are tremendous. To show how different, Colicchio roasted a
Perdue chicken, a Murray's all-natural chicken and an Eberly
chicken. The Perdue was yellow and so plump it made the others look
skinny. But its flavor was one dimensional, and the meat fell apart
in my mouth; I barely had to chew it. The Murray's had a slightly
better texture, but it was stringy and wet, had no aroma and was
flavorless compared with the Eberly, which was rich, meaty and had
a subtle gaminess like a bird from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The price differences correspond somewhat: at Food Emporium
stores in Manhattan, Perdue chicken is $1.99 a pound, Murray's is
$2.49, and D'Artagnan's private-label chickens from Eberly Farms
are $2.79.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs who make the effort to buy great chickens also tend to
take great pains cooking them. About the only consideration most
chefs agree on is that the chicken be small, three to three and a
half pounds, so that it may be cooked to order.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A typical restaurant trick is to roast the chicken
three-quarters of the way before service begins, then finish it to
order. But in better restaurants, this does not pass muster. ``If
you roast something and cut it up and let it sit out and reheat it,
it's just a totally different experience,'' said David Waltuck, the
chef at Chanterelle. The skin retains more fat, so it tends to be
flabby; the flesh loses moisture, which means it is dry.
</P>
<P>
   To roast a chicken quickly, chefs will use the cooking
equivalent of poetic license. At Gramercy Tavern, Colicchio cuts
the chicken into pieces, keeping the bones attached. He browns the
pieces slowly on the stove before putting them in the oven. He
keeps them skin side up, so that the bones beneath the flesh
protect the meat from drying out. After roasting for a few minutes,
he adds a healthy scoop of butter and herbs to the pan and spoons
the melted mixture over the chicken every few minutes to give it a
toasty skin infused with herbs. The chicken is served with glazed
vegetables, which are cooked separately, keeping the flavor of the
chicken pure.
</P>
<P>
   At Jo Jo, the method is slightly different. The pieces are
browned on the stove, then left skin side down and put into a fiery
500-degree oven. The chicken cooks quickly and turns a deep
chestnut brown. A sauce with ginger, saffron, green olives,
cinnamon and coriander is spooned over the top.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple dish. ``We try to buy the best of the best and
don't mess around with it too much,'' said Chris Beischer, the chef
at Jo Jo. ``You have to have a great chicken, a well-made chicken
stock and good olives.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a philosophy often repeated. ``We start with a good
chicken, and we take care of it while it's roasting,'' said Mueller
at Lutece. ``We make sure it doesn't burn.'' His technique is
surprisingly elementary. He seasons it inside and out with salt and
pepper, trusses it and roasts it whole, deglazing the pan with
water to make a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The great challenge in roasting chicken whole is getting the
breasts and legs to finish cooking at the same time. Before the
bird goes into the oven, Mueller makes small incisions on each side
where the breast and legs meet. This allows heat to penetrate the
cavity more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At Daniel, they hang whole chickens breast side down on a
rotisserie so that the drippings pass over the breast meat, keeping
it moist while cooking. They also press a mixture of butter,
mustard, herbs and bread crumbs under the skin. The bread crumbs,
said Alex Lee, the chef de cuisine, help to retain the moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Delouvrier, the chef at Lespinasse, uses a rotisserie,
too, but his method could not be more different, nor his opinions
more extreme. Cooking on a horizontal spit, he said, is ideal
because as the chicken turns, the juices drip down over the flesh,
so that it essentially cooks in its own juices. A spit also allows
all of the fat to fall off the chicken so that the skin
caramelizes.
</P>
<P>
   Delouvrier uses no pepper and salts only the interior cavity. As
the salt melts and the chicken turns, the seasoning soaks into the
flesh from the inside out. Salting the skin, he said, creates a
crust that tends to dry the meat and split the skin.
</P>
<P>
   He slides slices of truffle under the skin and puts a few herbs
into the cavity, then trusses it tightly. This step, he said, is
the key to keeping it juicy. Then he rubs it with butter and lets
it rotate, slowly browning, on the spit. When the breast is cooked,
he takes it off the spit and sends it out on a silver tray. Then
while the diner begins eating the carved bird, he finishes the legs
and sends them out on a separate plate.
</P>
<P>
   His pains are rewarded. Delouvrier's chicken is exquisite, each
bite more sumptuous than the next. Diners who pay $70 for two trust
him to provide nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   At the James Beard House, where a fixed-price dinner starts at
$75, organizers worry about diners making that leap of faith. The
Beard House discourages visiting chefs from using chicken as a main
course.
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Amico, a program director at the James Beard Foundation,
said, ``People can go into their supermarket and see chicken for 59
cents a pound, and when that comes up against a $75 dinner, that
may come to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, when elegance and luxury is the ideal, chicken is an
act of bravery. For the chef, and the diner.

 &HT;    Ministers bring message of change to Ohio with prayer breakfast
 &HT;    (EDS: ALSO MOVED IN (l) Lifestyle category as
PRAYER-CHANGES-COX.)
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Rev. Jimmy Adcox and the Rev. Laird Duran
aren't itinerant preachers by choice. ``We're just a couple of
local ministers who want to go back home,'' Adcox says.
</P>
<P>
   But ``home'' is Jonesboro, Ark., and because they were in the
wrong place at the right time, they now reluctantly find themselves
in demand.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, 1998, two boys at Westside Middle School pulled the
fire alarm and waited in a nearby woods as students and teachers
filed outside. Then they shot at them, killing four students and
one teacher.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Adcox, Duran and other Jonesboro ministers were
called upon to plan a memorial service, and they began to learn
what it takes to heal a grieving community.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson they shared Tuesday at the fourth annual Dayton
Prayer Breakfast, held in the Dayton Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The event drew 1,750 people, down from last year, when 3,000
attended. Event organizers said the decrease might have been
because the event was moved this year from spring to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for this year's breakfast was ``No Greater Time Than
Now: Prayer for the Youth of our City'' _ a fitting topic given
recent national tragedies such as the shootings at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., in April, said Dayton Mayor Mike
Turner, who hosts the event and chooses the guest speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Duran and Adcox were asked to come to Littleton to
assist clergy and counselors. This is only the third time they have
spoken publicly about their experiences, and they had mixed
feelings about speaking in Dayton, concerned that anyone might
think they are capitalizing on the tragedy. Another member of the
Jonesboro clergy scheduled to speak _ the Rev. Jack Harris _ pulled
out at the last minute. ``He feels an incredible closeness to the
kids at Westside, and he didn't want to be perceived as betraying
their trust and confidence in any way,'' Adcox explained.
</P>
<P>
   Duran described Jonesboro's Westside neighborhood as
country-turning-suburban, ``one of those places that is safe.''
When he heard about the shootings, he remembered thinking, ``This
isn't happening in my little town.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other clergy worked as a team, finding ways to help
friends and family members begin the hard work of healing, which
continues today. Some clergy still visit the school regularly.
There was never a trial _ the attackers were juveniles. So parents
were left to deal with their anger: ``Their child was dead, and
nothing happened.'' Helping them deal with anger became part of
Duran's ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them what to tell the people of Dayton,'' Duran said.
``One woman said, 'Tell them it's not the '50s anymore.' The world
has changed, and we need to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find new ways to minister. I used to think that
Lutherans did their thing, Baptists did their thing, and so on. But
we have our faith in common. These are all our children. We are
church. And we are called to look after all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Adcox praised the concept of a prayer breakfast, ``but it's not
enough to come together and pray. Prayers have to have feet and
hands.'' He urged the audience to make a difference in the life a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to be paralyzed by the spiritual devastation all
around us. Tell yourself, 'I can't do everything, but I can do
something. God, how can you use me?' ``

POT AND CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Why are we not surprised?
</P>
<P>
   Referendum results illicitly suppressed by Congress for a year
and only now made public by court order show that the District of
Columbia voted overwhelmingly last fall to legalize the use of
marijuana to ease the suffering of seriously ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't even close. The measure passed by 69 percent to 31
percent. Every precinct in the nation's capital, from pricey
Georgetown to rundown Anacostia, went for it.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is what conservative Republicans had feared. That is
why they refused to authorize funds to count the ballots,
arrogantly keeping the electorate in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Congress loves to push the nation's capital around, dictating
what its local officials can and cannot do. Congress is free to do
that because it has legislative and financial authority over the
city, although our worthy solons clearly exceeded their power by
denying us, the D.C. voters, the results of a democratic election.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled that Congress violated our First Amendment
right to express an opinion because no one was allowed to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional oversight was okay with most of us when Marion
Barry, convicted of possessing cocaine, was mayor. He was a major
embarrassment nobody could trust. But the city currently has as its
mayor Anthony Williams, a hard-working, honest bureaucrat who is
rapidly restoring administrative order and even filling the city's
infamous potholes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Congress still thinks it knows what is best for Washington.
To heck with the voters. Capitol Hill Republicans reacted angrily
to the referendum, promising to block any administrative move to
decriminalize pot for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Current D.C. law makes possession of marijuana a misdemeanor
punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Getting
caught is not going to ruin your life. But you won't like it.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering concept embraced by D.C. voters is highly
controversial. A year ago, the House approved by 310 to 93 a
nonbinding resolution opposing legalization of marijuana for
medicinal use, deliberately preempting the then-silent election
outcome. However sympathetic members may have been to the agonies
of the seriously ill, they were more interested in guarding against
opponents who might accuse them of being soft on all drugs,
including cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House stands with Congress on this. Politics
is politics.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in six states have approved similar legalization measures
in the last three years, permitting the possession, use,
cultivation and distribution of pot if recommended by a doctor for
a serious illness. Advocates are convinced that marijuana can make
life better for patients who have AIDS, cancer and other
devastating illnesses, and there is anecdotal evidence to support
their theory.
</P>
<P>
   Its usefulness is still largely unproved. Yet how can it ever be
proved or disproved unless there is a widespread lifting of the
criminal restrictions that prevent ill people who are not hopheads
from trying it?
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable doubts arise about control. Will marijuana really be
limited to medicinal purposes or will half the population suddenly
invent headaches that sucker some doctor into prescribing a legal
high?
</P>
<P>
   Such ambiguities do not bother the leaders of the GOP majority
in Congress. Deep in their conservative bones, they automatically
reject the whole idea.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot override legal referendums in the states. After all,
they keep lecturing us about the importance of handing federal
power over to the states. But they can stick it to the District of
Columbia, a colony that has been denied self-government. And they
intend to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Rep. Thomas Davis III, R-Va., chairman of the House
committee that runs the city, said Congress was ``determined'' to
block the measure. Mayor Williams, who supported the referendum,
was not happy. But he controls no votes in Virginia or anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are that Congress will again substitute its judgment
for that of the capital's voters. It's an old story. But at least
we stirred the pot. (Get it?) Maybe next time.

 &HT;    Flood forces students from homes
 &HT;    By Amy L. Royster
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ An estimated 2,000 to 5,000 East Carolina
University students, faculty and staff have been displaced from
their homes by flooding related to Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Dean of Students Ronald Speier said Tuesday that estimates are
rough and that they were made by tallying the number of flooded
apartments in the area. He said there also are no precise numbers
on how many faculty and staff were displaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know four of our campus police officers are homeless
because of flooding, and about half of the people in the mail room
were devastated, but came to work anyway to keep their minds off
their situations at home,'' Speier said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rumors that classes were canceled for the entire
semester, administrators assure students that classes will resume
on Monday. Parent's Weekend festivities, planned for this weekend,
are also canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking all students not to come back to Greenville
until Sunday,'' Cliff Webster, president of the Student Government
Association, said. ``We also want any student who has not called
home to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ECU Police Captain J.P. Smith reports no flood related injuries
to students. In addition to heightened patrols, the department is
providing special services such as driving some students to the
Raleigh-Durham airport and charging the electric wheel-chairs of
physically handicapped students.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, one student, 18-year-old Aaron Christopher
Childs, reported missing earlier this week, had still not been
located. Childs was last seen Thursday at 2 p.m. The Greenville
Police Department is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary shelter at Jones Residence Hall housed more than 100
students Tuesday morning. The shelter was established for students
who cannot return to their flooded Greenville apartments or
permanent homes. Calls by area residents, willing to volunteer
extra rooms to students in need of housing, inundated a telephone
matching service. By Tuesday afternoon, Speier said, only 13
students remained in need of more permanent housing.
</P>
<P>
   Speier said that while most of the students in the Jones shelter
have been placed with families, an influx of students returning for
classes next week will mean many more will need a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who want to go ahead and be put on a list to house
these students next week can call the ECU-HOME line
(252-328-4663),'' Speier said. ``Some people are offering their
homes for the entire semester. Some are providing a place to stay
for an evening and a warm meal. We will do our best to match
people's needs on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will provide a Flood Relief Center to provide counseling,
clothing and legal services,'' Speier said. ``The Student
Government Association also has an attorney on retainer, who we
will try to get down here to answer questions for students.''
</P>
<P>
   Other UNC-system schools are offering help to ECU in the form of
donated materials and financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had some of the most wonderful expressions of support
from our sister institutions,'' said Chancellor Richard Eakin.
</P>
<P>
   Webster has fielded several calls from people affiliated with
ECU's sister institutions, which want to offer assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Chapel Hill and State are taking up monetary donations
on their campuses,'' Webster said. ``SGA will make sure that money
gets into students' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our administration is working heavily to get us back in the
class and get us all on line again,'' Webster said. ``We're a
family at ECU, we've pulled together in the past and we will pull
together now.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Hollywood partnerships, like Hollywood marriages,
often don't survive the high-pressure strains they're subject to.
Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer, once best friends who helped found the
Creative Artists Agency, barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Katzenberg, formerly of Disney, and Michael Eisner
loathe each other. Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer's successful
producing partnership was virtually over even before Simpson died
after years of drug abuse. And Bob Daly and Terry Semel, a
successful and enduring partnership that ran Warner Brothers, left
the studio two months ago and may now go their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were Jim Wiatt and Jeff Berg. For nearly a decade
the two men ran International Creative Management, a top talent
agency representing such high-priced stars as Julia Roberts, Mel
Gibson and Jodie Foster. Berg, cool, cerebral and a bit aloof, was
the agency's No. 1. By contrast Wiatt, the No. 2, was known as
``the good cop,'' approachable and friendly, a schmoozer, an agent
who enjoyed guiding the careers not only of actors but of studio
executives and producers. The two men, an odd couple, seemed
inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, Wiatt announced that he was quitting International
Creative Management after a 22-year tenure, most recently as
co-chairman and co-chief executive. Three days later, the William
Morris Agency announced the appointment of Wiatt as president and
co-chief executive, succeeding Arnold Rifkin, who resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The title itself was a bit of a comedown for Wiatt, but the
money was not: he is earning at least twice what he was at ICM and
possibly more than $4 million, according to rival talent agents.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt's departure marked the biggest talent agency upheaval
since Ovitz left Creative Artists to take on the presidency of the
Walt Co. in 1994. Ovitz was dismissed from his job at Disney by
Michael D. Eisner, the chairman, and is now back representing
clients as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Wiatt, 52, to move less than two miles west to
the William Morris office in Beverly Hills has not only set off
seismic tremors in the lucrative but volatile talent agency
business. It underlined the way money, ego and power _ the forces
that drive Hollywood _ undermine even the most stable partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, sipping coffee in his elegant house in Pacific Palisades
recently, said that internal turmoil at the agency over the last
year had taken a personal toll. In June, ICM replaced its premier
film agent in New York, Sam Cohn, 70, with two younger literary
agents. ``There was a lot of anger involved and a lot of threats,''
Wiatt said, ``and it was distracting and I found myself very
unhappy in that process.'' (ICM executives said Wiatt was part of
the process.)
</P>
<P>
   More significant for Wiatt, the agency had promoted Ed Limato, a
prominent film agent who represents such stars as Gibson, Michelle
Pfeiffer and Denzel Washington, and Nancy Josephson, a television
agent, to serve as co-presidents and essentially run the agency's
day-to-day business.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt said the decision left him ambivalent. Not only was a
close friend, David Wirtschafter, passed over at the last minute to
give the job to Limato, but Wiatt said he found his job diminished.
(Wirtschafter quit earlier this month and has joined Wiatt at
William Morris).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was originally going to be Nancy and David, and it became
Nancy and Ed,'' said Wiatt. ``I didn't have so much a problem with
Nancy and Ed on a personal level, but how we worked together was
kind of ill defined. I felt my management responsibilities had been
diminished, and I was not thrilled with that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wiatt said, Berg ``was becoming more
fascinated by the technology and Internet world and seemed to spend
a great deal of time doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg said in an interview that, although he is first and
foremost a talent agent, it was vital to expand the agency into the
world of telecommunications, the Internet and satellite business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any client, studio or agent who has worked with me knows I've
remained and continue to be a full-time agent in all aspects of the
entertainment business,'' said Berg, who personally represents such
formidable moneymakers as James L. Brooks, the film and television
writer and director.
</P>
<P>
   When Wiatt left the agency, Berg said he was ``saddened'' and
that his former partner had made ``invaluable contributions'' to
ICM.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt is well liked in Hollywood and is often seen at premieres
and at a choice table at hangouts like the Palm and the Grill. ``He
has this ability to be very honest, very direct and very
enthusiastic,'' said Sherry Lansing, chairwoman and chief executive
of Paramount Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells it to you straight. In a town where people don't
often have good things to say about each other, I don't think
you'll find anyone who doesn't like and respect Jimmy Wiatt.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt brought over most of his clients to William Morris,
including Eddie Murphy, Sylvester Stallone, Neil Simon, Nora Ephron
and Penny Marshall. William Morris itself has in recent years
emerged as one of the most powerful music and television agencies,
but the movie side has not rivaled such agencies as Creative
Artists and International Creative Management (William Morris' top
moneymakers include Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Bill Cosby, Clint
Eastwood and Arnold Schwarzenegger).
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt grew up in Los Angeles, attended the University of
Southern California and worked as an administrative assistant to
Sen. John Tunney. After Tunney's loss in 1976, Wiatt worked for the
Frank Cooper television agency and then became an assistant at ICM
to Guy McElwaine, the head of the movie department. He started his
climb after that.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency business had changed remarkably over the last
20 years. ``When I started out all I needed to do was sign some
clients and get them jobs,'' he said. ``Now a good agent needs to
know the cable business, the first-run business, the foreign
finance business, the technology business. Successful agents have
got to make sure that their education and experience allows them to
give clients the opportunities to find jobs that they ordinarily
wouldn't find.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who enter the talent agency business have also
changed. Once, talent agents were mostly men with reputations as
sharks in bad suits. Now far more women have entered the business.
And agents, male and female, are almost uniformly wearing Prada
(Armani seems out). Moreover, many agents today are business school
and law school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that I hustle,'' said Wiatt. ``But I don't
consider myself a hustler.''

MODERN WINS RULING ON ART SEIZURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost two years after two paintings by Egon Schiele,
looted by the Nazis, arrived in the United States from Austria for
a three-month exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York's
highest court ruled Tuesday that a grand jury subpoena keeping the
works here while their ownership is investigated is invalid.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-to-1 decision, the New York State Court of Appeals said
that the state's 30-year-old Arts and Cultural Affairs Law did
indeed protect the works, ``Portrait of Wally'' and ``Dead City
III,'' from seizure in all cases, criminal as well as civil.
</P>
<P>
   The two paintings, which had been lent to the Modern by a
Viennese foundation, were claimed by two separate families on Dec.
31, 1997, just days before their scheduled return to Austria. The
families said the works had been confiscated from their Jewish
relatives, now dead, and had made their way improperly into the
collection of Dr. Rudolf Leopold and then into the private,
state-financed Leopold Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, obtained
a subpoena on Jan. 7, 1998, ordering the museum to hold the
paintings pending a criminal inquiry into their ownership. The
Modern then moved to quash the subpoena, citing the state law. The
state's Supreme Court, the lowest court in New York, sided with the
Modern in May 1998, but the appellate division of State Supreme
Court reversed that ruling in March.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Tuesday again backed the museum, effectively ending
the dispute about the paintings' whereabouts. ``It's over, totally
done,'' said Evan A. Davis, the lawyer for the Modern. ``It's a
state law question, and there is no appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau, in a statement, said the decision was ``wrong both
as a matter of law and policy'' and called it ``a sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   The paintings' ownership remains in dispute, and Daniel
Castleman, chief of the district attorney's investigation division,
said: ``We have to take a hard look to see what impact the ruling
will have on our investigation. The law in Austria is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Modern said it would return the two works, which have been
held in storage at the museum, to Austria as quickly as possible.
Months ago, however, the U.S. Department of Justice asked the
Modern to inform it of the plan for shipment, and the museum
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn D. Lowry, the Modern's director, was traveling overseas
Tuesday and could not be reached for comment, but the Modern issued
a statement calling the ruling ``a victory for all of the people
and museums of our state because it means that New York will
continue to be the cultural center of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen museums around the state, fearful that collectors and
other museums would be unwilling to lend artworks if the law was
not interpreted broadly, had filed a brief in support of the
Modern.
</P>
<P>
   The case essentially turned on two questions: whether the
statute's proscription against seizure applied to all judicial
proceedings and whether the subpoena constituted seizure.
Morgenthau had contended that the statute applied only to civil
proceedings, not a criminal inquiry, and that the subpoena was not
a seizure; the Modern disagreed on both counts and won on both.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority decision, Judge Richard C. Wesley wrote that the
statute's words, ``unrestricted as they are _ are not limited to
civil processes,'' citing the legislative history of the act as
backup.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of seizure, Wesley noted the time that had
lapsed without an indictment and wrote: ``The museum has been and
would continue to be precluded indefinitely from returning the
paintings to the Leopold Foundation. The subpoena here has
interfered significantly with the Leopold Foundation's possessory
interests in the paintings by compelling their indefinite detention
in New York, and thus effectuating a seizure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the court confirmed that there are no exceptions to the
state law protecting art loans from seizure, the Modern's victory
was not undiluted. The court rejected the museum's contention that
any judicial proceeding constituted seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling leaves open what would be temporary and would not
be temporary,'' Davis conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling has no bearing on the merits of the claimants'
cases, and Wesley also wrote that it should not be construed in any
way as an impediment to investigations of stolen art or the broad,
exploratory powers of grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are not prohibited from continuing the grand jury
investigation of possible criminal wrongdoing with regard to these
two paintings,'' he said.

`THE WEST WING': MORE ABOUT TV THAN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area; see local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With politics on television ranging all the way from the staid
to the raucous, from C-Span to Geraldo Rivera's verbal equivalent
of chair-tossing, ``The West Wing'' should occupy a plummy central
location, where entertainment and politics meet. Aaron Sorkin's
idea for a series set behind the scenes at the White House predates
the Lewinsky scandal, but should benefit from its fallout.
Saturation coverage has made Washington intrigue almost as familiar
as ``Entertainment Tonight'' and its many clones have made the
box-office grosses and inner workings of Hollywood. If politics has
crept closer to entertainment, why not an entertaining show about
politics?
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``The West Wing'' is that it has a
political point of view. In the first episode it tackles the
religious right with a vehemence rare in politics or entertainment.
The show's worst element _ and in Wednesday night's opening it is
overwhelmingly bad _ is that its ideas and drama are watered down,
as if to make them palatable to a quasi-intelligent audience. ``The
West Wing'' is in the middle of something, all right; what it turns
out to be is middlebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That still makes the series more daring than most of what's on
television; the problem is, its creators know that and the show's
self-satisfaction becomes annoying. The floundering first episode
(the only one available for preview) is sometimes smart, sometimes
stupid, eventually gooey and, despite its sharp cast, not often
entertaining. One of the season's most hyped and anticipated
series, ``The West Wing'' is by far its biggest disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Visually kinetic, it has a Steadicam trailing after half a dozen
characters and plots in familiar settings: the halls of the West
Wing, the Oval Office, the briefing room for White House press.
There is a lot of racing around to no purpose. That probably
happens in the White House, but the show doesn't mean this action
to be pointless; it means the flurry to signal Big and Important.
</P>
<P>
   There is sex in this administration, but it is more idiotic than
anything we heard about during the Lewinsky scandal. The episode
starts with Rob Lowe, as Sam Seaborn, the deputy communications
director, sitting in a bar with a male journalist. A woman keeps
eyeing him. ``I never know if they're looking or not,'' he says,
almost innocently. Sure. That slick line is a nice touch, but if
Seaborn is supposed to be the administration's primary spinner, why
is he stupid enough to sleep with the woman without realizing she's
a hooker, then walk off with her pager instead of his own?
</P>
<P>
   That first scene seems to exist so Seaborn can explain a pager
message that Potus has been in a bicycle accident. Potus is not a
friend's name but a title, he explains. With a self-importance and
clunkiness typical of the show, Seaborn turns in the doorway with a
dramatic pause as he leaves the woman's apartment and says,
``President of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the White House, several other promising plots kick in.
Cuban refugees are heading toward Miami. When Seaborn makes a naive
comment about the situation, his balding, irascible boss, the
communications director, Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), says,
``Mind-boggling to me that we ever won an election.'' The press
secretary, C.J. Gregg (Allison Janney), has to keep journalists
from laughing at the president for running into a tree on his bike.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is charming, but he and the other actors are often saddled
with plot summaries masquerading as dialogue. ``Please believe me
when I tell you that I'm a nice guy having a bad day,'' Seaborn
tells a visitor, launching into a litany that reminds viewers (duh,
dumb us) about all the stories in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Whitford is especially vivid as Josh Lyman, the deputy
chief of staff, who may lose his job over a comment he made on a
talk show. ``Lady, the God you pray to is too busy being indicted
for tax fraud,'' he tells a woman from the religious right. In a
peacemaking meeting between the White House staff and the outraged
religious leaders, it is possible to see the seeds of the textured,
absorbing series ``The West Wing'' might have been and might still
become. Who will make what political compromises to save a piece of
legislation or to save his own job?
</P>
<P>
   But in the middle of this meeting, Martin Sheen enters as the
president and ``The West Wing'' falls apart. His first words, in
answer to a question about one of the Ten Commandments, are, ``I am
the Lord your God.'' The entrance is meant to be sly but the
character is written and played for maximum hokiness and
cracker-barrel wisdom. When the president praises the Cuban
refugees, the camera moves in for his close-up as he intones,
``With the clothes on their backs they came through a storm,''
seeming less like a '90s president than an actor auditioning to
play Abe Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' was written by Sorkin but it is not like his
``Sports Night'' (an intelligent show struggling in the ratings).
It resembles his screenplay for ``The American President,'' another
middlebrow work that starts out smart but quickly turns into a
sappy romance cloaked in unbelievable politics.
</P>
<P>
   After shrewd films like ``Wag the Dog'' and a slew of television
news magazines and political memoirs, ``The West Wing'' has no
reason to be so smug about its subject. As it writes down to the
masses, it sends a message that is more about television than
politics: that all of television is so stupid, anything with half a
brain counts as bright. Judged against its own potential, ``The
West Wing'' is an insulting mess.

 &HT;    Church serves as rescue base north of Tar River
 &HT;    By Bobby Burns
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELVOIR, N.C. _ Gum Swamp Church is no longer just a place of
worship _ it's a makeshift relief post and command center.
</P>
<P>
   Church members, three deputy sheriffs, four forest rangers and a
handful of volunteer firefighters have staged search and rescue
operations from the Belvoir fellowship hall, served hundreds of
meals and even delivered some by truck and by boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that live all around the community are in here for
food, water, baby supplies, whatever we can get,'' said Eugene
James, a church member and chairman of the Pitt County Board of
Commissioners. ``We're encouraging them to stay at home, stay off
the roads. They can come in here once a day and pick up what they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days after Hurricane Floyd, communities north of the Tar
River continued grassroots relief efforts to distribute vital
supplies to thousands of residents cut off by flood water from
Greenville. N.C. Forestry Service helicopters have flown Red Cross
meals to Belvoir volunteers since Sunday. When rain grounded the
birds Tuesday they used one ranger's boat to ferry supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Belvoir community roughly follows N.C. 33 from Greenville
northwest to the Edgecombe County line. Flooding has devastated the
area, the group at Gum Swamp said. The water has swept up mobile
homes along Old River Road, rolling them along with the current.
</P>
<P>
   James and others estimated that 200 to 300 people remain in
flooded areas. Dozens of them on Tuesday wandered the half flooded
streets of soggy trailer parks and sat on the porches of scattered
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Wilder made his way to Gum Swamp Church Tuesday morning
to pick up a cardboard box of food for himself, his wife and three
sons. Styrofoam takeout plates of stew, bread and vegetables filled
the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used up everything at the house and we've been to some of
the side stores and they're just about sold out,'' said Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what makes it bad is not being able to get out
anywhere. Everybody on this side of the Tar River has to go to
Bethel or Williamston and they don't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Long lines and rationing persisted Tuesday at Pitt County's
single grocery store north of the river, Bethel IGA, although basic
necessities including milk and gasoline were available there and in
neighboring Martin County. A line also snaked outside the door at
Bethel Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   The area, like much of the county on Tuesday, also lost its
water supply. The prospect promised to pose challenges for
residents in shelters .
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have been brought in by helicopter. Bad weather on
Tuesday kept Eastern Carolina University student Devan Raghavan
longer than he expected. ``I have a 6-month-old baby and with the
prospect of no water and no power I'm a little worried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Belvoir, Derrick Moore was spending his third wedding
anniversary making sure residents were fed and safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service assistant ranger and the three other rangers
work out of Belvoir and decided to stick it out when the river
started rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck in Belvoir basically because there wasn't anybody
else up here. It's been isolated since the storm,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the supplies are in Greenville, its just that nobody could
get it to us until we got the Forestry Service helicopter . . . .
We were in bad shape a couple of days ago but we're doing OK now.

   CLEMENCY-CONGRESS (Washington) _ A Senate counterterrorism
committee hears from Justice and FBI witnesses on Clinton's
clemency for FALN members. The director of the FBI, in strongly
objecting to clemency for 16 Puerto Rican nationalists, said their
release would re-invigorate terrorist organizations in Puerto Rico.
According to documents released by Congress on Tuesday, Louis
Freeh, the FBI director, had warned the Justice Department that
releasing any of the prisoners ``would likely return committed,
experienced, sophisticated and hardened terrorists to the
clandestine movement.'' By Katharine Q. Seelye.

   ASIANAMERICANS-POLITICS (Los Angeles) _ In the relatively brief
span of one presidential cycle the role of Asian Americans in
national politics appears to have changed in fundamental ways.
After years as one of the most financially generous but
underrepresented ethnic minorities in American politics, many Asian
Americans are nursing deep wounds from what they regard as a string
of insulting scandals. And this time, they say, things will be
different. There will be less interest in photo opportunities with
the candidates, they say, and in its place a focus on getting more
Asian Americans appointed to positions in Washington and to
judgeships around the country and to bolster government efforts to
fight hate crimes and discrimination. By James Sterngold. 2,000

   TRADE-REPORT (Washington) _ The U.S. trade deficit surged to a
record $25.18 billion in July, as imports from western Europe,
China, Japan and Canada continued to grow. Economists had expected
the deficit to narrow from June's $24.6 billion gap, the previous
record. For the second month, imports topped $100 billion, at
$104.22 billion. Exports rose modestly, to $79.04 billion. The

thousands of Manhattan divorce cases to determine how many
fraudulent divorces were granted, and how many unwitting bigamists
there may be in the city. If the divorces are found to be improper,
they could be thrown out, officials said. By David Rohde.

 &HT;    Volunteers fight uphill battle to help neighbors left homeless
in Grifton
 &HT;    By Nichole Monroe
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRIFTON, N.C. _ When Leona Miller went home after hours of
serving hot meals to hungry residents, she shook from weariness.
</P>
<P>
   Then she cried.
</P>
<P>
   She did not cry because she was tired from working. Miller cried
because no matter how many meals she served, she could do nothing
to change the fact that many of her friends and neighbors are
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so tired I had the shakes, but I thought, I've come home
to a dry house and a soft chair,'' said Miller, her voice giving
way while her eyes held fast to tears. Miller was one of several
volunteers who for three days served meals at an unofficial
distribution center at Grifton School. ``I thought about all the
people I know who have nowhere to go. A lot of them lived paycheck
to paycheck, and now they don't even have that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grifton, where 2,300 people live, dozens of families have
lost their homes along Contentnea Creek since rains from hurricanes
Dennis and Floyd plunged the stream from its banks. The water has
been indiscriminate: It has taken the homes of those in public
housing and of city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding has cut the town in two, making it impossible to travel
from one side to the other on one street. The police and fire
stations are inundated and water is chest-high in the local grocery
store. Many businesses are also submerged.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the townspeople volunteered to accept and distribute
items for flood victims. Residents opened the school center
themselves when they realized how much help their neighbors needed.
They cook three meals a day.
</P>
<P>
   Five days into the town's worst flood ever, volunteers, police
and city officials fought fatigue, but kept relief efforts going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally and physically right now, I'm drained,'' said
Police Chief Linwood Outlaw. He had already worked more than 40
hours straight before the flooding began.
</P>
<P>
   Because the police station is underwater, officers have had to
work out of their cars to coordinate efforts to bring supplies into
town. Some computers and phones were salvaged before the water got
too high, Outlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers who lost their own homes to water have also slept
in their cars. Officers are now working in 12-hour shifts out of
the town hall, where waters had receded.
</P>
<P>
   The process of putting the town back together will be slow.
</P>
<P>
   Residents regained power and phone service, and the water is
safe to drink. But sewage began to bubble up from manholes in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, town commissioner Johnny Craft and Sheriff's
department Sgt. K.L. Kilpatrick slumped against a wall in the
Grifton School cafeteria. The pair had patrolled the town on
Jetskis, rescuing animals and delivering food to people who are
unable to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's affected every walk of life,'' Craft said. ``We haven't
had time to even stop and think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really starts to get to you when you deliver ice and water
to someone and they say, 'Thank you, we haven't seen anyone in five
days,''' she said. ``That's when your emotions start running. But
you have to stop and put it out your mind so you can go on to help
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Supplies streamed into the cafeteria all day. Volunteers at the
center said they still need powdered and canned milk, disposable
plates and utensils, toiletries and detergent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to feed those that are hungry and don't have
anything at all,'' said Barbara Atwell, who helped coordinate
efforts in the cafeteria. ``It's all you can do to keep from crying
when you see the people come in. I just think there's a lot of good
cooperation here.''

MEMORIAL TO MLK JR. SERVES AS COUNTERPOINT TO UT STATUES OF
CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ga.) 
 
By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Looking back now on the days they manned a table
at the West Mall, a humble donation jar in front of them, the
former activists at the University of Texas still get a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The band of three students was determined to raise money so UT
could erect a statue honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr. It was the late 1980s and minority students complained
that they felt unwelcome at Texas' largest university, where
enrollment now reaches 49,000. They felt intimidated and offended
by the university's prominently placed memorials to Confederate
President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had buttons, we had T-shirts and a petition, if I remember.
That was our feeble, poorly conceived effort to generate
momentum,'' said Dave Winter, now a high school journalism teacher
in Marietta, Ga. ``We had a benefit concert on Sixth Street called
`Statue Aid.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it now, it's just the optimism of
youth,'' said Becky Helton, now 35, of Austin. ``We literally had a
little jar for donations out on our table. I don't know what we
were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus were the humble beginnings of what became a 12-year odyssey
that will culminate at noon CST Friday with the historic unveiling
of an MLK statue costing nearly $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   UT officials believe the school will be the first predominantly
white campus in the nation to erect such a tribute to the man who
made the famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech. The only other
university they know of with an MLK statue is King's alma mater,
Morehouse College in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   UT, admittedly rocked by a history of racial strife and saddled
with a segregationist past, hopes the new memorial sends a message
of inclusion to counter the uncomfortable presence of the statues
of Confederate heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The giant Confederate statues of Davis, Robert E. Lee and Albert
Sidney Johnston were dedicated on the campus' prominent South Mall
in 1933 as part of a $250,000 gift from the late Major George W.
Littlefield.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston Chronicle editorial in 1920 said that nothing in
Littlefield's last will and testament expressed a nobler or
worthier or more beneficial purpose than the section describing the
UT memorials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present generation and generations yet unborn will be
debtors to George W. Littlefield for his princely gift,'' the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield fought for the Confederacy and grew up on a cotton
plantation in Gonzales County. His mother frequently offered her
home as refuge to Confederate soldiers. The family owned 200
slaves, according to a glowing biographical account, all of whom
were liberated at the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In coming years those who read the truth _ of which the South
is not afraid _ they will realize that George W. Littlefield
`though dead, yet speaketh,''' the Chronicle's editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   What his ``princely gift'' says to those now-born children,
however, is not what Littlefield must have intended. In a fateful
1987 editorial, Daily Texan editor Sean Price decried the ``Great
White University'' and took special aim at the glorified campus
figures of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those statues aren't offensive to everyone, they ought to
be,'' Price wrote. ``For starters, all three men were bigots and
traitors whose cause was the preservation of an inhuman
institution. And the presence of the statues is constantly cited by
blacks as one of many sources of intimidation on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   While UT's student editor said he understood the temptation to
remove the statues, he cautioned against trying to erase history
just because it is unpleasant. Instead, he argued, it was better to
write the next chapter with a statue in tribute to King.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Helton grew animated as she read the editorial while
sitting on the West Mall, the university's free-speech mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of us were sitting on the West Mall, saying ,`Wow,
that's a really good idea.' Someone should do something about
that,'' recalled Helton, who works for the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we kind of looked at each other and went: `Well, someone
should. We're someone, so we should do something about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Helton found two other students and a faculty adviser to
formally start an official group under university rules. Before
long, her tiny band gained strength when Helton was joined by
Winter and Michael Mark, now an assistant district attorney in
Liberty, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Negative reactions to the Confederate statues continued to mount
until vandals in 1989 defaced Jefferson Davis' pedestal, scrawling
``Roots (of KKK) fight racism now!'' in red spray paint. Helton
remembers palpable resentment of the statues when strolling
students stopped by the MLK donation table to chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least once a day someone would say, `Hey! Why don't we melt
down the statue of Jefferson Davis?'' she said. ``And, we would try
to change the subject. It's easier to accomplish something if you
keep your focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Winter and Mark became friends and co-directors of
the Martin Luther King Jr. Sculpture Foundation. On Nov. 3, 1988,
Mark held his first meeting with Ronald M. Brown, vice president
for student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lukewarm reception at best,'' he said recently.
``Really, we got nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really struck by the fact that it was a student
movement. It was not just African-Americans,'' said Vick. ``It was
the feeling that the university needed to make a tangible
expression of welcome to all people of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   While talks were ongoing, the university grappled with two
separate racial incidents that occurred during the spring 1990
Roundup festivities, Vick said. An attentive Daily Texan
photographer snapped a front-page photograph of a beaten up old
jalopy painted with racial epithets and parked outside the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity House. The same weekend, the Phi Gamma Deltas
offended black basketball players by presenting winners at a
Roundup game with T-shirts depicting the fraternity's ``Fiji
Island'' mascot, a rather unsubtle cannibal caricature with
exaggerated black features.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Vick said, the university no longer celebrated
Roundup.
</P>
<P>
   Mark says now that he felt a debt of gratitude to King and the
civil rights movement, which made it possible for him to attend UT,
despite its turbulent racial past and ongoing racial struggles. He
and others point to the case of UT's first black law student, Heman
Sweatt.
</P>
<P>
   Sweatt, sponsored by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, applied to the law school in 1946
but was rejected because he was black. He filed a lawsuit the next
month and in 1950 the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the university to
admit Sweatt. He was met, however, with hostility _ slashed tires
and a burning cross on the law school's yard, according to a 1990
edition of Utmost, a student magazine. He dropped out with ulcers,
unable to bear the stress.
</P>
<P>
   Mark said he's not convinced when those who would defend the
Confederate statues argue that the Civil War was actually a fight
for state's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say it's not about white superiority or racism,
but every time you see these Klan rallies or skinheads, they always
have the Confederate flag,'' he said. ``It's not a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nina Taylor, 49, of Houston and her family, the dedication
of the MLK statue drives home three generations of black history at
UT.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's father, Fidelus Breeding, was among UT's first black
graduates, earning a master's degree in education in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of resistance. I remember him personally
telling me there were places on campus he wasn't allowed to walk on
when he was there,'' said Taylor, who last year earned a law degree
and passed the state bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she arrived, attending UT between 1968 and 1971,
``there were professors who obviously were very prejudiced about
having us in class,'' she said. Her husband, Elgin, was an
engineering student and said that one of his professors told him
the first day of class that he would not pass.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Nichele, was a 1998 UT honors graduate and
served on the MLK Sculpture Committee. During her era, she said, UT
had two black student body presidents. But the campus was also
rocked by heated protests over the devastating drop in minority
enrollments on the heels of the Hopwood court decision. That ruling
of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals barred racial preferences
in scholarships and admissions.
</P>
<P>
   While blacks still seemed largely socially separated from many
of their white colleagues, ``certainly it was better than the
stories I heard growing up from my parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the earliest days of the MLK statue campaign, Mark said, the
first little band of earnest students couldn't get the ear of UT
Chancellor William Cunningham. But, by January 1990, Cunningham
endorsed the project and the following December the UT regents
joined the bandwagon. In the ensuing years, graduating students
passed the cause onto those who followed.
</P>
<P>
   The funding problem was finally resolved with a referendum, in
which students voted 1064 to 657 in favor of a $1 per semester
statue fee. The fee recently ended after raising $465,000, and
officials say any money left over will go toward a new MLK
scholarship. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The statue of King, draped in doctoral robes and reaching out
with a welcoming outstretched arm, will be placed in the East Mall,
facing predominantly black East Austin.
</P>
<P>
   For Marlen Whitley, a law student and former student body
president who serves on the sculpture committee, the new statue
represents a departure from the Confederate and segregationist
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an African-American male, it's kind of disturbing to walk
across campus and see a statue of a man who fought in a sense
against my existence in terms of freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy, he said, are the continuing racial issues UT has
been forced to confront during the 12 years it took to erect the
statue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every decade here at the university, for students of color
particularly, has been marred by some type of turmoil or
struggle,'' Whitley said. ``In the '80s, it was the investments the
university had with South Africa. In the '90s, it's been with the
affirmative action programs and &UR;  &LR; (law Professor Leo Graglia) making
the remarks concerning the academic competitiveness of students of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   While few think a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. alone will
end the racial divisions altogether, most everyone considers it a
step in the right direction. The dedication ceremony itself will be
steeped in significance, Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to move us closer, in a sense, to the dream Dr.
King talked about, all people coming together,'' he said. ``At
least for one hour, there will be people from all races, colors and
walks of life.''

After years as one of the most financially generous but
underrepresented ethnic minorities in American politics, many Asian
Americans are nursing deep wounds from what they regard as a string
of insulting scandals. And this time, they say, things will be
different. There will be less interest in photo opportunities with
the candidates, they say, and in its place a focus on getting more
Asian Americans appointed to positions in Washington and to
judgeships around the country and to bolster government efforts to
fight hate crimes and discrimination. By James Sterngold. 2,000

record. For the second month, imports topped $100 billion, at
$104.22 billion. Exports rose modestly, to $79.04 billion. The

`GROW UP': SPOTLIGHTING A TV SITCOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes are at and of review)  
 (af)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a sitcom so skillfully derivative that you'll swear
you're already tired of it, even though you've never seen it
before. Three hunky young guys with unusual first names share a
Brooklyn brownstone: Hunter (Stephen Dunham), the self-absorbed
lothario; Norris (David Alan Basche), the self-absorbed struggling
artist, and Ford (John Ducey), the self-absorbed gay guy.
</P>
<P>
   Having cloned these characters, the show's creators seem to have
been unable to find anything funny for them to do. Elated after a
one-night stand, Hunter tells Norris: ``I think she might be the
one. You didn't happen to get her name, did ya?'' Norris says,
``You just officially became a parody of yourself.'' (Sounds as if
someone's waving a white flag already.)
</P>
<P>
   If the show can't distinguish itself with humor, it tries
tacking on some serious stuff. Serious mistake. Ford has just
acknowledged his homosexuality, and his wife, Suzanne (Rena Sofer),
sure is miffed. She drinks too much wine and tells him, ``You
promised to love, honor and not go Nancy on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hunter discovers that a college romance produced a
daughter, Chloe (Niesha Trout), who shows up at the boys' doorstep
toting a backpack and not a little anger of her own.
</P>
<P>
   The freshest notion here is a dog named Mom who's jealous of
Hunter's girlfriends. You know that because her barks are
translated by subtitles. That makes one more character who can't
locate a clever line. &QL;

GUYS, LET'S TALK, WE CAN HELP HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, Sept. 28)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not good news that adolescent boys are preoccupied with
their chest, waist and bicep ratio and that their fathers are
getting eyelid tucks in order to remain marketable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any triumph in reading that men are unsure about
whether they're supposed to be quiet or loud, sensitive or
thick-skinned. Or that they feel inadequate next to pictures of
male underwear models.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were times we've been jealous of how men can buy and
don a bathing suit without their ego getting in the way, but it
wasn't necessary that they become as obsessed as women are.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the status of men and boys in America has become a
worrisome issue we're finding from social psychologists and
magazine writers that the American male is confused and frustrated.
He's not sure what it means to be masculine anymore. He's concerned
about his body image. He feels as if he's being told how to look
and act by society and he resents it.
</P>
<P>
   It's like deja vu in a deeper voice and hairier body.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's about time society starts paying attention to men
again. Some wonder when we ever stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Some want to say, ``Now you know what it feels like, Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be some good aspects to this so-called masculinity
crisis. Men in turmoil is not necessarily a terrible thing. If men
are not sure if they're supposed to be warriors or nurturers,
that's OK. Some can be one, some the other. If some men are lashing
out because they've been hoodwinked by their own culture, as author
Susan Faludi says in her upcoming book ``Stiffed,'' this is still
no time to revolt and rip out the diaper changing tables from the
men's restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, maybe, women and men can combine their uncertainties and
start to work together. First we have to ignore the notion, which
some people are aching to stir up, that we're in a gender war and
that men are losing because women have won.
</P>
<P>
   As a card-carrying feminist I've done my share of grousing about
men having advantages women don't and chuckled at Ally McBeal's
little joke about there being only two good men per state, but I
think it would be a sad crime if men and boys decided their value
was limited to looking buff and making money.
</P>
<P>
   Men could take a cue from women's struggles to find a new
identity. We may not have cracked the glass ceiling but we did
climb out of a few boxes. One thing that helped was getting
together and talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on the worried man say they fear they've lost control.
They feel like castoffs. The standards have changed and they're
lost and panicky. That's a lot to talk about, but are they talking?
The stereotype is that men get together only to walk around in
gangs or go pig hunting. When they tried sharing their feelings in
rituals in the woods people made fun of the drumming part. But
there is no reason for men to feel alone in their discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess some people would think it's time for white men to pay
the piper,'' said one young white male who feels that he's
pigeonholed, resented and unfairly labeled as someone who enjoys a
superior status that he personally doesn't claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone starts talking about affirmative action or glass
ceiling for women or diversity in the workplace it's assumed that
I've already taken a side because of my race and gender. I'm not
even allowed into the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he has more choices than many, he also feels the
pressure to be rich and studly. ``The media says to be successful
as a man you have to drive a Mercedes, have stock options, look
like Pierce Brosnan and have a woman who is arm candy.'' This young
guy would rather mark his masculinity by the fact that he cries at
movies, is passionate about his girlfriend and can be as dazzled by
a hummingbird as a football game. But he says a certain tough guy
stance is necessary and were he to admit the same around the
campfire, the others would call him a word that also means a small
cat.
</P>
<P>
   While the mixing of gender roles may be dismaying to some, it
has allowed men to exhibit new styles of male strengths in the form
of attentive fathering, men working as nurses and caregivers and
men showing their softer, creative sides.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this looks more like a turning point for men than a
revolution. As far as we know a matriarchy has not been declared.
Individual males may feel they've lost control but men still have
the power.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the goal was never to trade places or get anybody back.
There's enough fairness and good will to go around.

 &HT;    A vote for presidential politics
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The timing seems a little wrong for a drama set in the White
House, filled with journalists pestering presidential aides, and
staffers trying to cover their, uh, careers, and gasbags yammering
away on talk shows, and more chaos than a kindergarten fire drill.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't we just watch that show for 13 months on CNN?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the White House of NBC's new drama ``The West
Wing'' is a thong-free zone, and nearly everyone keeps his or her
pants on. (The only pants-doffing is done by Rob Lowe, which is an
inside joke of a different kind.)
</P>
<P>
   It's also a White House of endless intensity, a non-stop Maalox
moment, sort of like ``ER'' but everybody wears suits instead of
scrubs and nobody says ``stat.'' Policy, schmolicy. Let's rock.
</P>
<P>
   And ``West Wing'' wastes no time plunging viewers into a frantic
set-up, with everyone barking in Beltway shorthand. The prez
(Martin Sheen, who makes a grand entance late in the show) has hurt
his ankle in a bicycle accident, and from the reaction of his staff
you'd think Chinese ICBMs were raining down. We quickly meet
pretty-boy deputy communications director Sam Seaborn (Lowe),
growly chief of staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer), his beleaguered
deputy Josh Lyman (Bradley Whiford), press secretary C.J. Gregg
(Allison Janney) and opposition political consultant Madeline
Hampton (Moira Kelly). Whew. Don't worry, it's a jumble at first
but starts to sort out by the end of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Besides concerns about the First Ankle, ``West Wing'' deals with
Sam's one-night stand, whom he thought was just a sweet young thing
but turns out to be a hooker (working for free, natch, since he's
Rob Lowe); the business where they mix up their beepers is way too
obvious. And Josh has just insulted the Christian right on a
``Crossfire''-style show.
</P>
<P>
   That brings in, finally, President Josiah Bartlett, who bursts
into a showdown between testy evangelicals and the White House
staff and reels off a humdinger of a speech about anti-abortion
fanatics harrassing his 12-year-old granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the pilot, has every right to tee off on
evangelicals, but it's the cheapest of shots to have a Jerry
Falwell lookalike not know one of the 10 Commandments. Sorkin
swears ``West Wing'' won't be a liberal's game of Whack-a-Mole
every week, but the big finale of ``West Wing'' is a little too
self-congratulatory and full of its own smug virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question is whether the series can maintain the pace
of the pilot. Sorkin and director Tommy Schlamme owe their first
allegiance to ABC's ``Sports Night'' and executive producer John
Wells is still doing ``ER'' and another new show, ``Third Watch.''
Complicated series like ``West Wing'' work best when there's one,
undistracted overseer at the helm, unless they're David E. Kelley
shows, in which case anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing'' is a quick, brisk little drama that viewers will
find engaging, but it doesn't yet have the emotional heft of ``ER''
or the giddy wordiness of ``Sports Night'' (which returns Oct. 5 on
ABC and is the show you should be checking out). It's more than a
little slick. Hmm. Where have we heard that before?

 &HT;    Sneak peek backstage at CMA awards

<TEXT>
<P>
   They're spraying hair and shining boots in Nashville as the city
gets ready for its biggest shindig of the year, tonight's 33rd
annual Country Music Association awards. But like any true Southern
get-together, the live ceremony at the Grand Ole Opry is rife with
behind-the-scenes facts and feuds that probably won't show through
the camera lens. When you plop down on the sofa tonight to check
out the action, watch for these plot lines:
</P>
<P>
   1. NO-SHOW JONES: Pistol packing singer George Jones is ticked
off. Although he's nominated for single of the year for
``Choices,'' and had the comeback of the year after a near-fatal
car accident, the Possum says he's not performing on the show as of
press time. He's angry that producers asked him to sing an
abbreviated version of the tune to save TV time for other acts.
</P>
<P>
   The practice isn't all that unusual. In the 1970s, outlaw Waylon
Jennings boycotted the CMA ceremony when he was asked to trim his
performance of ``Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line.'' Last year,
Steve Wariner whacked the second verse of the single of the year,
``Holes in the Floor of Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   As country music has grown in popularity, making the CMA awards
show one of the highest-rated network programs of the year,
performance time has become as precious as initial shares in
Microsoft stock. Vince Gill, who is hosting the awards, says the
CMA is getting a bum rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people should try to put themselves in the shoes of
the folks at the CMA who have to put the show together,'' he says.
``These people are under incredible pressure from everybody, all
the labels in town who want their acts on the show. It's a hard,
hard job, and I'm not just saying that because I'm hosting.''
</P>
<P>
   No word as to whether Jones will be in a seat.
</P>
<P>
   2. RIMES NOR REASON: Don't look for teen queen LeAnn Rimes at
the podium either. CMA voters snubbed her; she hasn't a single
nomination. Mike Curb, president and founder of Rimes' record
label, is so angry that he resigned from the CMA's performers
selection committee in protest. Rimes recently halted plans to buy
a house in Music City, saying that the atmosphere there was ``too
political.'' Judging from the CMA's reluctant recognition of the
young star, who many in the close-knit community consider an
outsider, she may be right.
</P>
<P>
   3. COLLECTING FOR CONWAY: The late Conway Twitty is being
inducted into the CMA Hall of Fame, but who will show up to accept
the trophy? Six years after the sultry singer's death, his heirs
are still bitterly fighting over his $12-14 million estate, which
includes royalties to hits such as ``It's Only Make Believe,'' a
massive Nashville mansion and a $2.5 million life insurance policy.
In one corner is Dee Henry Jenkins, Twitty's second wife and his
widow, who was named as heir in a will Twitty drew up in 1987. One
small problem: he never signed it. In the other corner you have
Twitty's two daughters, who don't agree that Dee is entitled to the
fortune she has claimed. In June, a Nashville judged handed Dee
one-third of the estate, but the daughters may still appeal the
decision. A political solution: Have Twitty's longtime singing
partner, Loretta Lynn, accept the award.
</P>
<P>
   4. POOR PORTER: Dolly Parton also is going into the Hall of
Fame. However, one person who might not be too happy about that
honor is Parton's former singing partner, Porter Wagoner. The
Wagonmaster ``discovered'' the Smoky Mountain songbird, put her on
his syndicated TV show, and recorded a string of top duets with her
until she struck out on her own in 1974. Although Parton's talent
has clearly eclipsed Wagoner's, there is still friction between the
two that might be exacerbated by Dolly getting to the Hall of Fame
before Porter. Let's see if she mentions him in her acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   5. ODD COUPLES: The most bizarre performance of the evening
might be the pairing of crusty roadhouse troubador Merle Haggard
with sweet pop songbird Jewel. The duo is scheduled to perform
Haggard's classic hit ``That's the Way Love Goes.'' And in what is
perhaps the most contrived marketing scheme of the year, RCA
country group Alabama will team with RCA pop group 'N Sync to
perform ``God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You,'' a song
which is not nominated in any category.
</P>
<P>
   6. CHICKS COULD FLY: Although Tim McGraw goes into the awards
with the most nominations (seven), it is possible that the night
could belong to hot country trio, the Dixie Chicks. This has been
their year, as their first album on the Monument label, ``Wide Open
Spaces,'' sold 7 million copies and produced five hit singles. The
group's new album, ``Fly,'' hit the No. 1 spot on country charts
the week it was released in late August. The Chicks are scheduled
to open the CMA show with their latest chart-topper, ``Ready to
Run,'' a moment that could rival Garth Brooks' show-stopping
performance of ``Friends in Low Places'' in 1991. It would not be
surprising to see the Chicks overtake Brooks in the coveted
entertainer of the year category, particularly since Brooks'
somewhat weird metamorphosis into fictional pop star Chris Gaines.
But traditionally polite CMA voters may want to give a nod to the
staying power of McGraw, and save the Chicks for later.
</P>
<P>
   7. MARK'S MOMENT: On a happy note, Atlanta's Mark Wills, who was
once the house singer at the Buckboard, Smyrna's (Ga.) country
watering hole, has finally made it. He's nominated for two CMA
awards _ single of the year and music video of the year for the hit
``Don't Laugh at Me.'' Writers Allen Shamblin and Steve Seskin are
nominated for song of the year. Wills is scheduled to perform the
song on the show.
</P>
<P>
   8. RHUBARB REPORTS: As he has done for 21 years, Rhubarb Jones
is covering the behind-the-scenes action at CMA week live from 6 to
10 a.m. on Atlanta country station Y-106.7. He'll also host an
audio simulcast of the show.

 &HT;    Two shelters moved after losing water
 &HT;    By Jenna Hunt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Two shelters housing some 3,000 flood victims
in Pitt County were relocated on Tuesday afternoon because they
were without water.
</P>
<P>
   Four area shelters lost running water before noon. Many parts of
Greenville lost water service because flooding has limited the
capacity to treat and distribute water.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people from shelters at Wintergreen and E.B. Aycock
schools were transported to Ayden Middle School and Ayden
Elementary School, said Red Cross officials. Water is still
available in Ayden, Eastern Pines and areas in Winterville.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second move for many Wintergreen shelter residents.
They were evacuated from D.H. Conley High School on Wednesday due
to flooding there.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters at North Pitt High School and Welcome Middle School are
both without running water. Red Cross officials are trying to find
additional shelters in the area with running water and back-up
generators.
</P>
<P>
   The county has turned over shelter operations to national
officials with the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross emergency response vehicles are heading to eastern
North Carolina and Pitt County, said Jay Penuel, Red Cross
Wintergreen Shelter director.
</P>
<P>
   Each shelter has two military police officers, two county police
officers, nurses, and some shelters have volunteer mental health
workers and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Christena Woods offered to house Linda Green and her infant son,
who were staying at Wintergreen shelter. Woods, an Eastern Pines
resident, had running water for bathing and bottled water
</P>
<P>
   Greene, 17, and her 6-month-old son, Nehemiah, went to Woods'
home Tuesday. The Greenes' mobile home at Pinecrest Mobile Home
Park is now flooded. Greene came to the shelter with her mother and
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We barely made it because the water was almost covering our
car,'' her mother said. ``It was terrible to see people in boats,
walking in the water and hollering for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant mothers and infants drinking formula can't drink boiled
water or water treated with bleach _ they must drink bottled water
only, said Dr. John Morrow, director of Pitt County Health
Department. Boiling the water concentrates chemicals that can be
harmful to babies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene will stay with Woods until the city turns the water back
on, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Katina Warren, a former Wintergreen Shelter resident, is eight
months pregnant. She said she doesn't like the shelter food and has
trouble eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't eaten anything here period,'' Warren said. She
brought several cans of chicken noodle soup from her home before
she evacuated on Saturday. ``I'm hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 26, said they have apples, oranges, pastries, cereal and
milk available, but she can't eat. She said the milk tastes spoiled
to her sensitive palate.
</P>
<P>
   Warren and her husband, Lintay, lost their mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we're in jail _ lights out at 11 p.m. and door
closed,'' Warren said as she took a drag from her husband's
cigarette.

MEXICAN `PARADISE' FOR EXPATRIATE AMERICANS NOW A PLACE OF FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The local retirees like to call their lakeside
village of Ajijic, Mexico, an affordable vision of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow cobblestone streets and tightly nestled homes begin
at the north side of Lake Chapala, the largest lake in Mexico, and
creep up into the nearby hills. The weather is dry and warm much of
the year, and housing is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   But the quiet sense of bliss in Ajijic has been displaced by a
rising fear, prompted by the recent killing of two expatriate
Americans. The death of the elderly couple has shocked residents,
who said they barely encountered crime in this normally placid
municipality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is shocked and concerned that something like this
could happen,'' said former Oakland, Calif., resident Vierl Bunnell
said. ``It was very brutal.'' Bunnell is president of the Lake
Chapala Society, a social organization that serves the area's large
retirement community.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy performed on the bodies of Oakland native and former
Los Altos resident Robert Ramsdell Koll, 91, and his 90-year-old
companion Melba Boudreau Wasey, formerly of Garden Grove, Calif.,
indicated Koll's throat had been cut while Wasey had been
strangled. Their bodies were found in their living room Sept. 13 by
their maid.
</P>
<P>
   While police are investigating the possibility that the killings
were part of a robbery, the initial evidence leaves the door open
to other motives.
</P>
<P>
   Two rooms in the small home were thoroughly ransacked, but the
killer or killers did not take the couple's cars, paintings or
sculptures. Koll was found with his wallet, while Wasey had on a
diamond ring and earrings.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking into whether Koll or Wasey had
any problems with other residents in the area. No arrests have been
made, and people are wondering how the killings could have taken
place without anyone hearing or seeing something.
</P>
<P>
   The killings were not the first signs of trouble in paradise. A
48- year-old New Jersey woman and a 72-year-old Ontario woman were
killed in unrelated cases in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Koll, Koll's wife, from whom he was separated and who
lives on the other side of Ajijic, said she'd seen an increase in
crime in the area as it had become more populated. She said a
friend had been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past few
years. The deaths of her husband and Wasey have left her
grief-stricken.
</P>
<P>
   Koll said the character of Ajijic had changed as thousands of
seniors poured into the area. Other local residents, however, said
the town was still safe by U.S. standards, despite the killings of
Koll and Wasey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, but it's not something you live in fear of,''
said Georgette Richmond, 52, a former Berkeley, Calif., resident
and Ajijic real estate agent. ``It's just sad to live so long and
then meet such a violent end.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans retiring in Mexico has increased
noticeably over the years. The Ajijic area is home to about 10,000
foreign retirees, mostly Americans and Canadians. The bulk of the
expatriates come for the mild weather and low cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   The town offers the charm of a small village, many of the
amenities of the United States, and a nearby bustling metropolis in
Guadalajara. Spanish tile and palm trees dominate the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Though a number of Ajijic retirees are well-to-do, Bunnell said,
many come from middle-class backgrounds. To live in Mexico,
retirees must have an income of at least $1,000 per month and are
not allowed to work while there.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stephen Morisseau said officials were
watching the Ajijic investigation closely. But he said no warnings
had gone out to U.S. citizens, and he does not think U.S. retirees
in the Lake Chapala area face an unreasonable risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake to infer that much from a few
incidents,'' he said. ``But of course people do need to be
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Koll, a former Oakland food supply salesman, came to Ajijic in
1968 with his wife, Peggy. The two separated in 1974 but remained
friends, Peggy Koll said. A few years before the Kolls separated,
Wasey moved to Ajijic. She and Robert Koll started dating in the
late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot of good years,'' Peggy Koll said. ``They got
along really well.''

 &HT;    SCHOOLS VULNERABLE TO Y2K BUG, SURVEYS SHOW
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many U.S. elementary and secondary schools could
experience disruptions from the Y2K computer bug, federal
investigators reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys also found that many colleges and universities have
not eliminated the programming flaw that leaves computer unable to
recognize dates starting with Jan. 1, 2000, leaving student
financial aid programs vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Congressional Accounting Office, released at a
Senate hearing, examined ``mission critical'' functions in 25 large
school districts. Most districts reported that computers
controlling administrative systems, student records, facilities,
student transportation and food service would not be Y2K-ready
until nearly the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven of the 25 districts said they were already in full
compliance, and two more estimated they would be in compliance by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late completion dates leave very little time for testing to
make sure everything works,'' said Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah,
chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000
Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   A similar survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education
found only 30 percent of districts ready for the date change,
Deputy Education Secretary Marshall Smith told the committee.
Larger school districts were less likely to be compliant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers indicate that millions of students could be
affected by Y2K-related disruptions, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., co-chairman of the panel, noted
that elementary and secondary schools are often used as emergency
shelters in many communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schools have always served as integral parts of our
communities and we must be sure that they can continue this service
without interruption,'' Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said that time is quickly running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``With only 101 days remaining before the millennium,
remediation is now almost as futile as late night cramming for a
major exam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Education Department survey, colleges and universities
fared no better than elementary and secondary schools, Smith told
the panel. Of more than 6,000 responding, only 30 percent had
achieved full compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the Education Department has provided technical
assistance to institutions that might face ``special challenges,''
including historically black colleges, tribally controlled colleges
and Hispanic-serving institutions.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to financial aid programs, smaller institutions are
most vulnerable to Y2K disruptions because they may lack resources
to upgrade their systems, said George Chin, representing the
National Association of Financial Aid Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Though students' financial aid packages for this school year are
not likely to be affected, new or transfer students who plan to
enroll in the spring may have problems, Chin said. He encouraged
students to file their documents early and make sure their
financial aid records are current.

PEACEKEEPERS RESTORE CALM TO DILI, BUT FEAR REMAINS
</HEADLINE>
  (With TIMOR-INDONESIA) 
 (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARE, East Timor _ Panic seized the refugees in this mountain
hideout Tuesday morning. Soldiers were coming. Screaming and
scrambling, the refugees tumbled down the hillside seeking safety.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later the panic turned to shouts of jubilation. The
soldiers were Australian peacekeepers, not the Indonesian soldiers
or the militias that people feared.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up the steep hills overlooking Dili, the seaside
capital, the peacekeepers were escorting U.N. officials for their
first look at the situation in the countryside after three weeks of
violence and terror.
</P>
<P>
   When the officials arrived here, the 2,000 people who gathered
to greet them began to leap and cheer, celebrating at last the
victory of their vote on Aug. 30 for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viva Xanana!'' they shouted, chanting the revolutionary name
of Jose Alexandre Gusmao, their long-exiled leader, as small
children raced wildly among them. ``Viva East Timor!''
</P>
<P>
   Two huge gray transport ships, visible in the harbor far below
them, were unloading the latest in a continuing stream of foreign
forces, most from Australia. Military officials said the troops in
East Timor had climbed above 2,000 Tuesday and would reach 3,000 by
late Wednesday, building toward a final target of 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Australian forces, Brig. Gen. Mark Evans,
said his soldiers are consolidating their hold on Dili and will
move in to secure Baucau town in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Under tight military control, the situation in Dili is already
beginning to shift. The militias that have laid waste to much of
the city with the backing of the Indonesian military are either
disappearing or blending into the population.
</P>
<P>
   In their place, tough young men from the hills around Dare, a
stronghold of pro-independence rebels six miles south of Dili,
began gathering near the port Tuesday morning. They eyed the
Indonesian soldiers, who have begun a final pullout, with most
expected to be gone by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   One of these young men, moving with an air of authority, wore a
conspicuously bright yellow beret and a freshly laundered white
T-shirt with the slogan: ``Falintil'' _ the acronym of the
separatist guerrilla force.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it seems, the city will, on the surface at least, belong
not to the militias but to the forces who have fought for
independence since Indonesia invaded this former Portuguese colony
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from his van in Dare Tuesday morning, the head of the
U.N. mission here, Ian Martin, embraced leaders of the
pro-independence movement, who control the hilltop area and who are
now among the potential leaders of an independent East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had not seen them since the post-referendum violence
forced the United Nations to evacuate its mission a week ago. This
time, he told them, ``the United Nations is here to stay until an
independent East Timor no longer wants us to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the U.N. office, looted but not destroyed after the
evacuation, is being secured by British, Danish and Swedish troops
in preparation for reopening. At the moment, he said, the United
Nations has 17 staff members in Dili along with 10 aid workers and
six members of the International Committee for the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their moment of thrill and hope Tuesday, the 37,000
people taking shelter in the hills of Dare _ among the estimated
200,000 refugees throughout East Timor _ still face danger and
severe hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Though the peacekeepers have moved to seal off and secure Dili
in their second day on the ground, armed men who oppose
independence still roam the hills around Dare, and elsewhere
throughout the territory.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as many as 200,000 other people have fled or been
forced into camps in neighboring West Timor, long a province of
Indonesia. These East Timorese are under the control of militias
that so far have prevented most aid workers from entering West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   An Indonesian representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees also visited Dare Tuesday and said many families had been
separated as the militias forced people, under threat of death, to
move with them to West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Casimiro Reis, 45, spoke with quiet dignity of his family's
separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am refugee,'' he said in carefully enunciated English. ``My
wife told me to go to mountain. If I stay in Dili, my safety is not
guaranteed. The main reason is, I am a man and they will kill me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a wife and five children. I don't know what has
happened to them. I hope that if they are alive in Kupang or
Atambua [in West Timor). I hope they will be able to come back
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees in Dare included several dozen East Timorese
policemen who had defected, some with their uniforms and side arms,
to remain here with their countrymen. There are also numerous
reports of police officers and soldiers who have broken ranks and
joined the militias in their fight to keep East Timor part of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officers here, Agostinho Gomes, said he had joined
the Indonesian police force in 1994 specifically to learn about
police work so he could apply his knowledge in a future independent
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ross Mountain, who coordinates humanitarian aid for the United
Nations and who visited Dare Tuesday, was asked if the estimates
for the numbers of displaced people mean that half of East Timor's
800,000 people need assistance. He replied: ``Frankly, those in
need are well in excess of that. It's almost easier to talk about
who does not need assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   A major difficulty, he said, is distributing the supplies that
are expected to pour into the country. Most trucks were destroyed
or sent into West Timor in the mass evacuation. And even with
transportation, he said, ``this is quite a difficult country to
move around in.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Scott-Bowden, the East Timor representative of the World
Food Program, which is coordinating the food aid, said air drops
that began and then paused just before the beginning of the
peacekeeping operation would resume, mostly bringing specially
packed emergency rations from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the refugees are in the hills. In vacant lots and along
the long waterfront of Dili, thousands of families fleeing the
violence in their own city have created whole settlements of
displaced people. Many, young and old, lounge like retired elders
in displaced armchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Australian soldiers stationed around the city, these
hungry people are terrified, jumping at rumors of attacks and
afraid even to cross the city to see whether their homes have been
burned or are still standing.
</P>
<P>
   But with the arrival of the peacekeepers to support the vote of
independence, the remaining threats from militia members are likely
to stem from the cornered fury of a retreating force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militia in itself is not a threat for East Timor,'' said
Salar Kosi, a leader in the independence movement who greeted the
U.N. team here in Dare. ``But if they continue to be supported by
elements of the military that have run out of control, it may be
dangerous in the next coming weeks, the next coming months, the
next coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   A top lieutenant here for Gusmao, Leandro Isaac, said he is
still far from ready to declare victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be one more step,'' he said of the arrival of the
foreign forces. ``But I still don't trust the Indonesian military.
As long as there is one Indonesian soldier, one Indonesian
policeman in East Timor, our struggle continues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether, after the horrors of the past three weeks, the
leaders of the independence movement could still hold to their
policy of reconciliation with their enemies in East Timor, he said:
``We maintain our policy of reconciliation, but it must be
reconciliation based on justice. We cannot have peace without
justice; peace without justice would be a bad peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosi said that in a new East Timor, some leaders of the militias
may be pardoned and some may be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Dare, it is clear that the destruction and personal
traumas caused by the militias in the past three weeks will not be
forgotten quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Reynaldo Peveida, 28, said that with his home in ruins, he is
ready to live ``in a church or a school or a convent or under a
tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he voiced a rare complaint _ a criticism that is heard more
often abroad than in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the United Nations dismiss or fail to consider the
danger of assigning Indonesian security forces to keep the peace
during the referendum _ in effect, to police themselves? And he
addressed his comment to the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very bad decision,'' Peveida said. ``You see what
happened. I have that question for Mr. Kofi Annan.''

 &HT;    Businessess getting Y2K ready; some will continue testsBy
Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The software has been upgraded, the networks tested
and retested. Still, BellSouth is not resting on its laurels as the
Millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us are done with this until way past the turn of the
year,'' says Rick Harder vice president with overall
responsibilities for the corporate Year 2000 project. ``We prefer
to say we are ready for Y2K _ not that we are finished with testing
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is not alone. Every big company in metro Atlanta,
while prepared on paper, is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
New Year. They realize that no test, no matter how tough, can't
fully predict what will happen in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a moment to be sitting back on your laurels,''
says James M. McCullough, a Y2K consultant and board member of the
Atlanta/Southeast Region Y2K Solution Center.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough calculates that even the best, most well-financed
plan can't anticipate 30 percent to 40 percent of the potential
risk posed by a failure of computers to understand any date after
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That failure could ripple far and wide through a metro area in
which nearly every business, large and small, now uses computers.
</P>
<P>
   What the experts fear is not an earthquake-like catastrophe but
a continual series of disruptions that could slow the economy,
ending the 9-year-old expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst case scenarios won't occur,'' says Bud Hamilton, a
professor at Georgia State University. ``But problems related to
Y2K will persist for the first of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dolinsky, the computer consultant who heads up the Solution
Center, worries that Hamilton is right. ``Y2K is greatly
misunderstood,'' he says. ``It's not an event and it's not a bug.
There'd be no problem at all if everyone just converted their
computers to read the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in metro Atlanta, especially the billion-dollar
corporations, have done just that.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas, for example, will have spent an estimated $6.2
million this year alone readying its computers to handle 2000.
Among other things, the company has replaced nine software
applications.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has tested its own lines, systems used for 911 and
connections with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at BellSouth are doing everything we can to make sure our
telephone network and computer systems will be ready for the Year
2000,'' said Harder.
</P>
<P>
   Such work has not come cheap. Bank of America, formerly
NationsBank, has spent more than $500 million in the past five
years to ready its vast computer network for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have contingency plans for any emergency,'' says company
spokesman Mark Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Billion-dollar behemoths such as Bank of America can spend
hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading their own systems, but
that effort could be for naught it key suppliers aren't also
upgrading.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Solution Center has identified suppliers as the weak
link in the Y2K preparation effort. The problem is that suppliers
tend to be small to mid-sized companies. Many of them are either
reluctant to do or can't afford expensive computer upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little guys who make me nervous,'' says McCullough.
``The big companies have the money and resources to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Many big companies share McCullough's concern. ``We have some of
our people working with our outside vendors,'' says Bank of
America's Williams. ``They are trying to help our key suppliers be
ready for Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough also worries that many big companies have focused on
critical systems and neglected or cut back on upgrading
nonessential services.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if something fails because of Y2K, it won't be
the power grid or the telephone system. What you'll see instead a
series of smaller but still disconcerting problems such as an
inability to book a flight or renew your driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacations will get canceled, flight reservations booked on the
wrong days, stuff like that,'' says McCullough. He likens the
potential impact of these problems as being ``nibbled to death by
ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Bank of America say they're prepared but
company spokesman Williams agrees that there is an element of the
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as prepared for Y2K as we can be, but you never know
what will happen,'' says Williams. ``There could be an earthquake
tomorrow.''

 &HT;    Q and A on Y2K
 &HT;    By Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even the experts are uncertain about the effect of the
Y2K bug after Jan. 1, leaving many people with questions about how
and if to prepare for disruptions. Here are some answers.
</P>
<P>
   Lights, heat, water, other services
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will electric or natural gas service be interrupted?
</P>
<P>
   A: The state's report on Y2K preparedness says major national
disruptions in power are unlikely, but there could be limited,
local disruptions. Georgia Power is 100 percent in compliance,
according to its report to the state, but there could be temporary
interruptions in service because of the interdependence of power
systems. Atlanta Gas Light reported to the state it will be ready
by this month, but it is dependent on gas distribution, and the
Public Service Commission has reported concern about the readiness
of gas marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will water service be interrupted?
</P>
<P>
   A: That could be a concern. When local jurisdictions were
required in July to report to the state on Y2K readiness, Atlanta's
two water plants were rated ``not yet ready/making progress.'' The
plants supply water to most of the city and parts of Fulton County
and sell water wholesale to other metro-area water systems. Also
ranked ``not yet ready/making progress'' were water systems in
Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette and Gwinnett counties and the
cities of Lawrenceville, Fayetteville and Roswell. Rated ``ready''
were water systems in Fulton and Clayton counties, Cobb-Marietta
and Smyrna, College Park and Buford. However, the state is
scheduled to release new reports next week, and those rankings
could change.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will gasoline be available?
</P>
<P>
   A: It should be, assuming no disruptions in power to run pumps.
The American Petroleum Institute says the industry is prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will telephones work?
</P>
<P>
   A: BellSouth and AT&AMP;T said in August they have tested their
public telephone networks for potential Y2K foul-ups and the tests
were 100 percent successful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the mail be delivered?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Postal Service says yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will elevators work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Elevator operators, including Otis Elevators, one of the
largest manufacturers, predict no problems because elevators aren't
date-dependent. But elevators tied into larger building-control
systems could be affected if the larger systems have problems. If
you live in a high-rise building, check with your building manager.
</P>
<P>
   Money
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should I have extra cash on hand? Will sufficient cash be
available if many people want extra funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: You might want to have enough cash on hand to last a few
days, but don't empty your bank account. The Federal Reserve System
is preparing for the possibility that many Americans will withdraw
cash from banks: It has ordered $50 billion in new currency put
into circulation to cover demands on banks and automated teller
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will ATM machines work? Should I worry about bank records or
the security of my accounts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Problems with ATMs are not expected. Federal agencies are
inspecting banks to make sure all functions, including ATMs, will
continue uninterrupted. However, some experts recommend keeping
records of financial transactions, especially those conducted near
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should I worry about bills, mortgage payments or other
financial records?
</P>
<P>
   A: Experts recommend keeping copies of important documents, such
as payroll and credit union records, 1998 and 1999 tax information,
deeds, medical records, bank statements, investment reports, and
car and insurance payments. Especially, keep documentation on
expensive items or services purchased or business transacted from
December 1999 through January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Food and drugs
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should I stockpile food and water or such supplies as diapers
and baby formula?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Food Distributors International Web site expects ``Jan.
1, 2000, will be just another shopping day.'' But the general
advice is to prepare as you would for a winter storm or other
natural disaster, including possible power outages. The Red Cross
recommends preparing for 10 days to two weeks of inconveniences.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should I have extra supplies of prescription or
over-the-counter medicine?
</P>
<P>
   A: Federal agencies report they don't expect problems with drug
distribution but recommend consumers refill prescriptions when they
have a five-to-seven day supply of medicine remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Police, fire, traffic
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will police be reachable? Will 911 systems work?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is too soon to tell. In July, the state rated many metro
area 911 systems ``not yet ready/making progress.'' Among them were
Cherokee, Rockdale, DeKalb, Douglas, Clayton and Fayette counties
and the cities of Decatur and East Point. Rated ``not
ready/questionable'' were the city of Atlanta, Conyers and Gwinnett
County. 911 systems in Cobb and Fulton counties and in Smyrna
reported to the state they are prepared for the change. The status
reports from police and sheriff's departments were even less
encouraging. Ranked not ready were: Atlanta police, Cobb police and
sheriff, Clayton and Coweta sheriff's departments, Gwinnett police
and East Point police. The Decatur police and DeKalb police and
sheriff's office were ``making progress.'' The Cherokee sheriff's
office reported it is prepared. Fulton police did not report.
However, the state is due to release a new report next week, and
those rankings could change.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will traffic lights work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Metro area traffic engineers say yes, assuming electricity
continues to flow.
</P>
<P>
   Other worries
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will appliances such as televisions and microwave ovens work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Trade associations say that absent power interruptions, home
appliances aren't likely to be affected, because most _ coffee
makers, microwaves, clock radios, and heating and cooling equipment
_ use clock, rather than calendar, functions. Even products that
have calendars, such as VCRs and camcorders, are not likely to have
problems unless you bought them before 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Specific information on products and models is available on many
manufacturers' Web sites. The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Association's Web site (www.cemacity.org/govt/CEMA2000.htm) has
links to member companies' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will it be safe to fly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Airplane manufacturers say planes will be OK. The Federal
Aviation Administration's air traffic computer systems were
reported compliant by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can I do to make sure my PC works?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many PCs, especially those bought before mid-1997, may have
Y2K hardware problems. Major computer manufacturers offer
information about possible problems and fixes or ``patches'' that
can be downloaded. Check the Web site of your computer manufacturer
for information. Apple Macintosh reports that its computers should
not have any date-related hardware problems. Information is
available on Apple computer's home page
(ww.apple.com/about/year2000/). PC users also should check their
software for Y2K compliance. For information, check the software
manufacturer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else do I need to know to be prepared?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are Year 2000 scams are encouraging consumers to buy
unnecessary items and overpriced kits, or move money or investments
into so-called protected programs. Avoid them and use common sense.
Never give out your Social Security number or bank account numbers
over the telephone to callers you do not know. Include elderly
relatives or other vulnerable family members in your planning.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If there are Y2K problems, when will they start and how long
will they last?
</P>
<P>
   A: The experts say it's unlikely that all the lights will go out
or other systems will fail at midnight, Dec. 31. A more likely
scenario is that there will be small failures that may affect the
operation of large systems over the first several weeks or months
of 2000. The result may be service interruptions that are limited
in area and time.

 &HT;    Falcons try to rebound after losing first 2 games, AndersonBy
Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jamal Anderson's season began in a limousine on his
way to contract negotiations in Greenville, S.C., to end his 14-day
holdout.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons running back's season ended Tuesday, probably, with
him wedged into an MRI tube to reveal that Anderson tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in Monday night's 24-7
loss at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The injury happened when he tried to cut on the artificial
surface in Texas Stadium and heard a ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will undergo surgery in a couple weeks. He was not
placed immediately on injured reserve, however, because of a slim
chance that he could return by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Falcons will try to rebound from an 0-2
start without a back who last season rushed for franchise records
of 1,846 yards and 14 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely upset and saddened by this turn of fate,'' said
a statement from Anderson, who last month got a five-year, $32
million contract. ``I will do everything in my power to return
better than I was before, as quickly as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have two healthy running backs: Byron Hanspard, who
missed last season with a serious left knee injury, and Ken
Oxendine, who did not dress for the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will add at least one other back, either today or
Thursday. A list of possibilities includes Raymont Harris, Rashaan
Salaam and former Falcon Harold Green.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also were calling around the league on Tuesday to
inquire about trade possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some adjustments will be made to accommodate the running style
of Hanspard, who gained 76 yards on 19 carries against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The third-year pro, who is 5-feet-10 and 200 pounds, is quicker
and lighter than Anderson, and better suited to outside running
plays, draws and screens.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie in 1997, he had what were then three of the 12
longest runs in franchise history. Hanspard carried the ball 53
times for 335 yards and a stellar 6.3-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   In the final preseason game of `98, he tore the anterior
cruciate ligament and patella tendon in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard was not available for comment Tuesday, which was the
players' day off.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine, a seventh-round draft choice last year from Virginia
Tech, had 50 yards on 18 carries as a rookie. He is 6 feet and 230
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's running last year was the main reason the Falcons led
the NFL in average time of possession. In addition, his run threat
set up the Falcons' play-action passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   His absence places more pressure on a passing game that sorely
needs quarterback Chris Chandler to return from the strained right
hamstring that kept him out of the Dallas game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you'll do . . . is run plays that Byron likes, and they
are a little bit different than what Jamal likes,'' coach Dan
Reeves said. ``We will . . . try to work Ken Oxendine in there
some, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's injury does not affect his $7.5 million signing
bonus, which is guaranteed, and he is guaranteed his $1.9 million
salary for the season. His charge of $3.4 million against the
Falcons' salary cap remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams have insurance to cover medical emergencies but not
for wages for injured players.
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson is not placed on IR, and another back is signed, the
team would have to release another player to make room on the
roster.

JAPAN'S CENTRAL BANK REFUSES TO SHIFT COURSE ON THE YEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese central bank voted on Tuesday to leave
monetary policy unchanged, defying government officials and
economists here and abroad who have been demanding that the bank
take aggressive steps to reverse the yen's heady rise in value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign exchange rates themselves are not an aim of Bank of
Japan monetary policy,'' the bank said in a tartly worded
statement. ``The Bank of Japan has learned valuable lessons from
the bubble years that connecting monetary policy to control of
exchange rates'' carries the risk of getting policy wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Around 5 p.m. here Tuesday, when the bank issued its statement,
the dollar was selling at almost 107 yen. Twenty minutes later, it
was worth 104, as currency traders surged into the market to buy
yen and sell dollars on a bet that the Japanese currency would
strengthen. (Late in New York Tuesday, the yen settled at 104.87 to
the dollar, a gain from 106.38 on Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's going to be the markets versus the Bank of Japan,''
a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said. ``The market was
disappointed, and so were many people in the Ministry of Finance.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry had been pressing the central bank to further
loosen what the bank already considers a loose monetary policy _ in
the interest of weakening the yen, which surged to its strongest
levels in more than three years last week.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's strength reflects a belief among global investors that
Japan's economy is emerging from a prolonged slump, which has
increased demand for the currency. But a stronger yen also makes
Japanese exports more expensive abroad and could forestall any
economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stronger yen means exporters get hurt, they cut wages, their
employees cut their spending and that hampers economic growth,''
said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Treasury has also pressed the Japanese central bank for
a looser monetary policy as a condition for American participating
in any coordinated effort to weaken the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The currency markets had been betting that the Japanese would
move in some way to dilute the yen's value by expanding the money
supply, perhaps by pumping more excess cash into the money market
than the one trillion yen now available. That expectation had
pushed down the currency on Monday and helped rally Japanese stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did not, in fact, rule out an expansion of the money
supply, but it repeated its official position that such additional
liquidity would have a short-term impact at best. ``The Bank of
Japan cannot resort to policies if it cannot explain their
effects,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has steadfastly maintained that it has gone as
far as it can to pump liquidity into the economy, but to no avail.
It has pushed short-term interest rates close to zero, and still,
commercial banks are reluctant to lend and prospective borrowers to
borrow. It has intervened in the currency markets, selling yen nine
times since June to push down the currency, and yet the yen has
moved higher and higher.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Feldman said he thought the central bank would now begin laying
the groundwork for an an easing of monetary policy, with the aim of
expanding the monetary supply, but without appearing to make a
180-degree turn away from its stated opposition to such an
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of saving face for the Bank of Japan is quite
important,'' he wrote in a report to investors. Referring to Masaru
Hayami, the bank's chief, he said, ``Governor Hayami has taken a
strong stance against easing, and he must be satisfied that the
Bank of Japan is not being bullied and does not appear to be
bullied.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayami has charted an independent course for the central bank
since he took over as head of its policy board last year, when the
bank was declared free from the Finance Ministry and the ruling
political party. But he has had to fight the bank's former masters
every step of the way, and in the process, has been accused of
stubbornness and inflexibility. There has been speculation for
months that Hayami will step down, but he seems firmly committed to
his job.

BIG MONEY, SMALL IDEAS, MEDIOCRE PEOPLE MAKE FOR BORING POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I hereby announce my withdrawal from the San
Francisco mayor's race and the 2000 presidential campaign. The
public has spoken, saying it doesn't give a damn about either.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, my wife has spoken. She said if I write about either
topic again she'll invoke the prenuptial clause about boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Politics bores the average American more than waiting in stuffy
airports for overcrowded planes, and nowadays fills many political
writers with the urge to be assigned to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Big money, small ideas and mediocre people have made politics
less relevant to our lives than the new TV season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has a show set in the White House called ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say it's good, but it remains to be seen whether the
public wants more inside looks at the Oval Office _ even with Rob
Lowe as a presidential aide.
</P>
<P>
   Casting celebrities is the only way to keep people interested in
politics. That's why Hillary Clinton, Jesse Ventura and Warren
Beatty have gotten so much coverage for doing almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown is a celebrity too, but four
years of hearing him celebrate himself has worn out his welcome.
He's likely to win re-election because his opponents, Clint Reilly
and Frank Jordan, are less appealing than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Da Mayor could become default mayor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing the candidates decided to quit ``debating''
(berating is more like it). I refuse to attend any more of those
circuses, too, or be deafened by crowds of heckling political
lackeys.
</P>
<P>
   We just want this thing to be over. Brown's power and money kept
many would-be candidates out of the race. Instead they feebly hope
to fill Brown's large ermine mantle four years from now. The rest
of us just hope to catch a bus, or not have a highrise or loft
dropped on our heads.
</P>
<P>
   Brown couldn't have bought better opponents than Jordan and
Reilly. It feels as if we're at a Don King fight, with a
heavyweight blowhard vs. the best chumpdom can offer _ and it can't
end mercifully in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Already I've said too much about these guys. But from now on, I
swear I won't write about them _ unless they do something
surprising, like agreeing to bring in Indonesian troops to monitor
the election.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential sweepstakes, George W. Bush and Al Gore have
disappeared in a cloud of imaginary cocaine and wood chips.
</P>
<P>
   Things are so dull on the national political scene that Bill
Bradley is provoking interest.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the Reform Party is getting a lot of
press. It could be the spoiler in the election, but for now it's an
enhancer for political writers.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party will let anyone in. Its list of potential
candidates includes Jesse Ventura (who has said he doesn't want to
run, alas), Ross Perot, Lowell Weicker, Donald Trump and maybe even
Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party is an unlocked ward for the self-deluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the head of the party, is the psychiatric attendant.
</P>
<P>
   That's how weird it is.
</P>
<P>
   Perot once talked about the federal budget as the ``crazy aunt
down in the basement.'' Now Trump and Buchanan are jockeying for
position, and the bedlam is on the first floor of the house Perot
built.
</P>
<P>
   To be nominated by the Reform Party, you don't have to pass a
litmus test on abortion, guns or gays. Instead your ego has to test
off the charts on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.
</P>
<P>
   That's a psychological test invented at the University of
Minnesota, not the set of roles played by Governor Ventura of that
state. Lately he's been playing the sanest man in American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura wants to crush Buchanan's possible bid to become the
Reform Party nominee. He prefers former Connecticut Gov. Lowell
Weicker, who is crazy to want to be president because he's too
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker favors the right to abortion, gun control and free trade
_ things that can only get him in trouble in the Reform Party or
with conservatives. Buchanan is against free trade and the right to
abortion, and the only guns he would ban are those used in World
War II to fight the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy who said that Nazi Germany presented no threat to
the United States. This is a guy going nowhere but back to
loudmouth talk shows _ on the leading militia channels.
</P>
<P>
   But never fear. The enemies of Buchanan's brand of retro-
isolationism have a cosmopolitan new ally, The Donald.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump is trying to seduce the Reform Party by daringly
attacking Buchanan for being soft on the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    SAFETY BOARD SNUBS SEAT BELTS IN SCHOOL BUSES
 &HT;    430&AMP;add
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seat belts might not help your children on school
buses, and might even hurt them if the belts are installed before
the seats are redesigned, the National Transportation Safety Board
decided Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seats are not designed for seat belts. That's the bottom
line,'' said Jim Hall, chairman of the influential advisory board,
after the board was briefed by its staff on computer simulations of
school-bus crashes with and without seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   New York and New Jersey have required seat belts in new school
buses for eight years. Florida and Louisiana passed such laws this
year, and a similar bill in California is awaiting the governor's
decision on whether to sign it into law. The other states don't
have seat-belt rules for full-size school buses.
</P>
<P>
   With or without seat belts, today's school buses fail to offer
children enough protection when they are sideswiped or roll over,
the safety board concluded. The five-member board voted unanimously
to recommend that the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration (NHTSA) develop better crash-safety standards for
school buses within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take the board's recommendations seriously, because
they've been working on them for a long time,'' said NHTSA
spokesman Tim Hurd. ``We are right in the middle of a two-year
study of school buses, including whether there is a better way to
protect the occupants.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hall noted that some of his board's recommendations for
safety improvements for the big tour buses known as motor coaches
have been pending at NHTSA since the early 1970's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's frustrating,'' Hall said. He said he had one
consolation about how long it takes to change federal bus rules:
``The big yellow school bus remains by far the safest way for
children to go to and from school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just blowing smoke,'' responded Alan J. Ross, president
of the National Coalition for School Bus Safety, which favors seat
belt requirements. ``They had 50,000 accidents last year in a fleet
of 500,000 buses. Most were minor, but ... if your kid rides a bus
twice a day for twelve years, your kid has a good chance of being
in an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In an average year, 24 million children ride on school buses,
but only four die in accidents while riding in a bus. Injury rates,
though obviously higher, are unknown, because local, state and
federal data are fragmented and unreliable, the safety board said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the board voted Tuesday for more study, rather than a quick
change in existing rules, lobbyists for the bus industry and state
school-bus bureaucracies congratulated one another, while
representatives of seat-belt makers looked glum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I heard the board say is that there must be a way to make
a school bus a safer vehicle, although at this time we need more
research to make that happen,'' said Mike Martin of the National
Association for Pupil Transportation. ``Everybody should support
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Murphy, chief executive officer of Busbelts (cq)
Development Corp. of Norwood, Mass., which makes school-bus
restraints, said, ``We have some questions about the validity of
the research, and we're going to re-examine the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations adopted two decades ago require that
school-bus seats consist of a flat pan with a cushion covered with
a slippery fireproof material, and attached to a high, flexible
back padded on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of such seats, placed close together, protect seated
children if a bus is hit from the front or rear, according to the
board's safety engineers. But they told the board that if a truck
rams a bus from the side or sideswipes it, the children in the bus,
whether or not they are wearing seat belts, can slide sideways on
the flat seats and hit the inside of a bus or fly out a window or
door.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers said that vans, light trucks or cars are safer
with seat belts, because their curved, bucket-type seats _
especially in conjunction with light-thrust air bags _ help prevent
that. The staff also said that seat belts work better in short
vehicles than in long buses, in which someone seated at the rear
can suddenly accelerate by 25 miles per hour in less than a second
if the bus starts to spin.
</P>
<P>
   The bus safety coalition disputes that analysis. Ross said,
``Smaller school buses have the same kind of seats as the big ones,
and they have been using seat belts with good results for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules would have to be changed in order to legalize
major design changes in school buses, so competition between
manufacturers in the next few years is not expected to take the
form of a race to be the first in offering safer designs.
</P>
<P>
   In another decision Tuesday, the safety board recommended that
NHTSA combat the problem of passengers being thrown out the windows
during crashes of the large tour buses by speeding up its research
into new flexible, plasticized glass for windows. To minimize the
crushing of passengers during rollovers, the board said NHTSA
should adopt tougher roof standards for new school buses and tour
buses within two years.

 &HT;    Marianne Gingrich's attorney asks for depositions of estranged
husbands' friends
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's closest associate could become part of
his divorce case as Marianne Gingrich attempts to drag out and nail
down any personal and financial secrets her estranged husband is
keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney has asked a Cobb County judge for permission to
depose Joe Gaylord, whom Gingrich once described as an advisor ``on
all aspects of my life and career'' and one of his ``closest
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord has worked closely with Gingrich and his campaigns since
the early 1980s, and he served for a time as executive director of
GOPAC. Newt Gingrich used the powerful political action committee
to train Republican candidates for Congress in his long effort to
win a GOP majority in the U.S. House, and he credits Gaylord for
helping him do it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to motions released Tuesday, Marianne Gingrich's
attorney, John Mayoue, also wants to take a deposition from unnamed
representatives of GOPAC and the Friends of Newt Gingrich campaign
committee, for which Gaylord also worked.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth request among those filed late Monday asks to depose an
unnamed representative from Private Enterprise Partners in
Washington. Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said he knows
only that Private Enterprise Partners was an entity set up by
Gaylord.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord was reached at a Washington number for Private
Enterprise Partners on Tuesday, but declined to comment on the
request for his depositions. He also declined to say what the
company's purpose is. ``I'm not a part of this story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue won't comment on the organization either, and he won't
say what information he hopes to learn from the depositions. Mayoue
needs Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson's permission to take
the depositions because the subjects live out of state, in the
Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best guess is they're just trying to pin down the finance
pieces,'' said Evans, Newt Gingrich's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Gingriches have decided how to temporarily split
their assets until their contentious divorce is final, lawyers for
both sides have been freed up to concentrate on the next phase of
the case _ discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Ain, a Washington, D.C.-based divorce lawyer who makes a
specialty of representing high-profile politicians, said
depositions are particularly useful in the information-gathering
phase of a divorce case, especially when it comes to assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're really trying to find out is how much money and
where it is,'' Ain said.
</P>
<P>
   Depositions also allow lawyers to confirm information they
already have, and force witnesses to commit to testimony they would
give at trial. Tactically, the threat of a deposition can increase
``pressure to come to a settlement,'' Ain added.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich has already won permission to take at least
one deposition that could help pressure a settlement. On Sept. 29,
33-year-old congressional aid Callista Bisek is scheduled to answer
questions under oath about her relationship with Newt Gingrich.

INDONESIAN LEADER DEFENDS DECISION ON FOREIGN TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With TIMOR-RDP) 
 (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Disliked at home, discredited abroad and
discounted by virtually everyone, President B.J. Habibie trudged
into parliament on Tuesday to explain his decision to allow foreign
troops in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I could do, and what I think is the best for
Indonesia,'' Habibie said in a 75-minute speech that represented
the first time that an Indonesian leader has had to go to
parliament to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie urged the highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly, to ratify East Timor's resounding vote for
independence when it meets next month. Under the terms of an
agreement with the United Nations, the assembly has to vote on the
results of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept the results,'' Habibie said. ``It seems as
if the people of East Timor have rejected the offer of autonomy''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie said Indonesia, which annexed the former Portuguese
colony in 1976, would have never been accepted by the world if it
had not allowed the East Timorese to determine their future. He
said he had tried to stem the bloody aftermath of the balloting by
imposing martial law. When that failed, he added, the government
had little choice but to accept the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that the East Timor crisis would not go deeper,''
Habibie said as lawmakers watched with ill-concealed impatience.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has been in a surly mood since soldiers from
Australia, Britain and other countries began fanning across East
Timor this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel particularly hurt, because we are in such a difficult
situation,'' a political and military analyst, Salim Said, said.
``Internationally as well as domestically, we have so many
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the capital of North Sumatra, Medan, protesters swarmed over
the gates of the Australian Consulate, burned the flag and replaced
it with an Indonesian one, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, protests have flared in front of parliament and the
Australian Embassy. An Australian official said that gunfire hit
the embassy on Monday but that no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Although Habibie seems more politically fragile than ever, he
lashed out at Australia, the leader of the peacekeeping force and,
arguably, Indonesia's most important ally. Habibie said Australia
had overreacted and had breached the terms of a defense agreement
with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Australia has violated certain laws and
regulations in intervening in domestic problems of other
countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia suspended the pact with Australia last week, after
Australian officials had repeatedly condemned Jakarta for having
failed to halt the violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But that scarcely stopped the Australians. On Monday, Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer declared that Australia would support a
U.N. tribunal to prosecute Indonesian officials for human rights
abuses in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   People here complain that Australia is being highhanded. They
note that when Indonesia invaded East Timor and annexed it in 1976,
Australia was the sole country to recognize the move. But now
Australia has emerged as Indonesia's most strident critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Indonesians are offended by the attitude of
Australians,'' Said said. ``There is an element of the Australian
elite that has always considered Indonesia as its little brown
uncivilized neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Australia said pragmatism was driving the East Timor
policy. Australia tolerated the annexation, in part because
Indonesia was willing to draw boundaries in the Timor Sea, which
separates East Timor and Australia and which contains rich oil
deposits. East Timor's previous sovereign, Portugal, had dragged
its feet on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of Indonesia's leader, Suharto, rekindled
independence passions, however, Australia determined that the East
Timorese should be given the right to vote on their future.
Australia also feared that unrest would encourage refugees to flee
to Australia, 370 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the invasion, Australia did not have the
resources to do anything about it,'' said Harold Crouch, an
Indonesia expert at the Australian National University in Canberra.
``As circumstances change, policies change.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Habibie's low standing that many people were
disappointed when he announced at the end of the speech that he
would not withdraw his candidacy for president in elections in
November.

 &HT;    FINAL FIREWORKS FLY IN LANDMARK MICROSOFT TRIAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Courtroom battles in the historic Microsoft
antitrust trial ended Tuesday as they began, with prosecutors
deriding the software giant as a high-tech outlaw and defense
lawyers asserting their hugely successful client has done no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, counsels, the case is submitted,'' U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said after sitting mute through five
hours of oral arguments over what actual facts were brought out in
testimony that ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is expected to issue his own voluminous findings of fact
before the end of the year. Based on the judge's ruling, the
contending parties may gain a fresh incentive to settle _ thereby
avoiding a final judgment from Jackson and, perhaps, years of
appeals and private litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the high interest generated by the case, Jackson
agreed to shift Tuesday's oral arguments to a sixth-floor
ceremonial courtroom that is normally used to hear appeals. It was
the same setting where Microsoft won an important 2-1 verdict from
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in June 1998, overruling
Jackson's demand that Microsoft cleave its Internet Explorer Web
browser from the underlying Windows 95 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust laws are not about the government picking
winners and losers,'' boomed John Warden, the company's lead
litigator. ``If consumers side with Microsoft, Microsoft will come
out on top, and this is as it should be,'' Warden concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The only area in which Warden and his opposite number, David
Boies, agreed was, as Boies put it: ``Central planning is bad.''
But in his final rebuttal of the day, Boies was quick to add: ``It
is bad whether it is done by the government or by a powerful
monopolist.''
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutors' perspective, the guts of the case have
remained unchanged since the original complaint was filed 16 months
ago, despite vast changes in the marketplace, including the $10
billion takeover of Netscape Communications Corp., Microsoft's
archrival in the browser wars, by America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Boies contended that Microsoft's Windows software continues to
monopolize the operating system market for personal computers.
Moreover, he argued, Microsoft gained its dominant position by dint
of its ``anticompetitive conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no limits to what it will do to squelch emerging
competition,'' Boies asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing internal e-mails and sworn testimony on three 10-foot
screens spread across the courtroom, Boies portrayed Microsoft as a
ruthless predator determined to enshrine its flagship product.
Windows runs on more than 90 percent of the world's personal
computers and is largely responsible for the vast wealth of the
world's richest man, company chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is like the emperor without clothes,'' said Stephen
Houck, the lead lawyer for the states, who began the government's
arguments. ``Everyone knows, including Microsoft, that it's a
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden responded, however, that ``the government has made no
valid claim that Microsoft achieved its market power _ whatever it
is _ by illegal means.'' To emphasize his point, Warden showed the
``evidence'' on the courtroom screens. They were completely white.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a settlement, Jackson will call on both sides to submit
yet another set of briefs on the ``conclusions of law'' to follow
those they have given him on their proposed ``findings of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, given the wide gap between the warring parties, the judge
is most likely to frame his own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Should Jackson conclude that Microsoft has broken the nation's
antitrust laws, as the government and 19 state attorneys general
contend, the case would then enter a remedial phase, in which a
range of penalties could be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could then call the lawyers back into his courtroom to
hear still further arguments on these issues, but he indicated no
intention to do so.

CBS SCORES, FOR OPENERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new television season started with a bit of a bang for CBS
and a distinctive whimper from the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   The first night of the official season, Monday, provided good
news for two new CBS shows, ``Ladies Man'' and ``Family Law,'' and
a surprisingly lackluster effort from Fox, which apparently missed
the memo that the new season was beginning: Fox didn't even put on
any original programming.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had the best night of any network, thanks largely to its old
reliable, ``Monday Night Football,'' which moved back to 9 p.m.
this season. But ``20/20'' at 8 had an especially big night for
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   NBC got some promising news from its new drama ``Law and Order:
Special Victims Unit'' and some ominous news from its gasping
comedies ``Suddenly Susan'' and ``Veronica's Closet,'' both of
which were thrashed by CBS' comedies, even in the young-adult
ratings that NBC always says are all that count, and that CBS
usually tries its best to ignore.

<P>
   CBS' ``King of Queens,'' newly moved to 8, had the best rating
of any show on television at that hour among viewers between the
ages of 18 and 49, a 4.9, easily defeating ``Suddenly Susan,''
which limped in with a 3.7 rating in NBC's preferred category. In
the overall ratings, ``The King of Queens'' far surpassed
``Susan'': a 9.1 rating to a 5.9. (Each rating point this season
represents 1,008,000 homes, or 1 percent of the country's estimated
100.8 million TV-watching households.)
</P>
<P>
   That set up the new CBS comedy ``Ladies Man'' at 8:30, when CBS
again buried NBC, going with the equally dismal ``Veronica's
Closet,'' in every ratings category.
</P>
<P>
   At both 8 and 8:30 Fox ran repeats of ``That '70s Show,''
finishing last in both cases and thus helping the new comedies on
the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 CBS' mightiest comedy, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' got off
to a stellar start with a 12.1 rating and a big 6.7 rating among
those younger adults, in both cases second only to football among
all shows for the night.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was helped by Fox, which relied on a repeat of ``Ally
McBeal.'' Because of its commitments to postseason baseball, Fox
won't begin new episodes of ``Ally McBeal'' until Oct. 25. In the
meantime the network is sticking with repeats rather than filling
in with specials.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ally McBeal'' repeat probably also helped the new spinoff
of ``Law and Order'' get established. CBS executives said that show
had the best preseason awareness with viewers. That proved out as
``Special Victims Unit'' improved by more than three ratings points
over its ``Veronica'' lead-in.
</P>
<P>
   The show did so well that it may help the argument being made by
its executive producer, Dick Wolf, that it really ought to be on at
10 p.m. NBC's ``Dateline'' scored a rather disappointing 7.9 rating
at 10.
</P>
<P>
   That was far behind CBS' other new show for the night, ``Family
Law,'' which began with a strong 11.5 rating. It proved to be
especially appealing to the audience CBS believes is most available
on Mondays against football: women between the ages of 25 and 54.
</P>
<P>
   The results were even better news for CBS because they came one
night after another new show, ``Judging Amy,'' scored a big rating
in a one-time Sunday night tryout. The actual premiere for that
series was on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And although Fox executives said Tuesday that they were less
concerned about doing well during the early days of a season than
in doing the best job to establish shows as hits, the network must
surely be concerned about some new shows that are not off to strong
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' has not done well in a couple of tries against
repeats on the other networks in the first two weeks. And the
much-touted comedy ``Action'' was at best a modest success in its
premiere last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the stumbling start for Fox last week, with a number
of original shows it managed to fall behind even CBS into fourth
place for ratings among young adults, a rare event for both
networks.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vital to HBO's Plans
</P>
<P>
   One network that is very happy with its series lineup is HBO,
which announced Tuesday that it was renewing all its current series
for another season.
</P>
<P>
   That means only four shows, but series have never been stronger
for HBO. The network had already officially given ``The Sopranos''
another season, which starts in January, but Tuesday it gave
another year of episodes to the comedies ``Sex and the City'' and
``Arliss'' and the drama ``Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Those three shows are all summer series. They begin in June and
run until the fall. Now all will be back next June.
</P>
<P>
   All three shows have seen their ratings rise this past summer,
with ``Sex and the City'' also rising like a rocket in terms of the
reaction in the press and around water coolers. It was easily the
most talked-about show anywhere this summer and even received
several Emmy nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks at least partly to the success of ``Sex and the City,''
``Arliss,'' which follows it, had its best season ever. ``Arliss''
was on the verge of cancellation last season but was saved by a
campaign initiated by its creator and star, Robert Wuhl.
</P>
<P>
   This season it needs no campaign. ``Arliss'' was up 18 percent
in ratings.
</P>
<P>
   HBO will add 13 new episodes of ``Arliss'' next summer, 16 of
``Sex and the City'' and eight of ``Oz,'' the intense prison drama
that also just concluded its strongest season ever.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albrecht, the president of original programming for HBO,
said series programming, which this pay-cable network once avoided,
is becoming vital to its plans. ``We've come to realize that series
are the staple of television,'' Albrecht said. ``You have to keep
people involved over a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said HBO was actively developing more series, although he
admitted that finding series that are distinctive enough to stand
out on HBO were hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really like to be able to add two more comedies next
summer,'' he said. ``And by January of 2001 I want to be doing at
least one more drama to go along with `The Sopranos.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of the latter, he said, even though HBO is technically only
committed to 13 episodes more this winter, ``it and `Sex and the
City' probably have a free pass for more seasons.''

JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER WINS THE ENDORSEMENT OF HIS PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By STEPHANE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The governing Liberal Democratic Party re-elected Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi as its president Tuesday, thus extending his
term as the head of Japan's government.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, who has been prime minister for a year, has proven
unexpectedly popular, using his long-honed political skills to
cobble together a coalition government that insures him legislative
success and doling out generous dollops of taxpayer money to push
the lagging economy into action.
</P>
<P>
   Using his ability to cajole his political colleagues into
acceding to his wishes, Obuchi has pushed through credit guarantees
to bail out small- and mid-sized businesses, lowered taxes for the
rich, given the middle-class incentives to spend on housing and
handed out shopping vouchers that were financed by deficit bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Obuchi's popularity has waned lately. A survey of
4,544 voters this month by the Mainichi Shimbun, one of Japan's
leading daily newspapers, showed Obuchi's approval rating falling 8
percentage points to 32 percent, the second consecutive month in
which voters have cast a more critical eye on his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst with Warburg, Dillon,
Read, said the prime minister had been hurt by the recent alliance
he established between the Liberal Democrats and Komeito, a
political party backed by a wealthy lay Buddhist organization, Soka
Gakkai, that most Japanese regard with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   A recent proposal to raise mandatory social security
contributions has also hurt him, Okazaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few political commentators doubt that Obuchi will serve
as prime minister for the next two years, when he would once again
stand for election. He controls the largest faction in the party
and has used his skills as a conciliator to win the support of the
next two largest factions.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest immediate challenge is to sway conservatives within
the party who opposed the alliance with Komeito. There is likely to
be a struggle over the allocation of the political spoils
associated with the next supplementary budget, with Komeito hoping
to see a bigger portion for welfare spending and the conservatives
pushing for more conventional public works spending.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups are also likely to be at loggerheads in the
looming debate over amending the Constitution, with the
conservatives pushing for a more hawkish agenda and Komeito urging
amendments that impose a greater responsibility on the government.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was challenged by two colleagues for the party
leadership, Koichi Kato and Taku Yamasaki, Obuchi's triumph Tuesday
was widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kato and Yamasaki didn't expect to win from the beginning,''
said Masumi Ishikawa, a professor at the Niigata University of
International and Information Studies. ``They ran because they
wanted to establish themselves as future candidates for the job.''
Obuchi got 350 votes of the 514 cast; Kato had 113 and Yamasaki 51.

ETHNIC-ALBANIAN FORCE CLAIMS VICTORY IN TALKS WITH NATO 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ As NATO and U.N. officials in Kosovo
released details on Tuesday about the civilian force that will
replace the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, the Kosovo Albanian
guerrillas were quietly congratulating themselves on winning the
deal they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what negotiations are for,'' said Hashim Thaci, the
political leader of the rebel group and the chief negotiator,
looking confident behind his desk in his downtown office. The
rebels held the international community to their promise, made as
the peacekeepers were preparing to move into Kosovo, and the
bargain was kept, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci nearly derailed the negotiations with tough last-minute
demands that brought the two sides to an impasse during all-night
negotiations on Sunday. His stubborn stance forced an extension of
the deadline and the personal intervention of NATO's supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci may not have endeared himself to the NATO and U.N.
negotiators for that, but he is being regarded by many Kosovo
Albanians _ as even some of the Western negotiators concede _ as a
leader who stood up for his commanders under enormous pressure from
the West and won them a good deal. As he prepares to start his own
political party and career, he also appears to have the trust of
his top military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last three days we were all together, we worked
together and reached the decision together,'' he said. The
commanders were present during the last day of negotiations and met
with Clark when he flew in.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting was seen as important in swinging the commanders
behind the agreement. ``He is NATO's most senior military officer
and himself a soldier with fighting experience,'' a spokesman for
the peacekeeping force said. ``And don't forget, NATO was bombing
here while they were fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if Clark gave any informal promises to the
Albanians, but Thaci credited him with a realistic and moderate
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had experience of dealing with this kind of situation that
others did not,'' Thaci said. ``They knew they should reach an
agreement but did not know how.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Kosovo Protection Corps, which will have 3,000 active
and 2,000 reserve members, has been assiduously described as
civilian by United Nations and peacekeeping officials. But the
rebels succeeded in including the word ``protection'' in the name,
which in the Albanian translation gives the distinct flavor of a
defense force.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leadership will also have a major role in recruiting
members for the organization, together with the peacekeepers, and
the senior rebel officers have already been appointed to the new
corps. Agim Ceku, the rebel chief of staff, has been approved by
the U.N. special representative, Bernard Kouchner, to lead the
corps.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also appear to have won something of what they wanted
on the issue of weapons. The force will have 2,000 weapons,
although the majority will be held under lock and key on
peacekeepers' bases. Two hundred of the weapons, sidearms, will be
permanently in use by bodyguards and guards of bases and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the corps will also be allowed to carry personal
weapons for their own protection and can apply for permits from the
U.N. police. It is not clear how many will win permission. The
rebels had asked for several hundred permits and, one official
close to the negotiations said, may get as many as 200.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling indication that the rebels won what
they wanted was that they emerged looking better than the
negotiators for the United Nations and the peacekeepers, who looked
exhausted. Their relief that the deal was done was evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tense,'' said one U.N. official who had taken part
in the all-night negotiations. They had prepared contingency plans
in the event of the failure of a deal, but that could have meant a
stand-off around the rebel bases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot go and arrest 10,000 men for wearing uniforms,'' he
said.

`THE WEST WING' ISN'T SERIES TV AS USUAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(``Tonight'' refers to Wednesday, Sept. 22)  
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fall season's crown jewel debuts tonight.
``The West Wing,'' a brisk, smart drama about the behind-the-scenes
political maneuvering amongst those in the White House inner
sanctum, comes from Aaron Sorkin (``Sports Night,'' ``A Few Good
Men''), John Wells (``ER,'' the upcoming ``Third Watch'') and
director Thomas Schlamme (Emmy winner for ``Sports Night'') and
boasts a feature-film-quality cast.
</P>
<P>
   All these president's men and women are aces at their jobs,
speak in snappily witty repartee, and are fiercely committed to
their ideals, often unwilling to budge even when it might be
politically prudent. In other words, they're unlike virtually any
White House employees this generation has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   John Spencer plays Leo McGary, the president's irascible chief
of staff, who has to curb the sharp tongue of his deputy chief of
staff, Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford). Communications director Toby
Ziegler (Richard Schiff) has an encyclopedic knowledge and is
finely attuned to the subtleties of language; his deputy, Sam
Seaborn (Rob Lowe) is a slick operator both politically and with
women, but he may not be the brightest guy on the planet. It's Sam
who gets most of the character development in the pilot episode,
and Lowe responds with some wonderfully comic line readings. C.J.
Cregg (Alison Janney) is the wry, easily flustered press secretary,
and Madeline Hampton (Moira Kelly), Josh's ex, has just gone to
work for a senator about to campaign against the president.
</P>
<P>
   But it's President Josiah Bartlett (Martin Sheen), who, as the
initial show opens, is referred to as a ``geek'' because he ran his
bicycle into a tree _ or, as Leo suggests they spin it, he made ``a
sudden arborial stop'' _ who represents Sorkin's ultimate
wish-fulfillment fantasy. He soon makes it clear that he's nobody's
fool. For Bartlett, it's all about doing the right thing, political
back-scratching or public perceptions be damned. They'll watch this
inside the Beltway with slack jaws.
</P>
<P>
   We all realize this after a too-cute opening that introduces our
sprawling, singularly impressive cast _ everyone makes a big deal
responding to beeper messages concerning ``POTUS,'' code for
President of the United States (wouldn't people in Washington,
D.C., be able to figure that one out? And, if so, why not just say,
``The President''?).
</P>
<P>
   Later, when at one point his personal life is threatening to
bottom out, Sam pleads to his ringing phone, ``Please let this be a
national emergency.'' Tonight's episode manages a couple _ a
flotilla of Cubans descends upon the Florida coastline seeking
asylum, and a snide comment Josh made on a Sunday-morning political
talk show has enraged the religious right. In both cases, Bartlett
acts in a rational, if seemingly politically imprudent fashion.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes ``The West Wing'' from much of the
competition is the ringing quality of Sorkin's scripting.
Characters here deliver, in ordinary conversation, stirring,
epigrammatic speeches that real politicians can't manage, even with
prepared notes before them. His punchlines here are funnier than
those found in most of the new season's sitcoms (he did, after all,
create ``Sports Night''), and he deftly blends the hectic pace of
office life in this ultimate location for a workplace drama with
nicer, more quiet moments.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, it looks like Sorkin will actually add some
occasional pointed social commentary. If Sorkin and company can
maintain this level of quality _ and avoid the speechifying that
can sometimes drain ``Sports Night'' of its comedy, if not its life
_ then ``The West Wing'' could become a classic series. Even if all
the good scandals have already been done.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``The West Wing.''

`OH, GROW UP'
</P>
<P>
   You know you're in trouble when a dog grabs a sitcom's biggest _
or should we say only _ laugh lines, and such is the fate of ``Oh,
Grow Up,'' a look at three mid-30s ne'er-do-wells aimlessly ambling
through life. One guy recently discovered he was gay (his wife
didn't take that too well; still hasn't, in fact), another found
out he had fathered a daughter who's now in her teens (he _ and she
_ are coping), and the other is striving to make a palatable _ and
profitable _ artistic statement. Since the show is largely given
over to gags about noisy sex, any artistic statement is highly
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Oh, Grow Up.''
</P>
<P>
   What: Sitcom about middle-age slackers trying to take
responsibility for their lives.

</P>
<P>
   Our rating: 1 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`LAW &AMP; ORDER'
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' a spin-off of Dick Wolf's
acclaimed and long-running crime procedural, debuted on Monday, but
for sheer narrative bravado, there's no beating the original.
Tonight's season premiere is a pointedly political epic tale that
crams a wealth of drama and social commentary into its hour. Wolf,
who has tirelessly and eloquently argued that crime in America is
more attributable to firearms than to media depictions of violence,
takes on what he perceives to be at the heart of America's ills _
the laissez-faire attitude of gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The episode begins explosively, with a mass shooting in Central
Park _ 15 young women, all pre-med students, are murdered by a
misogynist nut wielding an automatic weapon. The killer is captured
and prosecuted in the first half-hour; what district attorney Jack
McCoy (Sam Waterston) is more interested in prosecuting is the
manufacturer that sold a gun that was so easily converted into a
weapon of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer power and provocative nature of the episode almost
obscures the fact that it serves as a strong debut for Jesse L.
Martin (seen last season as Ally McBeal's boyfriend), who replaces
the departed Benjamin Bratt. Martin plays a cop with passions for
gambling and beating confessions out of scumbags, but his bravura
performance in the scene in which he wheedles a confession out of
the killer promises further entertaining fireworks for the rest of
this venerable show's decade season.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   What: Season premiere of the Emmy-winning police/prosecution
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Jerry Orbach, Jesse L. Martin, Sam Waterston, S.
Epatha Merkerson, Angie Harmon, Steven Hill.
</P>

<P>
   When: 10 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Our rating: 4 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`NORM'
</P>
<P>
   Don Olhmeyer and I agreed, for a while, on Norm Macdonald _ he
was a little too lazy to be consistently funny, and his film
``Dirty Work'' proved not only that he couldn't act but that he
probably didn't want to. Miraculously, however, executive producer
Bruce Helford (``The Drew Carey Show'') has turned these negatives
into a guilty pleasure with ``Norm,'' Macdonald's successful
midseason replacement series from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald still can't act, but the hangdog, who's-fooling-who
sloppiness of his presence makes for a great joke all its own, and
the one-liners generally have a cynical bite. The plots on the show
are perfunctory, so Macdonald's refusal to play along and invest
any commitment to the proceedings is understandable yet still
practically subversive. He's just there to insult whoever gets in
his way. For the record, though, Faith Ford appears in the first
few episodes as a social worker that Norm (pathetically, of course)
is sweet on.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular comic note is Macdonald's weekly introduction, in
which he cynically, sardonically and hilariously explains why each
episode got whatever meaningless rating it's saddled with.
Macdonald will likely aim to get every episode as grievous a rating
as possible, so this segment could become one of the show's high
points fast.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Norm.''
</P>
<P>
   What: Return of the sitcom about a disgruntled social worker and
his not-terribly-high-class pals.
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Norm Macdonald, Lori Metcalf, Vicki Cox, Faith Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Where: ABC (Channel 7)
</P>
<P>
   When: 8:30 tonight.
</P>

   Our rating: 3 stars &QL;

`DREW CAREY'
</P>
<P>
   Not available for review, for obvious reasons, is the season
opener of ``The Drew Carey Show'' at 9 tonight. Drew and company
will not only do the show live, but, taking a cue from Carey's
other series, ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' the episode will feature
a number of unscripted scenes. Since Carey openly admits that some
of the cast members don't have much improvisational experience, the
show's subtly suggesting that checking out the episode is akin to
watching the Indy 500 _ you're there to see a wreck.

NBC'S `THE WEST WING' LOOKS LIKE A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' doesn't crackle the way ``Sports Night'' did
last season. But creator Aaron Sorkin may end up with a bigger
winner because ``The West Wing'' is on NBC, which knows a thing or
two about marketing. (``Sports Night'' is on ABC, which couldn't
sell water to a thirsty man in the desert.)
</P>
<P>
   Generously populated like an episode of ``ER'' (minus the
scrubs), ``The West Wing'' is a busy, buzzy hive of
behind-the-scenes franticness. Instead of saving lives, the corps
d'elite is trying to champion the presidency of Josiah Bartlet
(Martin Sheen), favorite son of New Hampshire and maverick chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin, who wrote the film ``The American President,'' which
inspired the series, likes to keep his characters in hyperdrive.
This helps an hour pass quickly, but it requires viewers to pay
attention, lest they miss a subtle moment _ Sorkin's stock in
trade. For instance, when chief of staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer)
is complaining to The New York Times about the crossword puzzle,
it's an amusing moment _ ``They always hang up on me,'' he
complains _ but it's also metaphorical. Getting a staff to respect
the presidency is McGarry's task. Sometimes they foolishly speak
their minds in public, as deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman (Bradley
Whitford) does. Sometimes they sleep with high-priced call girls by
mistake, as deputy communications director Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe)
does.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's premiere tries to be too cute, but Sorkin is
good at creating likable characters. Blessed with a great cast, he
may have given NBC a two-term lock.
</P>
<P>
   The West Wing. One-hour drama series about behind-the-scenes
activity at the White House. Starring Rob Lowe, Martin Sheen, Moira
Kelly, Bradley Whitford, John Spencer, Richard Schiff and Allison
Janney. Season premiere Wednesday night on NBC. Parental guideline
rating: TV-14.

 &HT;    WORLD POPULATION TO HIT 6 BILLION ON OCT. 12, UN SAYS
 &HT;    With POPULATION-DATA.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The Earth's population will officially reach 6
billion on Oct. 12, the United Nations Population Fund announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone is both hopeful and discouraging, demographers
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask whether 6 billion is a lot,'' said Amy Coen,
president of Population Action International, a family planning
advocacy group. ``It's not so much the number itself as how quickly
we got here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, the number represents longer life spans in
most countries, with a global life expectancy of 66, compared with
46 in 1950. More old people are adding their numbers to the overall
total.
</P>
<P>
   It means lower infant mortality, which has fallen by two-thirds
since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   It reflects improved health care, sanitation, clean water and
education in the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a sharp and unexpected decrease in human fertility,
the 6 billionth human being is arriving later than was predicted 30
years ago. Couples in developing countries have reduced the size of
families from almost six children in 1969 to under three.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, projections that the world's population would
eventually reach between 10 billion and 14 billion appear to have
been wrong. U.N. demographers now project that growth will start
leveling off near the middle of the next century at around 9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The population number also has its dark aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce maternal deaths in many developing countries
have largely failed. While seven American women died for every
100,000 live births last year, the corresponding figure in Sierra
Leone was 1,800 deaths per 100,000 live births, and in Bolivia,
370.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic is spreading faster than was anticipated only
five years ago. The World Health Organization estimates that
infections by HIV increased by 10 percent last year, to 33.4
million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, which has the world's highest HIV prevalence rate,
one out of four adults is infected. Life expectancy has fallen from
61 in the late 1980s to 47 today, and is expected to plunge to 30
sometime after 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Another dark spot has been reduced interest among developed
countries in providing assistance for family planning activities in
poorer regions.
</P>
<P>
   Although still the world's leading donor for population
activities, the United States has recently reduced its level of
support because of funding restrictions passed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries need to invest in population and reproductive health
programs,'' said Robert Engelman, Population Action International
vice president for research. ``Population could then stabilize by
the middle of the next century, a crucial step toward a more
equitable world for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the AIDS epidemic, the world's population growth rate
is being guided now by a ``demographic transition'' from high
fertility and high mortality to low fertility and low mortality,
the U.N. fund said in its report, ``6 Billion, a Time for
Choices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In may respects, the less-developed regions are now about
halfway through this transition, approximately where the
more-developed regions were a half-century ago,'' the report
stated.
</P>
<P>
   While the 4, 5 and 6 billion marks in global population were
reached at accelerating rates _ 14, 13 and 12 years apart
respectively _ the rate of increase has already started to slow,
and the 7 billion mark won't be reached until 2013, or in 14 years.

 &HT;    HOUSE PASSES BILL EXPANDING VETERANS HEALTH CARE
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved a bill Tuesday ordering the
Department of Veterans Affairs to meet more of the long-term health
care needs of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put a halt to the erosion of the Veterans
Administration's long-term health care,'' said Rep. Cliff Stearns,
R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee on veterans' health.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which Stearns sponsored, would require the VA to
provide more home and community-based health care options and
increase the amount it spends on long-term care. It was approved
Tuesday evening on a 369-46 vote.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Senate and signed by the president, the bill
would give veterans who have earned the Purple Heart in combat
higher priority access to health care, previously only offered to
former prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also authorize the VA to make grants to assist
homeless veterans and would re-evaluate the criteria for building
and remodeling state veterans' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include a new pilot program providing primary
coverage for dependents of veterans, reimbursement of emergency
treatment at hospitals outside the agency's designated clinics for
veterans without health insurance, and a counseling program for
veterans who are victims of sexual trauma.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also require the VA to develop an evaluation
program that would solicit input from veteran organizations and
employee unions on improvements to the access and quality of
service at VA hospitals throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also earmarks money for medical construction at
facilities in Orlando and Kansas City and for leasing new
facilities in Lubbock. Texas, and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns said the VA has insufficient money to deal with the
nation's increasing number of older veterans. Earlier this month,
the House attempted to rectify the imbalance by giving the
department a $19.6 billion budget for 2000, the most it has ever
received in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns said, ``The new millennium should not become a source of
fear or concern for our nation's veterans.''

AIR CANADA REJECTS HOSTILE BID FROM ONEX  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Air Canada rejected a hostile takeover proposal on
Tuesday from Onex Corp., a conglomerate that wants to merge Air
Canada with its weak rival, Canadian Airlines International.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a formal response for the first time to the $1.8
billion (Canadian), or $1.2 billion (United States), offer Onex
made for both airlines last month, Air Canada's board called the
proposal harmful and urged shareholders not to sell their stock.
</P>
<P>
   Onex's offer is financially backed by the AMR Corp., the parent
of American Airlines, which owns a third of Canadian Airlines. The
takeover proposal would leave Canada with only one major airline.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters, Air Canada's chairman,
Robert A. Milton, said that the Onex offer was ``structured to
rescue Canadian Airlines at Air Canada's expense, and to transfer
$1 billion (Canadian) of value from our shareholders to Onex, AMR
Corp. and Canadian's creditors and shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton would give no indication of Air Canada's preferred
strategy, but he said the airline might enlist the help of others
to thwart the takeover attempt. Analysts have speculated that the
airline may be talking with United Airlines and Deutsche Lufthansa
AG, which are its partners in the Star Alliance of international
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been anticipating a sweetened price for Air
Canada shares since the initial takeover price of $8.25 (Canadian),
or $5.61 (United States), was announced on Aug. 24. The shares
closed on Tuesday at $9.90 (Canadian), or $6.73 (United States), on
the Toronto Stock Exchange, down 25 Canadian cents (17 cents).
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Airlines, based in Calgary, has been operating under
extreme financial difficulty for years and only the support of the
federal government and AMR has kept it flying. Air Canada, based in
Montreal, is far healthier financially but industry analysts say it
could be more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada itself has seen the potential strategic value in a
combination with Canadian Airlines. In June, it sought to buy
Canadian Airlines' international routes for about $500 million
(Canadian), or $340 million (United States), and offered to
integrate their domestic flight schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Milton has said AMR blocked that proposal and pushed its own
plan to take over Air Canada through Onex. AMR remains an obstacle
to any revamping plan, Milton said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Onex bid for the shares of both Air Canada and Canadian
Airlines, coupled with a proposal to merge the two, its chances of
success looked reasonably good.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald W. Schwartz, the chairman of the Toronto-based Onex, has
good connections in Ottawa, having been a high-profile fund-raiser
for the governing Liberal party. And because Onex owns Sky Chefs,
an airline food service company, he knows something about the
business. When the government decided in July to temporarily lift
competition measures in the Transportation Act to let the two
airlines discuss ways to improve their fortunes, Schwartz saw an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Airlines quickly endorsed Onex's offer of $2
(Canadian), or $1.36 (United States), a share for its stock.
Schwartz has given no indication that Onex is willing to pay more
than $8.25 (Canadian) a share for Air Canada.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Smoked out again on the gun issue, Gov. George
W. Bush on Tuesday turned over $1.6 million to the state attorney
general's office to help beef up prosecution of gun-law violations
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential front-runner, whose opposition to
more gun-control laws drew renewed criticism after last week's
church shooting in Fort Worth, vowed to ``vigorously enforce our
current gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some very tough laws against gun violence in Texas,
and federal law with its mandatory sentences is tough as well,''
Bush said. ``Only with tough enforcement can we win the war against
gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some $1.28 million of the grant will allow Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn to hire eight assistants to help state and
federal prosecutors seek tougher sentences for criminals who use
guns.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder will fund a public awareness program, which will
include a toll-free hotline encouraging Texans to report people
illegally carrying firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The program, dubbed ``Texas Exile,'' is patterned after a
program in Richmond, Va., which, according to Bush and Cornyn, has
drastically reduced gun crime in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he and Cornyn were working on the program before Larry
Gene Ashbrook walked into Fort Worth's Wedgwood Baptist Church last
week and shot 14 people, seven fatally, before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a series of recent mass shootings across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the new effort could help prevent such tragedies,
Bush replied, ``We certainly hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``It's hard to convince a crazy man not to act. If
it wasn't a gun, it may have been a pipe bomb. The idea is to send
a clear message ... that there will be a consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth last week to comfort the families of Ashbrook's
victims, Bush said, ``I don't know if government could have done
something to prevent this man from walking into a church.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first year in office, Bush signed the law that allows
Texans to carry concealed handguns with a license. Ashbrook,
however, did not have a license.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth shooting prompted Vice President Al Gore, a
candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, to renew his
attacks on the Texas governor over the gun issue.
</P>
<P>
   And the latest issue of Time magazine called Bush a ``loser''
for the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas massacre spotlights Guv's slavish devotion to N.R.A.
(National Rifle Association). Where's the `compassion,' Big Guy?''
the magazine wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called the criticism ``politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing my job. The attorney general is doing his job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said law enforcement officers already were enforcing gun laws
but added that this program will escalate the effort into a ``war
on people who are illegally carrying weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in explaining his opposition to new gun-control laws as a
presidential candidate, has criticized the Clinton administration
for lax enforcement of existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the new assistants that he will hire will be
cross-designated as both federal and state prosecutors. Whenever
possible, they hope to take advantage of federal sentencing
guidelines that allow any convicted felon or drug trafficker caught
with a gun to be sentenced to five years in a federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences can be increased if the felon was involved in
criminal activity when arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Exile means ``exiled to prison,'' Cornyn said. The ``zero
tolerance'' program, he said, ``sends a clear message to convicted
felons and drug dealers. If you carry a weapon in Texas, you'll do
hard time in federal prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized the Clinton administration for what he called a
40 percent decline in federal prosecutions of gun offenses during
the past six years. But federal prosecutors from Texas joined the
governor and Cornyn to support their announcement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins of Dallas, a Clinton appointee, said
the new resources were ``tremendously needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hotline, the public awareness campaign will include
newspaper ads, bus posters and billboards carrying the message that
``Gun Crime Means Hard Time.'' That slogan was borrowed from the
city of Fort Worth, which even before last week's church shooting
had patterned a local program after the one in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cornyn said that Richmond, Va., had the second highest
murder rate in the nation in 1997, the year it began ``Project
Exile,'' an intensive effort to keep guns out of the hands of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the Richmond program, which is supported
by the NRA, more than 300 criminals have been convicted. The city's
murder rate has dropped by 33 percent, and its rate of violent
crime has decreased by almost 50 percent, Bush and Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   As he has before, Bush told reporters Tuesday that he supported
criminal background checks for gun purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, in the wake of fatal shootings at a high school in
Littleton, Colo., Bush said he supported requiring background
checks of people purchasing guns from unlicensed sellers at gun
shows. But he did not lobby the Texas Legislature for a gun show
bill, which was killed by a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the loophole should be closed in federal law.

LINGERIE AD ON BILLBOARD SPARKS MEXICAN DEBATE ON WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Anna Fusoni Ponthier, a television executive, was
driving home from work along one of Mexico City's major
thoroughfares in May when she saw a towering billboard photograph
of a blond model, clad only in bra and panties, promoting a line of
lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you move it like you shake it ...'' the advertisement said,
citing part of a vulgar adage popular in Mexican cantinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `How horrible!''' recalled Ms. Fusoni, who worked
for a time as an editor at Vogue magazine after her graduation from
Vassar in 1966. ``That's not funny, that's just gratuitous
aggression against women.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of nursing her anger quietly, Ms. Fusoni fired the first
shots in what has grown into Mexico's latest battle over sexuality
and women's rights. In letters to trade associations and
advertising groups, she complained that the campaign by the Vicky
Form lingerie company was sexist and degrading.
</P>
<P>
   Her letter-writing campaign led to an appearance on a television
talk show in July, and her criticisms set off a clamorous cultural
debate. Feminist groups criticized the Vicky Form billboards,
saying they were incitements to rape. A Mexico City government
agency that works to provide legal and other aid for women
collected thousands of signatures on a protest petition.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the federal prosecutor for consumer affairs ordered the
company to clean up the advertisement and threatened to impose
heavy fines. The company agreed to paint a dramatic black X over
the slogan that Ms. Fusoni saw and on others on its billboards here
and in 10 other Mexican cities.
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Cervantes, the advertising executive responsible for the
campaign, said the blacked-out slogans would serve to protest what
he called an attack on free expression.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards all feature photographs of a model in underwear
and a popular aphorism suggesting some sexual interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the safe is left open, even an honest man will steal,''
reads one advertisement, showing Ignacia Esnal, an Argentine model,
seated in lingerie with her legs spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bird in the hand is worth ...'' reads another slogan,
alongside a photo of another Argentine model, Jackie Fedete,
beckoning consumers with a come-hither gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after receiving a May 17 letter of complaint from Ms.
Fusoni, the Council for Self-Regulation and Ethics in Advertising,
a private sector group, wrote urging Vicky Form to tone down its
advertising, saying the language used ``denigrates and offends
women, as well as men and children.'' The company responded by
eliminating two billboards that had been criticized as especially
obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear attack on free expression,'' Cervantes said in
an interview. The government's threat to impose fines, he said,
resulted from a campaign by a wealthy elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built this advertising campaign on folk expressions that
are an accumulation of popular wisdom,'' Cervantes said. ``Most of
our critics are cultural retrogrades who are out of step with the
tastes of the Mexican masses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign has worked well,'' he added, noting that the
billboards, along with a similar campaign last year, had helped to
quintuple Vicky Form's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Several diners, passing Cervantes' table and seeing several
poster-sized photographs of the Vicky Form billboards piled on a
chair, stopped to offer opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're enchanting!'' gushed a paunchy man who identified
himself as a merchant but declined to offer his name.
</P>
<P>
   Cervantes, inspired by the show of support, called out,
``They're Argentine models!''
</P>
<P>
   Araceli Ibarra Granjales, a hospital administrator, gazed at the
posters for a time, a finger at the corner of her mouth, before
concluding, ``I think they're in good taste.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mexico City government disagreed. The city, run by the
Party of the Democratic Revolution, a leftist coalition of former
socialists and Communists, waded into the controversy after it came
to the attention of officials at Promujer (For Women), a
300-employee municipal agency that works to promote self-esteem and
business opportunities and offers legal counseling to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sell its lingerie, Vicky Form offers us female models in
positions that together with slogans or sayings present them as
merchandise offered to men, which is offensive to us women,'' says
the petition that Promujer employees are encouraging city residents
to sign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The petition drive has invited comparison to a 1996 campaign in
which billboards advertising Wonderbra brassieres came under attack
from the National Action Party, which has roots in the Roman
Catholic Church, as violations of public decency.
</P>
<P>
   The Wonderbra billboards displayed a woman with a sumptuous
bosom wearing a satin brassiere and saying, ``I'm sorry, I just
can't hide it.'' After municipal governments in several cities
governed by National Action put pressure on Wonderbra to remove the
billboards, several prominent leftists criticized the center-right
party as intolerant and prudishly moralistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please make clear that our criticisms of Vicky Form are not
based on moralism _ this is different,'' Gabriela Delgado
Ballesteros, a psychology professor and Party of the Democratic
Revolution activist who is Promujer's general coordinator, said in
an interview. ``In my opinion, the Wonderbra billboards were
excellent. They showed a woman who was proud of how she looked. But
the Vicky Form ads are just vulgar insults.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's petition drive aroused strong emotions in many women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get angry every time I see one of these billboards,'' said
Katia Gonzalez Romero, the coordinator of a municipal office in the
working-class Iztacalco district, who collected 300 signatures.
``When you're a woman in Mexico, you have to protect your body
every minute you're in the street or you'll be touched. And this
campaign just invites more sexual aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   With public clamor growing, the federal government stepped in.
An Interior Ministry official, the general coordinator of the
national commission for women, began to exert pressure on the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The federal prosecutor for consumer affairs filed suit against
Vicky Form, arguing that the billboards were deceptive to
consumers. Vicky Form surrendered, agreeing to cover the slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fusoni said she had been hoping the industry would police
itself and was not entirely comfortable with the government's
decision to suppress the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is certain,'' she said. ``This shows that women's
complaints are beginning to have real political weight.''

VISIT BY U.S. JEWS LEADS GERMAN TOWNSPEOPLE TO CONFRONT NAZI PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Atonement, of a deep and fragile kind, stirred in
a rural Bavarian town of Unsleben this summer, where the fairy-tale
castle, red-tiled roofs and rolling farmland hide the sins of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the synagogue, abandoned when Unsleben's 150 Jews fled
Nazi genocide in the late 1930s, reportedly became a stable, then
grange, and now, the town hall. The granary where Ludwig Nauman
processed grain for the local farmers also has been absorbed by the
town government building. The Nauman homestead, where Ludwig and
Hilde Nauman's son, Fred, played so many decades ago with his
beloved dog Orpal, is remodeled, the family name erased from its
outer wall. Someone else lives there now.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Nauman of Ballston Lake, N.Y. and 40 members of his
extended family in early July traveled to Unsleben, in this
famously picturesque part of Germany, at the invitation of resident
Angela Bungert, who forced Unsleben to confront its past.
</P>
<P>
   The trip did not spur an overwrought epiphany in Nauman, now 69,
who has vague boyhood memories of a traumatic immigration to
America. Rather, he and other relatives describe the return to
Unsleben as a simple affirmation of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we discovered is that people are not uniformly bad or
good,'' he said, ``that even though this society allowed these
horrors to happen, the descendants of those people are interested
in putting this shame behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though it's not their personal shame, it's a national shame.
And they do want to reach out.''
</P>
<P>
   The key German host, Bungert, a journalist and public relations
specialist, in a message to Nauman, had spoken of the unease
stirred among some Unslebeners about the return of their former
Jewish neighbors: ``Some people here are afraid. This box they
don't want to open. But it will be very good to have you here in
Unsleben.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, days before Yom Kippur, the most solemn day of the
Jewish religious year, marking repentance and soul-seaching, Nauman
described the journey back to Unsleben.
</P>
<P>
   It all began last year, when Nauman, secretary treasurer of New
York State United Teachers, who is also an avid genealogist, was
seeking family records. He contacted Bungert through an unfinished
Web site on Unsleben. She soon raised the prospect of a visit, and
Nauman and his older sisters, Lottie Hess and Ruth Derison, rallied
relatives from as far away as Israel and France.
</P>
<P>
   Then this summer they returned to a place many had fled some 61
summers before, in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   By that year, Hitler's laws restricting the rights of Jews had
crippled the population. Because Jews were forbidden to trade with
Gentiles, Ludwig Nauman's grain business all but stopped. Sponsored
by family in the United States, he had immigrated to New York City
the previous year to get a job and later retrieve his family.
</P>
<P>
   Within 18 months, according to Nauman, nearly all of Unsleben's
150 Jews, a thriving community of bakers, teachers and factory
owners, were gone. On Nov. 9 and 10 of that year, Nazis initiated
what is considered the first act of widespread aggression of the
Holocaust. Now referred to as Kristallnacht, ``the night of
shattered glass,'' the pogrom was responsible for the murder of 91
Jews, the imprisonment of thousands and the destruction of
synagogues, cemeteries and businesses throughout Germany and
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Bavaria was a stronghold of the Nazi party. In Munich, Hitler
established the party's administrative complex and his racial
Nuremberg Laws were born there on Sept. 15, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe what saved us was the fact that it got bad early enough
for us to get out,'' said Nauman. Today, he comments with some
irony about his strong attachment to Orpal, the shepherd dog he
left behind and whose absence left a more indelible mark than his
father's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have had to get rid of him anyway if we didn't leave,
because Jews were not allowed to have thoroughbred animals.'' To
the 8-year-old, boarding the SS Manhattan bound for South Ferry in
New York, was a ``great adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred saw his first motion picture and had his first taste of
chewing gum, which he now believes was taffy. But his sister Ruth,
just a year older, in a recent family newsletter, wrote of
terrifying memories. ``People I remembered so were beaten up, or
worse, sent to concentration camps to die. I still see myself as a
little girl, drapes tightly drawn, hearing Nazis passing by ... ''
</P>
<P>
   That Fred Nauman has so few memories is now significant. His
parents had effectively smoothed what had to have been a worrisome
passage to America. ``Many years later, I finally realized how
brave it must have been for my father ... to just pick up and go
somewhere else, with the whole family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, too, his parents spoke of the betrayal they felt, in an
atmosphere in which Gentile friends did little to help their
oppressed neighbors. A rural middle-class couple, the Naumans lost
everything. Ludwig Nauman, who did not speak English, had to begin
life in New York stocking shelves at S. Klein, the department store
at Union Square. Typical of many immigrants, he insisted that his
children speak English at home. The Naumans, too, would host other
arriving relatives in their Queens home.
</P>
<P>
   The Nauman relatives' return to Germany reads, in family
newsletters, much like a VIP tour: a concert in the family's honor,
a visit to the town castle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was trepidation, worry about being received with
hostility by some townspeople. It didn't happen. ``The atmosphere
surprised all of us, on just how positive it was. We were expecting
at least some significant resentment. I'm sure it was there
somehow, but it didn't manifest itself.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, what was then West Germany began a program of
reparations. The government reinstituted his father's veterans
pension and his mother's social security and gave each of the
Nauman children about $2,000 because they'd been denied public
schooling. Now, the Nauman family is uninterested in pursuing
further reparations or claims to property, feeling that it would
raise the potential for some anti-Semitic sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   A German newspaper, Sueddeutsche Zeitungticle, also pointed out
a fervent desire by some townspeople to tell the truth about the
disppearance of Unsleben's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The article described how one woman, in her 90s, doggedly made
sure she dictated the name of every Jewish resident she could
remember before she died. Most were able to escape to far-flung
destinations including Cuba and South America, but 16 people were
deported to concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The Naumans did not lose immediate relatives, but some of those
who were deported and died were distantly related, he said.Nauman
said his family was not looking for a direct apology from their
hosts, many of whom were not born until after the war.
``Philosophically I don't blame the children for the sins of the
parents,'' he said.

CLINTON SAYS US CAN'T BE LONE WORLD POLICEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Narrowing America's guideposts on when and
where it should intervene in the world's burgeoning humanitarian
crises, President Clinton told the UN General Assembly Tuesday that
stopping mass killing required a shared responsibility and that the
United States couldn't do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some are troubled that the United States and others
cannot respond to every humanitarian catastrophe in the world,''
said a hoarse Clinton, struggling to speak. ``We cannot do
everything, everywhere. But just because we have different
interests in different parts of the world does not mean we can be
indifferent to the destruction of innocents in any part of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments _ his seventh annual speech to the General
Assembly _ came against a backdrop of criticism of the United
States' varying responses to humanitarian tragedies around the
world and followed by a day a call by Secretary-General Kofi Annan
for the UN Security Council to take the lead role in humanitarian
interventions.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last 16 months Clinton had seemed to indicate that
the United States would take a more active role in stopping mass
killing. In Rwanda, on the fourth anniversary of the genocide that
killed a half-million people, he pledged the United States would
``never again'' stand aside and do nothing if it had evidence of
mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   And in Macedonia after the end of the Kosovo war, he told NATO
troops in Macedonia, ``If somebody comes after innocent civilians
and tries to kill them en masse because of their race, their ethnic
background or their religion, and it's within our power to stop it,
we will stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who remains stung by the failed 1993 peacekeeping
mission in Somalia that ended in retreat, Tuesday tried to lower
expectations of future US role in stopping conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should work to end violence. (But) that does not mean our
response in every case can or should be the same. Sometimes,
collective military force is both appropriate and feasible.
Sometimes, concerted economic and political pressure combined with
diplomacy is a better answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also offered two other ``resolutions'' for the United
Nations in coming years: that it should battle global poverty more
effectively and work toward ending the threat posed by weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   He made only passing reference to the US debt to the United
Nations, which some estimates say approaches $1.7 billion, pledging
he will try to get Congress to pass legislation authorizing the
payment.
</P>
<P>
   His most closely followed portion of the speech, though, was on
principles of intervention, an issue which has become the talk of
the United Nations in the first week of its 54th annual session.
Annan also said rogue states should not expect that their borders
will protect them if they commit atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took issue with Annan's belief that the Security Council
act as the world's sole arbitrer of humanitarian tragedies. The
United States and its 18 NATO allies sidestepped the Security
Council before bombing Serbia because it didn't want to be
embarrassed by Russian and Chinese vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   On taking action in the Kosovo war, Clinton said, ``Had we
chosen to do nothing in the face of this brutality, I do not
believe we would have strengthened the UN. We would have risked
discrediting the UN. By acting as we did, we helped to vindicate
the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, and to give the
United Nations the opportunity it now has to play the central role
in shaping Kosovo's future.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
applauded Annan's efforts to raise the issue, but said Annan's
ideas contained ``a fatal flaw. The UN is not a self-selecting
institution. The major powers consist of Russia, France, China, the
US and the UK. If we are going to put his words into practice, the
United Nations has got to overcome the divisiveness of the major
powers in order to respond to big crises.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, said Clinton, the world's reaction to slaughters ``will
depend on the capacity of countries to act and on their national
interests. NATO acted in Kosovo, for example, top stop a vicious
campaign of ethnic cleansing in a place where we had important
interests at stake and the ability to act effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same considerations brought Nigerian troops and their
partners to Sierra Leone and Australians and others to East
Timor,'' Clinton said. ``And that is proper _ so long as we work
together and support each other, so long as we don't collectively
abdicate responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent only eight hours in New York and met with at
least seven heads of state (Portugal, Argentina, Slovakia, South
Africa, Colombia, Tanzania and Venezuela) also raised multiple
questions in his speech on how the world would respond to the most
pressing problems in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   He rattled off an alarming set of statistics on the world's
widening gap between rich and poor: 1.3 billion people live on less
than a $1 a day; a person in South Asia is almost 700 times less
likely to use the Internet than a person in the United States; 40
million people die every year of hunger, a toll almost as high as
all those killed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton: ``We must refuse to accept a future in which one
part of humanity lives at the cutting edge of a new economy, while
another lives at the edge of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   His solutions: keep markets open; reduce debt of countries
struggling to rise; try to reverse global climate change because it
devastates agriculture and accelerates the spread of disease; and
provide better health care.
</P>
<P>
   And then he gave more depressing numbers: AIDS is expected to
kill more people and orphan more children in Africa over the next
10 years than all the wars of the 20th Century combined; and only 2
percent of all global biomedical research is devoted to the major
killers of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged another $100 million to fight the AIDS epidemic
in Africa, and said he will convene a special White House meeting
to strengthen incentives for research and development toward
vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and other diseases. Among
those invited will be public health experts, pharmaceutical company
CEOs, foundation representatives and members of Congress.

 &HT;    SAFETY BOARD SNUBS SEAT BELTS IN SCHOOL BUSES
 &HT;    EDS: Changes number of deaths from four to nine in 9th graf
 &HT;    430&AMP;add
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seat belts might not help your children on school
buses, and might even hurt them if the belts are installed before
the seats are redesigned, the National Transportation Safety Board
decided Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seats are not designed for seat belts. That's the bottom
line,'' said Jim Hall, chairman of the influential advisory board,
after the board was briefed by its staff on computer simulations of
school-bus crashes with and without seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   New York and New Jersey have required seat belts in new school
buses for eight years. Florida and Louisiana passed such laws this
year, and a similar bill in California is awaiting the governor's
decision on whether to sign it into law. The other states don't
have seat-belt rules for full-size school buses.
</P>
<P>
   With or without seat belts, today's school buses fail to offer
children enough protection when they are sideswiped or roll over,
the safety board concluded. The five-member board voted unanimously
to recommend that the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration (NHTSA) develop better crash-safety standards for
school buses within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take the board's recommendations seriously, because
they've been working on them for a long time,'' said NHTSA
spokesman Tim Hurd. ``We are right in the middle of a two-year
study of school buses, including whether there is a better way to
protect the occupants.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hall noted that some of his board's recommendations for
safety improvements for the big tour buses known as motor coaches
have been pending at NHTSA since the early 1970's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's frustrating,'' Hall said. He said he had one
consolation about how long it takes to change federal bus rules:
``The big yellow school bus remains by far the safest way for
children to go to and from school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just blowing smoke,'' responded Alan J. Ross, president
of the National Coalition for School Bus Safety, which favors seat
belt requirements. ``They had 50,000 accidents last year in a fleet
of 500,000 buses. Most were minor, but ... if your kid rides a bus
twice a day for twelve years, your kid has a good chance of being
in an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In an average year, 24 million children ride on school buses,
but only nine die in accidents while riding in a bus. Injury rates,
though obviously higher, are unknown, because local, state and
federal data are fragmented and unreliable, the safety board said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the board voted Tuesday for more study, rather than a quick
change in existing rules, lobbyists for the bus industry and state
school-bus bureaucracies congratulated one another, while
representatives of seat-belt makers looked glum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I heard the board say is that there must be a way to make
a school bus a safer vehicle, although at this time we need more
research to make that happen,'' said Mike Martin of the National
Association for Pupil Transportation. ``Everybody should support
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Murphy, chief executive officer of Busbelts (cq)
Development Corp. of Norwood, Mass., which makes school-bus
restraints, said, ``We have some questions about the validity of
the research, and we're going to re-examine the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations adopted two decades ago require that
school-bus seats consist of a flat pan with a cushion covered with
a slippery fireproof material, and attached to a high, flexible
back padded on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of such seats, placed close together, protect seated
children if a bus is hit from the front or rear, according to the
board's safety engineers. But they told the board that if a truck
rams a bus from the side or sideswipes it, the children in the bus,
whether or not they are wearing seat belts, can slide sideways on
the flat seats and hit the inside of a bus or fly out a window or
door.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers said that vans, light trucks or cars are safer
with seat belts, because their curved, bucket-type seats _
especially in conjunction with light-thrust air bags _ help prevent
that. The staff also said that seat belts work better in short
vehicles than in long buses, in which someone seated at the rear
can suddenly accelerate by 25 miles per hour in less than a second
if the bus starts to spin.
</P>
<P>
   The bus safety coalition disputes that analysis. Ross said,
``Smaller school buses have the same kind of seats as the big ones,
and they have been using seat belts with good results for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules would have to be changed in order to legalize
major design changes in school buses, so competition between
manufacturers in the next few years is not expected to take the
form of a race to be the first in offering safer designs.
</P>
<P>
   In another decision Tuesday, the safety board recommended that
NHTSA combat the problem of passengers being thrown out the windows
during crashes of the large tour buses by speeding up its research
into new flexible, plasticized glass for windows. To minimize the
crushing of passengers during rollovers, the board said NHTSA
should adopt tougher roof standards for new school buses and tour
buses within two years.

NO EARLY ACCORD ON IRAQ ISSUE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Hopes faded on Tuesday that the Security
Council could agree this week on a new approach to Iraq, with the
United States and Russia still far apart on how to monitor Iraqi
weapons programs and on when _ or if _ to begin lifting sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   American and British officials said on Tuesday that meetings
would continue this week to explore compromises on outstanding
issues like how to measure Iraqi cooperation and how much control
the United Nations would have over money Iraq would earn if
sanctions were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   But a high-level meeting tentatively planned for Friday is not
likely to be held, diplomats said. The foreign ministers of the
permanent council members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States _ are all in New York this week for the General
Assembly's annual debate.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has repeatedly said that it would not consider any plan
that did not lift sanctions. And the only surveillance the Iraqis
are likely to accept would be nonintrusive monitoring without the
short-notice or challenge-type inspections that characterized the
work of the weapons-monitoring program by a U.N. special commission
that was set up after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections were to have been the key to lifting sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no U.N. inspections in Iraq since last December,
when inspectors were withdrawn in advance of punitive air strikes
by Britain and the United States, and President Saddam Hussein
barred them from returning. But even before that, months of Iraqi
interference had made the work of the special commission, which had
been disarming Iraq since 1991, largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Without inspectors in Iraq, it is difficult if not impossible to
know whether Saddam has renewed prohibited weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The French say that this is reason enough to end the stalling
over a new inspection system. Diplomats said on Tuesday that France
had suggested the early adoption of a ``statement of principles''
on Iraq, as an interim measure.
</P>
<P>
   An American official said Tuesday that the stalemate on Iraq had
been discussed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia over dinner on Monday. The official
said that Albright had emphasized that the United States opposes
any changes in sanctions rules until the Iraqis demonstrate
compliance with arms inspections. Americans say that they have
taken a significant step even in talking about adjusting sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. recognizes the value of re-establishing the consensus
that was lost,'' on Iraqi policy, a Western diplomat said on
Tuesday. In his speech to the General Assembly, Ivanov mentioned
the Iraqi impasse as one of the causes of a more general decline in
the authority of the Security Council.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russia is prepared to ease sanctions without waiting for
progress in inspections and indeed would use a suspension of the
embargo as an incentive to the Iraqis to comply with inspectors.
The Russians, who attacked the special commission and its former
chairman, Richard Butler, in the Security Council earlier this
year, contend that there may be nothing left to find in Iraq and
that to make successful inspections the trigger for sanctions is
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   France has fallen somewhere in between these two positions, and
diplomats on the council say that they hope that the French may
eventually agree to a British-Dutch proposal that seems to have a
majority of council members behind it.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal would permit Iraq to export goods, including oil,
after Iraq met certain requirements, but it would stop short of
allowing Iraq a free hand in importing goods. There is ample
evidence that Iraq may have used imports in the past to obtain
missing pieces in its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here say that it seems clear in retrospect that the
United States lost interest in pressing the inspection issue almost
two years ago, when the Clinton administration first began to shift
its policy from fighting for inspections to keeping sanctions in
place and using air strikes from time to time while actively
supporting Iraqi opposition figures. On Monday, Albright met with
opposition leaders from Europe, the Middle East and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the spring of 1998, the United States has not pressed in
the council for effective arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the United States was backing away, Russia,
France and to some extent China _ all of which have commercial or
financial interests in Iraq _ were urging that sanctions be lifted.
These countries have contended that the inspection system has come
to the end of its usefulness and that Iraqi civilians are suffering
from the embargo.

JOSEPH P. MASTRANGELO, 77; WAS WASHINGTON POST FEATURE WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph P. Mastrangelo, a Boston native who began a newspaper
career inking drawings for Walt Kelly's comic strip ``Pogo'' and
who later became a feature writer for the Washington Post, died
Saturday (Sept. 18) of a heart ailment at his home in Washington,
D.C. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mastrangelo was the quintessential `newspaperman' of the
old school,'' the Washington Post noted in its obituary.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper stories often praised for warmth and wit, Mr.
Mastrangelo sometimes recalled his youth as one of 12 children
growing up in three-deckers in and around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If the written word became Mr. Mastrangelo's forte, art was his
first love. He married an artist, and his two children are artists,
Susan Mastrangelo of New York and Ann Mastrangelo of Brookline,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Mr. Mastrangelo learned the fine points of curve and
color from an older brother who, under the name of Charles Martin,
gained fame for paintings that regularly graced the cover of The
New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mastrangelo's artistic ambitions were interrupted by
World War II. The day after Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the
Merchant Marine, and promptly had a ship torpedoed out from under
him. Preferring to be on the shooting end of torpedoes, he arranged
a transfer to the Navy's submarine service.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Mr. Mastrangelo came to New York, where his skill
at drawing maps and inking comic strips landed him jobs at PM, the
New York Herald Tribune, and the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   It was his skill as a cartographer that brought him to the
Washington Post, and he spent much of the 1960s and early '70s
drawing maps that accompanied Post reports on the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mr. Mastrangelo could tell funny stories, colleagues
urged him to moonlight as a writer, and soon the one-time mapmaker
was writing a humor column called ``Out &AMP; About.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include two daughters, two sisters, a brother, and two
grandchildren.

BRISK `WEST WING' SHOWS A BUSY, DIGNIFIED PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A TV series about the White House isn't supposed to move. It's
supposed to sit down ponderously and tend to national business.
</P>
<P>
   It figures to be eye-glazingly dull, because when TV types get
close to important things, real things, it converts them into
oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, NBC proves expectations wrong. It's all in the
execution. The White House of ``The West Wing'' is a jumping place.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, it's a little like ``ER.'' You half expect
the Prez (Martin Sheen) to order up a couple cc's of FEMA funds in
a frantic ploy to save a stricken patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' producer John Wells, one of the three co-executive
producers of ``The West Wing,'' might account for the swirling
sense of busyness in the presidential business.
</P>
<P>
   Check those tracking shots as chief of staff Leo McGarry (John
Spencer) arrives at work early in the show. On the way to his
office, wearing his raincoat, he's seemingly accomplished more than
some executives do in a full day.
</P>
<P>
   After all, 1,200 Cubans are bobbing on rafts en route to Miami.
The president, Josiah Bartlet (this fictional president is supposed
to be descended from one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence), has just injured himself riding a bicycle into a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   And more. A powerful senator is thinking about challenging for
the presidency. Deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford)
has enraged the Christian right with his remarks on a TV chat show.
</P>
<P>
   Then too, McGarry is in a huff because he's sure the name
Khadafy has been misspelled in the New York Times crossword puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   If the show's hectic pacing is ``ER''-ish, there's an even
heavier infusion of another producer, Aaron Sorkin, in Wednesday
night's pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin (``Sports Night,'' ``A Few Good Men'') displayed a knack
for capturing the modern presidential aura in the 1995 film ``The
American President,'' in which Michael Douglas played the president
and Sheen played the chief of staff. That film was a pre-Monica
romantic comedy in which Sorkin's script was moderately reverential
in conjuring a vaguely liberal, feel-good executive mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin wrote the script for Wednesday's ``West Wing,'' and he's
duplicated his feat. It's as if Monica Lewinsky never passed
through the Oval Office on her fateful path toward Bill Clinton's
zipper.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin has made Josiah Bartlet a Democrat, and a former
governor, like Clinton. But at first blush, at least, Bartlet isn't
someone who'd take a sexual interest in a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen makes his appearance late in the show, supported by
crutches from his bicycle mishap. He snuffs out some staff
nonsense, spouts a few homilies involving his granddaughter, waxes
idealistic about the Cuban boat people and reminds everyone that
playtime had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen is a good choice, authoritative and yet still folksy and
approachable. He does seem a bit manic at first, though. There's
something weird about him; I think it's the dentures.
</P>
<P>
   (As for the show's first lady, she does exist, at least on
paper. Her name is Abby, but she doesn't turn up in the first
episode and apparently won't be seen for several weeks, at least.)
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sorkin's obvious respect for the dignity of the
office works intentionally as a kind of balm for viewers who'd
welcome a fresh gust of decency, even fictional decency, from 1600
Pennsylvania Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's a certain amount of wish fulfillment here,''
Sorkin said in a recent interview. ``Maybe we'll be excited to look
at the White House the way we wish it was a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not that ``The West Wing'' is altogether Capra-esque. There's a
budding story line, for example, involving Rob Lowe as deputy
communications director Sam Seaborn. He's spent a night with a call
girl. He didn't know she was a call girl, but there's a scandal
brewing if Sorkin wants a cup of it.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble cast also includes Allison Janney (``American
Beauty'') as press secretary C.J. Gregg, Richard Schiff as
communications director Toby Ziegler and Moira Kelly (``To Have and
to Hold'') as political consultant Madeline Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exceptional cast, in a brisk, smart, satisfyingly
dramatic take on life in America's most auspicious workplace. Score
one for NBC; ``The West Wing'' figures to be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Which is more than can be said for another Wednesday show,
ABC's ``Oh Grow Up,'' a horrendous sitcom about three guys sharing
a house in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Make that three guys and a talking dog called Mom. It speaks in
subtitles. ``Arf, arf'' means ``Get a room.'' Laugh? Really, I
thought I'd die.
</P>
<P>
   The guys are Hunter (Stephen Dunham), a skirt chaser; Norris
(David Alan Basche), an aspiring artist; and Ford (John Ducey),
who's just declared that he's gay and left his wife (Rena Sofer).
</P>
<P>
   The unbelievable aspect of this forgettable comedy is that it's
created by Alan Ball, who wrote the much-praised script for
``American Beauty.'' It's a fact, and a head-scratcher.

   FIENNES-FILMS (Toronto) _ The ten-day Toronto International Film

bleary from a day's worth of questions about ``Sunshine'' _ a
Hungarian generational epic from director Istvan Szabo in which
Ralph Fiennes plays three roles _ the actor was collecting his

   EVE-ENSLER-THEATER (New York) _ If you'd never seen Eve Ensler's
one-woman show ``The Vagina Monologues'' and if you knew she had
also written plays about Bosnian refugees, women in prison and
nuclear war, you might expect her to be humorless, single-minded,
even didactic. But to step into Ms. Ensler's apartment in Chelsea
is to confront a positively bubbly figure. Ms. Ensler, 46, good
humor masks a serious purpose and a troubled personal history that
gave rise to ``The Vagina Monologues,'' which began its second New
York run last Tuesday (in previews at the Westside Theater). The
monologues are part of Ms. Ensler's crusade to wipe out the shame
and embarrassment that many women still associate with their bodies
or their sexuality. By Dinitia Smith. Photo.

   UPSIDE-DOWN-DANCE (New York) _ To the propulsive beat of the
Nigerian composer Fela Anikulapo Kuti's music, the choreographer
Ronald K. Brown led his 12 sinuous dancers across the floor in
fast, rhythmic movements, each stride increasing the tension in the
studio. Just five minutes into ``Upside Down,'' Brown had already
reached a wrenchingly emotional place. It is a place he fruitfully
visits often. ``Upside Down,'' a section from a larger work, the
1998 ``Destiny,'' illustrates the enormous effort and energy it
takes to move toward inner peace in a chaotic world. When Brown's
aptly named company, Evidence, begins its one-week engagement at
the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, it will present ``Upside Down'' as
well as two other Brown works; Ebony Magazine'' and ``Water.'' By

   BROOKLYN-PHILHARMONIC (New York) _ For their season that opens
on Friday, Robert Spano and the Brooklyn Philharmonic have put
together a set of programs to survey the 20th century at its end.
This is a 20th-century season in two ways: not only does all the
music come from the last hundred years, but the planning has a very
20th-century feel. Spano and his orchestra are concerned less with
great composers than with great themes _ war, politics, pop
culture, the environment, faith _ and there is no attempt to make
sure that all the outstanding creative personalities will be
represented. By Paul Griffiths. Photo.

<P>
   VIENNA-PHILHARMONIC (Seewalchen Amattersee, Austria) _ Yes, 1999
is a Johann Strauss year, filled with commemorations of the
composer's death 100 years ago. And yes, it ends in the turning not
only of the century but also of the millennium. Yet when the Vienna
Philharmonic performs Strauss waltzes on New Year's Eve and New
Year's Day in the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna and on worldwide
television, it will be conducting business more or less as usual.

   CHRIS-GAINES-ALBUM (Undated) _ Whether it is a testament to
cowardice, marketing or megalomania, ``Chris Gaines'' is a gutsy
undertaking, not only as an attempt by an outsider to fit into
another genre but also as a greatest hits album that tries to fit
into each phase of that genre's recent history. Gaines may be a
pseudonym _ complete with an elaborate invented background that
incorporates bits of Dylan, Beatles and Prince lore and parallels
elements of Garth Brooks' life (the solo careers of both begin in
1989, and both have the same number of letters in their first and
last names). But Chris Gaines is very much Garth Brooks, who has
described himself as a melting pot of the past. By Neil Strauss.

   MONROE-PIANO-SALE (New York) _ As grand pianos go, the one going
on the block at Christie's this month is nothing special.
Paderewski did not play it. Neither did Liberace, though he would
have swooned over its fondant-white finish and maybe added some
stylistic flourishes of his own. And as far as Christie's knows, no
one but Marilyn Monroe, its last owner, ever tickled its ivories,
though it is possible that Frank Sinatra, a Monroe beau, might have
plunked out a tune or two. The baby grand piano is a centerpiece of

   MARILYN-PERFUME (Los Angeles) _ Over the last couple of years,
the estate of Marilyn Monroe has not been kind to the goddess whose

lingerie. The 50s-style underwear was hawked at department stores.
Now comes an estate-approved perfume called Marilyn, from
International Flavors and Fragrances, the company that has
recreated the essence of Elizabeth Taylor, Victoria Principal and
Christie Brinkley. This takes the concept of celebrity perfume to a
new level: the notion of smelling like a famous dead person _ even
Marilyn Monroe _ is at best an odd one. By Deanne Stillman.

   BIBLE-ART (Hatfield, Mass.) _ Putting pictures to words is Barry
Moser's profession, but never has the challenge been greater than

revered and surely most contested text in our culture, but it is
one already firmly fixed in our collective minds by religious
inclination and by the countless artists who have already left
their mark. Moser, while keenly aware of those precedents and
preconceptions, has approached this daunting project by returning
to the words themselves to confront familiar stories as if for the

BARAK VISIT TO BERLIN IS `CHARGED WITH SYMBOLISM' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Accompanied by survivors of a Nazi concentration camp,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel arrived in Berlin Tuesday on
the first state visit to the German capital since the government
moved here last month.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is charged with symbolism. For the German government,
back in Berlin 54 years after the collapse of Hitler's Reich,
Barak's presence is welcome evidence of the democratic credentials
of the new ``Berlin Republic.'' For the Israeli government, it is a
demonstration of good will to a country that has become an
important ally.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he was born in 1942, the same year that ``not far
from here, the final solution was decided'' by the Nazis, Barak
said his visit to Berlin stirred ``deep emotions.'' The plan for
the annihilation of European Jews was put into force on Jan. 20,
1942, at a meeting in Wannsee in what are now the southwestern
suburbs of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister, on his first trip to Europe since taking
office in July, added that his presence was evidence of the close
ties now linking ``the new, democratic Germany and the the state of
Israel that emerged from the ashes of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the move to Berlin, the German government of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder has been trying to strike a balance between a new
assertiveness _ the chancellor described Germany this month as ``a
great power in Europe'' _ and expressions of commitment to the
values of the postwar Bonn Republic.
</P>
<P>
   This tone was evident again Tuesday. Schroeder said that times
had changed and the ``generation of the perpetrators'' was no
longer in power. But he added that the Holocaust was an event that
``every generation has the duty to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders spoke in the former council of state of the East
German leader Erich Honecker, which has become the temporary
chancellery of Schroeder pending the completion of a new building.
They stood beneath stained-glass images of worker-heroes bearing a
message that Communist doctrine would bring well-being to all
mankind.
</P>
<P>
   This bizarre setting was further evidence _ if any was needed _
of Berlin's turbulent history. As a result of this past, Barak was
greeted without any elaborate ceremony: No German or Israeli flags
fluttered in the Tiergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming, the Israeli leader had offered the endorsement
for the government's move that Schroeder has clearly sought. In an
interview published in this week's edition of Der Spiegel, Barak
said: ``I have no reservations about the move to Berlin. Despite
the evil that emanated from there, we respect the decision of the
German people that Berlin once again become its capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has chosen to make memory a central theme of his two-day
stay, declining a meeting with German business leaders in favor of
a visit Wednesday to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, just
north of Berlin, where over 200,000 prisoners were held between
1939 and 1945. About half of them were killed or worked to death.
</P>
<P>
   A few survivors of the camp and their grandchildren arrived here
with Barak on Tuesday. One, Eli Carmel, 82, said, ``This means the
circle is closing, the circle of having been a homeless, stateless
Jew incarcerated, and to come back with the prime minister of our
Jewish state.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews formed a relatively small proportion of those held in
Sachsenhausen. The prisoners included many Communists, Social
Democrats, members of labor unions and others viewed as enemies of
the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Tuesday in Bild Zeitung, Barak said
the visit to the camp was a ``moral necessity.'' Certainly, it will
focus attention on strained talks on compensation from German
corporations for slave laborers and others put to work by the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have stalled over money, with tens of billions of
dollars separating the companies' offer and the demands of lawyers
representing the forced laborers. Barak said Tuesday that an
agreement was ``urgent because these people are already old.''
Schroeder said he hoped for a settlement by the end of the year _
several months after the deadline of Sept. 1 that he originally
set.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing an honor guard of German soldiers at the
chancellery, and listening to the national anthems of the two
countries, Schroeder and Barak held talks that focused chiefly on
the quest for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he believed a ``golden opportunity'' for the talks
existed in the coming year, and that Israel would leave ``no stone
unturned'' in seeking peace. He expressed confidence that a way
would be found to open talks with Syria so that a comprehensive
peace could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to make peace with Syria as well,'' Barak
said. After the visit to Sachsenhausen on Wednesday, he is to go on
to Paris for talks with President Jacques Chirac of France, who
recently met with the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara.

IN RESPONSE TO QUAKE, BEIJING OFFERS AID AND SYMPATHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Saying that the people of China and Taiwan are ``as
closely linked as flesh and blood,'' President Jiang Zemin of China
offered condolences and aid to Taiwan's earthquake victims on
Tuesday in a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catastrophe and agony of our Taiwan compatriots affect the
hearts of all Chinese,'' Jiang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   China's press on Tuesday evening carried similar messages of
sorrow and concern from several of the agencies dedicated to
relations with Taiwan, which China considers a lost province that
must be reunited with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The statements on Tuesday made no direct reference to Chinese
anger over the Taiwanese president's recent rejection of the
longstanding ``one China'' formula. President Lee Teng-hui's
assertion this summer that Taiwan and China must negotiate as two
separate states, seen here as a step toward declaring independence,
was answered with a barrage of warlike statements from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to questions on Tuesday, a Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman, Zhang Qiyue, repeated the customary reference to
Taiwan as a region of China, pressing the point by thanking foreign
countries that were sending aid to earthquake victims. She said
that the sovereignty dispute and the earthquake were ``two
different subjects'' and that China would not relent in its demand
for political unification.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's statement said: ``We are willing to provide all possible
assistance to reduce losses from the earthquake disaster.'' So far,
the only announcement of concrete assistance has come from the
Chinese Red Cross, which pledged to send $100,000 in cash and
$60,400 in relief materials. As of Tuesday night there have been no
calls for public donations, such as followed disastrous floods on
the mainland last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the national television news on Tuesday evening, the disaster
in Taiwan played second, after reports on Jiang's visit to a museum
exhibit celebrating the 50-year history of the People's Republic.
The government is mounting a huge celebration of the Oct. 1
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   In the news report on the earthquake, China Central Television
featured the statements of deep sympathy by Jiang and other leaders
and an announcement of the Red Cross aid.
</P>
<P>
   The television report also said that the State Council's Taiwan
Affairs office had sent an ``urgent circular'' to the Taiwan
Affairs offices in each province, calling on them to show concern
and sympathy for ``Taiwanese compatriots'' living or touring in
their localities. The provincial offices were also instructed to
assist any resident Taiwanese who wanted to return quickly to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political freeze, tens of thousands of Taiwanese
pursue business in China and it is also a popular tourist
destination for Taiwanese, many of whom have relatives on the
mainland.

 &HT;    Some animals displaced by flood reunited with owners
 &HT;    By David Blount
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ As floodwaters left by Hurricane Floyd began
rising, Dr. Bobby Sherwood jumped in a canoe and paid an an unusual
visit to his office at Riverside Veterinary Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   With 4 feet of water sloshing inside the clinic, Sherwood sprung
open the cages of animals kenneled at the facility. Next, he called
other boaters to help him rescue the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ben Turner said all but four animals were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost one client's Chihuahua,'' he said. ``We also lost
three cats we had taken in after they were abandoned. We managed to
get all of the other animals out.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Riverside, rescue attempts for the animals at the
Rocky Mount Animal Shelter were not as successful. Several smaller
dogs, two adult cats and six kittens were killed by floodwaters
before city workers could reach the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to save about 15 dogs and eight cats,'' said
Officer Don Cashwell, a shelter employee. ``We came in on boat on
Thursday and managed to get them out. The water was probably
waist-deep. We just didn't expect it to get so high.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashwell said most of the animals were frantic as workers began
hauling them out of the building. Many of the dogs were standing on
their hind legs to keep above the high water.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Jean Wood is sheltering the rescued animals at her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad we got here, but we are sorry we couldn't save
them all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Leonard, owner of Animal World, was less fortunate in her
rescue attempts. Leonard tried to find someone to take her to the
store last Wednesday and Thursday, but could not find an available
boat.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, she found someone with a personal watercraft
who was willing to brave the waters to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was 4 feet of water at that point outside the mall,''
Leonard said. ``Judging by the damage, I'd say the water got 6 or 7
feet deep in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   The water pressure was so great outside the door to the mall
that Leonard had to use a crow bar to pry open the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' she said. ``Everything was floating. It was
like being aboard the Titanic. There were dumpsters floating
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside Animal World, Leonard discovered most of her animals
had already drowned. The only survivors of the flood were a snake,
two cages of finches, a guinea pig, and one puppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one dog was a pug,'' Leonard said. ``The others were baby
poodles and baby Yorkshires, and they couldn't make it. This one
was three weeks older than the rest and was just a little taller.
He was able to tread water just a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, fittingly, has named the pooch Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided if were going to keep it, we should name it after
the storm,'' she said. ``We are keeping the animals at my son's
house until we can find another location for the store.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mall remains closed, Leonard is looking for a new
location for her shop. Her customers have remained loyal as well,
offering to clean up and do whatever is necessary to reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried from Thursday to Monday,'' Leonard said. ``I don't
know if I have any tears left. Those animals were pets that we
tried to find good homes for and we took care of. It is so hard to
see something that you've played with and handled and now it's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the 15 animals at the Rocky Mount Children's
Museum managed to survive the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, a 40-year-old alligator, Snarf, a 35-year-old python,
and Lizzy, a boa constrictor, are the only occupants left at the
mud-covered museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited that they made it,'' said Parks and Recreation
Director Pete Armstrong. ``Still, the workers at the museum were
devastated by the animals we did lose. We were scheduled to redo
the museum before the flood and now we just have a lot more to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he talked with FEMA officials and hoped funds
would be available for the damaged museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a branch that deals with art centers and museums,''
he said. ``They recognize the value these places add to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In another neighborhood, one pet owner was reunited with his
lost dog after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry G. Fish was evacuated from his home on Thursday
morning by boat, according to his daughter-in-law Ashley Fish,
leaving behind the family German shepherd, Duchess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way they could get her out the door,'' Ashley
Fish said. ``The current was too strong. ``You could hear her
barking and it was not a good sound. But the water was 4 or 5 feet
deep inside the house at that point. They (her in-laws) were taken
to my parents' house and were so sad about the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday afternoon, Dr. Fish's son, Don, was determined to
find Duchess and reunite the dog with her owner.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. that night, Ashley Fish received an excited phone call
from Louis Pulley, a family friend who said he had discovered the
missing dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought the dog over to Dr. Fish and everyone was so
elated,'' she said. ``It was very emotional for all of them. We
don't know how she got out. She would not put one toe in the water
before, but she learned how to swim quick and fast when she had to.
It was a bright spot in a dark day.''

span of one presidential cycle the role of Asian Americans in
national politics appears to have changed in fundamental ways.
After years as one of the most financially generous but
underrepresented ethnic minorities in American politics, many Asian
Americans are nursing deep wounds from what they regard as a string
of insulting scandals. And this time, they say, things will be
different. By James Sterngold. (Scheduled to move by 7:45 p.m. ET

   Senior royals are peeved at the &UR; Countess of Wessex &LR; , says a
Sunday Times of London report cited by reader  &UR; Julie Pinchin &LR; ,
because the former  &UR; Sophie Rhys-Jones  &LR;  has a money-making career.
According to the Times,  &UR; Sir Robin Janvrin &LR; , private secretary to
the queen, has been dispatched to tell the newest royal that she
must make a choice between her career and her role as a royal.
</P>
<P>
   When the countess posed for publicity photos with new Rover cars
after her PR firm won the Rover account, the queen was
``surprised,'' said the newspaper. In addition, the countess's
planned promotional tour for Rover in the United States has
 &UR; Prince &LR;   &UR; Charles &LR;  and  &UR; Princess Ann &LR;  ``aghast,'' said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Earl of Wessex  &LR; (formerly  &UR; Prince Edward &LR; ) recently sold a
U.S. television network a series on the life of the  &UR; Queen &LR; 
 &UR; Mother &LR; , his grandmother. She is refusing to cooperate, says the
Times.

<P>
   &UR; THE BIG QUESTION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Confusion is a necessary part of art, writes playwright  &UR; Tom &LR; 
 &UR; Stoppard &LR;  in the New York Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   Citing great 20th century plays _ ``Waiting for Godot'' and
``The Birthday Party'' _ Stoppard says they each ``broke a
contract, which up to that era had been thought to exist between a
play and its audience.'' Before those plays, it seemed ``that if
you could be bothered to show up to watch something up there, then
the thing up there had certain obligations toward you, such as the
obligation to give you the minimum information you needed to make
sense of the whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The best plays can leave the audience somewhat frustrated,
writes Stoppard. ``Art which stays new, in  &UR; Ezra Pound &LR; 's phrase,
is art in which the question `what does it mean?' has no correct
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHALLENGE TO A BAY AREA DUEL? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Howard Junker &LR; , editor of the Bay Area literary magazine
Zyzzyva, has drawn a playful (to give him the benefit of a doubt)
sword on  &UR; Wendy Lesser &LR; , editor of the Bay Area literary magazine
the Threepenny Review. They're ``hardly rivals,'' writes Junker in
his latest issue, because Lesser's model is the New York Review of
Books; his is the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   But several points must be made: In 1980, when he worked at the
University Art Museum, she declined his offer of using some of its
art in her magazine. Also, in 1991, she rejected a piece he had
submitted. Then, he recalls a softball game years ago between the
two journals, when poet  &UR; Robert Pinsky &LR; , playing for the Review,
crashed into him on purpose at second base. ``I was so shocked
...'' writes the editor, ``that I merely called him a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   And 12 years ago, when the Los Angeles Times wrote a piece about
the two journals, Lesser's picture was on the front page of the
arts section and Junker's was inside. Furthermore, Junker was
unable to obtain a free copy of Lesser's recent book of
autobiographical essays, ``The Amateur.'' Sometimes life really
isn't fair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rep.  &UR; Jesse Jackson Jr. &LR; , D-Ill., and his father, the  &UR; Rev. &LR; 
 &UR; Jesse Jackson &LR; , are co-authors of the forthcoming ``It's About the
Money! How You Can Get Out of Debt, Build Wealth and Achieve Your
Financial Dreams,'' says Roll Call. A press release about the book
says that the authors believe making money ``is the fourth step in
the movement to freedom,'' after emancipation from slavery, getting
the right to vote and the end of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week's account of the theft of a Golden Nica award was
incorrect. Etoy's ``theft'' was a hoax, and the trophy was returned
immediately after the press conference. Also, it was not the award
won by Digital Domain and four other companies for the visual
effects of ``What Dreams May Come.'' That one, safe and sound, is
with the producers of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Candid Camera,'' the show created by Cornell graduate
 &UR; Allen Funt &LR; , who died earlier this month, is used in that
university's basic psychology courses.
</P>
<P>
   Psychology 101 students see an episode wherein an elevator
passenger is joined by three others who turn to face one side of a
car. Most of the time Passenger A turns to face the same way as the
rest, unable to resist the pressures of conformity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it work. If you exercise your index finger,
it's not terribly exacting. You know ... there goes another one! I
never thought of it as a career. I was very busy trying to avoid
anything that might entail illustration of my feelings.''

WORLD POPULATION EXPECTED TO REACH 6B IN OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marking the fastest population spurt in history, the world will
reach six billion people Oct. 12, a milestone that raises serious
questions about the limits of the planet's resources, UN officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Earth's population reached its first billion in 1804,
each subsequent billion has taken less time attain. In fewer than
40 years, the world's population has doubled from three billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sixth billion is the fastest we'll be adding, taking only
12 years,'' said Carl Haub, a demographer with the Population
Reference Bureau, a nonprofit demographic and information
organization in Washington. ``When is billion No. 7 going to
come?''
</P>
<P>
   Unchecked, the growth could harm the environment, lead to
disease and famine, prompt wars over increasingly scarce resources
and limit the ability of nations to provide education, housing,
jobs and health care to its citizens, say UN officials and others
concerned about the potential for overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carrying capacity of the glob? No one has the answer,''
said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the United Nations
Population Fund, which Tuesday released a report, ``6 Billion: A
Time for Choices.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added in a telephone interview Tuesday, ``whether the
world will stabilize at 7-1/2 billion, 8-1/2 billion, 9-1/2 billion
_ it's something we could influence by the actions of today.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sadik pointed to such successes over the last few decades
as the increase worldwide in use of contraception from 10 percent
to 60 percent and the halving of the average family size, she said
much more must be done.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for overpopulation has held humankind's attention
since at least the time of T.R. Malthus, a 19th century English
economist and clergyman who predicted population growth would
exceed the food supply unless war, famine and disease reduced the
numbers, or the growth was slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago in Cairo, at an international conference, 179
countries, including the United States, agreed that population is
linked to poverty, empowerment of women and environmental
protection. Both developed and developing nations agreed that $17
billion a year would be needed by the year 2000 for international
family planning and reproductive health services, but that figure
looks unlikely to be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of that is the US failure to live up to its
agreement,'' said Brian Dixon, director of government relations for
Zero Population Growth, a grass-roots organization concerned with
the effects of rapid population growth, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials concerned about overpopulation criticized some members
of Congress for holding up the millions of dollars promised for
international family planning services _ as well as the more than
$1 billion owed the United Nations in back dues _ because of US
abortion politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have held it up as hostage on their anti-choice agenda,''
said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who has
co-sponsored legislation to reauthorize $25 million in funding for
international family planning services. She participated in a
telephone news conference announcing the release of the UN
Population Fund's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that it's gotten tied up in so many other
political battles,'' said Sally Ethelston, a spokeswoman for
Population Action International a private, nonprofit research and
advocacy organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Coalition for Life, however, has urged
its members to support attempts by Representative Chris Smith of
New Jersey to tie both payment of UN back dues and international
family planning funding to strict anti-abortion provisions. ``The
reform most needed at the UN is to get them out of the population
control business,'' the coalition stated in a recent Internet
posting.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of the United Nations, Ben Wattenberg, a senior
research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute,
called the UN's claims ``pretty silly.'' While he agreed that the
sixth billionth baby will be born any day now, he said UN world
population projections are inflated, and that the numbers will be
adjusted downward because of the decline in the fertility rate that
is already occurring, according to a syndicated column published
last week.

   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

prices but matching products to the needs and tastes of individual

pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be

   &UR; LATEST HIT ON CAMPUS: CRESCENDO IN E-MAJOR &LR;  &QL;

   When it comes to offering degrees, the halls of academia are not
immune to trying what's hot every now and then. What's sizzling
right now, given the successes of the dot-com crowd, is the
E-commerce credential. Colleges and universities nationwide are

majors, minors, concentrations, specialities, certificates,

   &UR; MAKE A QUICK PURCHASE. WAIT FOR THE DELIVERY MAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KIRBY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting products out of the virtual shopping cart and into the
home is a barrier to E-commerce growth. But the cost of home
delivery and the hassle of waiting for it are enough to drive even
patient consumers to the mall. And who has ever returned a sweater
on-line? But things are beginning to change, writes David Kirby.
Home delivery, a hallmark of the 19th century, is making a big
comeback. And analysts say that means that whatever else happens in
E-commerce, the delivery industry will be a big winner. A report.

   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   There are Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents

programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,'' are among the hottest

making shopping on the Internet better not just by finding lower
prices but matching products to the needs and tastes of individual

 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the new shows, there is only one guarantee: ``Once and
Again'' will be knocked from its Tuesday night perch come November.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it's a goner. It is also the best show ABC is introducing,
and one of the best dramas of the new season, an insightful adult
look at post-divorce dating and the complications posed for and by
the kids. And it will still get the boot.
</P>
<P>
   That's because ``Once and Again'' is just renting the 10 p.m.
Tuesday time slot on ABC until ``NYPD Blue'' returns Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it is slated to return in January, probably into the
``Monday Night Football'' slot after the season ends. Maybe sooner,
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   That is better than a two-month hiatus _ two months for a show,
even as good as this one, to fade from memories and viewer
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is conceding it is a big risk. Renting a slot worked for
``The Practice,'' which slid into the Monday night slot from
Saturdays a few years back before finding a home on Sundays. And
maybe it can work again.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the network likes the show _ and with good reason _
judging from all the promotional effort behind it. And the
creators, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the makers of
``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called Life'' (now there is a
strong pedigree), are confident that ABC will keep the show strong,
even if it leaves the air for a period.
</P>
<P>
   And they are not so convinced that it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a network executive. A show goes on the air and it does
extremely well. It seems to build momentum. Do you take it off the
air?'' Zwick rhetorically asked reporters in July. ``Or, if you
take it off the air, do you then pay no attention to it during that
time and make sure people forget about it and lose all the momentum
that you had?''
</P>
<P>
   The story follows two single parents, the recently separated
Lily Manning (Sela Ward) and Rick Sammler (Billy Campbell), as they
tentatively venture into seeking and accepting love after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, each gives documentary-style analysis via
black-and-white interviews with an unseen, unheard third party.
They don't talk directly to the camera _ a fad this season _ but
the inserts in the drama provide insights that otherwise could
weigh down the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The children, particularly Manning's lovelorn and confused
14-year-old daughter Grace (Julia Whelan), throw constant obstacles
into the burgeoning relationship.
</P>
<P>
   A show that focuses on the ``Can-I-get-a-sitter?'' instead of
``Can-I-get-Dad's-car?'' dilemmas of dating is refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   The moment this show was announced, it was immediately dubbed
``fortysomething,'' and that is not a slight. Ward, best known for
her Emmy-winning role on ``Sisters,'' is at 43 one of the sexiest
people on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think perhaps unwittingly they've written something that
celebrates age, that celebrates that at 40 there is life,'' Ward
said. What a refreshing, unique concept for a youth-obsessed
industry. What a refreshing show.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a thought raised by a colleague: How disconcerting is it
for those who remember the original recipe (and the late) Colonel
Sanders, the dignified, Southern gentleman in a white coat of KFC
fame, now portrayed as an animated dervish who resembles Foghorn
Leghorn on crack?

<P>
   And have you seen the ad for Levi's in which a bodaciously
beautiful woman and a guy strip naked out of their jeans _ and the
rest of their clothes _ with the catch being that their bodies are
invisible?
</P>
<P>
   It is among the most titillating spots to ever air on network
television (along with those Herbal Essence/women moaning shampoo
commercials), even though it shows, well, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is great at getting attention for Levi's, a
hurting company. But even though I'm about as far from a prude as
you can get, this should not air in daytime or early evenings, as
it has (especially during football games). Even showing nothing,
the ad leaves little to the imagination.

PARENTS OF WHITE SUPREMACIST PLEAD FOR SON'S LIFE, EMBRACE VICTIM'S
FAMILY 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ The parents of a white supremacist convicted in
last year's dragging death of a black man tearfully embraced the
victim's family Tuesday, moments after pleading with jurors to
spare their son's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like all of you people to know our hearts and our
prayers are with you,'' a sobbing Lawrence Russell Brewer Sr. said
as he shook hands with James Byrd Jr.'s parents, sisters and nephew
outside the courtroom. ``God bless you all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had met under different circumstances,'' he told
Byrd's father, James Byrd Sr. ``I'm awfully embarrassed by this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he hoped he and Byrd could go fishing together one
day. Byrd took Brewer's hand and nodded in acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just breaks my heart to know this family lost someone,''
Brewer said later. ``They're wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors convicted Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr. of capital murder
Monday in the June 7, 1998, death of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old
disabled man who was stripped and chained by his ankles to a pickup
and dragged more than three miles down backwoods roads east of
Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   The same jury will hear closing arguments in the trial's
punishment phase and decide whether Brewer, 32, should get a life
sentence or join fellow racist John William ``Bill'' King on death
row. A third defendant, 24-year-old Shawn Allen Berry, will be
tried next month in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional scene came after Helen Brewer had testified about
her son's childhood and asked jurors to let him live. After the
lunch break, Brewer's father, a former Army sergeant, took the
stand, crying and begging jurors to spare his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the bottom of my heart, there are two things I would
really want,'' Brewer told the jury, his voice breaking. ``That's
to ask for forgiveness and to allow my son ... If you take his life
you're killing more than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family is torn apart, as I'm sure the Byrd family is,''
he said. ``To take his life is more than this family can bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer told the jury that although he was stationed overseas for
much of his son's childhood, all five of his children were reared
in a strict, religious, military family. The younger Brewer was
taught to ``trust and love not only God but his fellow man,''
regardless of skin color, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He described his son as a polite youngster who as a teen-ager
fell in with the wrong crowd and began using drugs and skipping
school. Against his wife's wishes, Brewer said, he kicked his
14-year-old son out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to have Russell leave our home,'' he cried. ``I was
afraid he would influence our other children.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped down from the witness stand, Brewer, said, ``God
bless you, the Byrd family.'' He stopped at the defense table and
grabbed his son's hand on his way out, and both sobbed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, who has a history of heart problems, then took a
nitroglycerin tablet. Once outside the courtroom, he collapsed into
a chair. A paramedic who had been standing by gave him oxygen and
checked his pulse and blood pressure as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, a Vietnam veteran, said begging for his son's life was
worse than anything he had ever faced in the Army. ``This was by
far the most painful thing I've ever had to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Helen Brewer and others testified that when her son
would occasionally sneak home after being kicked out, she would
allow him to stay briefly in a camper behind the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell him, 'Russell, you know your daddy won't let you come
home,''' she said. ``He would always say, 'Which way, Momma? Which
way do I go?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good person. He's a loving person,'' she said. ``Drugs
is what led him astray. He just got with the wrong people.''
</P>
<P>
   When she visited him in the Jasper County Jail shortly after his
arrest, Helen Brewer said her son ``cried and cried and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, 'I don't remember,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's aunt, cousin and a family friend also testified
Tuesday, tearfully telling jurors that Brewer had always been a
quiet, timid child who cowered and hung his head when people talked
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way he could ever be a leader,'' said Paula Cruz, a
friend from church.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's defense attorney Doug Barlow showed the jury 11
poster-size color photos of Brewer growing up. They included
pictures of Brewer and his brother as boys, posing with their arms
around a black friend, and Brewer with his Hispanic ex-wife and
their son.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Roberts, a psychologist called by the defense, testified
that Brewer, though not mentally ill, has a severe anti-social
personality disorder, suffers from paranoia and has attempted
suicide more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs reassurance. He wants to be included,'' Roberts
testified. ``But he also has a strong fear that people will reject
him or humiliate him so he hangs on the fringes of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how that personality jibed with Brewer's status as the
leader, or ``Exalted Cyclops,'' of a racist prison gang, Roberts
pointed out that Brewer wasn't a very effective leader and that the
group fell apart under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Russell could lead a horse to water if it's thirsty,''
he said. ``He wanted to be the leader, but it was like Fred
Flintstone wanting to be the Grand Pooba of the Water Buffalo
Club.''
</P>
<P>
   And Roberts disagreed with a psychiatrist who had testified for
the prosecution that Brewer would be a continuing threat if he were
allowed to live.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Johnny Stevens,
who is assisting Jasper County prosecutors, asked Roberts: ``If I
had asked you on June 6, 1998, whether he would be a future danger,
what would you have said?''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he would have answered no.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you would have been wrong,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly possible that I'm wrong now,'' Roberts replied,
``but I think the odds are low.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, prosecutors had called witnesses who testified about
Brewer's previous prison record, which includes convictions for
burglary, cocaine possession and parole violations that have kept
the defendant in prison most of his adult life. They also showed
the jury several guns that Brewer had stolen after breaking into
the homes of two men.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrist Edward Gripon testified Tuesday that after
interviewing Brewer for more than two hours, he concluded that the
killer's personality disorder causes him to blame others for his
own actions, to engage in self-pity and to show no remorse. Brewer
was bothered more by being caught than by what he did, Gripon said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Brewer would be a continuing threat, Gripon said,
``Unlike those of us who wonder what our potential for violence
might be, Mr. Brewer has answered that question.''
</P>
<P>
   As court recessed Tuesday, Byrd family members said they were
touched when the Brewers greeted them outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem like a very nice family,'' said Clara Taylor, Byrd's
sister. ``There's no need to blame them for what their son did.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the elder Brewer's pain was caused by the actions
of his son. ``And our pain was caused by what his son did.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Byrd's sisters, Stella Brumley, said that as a
parent, she could empathize with Brewer's parents and expected them
to ask for their son's life. ``I can understand that part of it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother's killer might have been a model child,
``but he didn't turn out to be a model person when he made a choice
June 7 to do something so hideous.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Brewer deserves mercy, she said, ``He didn't give
any mercy.''
</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the chairman of Al Gore's presidential
campaign, Tony Coelho routinely meets with wealthy Democratic
fund-raisers to offer encouragement and listen to their views. But
these feel-good pep talks are rarely as blunt or as riveting as the
one held with about two dozen Asian-Americans here late one
afternoon last month.
</P>
<P>
   As several participants later recounted, Victor W. Hwang, a
young lawyer who worked for the Democratic National Committee in
1996, broke the usual pattern of pleasantries and insisted that if
Asian-Americans were to be pressed for millions of dollars in
donations once again they expected clear benefits like prime-time
speakers at the Democratic convention next summer and a firm
promise of a Cabinet-level appointment in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just a warm-up for Mary Miyashita, a highly
regarded Democratic fund-raiser for more than 40 years. Ms.
Miyashita burst into sobs as she asked if Gore could make a
courtesy telephone call to John Huang, a Chinese American who was
at the center of the furor that erupted over illegal donations by
Asians to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign. Like many
Asian-Americans, Ms. Miyashita feels that Huang was unfairly
vilified in the fund-raising scandal, less because of any
violations of the law than because of his Asian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listened very silently with his head bowed,'' Mrs.
Miyashita said in an interview, breaking into tears again as she
recalled the meeting with Coelho. ``Maybe I put him on the spot,
but it was my personal way to begin the healing. I don't think it's
started yet, but it so needs to happen because so many people are
bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the relatively brief span of one presidential cycle, the role
of Asian-Americans in national politics appears to have changed in
fundamental ways. After years as one of the most financially
generous but underrepresented ethnic minorities in American
politics, many Asian-Americans are nursing deep wounds from what
they regard as a string of insulting scandals. And this time, they
say, things will be different.
</P>
<P>
   There will be less interest in photo opportunities with the
candidates, the groups say, and instead a laserlike focus on
getting more Asian-Americans appointed to positions in Washington
and to judgeships, and on bolstering government efforts to fight
hate crimes and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Asian-Americans say they are now taking
political matters into their own hands by trying to transform the
diverse Asian-American groups into an electoral bloc where the
population is most concentrated, in California, which is also the
biggest prize in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts are backed by a great deal of emotion, too,
because of the shock of the campaign finance scandals. No one
doubts now that some election finance laws were broken,
particularly by two political newcomers who had ties to Clinton,
Johnny Chung and Yah Lin Trie. Both have pleaded guilty to charges
involving improper political fund-raising and hundreds of thousands
of dollars of donations they solicited had to be returned.
</P>
<P>
   But many Asian-Americans feel that the fund-raising scandals put
anyone with an Asian surname under a humiliating cloud of suspicion
_ with many perfectly legitimate donors receiving calls from the
FBI. They hold both political parties partly responsible: The
Republicans, they say, exploited racist fears for political gain,
while the Democrats did little to openly defend the loyalty and
integrity of the Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pain, some Asian-American leaders say the process
was ultimately beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been a great experience,'' said Thomas Chan,
a founder of the newly formed Asian Pacific American Bar
Association of Los Angeles. ``Finally, there's something
galvanizing the Asian-American community. It's sad, but you have to
have an event that shakes people to make them care. There was a
paradigm shift. The focus now has got to be on practical things,
like discrimination in jobs, glass ceilings at work, hate crimes
and the appointment of Asian-Americans to important jobs in the
next administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Coelho is regarded here as a harbinger of some
tough bargaining ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were expecting the usual meeting where everyone was real
nice and just said their platitudes,'' Warren Furutani, an aide to
the speaker of the California state Assembly, Antonio Villaraigosa.
``But there is a definite residue of bitterness, and that
bitterness has really created a political vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bitterness, no one is suggesting that the flow of
Asian money into American politics will subside. Furutani and
others said donors will scrutinize candidates more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund raising is a mechanical part of the system, and it can't
be avoided,'' said Henry Tang, an investment banker and the
chairman of the Committee of 100, an influential group of Chinese
Americans in society and the arts. ``But we will be getting into
much more of the philosophical core of the candidates and what
their policies will do for us.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made the campaign finance scandals a particularly
bitter pill to swallow is that Asian-Americans have been one of the
most generous ethnic groups in the country. They contributed, quite
legally, about $10 million in each of the last two presidential
elections, by some estimates, but the money seems to have brought
little open support from the political parties they had financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't completely come to grips with what I would call
maltreatment by both parties,'' Tang said. ``People drew a linkage
between Asians who were breaking the law and Asian-Americans that
was completely unfair. We felt helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were heightened earlier this year when a Chinese
American scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed, on charges
that he had violated security policies by downloading secret data
to an unsecure computer.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was widely reported to be under suspicion of handing over
nuclear secrets to China, but he has not been charged with a crime
and has denied any spying. Adding to the concerns, last month the
former head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos, Robert S.
Vrooman, said that Lee was singled out in large part because of his
race, something the Energy Department denied.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's case has particularly enraged Asian-American scientists
and engineers who had generally steered away from politics and had
felt their work for the national defense would place them above
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing remains the same today,'' said Bill Chang, a former
bank chairman and now the president of the Chinese American
Engineers and Scientists Association of Southern California, which
has about 800 members. ``I do have reports from other scientists,
even professors, that they have suffered some kind of prejudice
since this happened. It is just amazing to many of us. A lot of
times we are looked at not as Americans, but as Chinese, even after
all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Fong, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully against Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., for a U.S. Senate seat in 1998 and is now
a fund-raiser for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said the attacks on
Lee were a catalyst for the new strains of political thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new mood of activism that hadn't existed before, and
it has a different flavor,'' Fong said. ``The different flavor is
Wen Ho Lee. That has caused a far more broad-based chill. What the
community fears is the broad brush strokes, in which everyone of
Chinese ancestry is suspected of spying for China.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, party loyalties are being abandoned and
Asian-Americans are looking to candidates who appear to offer
specific benefits to their community. For instance, Jackson Tai, an
investment banker and a lifelong Republican, said he had abandoned
his old party because of what he felt was its eagerness to fan the
flames of Asian racism. Now, he is raising money for Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bradley has been picking up significant support in some
Asian-American circles, in part because of what he is not: neither
a Republican nor a member of the Clinton administration. ``The
biggest failure was the administration's unwillingness to openly
defend Asian-Americans in the campaign financing scandal,'' said
Dale Minami, who heads the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans,
based in San Francisco, and was a co-chairman of Clinton's northern
California committee in 1992. ``That kind of sticks in the craw of
a lot of Asian-Americans, and will for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he did make a small number of appointments of
Asian-Americans, Clinton is perceived as having not been vocal
enough in supporting them during the scandals. And Gore has his own
problems. He participated in a fund-raiser for Asian-Americans at a
Buddhist temple here in 1996 at which, it was later disclosed, many
improper contributions were made at a venue, a nonprofit religious
institution, where candidates are prohibited from soliciting
donations. Gore's staff returned many of the improper donations,
and some Asian-Americans say they detect a reluctance on his part
to be identified too closely with them.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, a Gore campaign spokeswoman, denied this, saying,
``Absolutely not. This is a community he wants to work with.''
Also, it appears that Gore will address later this fall a
convention of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has endorsed Gore, said she
thinks he will win over many Asian-Americans once they sit down and
hear his views, but she conceded he has a problem. ``The vice
president, because of the Buddhist temple thing, may not have
wanted to have ventured forth,'' Feinstein said. ``My own view is
that the community itself needs to come together and speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what many Asian-Americans are doing. They are focused on
the local, grass roots level, and are working on long range plans
to develop a broader base for influence over the political process.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a new group was formed here, called Vision 21, to
quicken the pace of voter registration and to do extensive exit
polling after elections. Much of the polling will be used to
convince candidates of the importance of the Asian-American votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are also efforts to get more Asian residents to become
citizens and, importantly, to find and train potential
Asian-American candidates for public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community needs more facets and dimensions,'' said Don T.
Nakanishi, director of the Asian-American Studies Center at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``One can't participate
effectively with just one means, like giving money.''
</P>
<P>
   Another effort is called the 80/20 Initiative. This is a
campaign to persuade the Asian-American community in California to
vote as a bloc for the candidate _ no matter from which party _ who
demonstrates the strongest commitment to offering tangible policy
benefits. The aim is to get 80 percent of registered Asian-American
voters in the state to back the endorsed candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a completely fanciful strategy. In the 1998
elections here, Fong, a Republican, received nearly 59 percent of
the Asian-American community's vote in his unsuccessful campaign
against Boxer. In the gubernatorial race, 64 percent of
Asian-Americans voted for the Democratic candidate for governor,
Gray Davis, who defeated a Republican candidate perceived to be
anti-immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian-Americans consider the initiative slightly
unrealistic, but at the least a potent symbol of the new mood.
``It's a vehicle for peoples' frustration,'' said Tang of the
Committee of 100. ``80/20 is one of the new arrows in our quiver.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The word naivete is too simple a word for where we
were four years ago. Maybe sophomoric, in terms of the whole
process. We were probably set back 10 years by what happened, but
at least we're far more realistic now.''

JORDAN TEEING IT UP _ BUT ON NANTUCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The Ryder Cup, also known as the Where's
Jordan Jubilee, moved into its second day Tuesday with former NBA
icon Michael Jordan not to be spotted among the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was nearby, and he was on a golf course, but he wasn't on
the Massachusetts mainland. For the second straight day, he teed it
up with friends at the tony Nantucket Golf Club, the same course he
played Monday with ex-NHL great Mario Lemieux, former Pittsburgh
Penguin Dan Quinn, and Mike Eruzione, the former Boston University
Terrier who captained Team USA's hockey gold medal triumph at the
1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, along the fairways here at The Country Club, the most
often heard question among the spectators was, ``Have you seen
Michael?'' Tiger Woods is all the rage on the course, but that's
only inside the ropes. The biggest buzz of the tournament could
come when MJ hits the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is believed to have rented a home bordering the course
through the tournament's final matches Sunday. Just where that
house is, and just how much of a ransom Jordan shelled out to rent
it this week, remains speculation. The latest rumor had Jordan
occupying a beige, two-story colonial, with Victorian touches,
located just behind the course's International Pavilion adjacent to
the No. 2 tee box.
</P>
<P>
   However, a young man who answered the door at 195 Newton Street,
with its backyard abutting the International Pavilion, denied
Jordan would be staying there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``this is a private residence. He is on the
street, though, from what I hear. I wish he was staying here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan golfed all the courses he was rumored to play, he
would be one tired hacker. Varying reports had His Airness teeing
it up at Wannamoisett in Rumford, R.I., Farm Neck on Martha's
Vineyard (a Bill Clinton favorite), and both Brae Burn and Charles
River in Newton. Spokesmen for all four noted courses said Jordan
had not golfed there Tuesday and there were no plans for him to
play there later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan played in a traveling Nantucket foursome Monday,
accompained by Lemieux (new owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins),
Quinn, and Eruzione. They opened with nine holes at Sankaty Head,
which was being aerated, and then moved on to play a full loop at
nearby Nantucket Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some notification that (Jordan) was coming out,'' said
Mark Heartfield, the pro at Sankaty Head. ``I believe that Mario
Lemieux is a member at Oakmont in Pittsburgh and the pro there, Bob
Ford, called here and asked if they could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Word around Sankaty Head was that Jordan shot 37, 1 over par, on
the front nine before moving on to the next course.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with Jordan's plans for later this week said
the retired superstar will host a party at his rented home for
members of both Ryder Cup squads. Two other retired icons, former
NHL star Wayne Gretzky and ex-Denver Bronco John Elway, are
expected to attend. The crowds along the fairways could hold more
famous faces than the fairways themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, US Ryder Cup star Tiger Woods said he
spoke with Jordan Monday night. Jordan played for the US Dream Team
that won the basketball gold medal at the 1984 and '92 Olympics _ a
tournament with an international profile akin to the Ryder Cup _
but Woods said he didn't trade tournament comparisons with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of talked about what he's doing and just kind of
shooting the breeze,'' said Woods. ``That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice resumes bright and early Wednesday and the real stuff
begins Friday. Until then, the Where's Jordan Jubilee continues.

<P>
   MIAMI _ As Floridians asked themselves how anyone could be all
that afraid of a tropical storm named Harvey, people in the
southern tip of the state wearily endured this latest bout with bad
weather with more impatience than trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected change in direction shifted the ragged tropical
storm away from the densely populated Tampa Bay area and into
Florida's southwestern Gulf Coast. Although the storm forced the
closing of schools and triggered an emergency declaration from Gov.
Jeb Bush, in the end heavy rains and some flooding were the worst
the storm could do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said environmentalists, the state needed the heavy
rains in its South Florida wetlands to help replenish the aquifer
and swamps so that fish, wading birds and other wildlife will have
enough water to make it through the dry season this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical storm came ashore less than a week after Hurricane
Floyd, a massive storm four times the size of the destructive
Hurricane Andrew in 1992, pounded the Bahamas and skirted the
Florida coastline before blowing along the Eastern Seaboard,
killing more than 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   The center of Harvey, with winds around 50 mph, came ashore
Tuesday morning in Collier County on the Gulf Coast. Then, with
winds weakening to below 40 mph, the tropical strom washed across
the Everglades before bringing rain into Miami and the rest of
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters had feared that the storm would enter the state at
Tampa Bay and head northeast, perhaps bringing more hard rain and
misery to the Carolinas, which were ravaged by floods from
Hurricane Floyd. But instead, the storm weakened Tuesday and a cold
front turned the storm to the southeast, across the state's
southern peninsula and into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tampa area spared the brunt of the storm Tuesday, a
cruise ship was able to limp back to port under the power of one
engine. On Sunday, an engine room fire had knocked out both
engines, stranding the ship and the 1,700 people aboard in the Gulf
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm's new course, its impact on the Carolinas, if
any, would be slight, said weather experts at the National
Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't anything to worry about by any means,'' said Lixion
Avila, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center,
as the storm staggered across the southern tip of the state and
took aim at the open Atlantic. ``This is a poorly defined tropical
storm. It will dump some rain. It will only move around a couple of
tree branches and lightweight street debris. That's all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The storm deluged Collier County with some 10 inches of rain,
flooding streets and sending water into 35 homes and about the same
number of businesses, said Ken Pineau, the emergency management
director for Collier County.
</P>
<P>
   In Everglades City, a town of about 600 people some 40 miles
east of Naples, Martha Daniels, the city clerk, sat in her office
and watched the streets flood all around City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Hall is an island,'' she said. ``We're watching the tide
go by. We see these little reddish-brown piles floating by _
millions of ants on top of each other. We saw a telephone pole go
by a while ago. Now we're seeing somebody go by in a canoe. You
can't tell what's road, what's lawn. It all looks the same under
water.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one seemed to be panicking. In the nearby small town of
Ochopee, Vince Doerr, a retired firefighter, watched the heavy
rains more with interest than fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take it better than they can in Miami, I guess on
account of all those roads and shopping centers,'' Doerr said. ``It
slows the water down. Here it flows real natural.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm was expected to bring rains of from 2 to 5 inches to
the Miami area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, environmentalists were grateful for the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rains are crucial,'' said Ed Carlson, manager of the
Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, about 30 miles north of Naples. ``This
is the kind of rain that covers the entire region and replenishes
the wetlands and aquifers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the storm moved across the state, it brought mild street
flooding to Key West, then headed into open water. The Bahamian
government posted a tropical storm warning for Grand Bahama Island
and the Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas, which had suffered
last week from Hurricane Floyd.

 &HT;    Business start picking up pieces in flood's wake
 &HT;    By Gene Metrick

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Twin County merchants began the grimy task
of cleaning up their flood-damaged businesses this week.
</P>
<P>
   At Tarrytown Mall, maintenance workers and office employees
joined shop owners in dredging out the mud and moisture left by the
55 inches of water that had filled the inside of the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastation _ 100 percent of our stores received water
damage,'' said Leigh Haislip, general manager of the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The mall's benches, plants and garbage cans lay heaped together
in piles, strewn across different spots along the main walkways.
Shop owners, their friends and employees wandered in and out of the
stores, surveying the damages and looking to see what could be
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't have any flood
insurance,'' said Chong Pak, owner of Tharrington's Cobbler Shop,
as he and his wife, Yisoon, carried their damaged tools and
supplies outside for cleaning. ``It's a big mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Haislip said the cleanup will be limited to daylight hours until
the power is restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no structural damage, so that's the good news,'' she
said. ``But where do you start?''
</P>
<P>
   Prem Gulabrai, owner of Le New York and PJ's Sportswear, said
aside from cleaning up and working toward eventually re-opening,
his main concern is his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had good credit, so I hope the suppliers can
understand,'' he said. ``For the moment, we're just trying to do
our best. Everything is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Across U.S. 301, vehicles streaked with mud and debris filled
the Premier Ford-Lincoln Mercury car lot. In the front, a dumpster
was wedged against a light pole, straddling the hoods of two new
Ford Expeditions like an ornamental marker reminding passers-by of
the fury of the receded waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total inventory was under water except for maybe 20
cars,'' said David Hughes, general manager of the car dealership.
``They'll be total losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the cleanup effort began Saturday, with small crews
of employees tackling the chore of removing the silt and stains
left by the 5 feet of water that at one time sloshed throughout the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to operate by replacing the carpet and
patching things up,'' he said. ``But the building damages are
miniscule compared to the equipment damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the damaged vehicles, the dealership also lost most
of its service tools and computer diagnostic equipment, Hughes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Allen said he'll soon be looking for a new location for his
Sunset Music store, which was buried under 7 feet of water after
Stony Creek overflowed and turned the intersection of Sunset Avenue
and Forrest Hill Road into a raging river engulfing everything in
its path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably 90 percent of the merchandise and equipment is lost _
there's water inside everything,'' he said. ``We'll be busy for a
while.''

`ONCE AND AGAIN' TO GET BOOTED TO DIFFERENT TIME SLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: FIXES headline, changing slots to slot)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the new shows, there is only one guarantee: ``Once and
Again'' will be knocked from its Tuesday night perch come November.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it's a goner. It is also the best show ABC is introducing,
and one of the best dramas of the new season, an insightful adult
look at post-divorce dating and the complications posed for and by
the kids. And it will still get the boot.
</P>
<P>
   That's because ``Once and Again'' is just renting the 10 p.m.
Tuesday time slot on ABC until ``NYPD Blue'' returns Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it is slated to return in January, probably into the
``Monday Night Football'' slot after the season ends. Maybe sooner,
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   That is better than a two-month hiatus _ two months for a show,
even as good as this one, to fade from memories and viewer
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is conceding it is a big risk. Renting a slot worked for
``The Practice,'' which slid into the Monday night slot from
Saturdays a few years back before finding a home on Sundays. And
maybe it can work again.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the network likes the show _ and with good reason _
judging from all the promotional effort behind it. And the
creators, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the makers of
``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called Life'' (now there is a
strong pedigree), are confident that ABC will keep the show strong,
even if it leaves the air for a period.
</P>
<P>
   And they are not so convinced that it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a network executive. A show goes on the air and it does
extremely well. It seems to build momentum. Do you take it off the
air?'' Zwick rhetorically asked reporters in July. ``Or, if you
take it off the air, do you then pay no attention to it during that
time and make sure people forget about it and lose all the momentum
that you had?''
</P>
<P>
   The story follows two single parents, the recently separated
Lily Manning (Sela Ward) and Rick Sammler (Billy Campbell), as they
tentatively venture into seeking and accepting love after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, each gives documentary-style analysis via
black-and-white interviews with an unseen, unheard third party.
They don't talk directly to the camera _ a fad this season _ but
the inserts in the drama provide insights that otherwise could
weigh down the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The children, particularly Manning's lovelorn and confused
14-year-old daughter Grace (Julia Whelan), throw constant obstacles
into the burgeoning relationship.
</P>
<P>
   A show that focuses on the ``Can-I-get-a-sitter?'' instead of
``Can-I-get-Dad's-car?'' dilemmas of dating is refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   The moment this show was announced, it was immediately dubbed
``fortysomething,'' and that is not a slight. Ward, best known for
her Emmy-winning role on ``Sisters,'' is at 43 one of the sexiest
people on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think perhaps unwittingly they've written something that
celebrates age, that celebrates that at 40 there is life,'' Ward
said. What a refreshing, unique concept for a youth-obsessed
industry. What a refreshing show.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a thought raised by a colleague: How disconcerting is it
for those who remember the original recipe (and the late) Colonel
Sanders, the dignified, Southern gentleman in a white coat of KFC
fame, now portrayed as an animated dervish who resembles Foghorn
Leghorn on crack?
</P>
<P>
   And have you seen the ad for Levi's in which a bodaciously
beautiful woman and a guy strip naked out of their jeans _ and the
rest of their clothes _ with the catch being that their bodies are
invisible?
</P>
<P>
   It is among the most titillating spots to ever air on network
television (along with those Herbal Essence/women moaning shampoo
commercials), even though it shows, well, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is great at getting attention for Levi's, a
hurting company. But even though I'm about as far from a prude as
you can get, this should not air in daytime or early evenings, as
it has (especially during football games). Even showing nothing,
the ad leaves little to the imagination.

AFTER KOSOVO, EUROPEAN ALLIES DISCUSS MODERNIZING FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ NATO defense ministers, meeting for the first time
since the end of the Kosovo air war, agreed on Tuesday that the
European members of the alliance have to spend far more money on
modern arms and equipment to carry their share of the
responsibility in war.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo war, with its daily demonstrations of the huge
disparities between American and European forces, confirmed the
growing technology gap between the two forces and its effect on
even the most sophisticated armies to react quickly in war.
</P>
<P>
   In the closed session on Tuesday morning, Clinton administration
and NATO officials said, Lord Robertson, the British minister of
defense who will become secretary-general of NATO next month, said
that even though the European countries sent only 2 percent of
their combined armed forces for use in the Balkans, they did so
slowly and with great difficulty. If they could not use the 2
percent effectively, then what, Robertson asked his fellow defense
ministers, was the use of the remaining 98 percent of their armies.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen argued that the lesson of
Kosovo is that even though European governments are trimming their
budgets, they can spend their defense money more wisely _ on better
weaponry as well as on new communications equipment and transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO countries spend roughly 60 percent of what the United
States does and they get about 10 percent of the capability, ``
Cohen said on Tuesday. ``That has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   A lack of precision-guided munitions was chief among the
European shortcomings during the war. Even though European
warplanes sometimes flew half of the nightly bombing sorties, they
had to rely on the United States to supply them with the
laser-guided bombs they needed to hit their targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we learned is that in a conflict like this,
it is not politically sustainable in the long run for one ally to
have to bear as much of the burden of actually delivering the
ordinances,'' said a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Transporting troops and equipment was another large problem for
the Europeans. On Tuesday, they agreed to a suggestion from Cohen
to take greater advantage of private commercial planes and
aircraft. For his part, Cohen said the United States learned of its
own shortfalls during the Kosovo campaign and as a result is buying
more C-17 transport planes, more ships to carry heavy equipment and
more precision-guided munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Other major headaches arose with European logistics and
engineering capabilities, their spotty communications networks and
their intelligence capabilities, administration and NATO officials
have said.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries did not have secure radio networks for their
pilots and were forced to speak to pilots of other NATO nations on
the open airwaves, which were monitored by the Serbs. That problem
should have been easy to solve, said a senior NATO defense
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it take to have secure radios we all can use?'' the
official said. ``Not much. It takes the Europeans buying American
radios and they don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After undertaking a defense review of British forces, Robertson
said Tuesday that the Europeans can find the money to buy new
equipment by cutting unnecessary duplication of their efforts and
taking better advantage of their multinational forces.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's 50th anniversary summit meeting in Washington last
spring, when the outcome of the Kosovo air campaign was uncertain,
all NATO members adopted a ``defense capability initiative''
requiring the European nations to close the gap between the United
States and Europe. Now, with the alliance proclaiming victory in
Kosovo, Cohen is trying to insure that the Europeans follow through
on their promises.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're not saying they have to look like us but we are saying
we all have to be able to talk to each other, we have to be able to
share data and intelligence and work together as a team,''' said a
senior administration official here.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are few countries other than the United
States that produce all the equipment that will be on the
Europeans' shopping lists. Cohen said on Tuesday that the United
States is developing lower-cost precision guided munitions that
would be more affordable for the European allies and that the
United States manufactures the special aircraft for collecting
intelligence that the Europeans said they would acquire.
</P>
<P>
   To make those purchases the Europeans will have to overhaul
their budgets and make more drastic changes in their armed forces
that still look too much like Cold War standing armies, lacking the
mobility and the resources to be deployed quickly outside their
national borders.
</P>
<P>
   Without those changes, the Europeans will be unable to take the
next step in creating their own defense and security arm within
NATO, a goal they reconfirmed this year in the midst of the Kosovo
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some European nations were humiliated to discover that for all
the money they spent they could not fly with the big boys in
Kosovo,'' said a senior Administration official.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials would not provide estimates of the amounts that
nations would have to spend to upgrade, saying only that individual
countries would have to find the money. With financial difficulties
making it difficult for many European governments to maintain their
current level of defense spending, the defense ministers gathered
here avoided making any promises of actual increases in their
defense budgets.
</P>
<P>
   One solution may be trans-Atlantic mergers and joint ventures
between European and American defense industries, a policy the
Department of Defense began pursuing this summer. Such mergers
would help Europe catch up with American technology and help insure
the compatibility of the equipment used by the alliance.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, denying that he was
trying to impose a dictatorship, on Tuesday promised that he would
build a democracy in Venezuela that would help end poverty in his
oil-rich nation.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, making his first visit to the United States since being
sworn in as president last January, said the basis for his reform
program was the incongruity between Venezuela's rich natural
resources and the widespread poverty of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can such a rich country with oil, gas, gold, iron and
fertile soil be inhabited by 85 percent poor people?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez answered his own question, attributing the country's
economic disparities to a national malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are leaving a terrible time that we all have lived
through,'' Chavez declared. ``For the last 20 years, we went into a
freefall, an economic and moral crisis. This crisis is the mother
of our movement. We are contributing to leading the people in a
democratic way and a peaceful way out of that time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Venezuela, we had corrupt people incapable of governing,''
he said. ``They took away democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a follower of the great South American 19th century
liberator Simon Bolivar, sounded a populist note as he described
his program and cited American history to emphasize his commitment
to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating a democracy that will recover its ethical
content, its social content and institutional content so that the
different branches of government will really work to serve the
people,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Abraham Lincoln said, `We will have a government of the
people, by the people and for the people,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan president spoke to a gathering of business
executives and media leaders before he addressed the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez told the audience that he knew that his government's
sweeping changes have caused a ``great deal of concern'' in the
United States and elsewhere, but he assured the crowd that his
country would remain free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has a dictatorship arrived? Has violence arrived? Has chaos
arrived? Has the end of democracy arrived?'' Chavez asked. ``I can
tell you that none of those things has happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in his remarks, Chavez acknowledged that he was
``surprised at how fast change has come to Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez spoke at a luncheon hosted by Randolph and Veronica
Hearst to an audience that included financier George Soros; retired
banker David Rockefeller; Mort Zuckerman, publisher of the New York
Daily News; Martin Singerman, publisher of the New York Post;
Gustavo A. Cisneros, prominent businessman in Venezuela and the
United States; Linda Wachner, chairman and CEO of Warnaco; members
of Chavez' Cabinet; and Carlos Biero, Venezuela's ambassador to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, Chavez travels to Washington to meet with
President Clinton. He is expected to renew his assurances to the
American president that his government is committed to democracy
and the anti-drug campaign.

<P>
   Leaders of Venezuela's two main parties, Democratic Action and
the Social Christian Party, which ruled Venezuela for 40 years,
have accused Chavez and his followers of a crude power grab. The
party leaders say the constitutional assembly, elected in July to
rewrite the country's constitution is a tool of Chavez designed to
do an end run around Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis reached a climax late last month when the assembly
voted essentially to shut down the Congress. Chavez's opponents
compared him with Cuba's communist dictator Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, a major purchaser of Venezuelan oil, took a
dim view of the assembly's action. But early this month, the
assembly relented and agreed with the Congress on a power-sharing
scheme until Venezuela's new constitution is completed this month.
A referendum approving or disapproving is expected to be held in
November, according to Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan leaders are now trying to soothe feelings in U.S.
financial and political circles.
</P>
<P>
   However, so far the administration has remained skeptical of
Chavez's promises. Last month, U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering said in Caracas, said the Clinton administration ``will
judge President Chavez's actions and steps to the degree to which
his is able and willing not only in his rhetoric but in his actions
to support the democratic future.''

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavez's actions have generated some criticism abroad
that democracy is being endangered in Venezuela, the country's 23
million people have largely hailed the moves.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the popularity of Chavez, a 45-year-old former
paratroop colonel who led a failed coup attempt in 1992, has risen
as a result of his reform campaign. He was elected last December
with 57 percent of the vote, but a public opinion survey taken in
August by Datanalisis, a leading polling and market research
company in Venezuela, gave him a national approval rating of nearly
75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Shifter, a professor of Latin American
politics at Georgetown University, public sentiment against
Venezuela's Congress has been building for at least a decade. In
addition, other state institutions are seen as remote and
unresponsive.
</P>
<P>
   He said the country's two main political parties are seen as
having set up a spoils system that has led to the squandering of
the country's vast oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite having the largest oil reserves outside the
Middle East, nearly 80 percent of the Venezuelan population lives
under the poverty line, defined as an income of $400 a month for a
family of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Chavez, Venezuelans' disgust at the prevailing system
justified drastic action, using whatever means necessary,'' Shifter
said.

COMMENTARY: GO AHEAD, BORE ME! 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead. Get crazy for a minute. In the wake the latest
Israeli-Palestinian agreement there are several reasons to be just
a tad optimistic about the prospects for a final settlement. I
could go down the whole list, but the most exciting thing is the
silence _ the deafening silence with which the silent majorities in
both Israel and the Arab world have embraced this latest deal.
</P>
<P>
   The tough-minded accord that the Israeli prime minister, Ehud
Barak, recently negotiated to improve and implement the Wye
agreement was exactly what the Israeli everyman has been looking
for. The Israeli center concluded that it was not comfortable with
the idealist approach to peacemaking of Shimon Peres and, to some
extent, Yitzhak Rabin. They seemed to be going too fast. And then
the Israeli center decided it was not comfortable with the cynicism
and media manipulations of Bibi Netanyahu, who only seemed to want
to go nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli center wanted something in between _ someone who was
more interested in making a difference than in making a point,
someone who wouldn't give away anything cheap, but someone who
would just do it, if and when the ``it'' on the table made sense.
That is what Barak represents. A few days after the Israeli Knesset
ratified the accord, I asked an Israeli friend, Victor Friedman, a
consultant who lives in the village of Zichron Yaakov, what was the
mood. He messaged back: ``I've been trying to take the pulse of the
country. The problem is, I'm having a hard time finding it. When I
ask people what's been going on, the universal answer is `nothing.'
So I continue to give Barak high marks for his amazing ability to
make progress without arousing strong emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak says that by Feb. 13 he wants to have worked out the
outline of a final deal with the Palestinians _ including
Jerusalem, water, settlements and refugees. That's very ambitious.
But the silence in Israel suggests that Barak is going to have a
relatively free hand. And even if the Big Deal can't be struck,
Barak will have the latitude to offer the Palestinians a mini-deal:
a Palestinian state in a large part of the West Bank, in return for
guarantees of demilitarization and a willingness to postpone the
unresolved existential issues, such as Jerusalem, for later. For an
ailing Arafat, who wants to see a Palestinian state before he dies,
that could be tempting.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for a little optimism is the partnership that's
been restored. Barak actually had Arafat to his house for talks.
During the past few years no problem was too small for the two
sides to find a way to argue forever about it. Today, the mood is
no problem is too large that they can't find a way to manage it.
That may not last, but, for now, it's a real asset. Said the U.S.
negotiator Aaron Miller: ``If there is one thing we have learned
it's that the odds of implementation, for any agreement between
Israelis and Palestinians, go way up if they are problem-solving
with one another directly, and making commitments to one another
directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up and you find that they're increasingly building a
critical mass of people in Israel and the Arab world, not who love
each other, but, much more important, who are willing and able to
ignore each other. We know now that love is not going to be part of
any Israeli-Arab deal. But we can hope for silent acquiescence. The
way to build silence is by building an expanding pool of people who
not only want to tend their own gardens, without reference to the
other side, but who are able to do so. That's why things like the
safe passage road between Gaza and the West Bank, or the new port
in Gaza, which were part of the latest accord, are important.
</P>
<P>
   The parties' ability to focus inward will never be 100 percent,
because they're too intertwined and there will always be people
without gardens, and therefore there will always be another bomb
that can crash the silence. But you can get a deal where a
significant portion of Palestinians and Israelis are simply no
longer interested in the conflict so that the worst explosions are
contained. The more people who yawn about the peace process _ and
get exercised instead about democracy, tariffs, schools and
religious issues _ the more you should take heart.
</P>
<P>
   The romance of the peace process is over. For now, love will not
be its product or byproduct. I'm rooting for indifference and
acquiescence. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall make us
bored.

GRAVEL PIT OPERATOR'S PROPOSAL SPLITS LONGTIME RESIDENTS,
NEWCOMERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUNCTION, Texas _ A gravel pit operator's plan to make asphalt
on the banks of the scenic North Llano River has caused friction
between longtime residents and urban-refugee newcomers in this town
that calls itself the ``front porch of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks say the proposal by the well-established company
won't hurt anybody. Even a major flood over the riverside pit
wouldn't ruin the scenic waterway as it winds through town, they
contend.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are residents who argue that Texas
environmental regulators and local governments have proven inept at
policing this and other gravel pits. In the midst of another
drought, the notion of using oily substances near clean water
worries these residents enough to produce a petition drive, heated
public meetings and a growing network of activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last clean river in Texas,'' said Bill Neiman, a
resident for five years. ``This is not just a Junction problem.
This is for everyone in Texas to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman moved his family here from the Dallas area to escape
health problems that he said were caused by big-city smog.
   In the middle are those like Kimble County Judge Delbert
Roberts, who want more information before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing that any member of the Commissioner's Court of
this county wants is any kind of pollution,'' he said. He's waiting
for environmental experts to clarify the likely impact of the
asphalt plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never say pollution is justifiable because we need
jobs, we need industry. No sir,'' Roberts said. ``That's just
common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   All the factions among the county's 4,500 residents are waiting
to find out if the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
grants an air emissions permit to Weirich Bros. Inc. of Johnson
City. A tentative decision could come this fall.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, the Weirich company has been mining gravel along
the North Llano where it joins the South Llano. Their confluence
gave the town its name and produced the Llano River, which cuts
eastward through the Hill Country and empties into Lake LBJ.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're proposing to do would not be harmful to people,
wildlife or the environment,'' insists co-owner Terry Weirich.
</P>
<P>
   Because of water contamination dangers, Weirich said he'd prefer
not to make the asphalt beside the river, but new regulations at
the state Department of Transportation favor bidders who provide
precoated crushed rock for state highway improvements. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``This is a process that has been shoved down our throats by
the Texas Department of Transportation,'' Weirich said. ``When they
told me I was going to have to do this, I pleaded with them not to.
I didn't think this was a proper thing to do on the river. I'm
having to do this to retain my share of business.''  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; As it is, Weirich said he won't have the necessary permit in
time to bid for jobs next year. The coated gravel would be used in
the transportation agency's San Angelo region, which includes
Junction.
</P>
<P>
   The plant currently operates with the only state permit required
_ a river dredging permit from the Texas Department of Parks and
Wildlife. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The state's authority is so splintered and in most cases so
thin that it really is a problem,'' said Parks and Wildlife
official Rollin MacRae, who oversees regulation of the five
riverbed gravel operations in Texas, including three on the Brazos
and one on the North Sulphur River.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a bad operator, then they can go a long way''
without consequence, he said. But the Junction site is not known as
a trouble spot, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The facility also has water-related permits from two federal
agencies, but neither has intervened in the current dispute. Water
is used to cleanse gravel after it is mined with a dredging crane,
although the pit is inactive due to seasonal low river flow. When
the pit is operating, water used to clean gravel is supposed to
pass through a settling pond before reaching the river, a state
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real requirement is that they reintroduce 90 percent
of the waters they extract from the Llano River back into the Llano
River,'' said TNRCC spokesman Ruben Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   Downstream water clouding was attributed to the plant after a
storm earlier this year, but Ochoa said it was quickly corrected
with repairs to a storm-damaged berm. A fuel spill also was cited
and remedied, Ochoa said, noting that no formal complaints have
been lodged about dust or other air particulates drifting into the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weirich Bros. has been responsive to the TNRCC and respectful
of the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed air permit for Weirich's mobile precoating
equipment would allow emission of up to 7 pounds per hour of
volatile organic compounds and the plant would be authorized to
produce up to 50 tons of precoat gravel per hour. Both amounts were
described as harmless by Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facility is relatively small compared to asphalt
facilities that are permitted by the TNRCC on a pretty regular
basis. The typical facility will produce 200 to 300 tons per
hour,'' he said, ``and the larger ones will produce 600 to 1,000
tons per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   The state engineers' recommendation will be sent to the
conservation commission's three members. More than 200 people have
signed petitions seeking a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   If the permit is granted, opponents of the plan would have to
decide whether to pay for a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman said a few hunters from Houston already have contributed
a small amount of money to an ad hoc group that is questioning the
air quality permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't come here only for the deer,'' Neiman said. ``It's
the last clean place in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a false radio news report that the permit had already
been granted resulted in an incident that shows how emotional the
issue has become: A neighbor of the gravel plant whose toddler has
respiratory problems broke into tears when she heard that report.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic woman's first call was to Neiman, the man who gets
the blame by some people when they complain about meddling
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Neiman brings a unique viewpoint to the debate. As a
private pilot who routinely takes to the air to seek fields of
wildflowers for seed havesting, he often soars over the gravel pit,
which is mostly hidden from public view because it is tucked behind
tall tree lines and around river bends from public roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one on the ground can see what's been going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman said he began photographing the site several months ago
to document what he said was clouded river water downstream from
the pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed it escalated significantly,'' he said. Neiman said
the photos, which were provided to regulatory agencies, suggest
that earthen barriers and retention ponds don't always work as
intended to filter impurities from the returning river water.
</P>
<P>
   The water is under the jurisdiction of the Lower Colorado River
Authority, whose officials said last week they will upgrade
water-quality monitoring on the Llano River next month by
installing a new pollution detection device downstream from the
pit. The agency said the nearest closest monitoring station is more
than 30 miles downriver.
</P>
<P>
   In all, at least seven governmental entities have some
regulatory authority over the pit's operations, which also fall
under the jurisdictions of the county and city.
</P>
<P>
   Weirich said the array of regulators, which also includes the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, can be befuddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, there seems to be something new and different,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects a protracted struggle to secure the air permit. If
obtained, he next would seek a wastewater discharge permit, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not looking forward to it ... but I do believe the
public outcry is unfounded. We're probably 10 times smaller than
most plants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else to do but fight this and stick to my
guns. The demand for this material is not just going to die because
there are some environmentalists in Junction, Texas.''

   INDIA: POLLS PUT HINDUS AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll by the private Star TV said the Hindu
nationalist-led coalition is heading for a sweeping victory in
national elections that conclude Oct. 3. Another exit poll,
broadcast by the state television network, put the coalition firmly
in the lead, though not by such a large margin. A third, smaller
exit poll, by a regional newspaper in the state of Maharashtra,
showed the coalition narrowly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN: LIBERAL LEADER RE-ELECTED
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democratic Party re-elected Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi as its president, thus extending his term as head of the
government. Obuchi, who has been in office a year, has proven
unexpectedly popular, using his political skills to cobble together
a coalition that insures him legislative success and doling out
money to push the economy.

</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: GOALS TO END POVERTY
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on a recent pledge by Prime Minister Tony Blair to
eradicate child poverty in Britain in 20 years, the government set
a series of measurable goals to improve housing, health care and
education, increase jobs and incomes and counter bias. Social
Security Secretary Alistair Darling said, ``For the first time a
government is standing up to be counted setting specific standards
against which we will be judged tackling poverty and its causes.''
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN IRELAND: CLASHES CONTINUE
</P>
<P>
   The rival Catholic and Protestant parties, Sinn Fein and the
Ulster Unionists, met together with Sen. George Mitchell in Belfast
but continued to clash over whether the Northern Ireland peace
agreement could go forward without any disarmament by IRA
guerrillas. Mitchell, chairman of the talks that led to the April
1998 accord, is in the third week of a mission to rescue the
stalemated accord, and a spokesman said, ``There is no formula on
the table at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: VATICAN CURBS ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Karl Lehmann, the head of the German Bishops' Conference,
has received a letter from the Vatican telling German bishops that
the church can no longer hand out counseling certificates to women
to enable them to get abortions. Under German law, a woman wanting
to end her pregnancy must first receive a certificate saying she
has been counseled by an advisory service. One-sixth of the 1,500
such services in the country are run by the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: NEW CHIRAC RIVAL
</P>
<P>
   The already frazzled right-wing party of President Jacques
Chirac suffered a new split when a sixth candidate, Michele
Alliot-Marie, entered the race to head the Gaullist movement, the
Rally for the Republic. This will make it even harder for Chirac to
unite the party behind his effort to be re-elected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE, ITALY: ONE-DAY CAR BAN
</P>
<P>
   Paris and Rome, and more than 150 other European towns and
cities, will join to celebrate a pedestrians' day on Wednesday by
keeping cars out of urban centers. Many boulevards, avenues and
squares will be accessible only to strollers, rollerskaters,
joggers and pedicabs. Some will allow buses and electric vehicles.

</P>
<P>
   Fourteen academics and intellectuals who are trying to help
eight opposition parties break the impasse in talks over forming a
coalition for the July 2000 general elections said they were
writing a new proposal for how the parties could pick a single
presidential candidate. But Vicente Fox and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
the two main opposition candidates, exchanged icy greetings in a
chance public encounter and both suggested they are writing the
coalition out of their plans.

</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: PROTEST ON U.N. ENVOY
</P>
<P>
   Israel protested the naming by Secretary-General Kofi Annan of a
special envoy to the Mideast, saying Annan had expanded the title
and functions beyond that of a coordinator of U.N. activities in
the region. Terje Roed-Larsen was named special coordinator for the
Middle East Peace Process and Annan's personal representative to
the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian
Authority. Israel's U.N. mission says the title implies a role for
the organization in peace talks and is ``unacceptable to the
government of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ: JOURNALIST HURT IN ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   A Swedish journalist was slightly hurt in southern Iraq when a
missile apparently fired by a Western warplane landed within 50
yards of a car in which he was riding. Jan Arell, of The Goteborg
Post, said the attack had been preceded by nearby antiaircraft
fire. U.S. military spokesmen confirmed that American and British
planes had been in action at about the time Arell was hurt.

 &HT;    Republican delivers scathing assessment of Atlanta Olympics
bidding
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (w) Washington and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House Republican on Tuesday accused Atlanta
Olympics officials and the International Olympic Committee of
engaging in a ``pattern of corruption'' to win the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol Hill news conference, Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.)
strongly disputed assertions by Atlanta organizers that the city's
bid process was ``open and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little you can think of that wasn't on the table
to try and get'' votes, said Upton, who plans to call Olympics
Chief Billy Payne and former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young to testify.
``And it shouldn't happen. It's wrong. There's a word called
'ethics.' Clearly votes were for sale and it's got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Upton delivered his assessment of the Atlanta bid process less
than a week after Atlanta organizers submitted a report to Congress
outlining what Atlanta officials did to influence the IOC, whose
members voted in 1990 to give Atlanta the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The report details how Payne and other top officials gave lavish
gifts and travel and offered scholarships and job assistance to IOC
members and their families. Many of the gifts and extra travel were
in direct violation of IOC rules. Several U.S. laws were also
broken, Upton said, but prosecutions are unlikely because the
statute of limitations has expired.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings scheduled for the week of Oct. 11, Upton will call
Payne, Young and IOC chief Juan Antonio Samaranch to explore
possible legislation to govern future Olympics. Samaranch refused
to testify at a Senate hearing earlier this year, and Upton said
House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley (R-Va.) was prepared
to subpoena Samaranch if he refused to testify again next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that he'll be cooperative and that we can get to
the bottom of this,'' said Upton, who chairs the House Commerce
Committee subcommittee on oversight and investigations. ``We want
to ask him, 'Did the IOC not know about this?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Because Samaranch is not a U.S. citizen, he can be served with a
subpoena only if he enters the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Others invited to testify are former Maine Sen. George Mitchell,
who authored a report about excessive gift-giving in Salt Lake
City's bid for the 2002 winter Games, and Peter Ueberroth, who
organized the 1984 summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and who is a
member of a new IOC commission working on reforms of the bid
process.
</P>
<P>
   Former attorney general Griffin Bell, who authored the report to
Congress on the Atlanta Games, will also testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the right time to discuss the future of the Olympic
Games, and we are delighted to participate in that process,'' Bell
said Tuesday. ``Much recent discussion has focused on questionable
bidding practices and what has gone wrong. I hope that this hearing
will encourage new discussion about what is good about the Games
and how to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Upton said his panel will consider ending the IOC's exemption
from the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as a possible way to stop
the long-standing practice of gift-giving to IOC members to
influence the selection of host cities for the games.
</P>
<P>
   And he suggested the U.S. businesses that provide much of the
financial support for the Olympics through advertising might be
willing to pressure the IOC to clean up the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Next month's hearings will be the second this year into
allegations of excessive gift giving to IOC members on the part of
U.S. host cities. In April, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) held
hearings into the allegations surrounding the Salt Lake City bid
process.
</P>
<P>
   Upton's hearings will likely be another forum for members of
Congress to express their unhappiness with the pace of internal
reforms at the IOC, and with the reluctance of Samaranch to fully
acknowledge the scope of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Upton declined to draw too many comparisons between Atlanta and
Salt Lake City, but said apparent misconduct in both arose from the
same ``culture of corruption'' that permitted bid cities to offer
any gift or inducement to win the support of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping that what happened in Salt Lake City was an
aberration,'' Upton said. ``Clearly it wasn't. The sky was the
limit in terms of the gifts being offered and the number being
accepted. It's got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Upton released copies of memos and
letters found in the files of Atlanta organizers that pointed to
some of the most egregious violations.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the memos from Payne to staff identify the specific
gifts or inducements that would be welcome by a particular IOC
member. For a Russian IOC member, Payne said, ``decorations for
their new home would be appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   For another, Payne offered to help have the member's book
translated into English. On another occasion, Payne wrote to
Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta to ask for help in getting a job
for the son of an IOC member from Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Payne also arranged for IOC members and their spouses to play
golf at the Augusta National Golf Club, a perk that had been
suggested to Payne by the IOC member from Switzerland, Marc Hodler,
who blew the whistle on influence-peddling in the IOC when the Salt
Lake scandal erupted last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Upton generally praised Atlanta officials for opening
their records to his committee and cooperating with its
investigation, the Michigan Republican said Atlanta officials
should have ``blown the whistle a lot earlier than they did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have to give some of these sweet gifts that in any
normal layman's definition one would feel was bad,'' Upton said.
``Would have they gotten the Games if they had not done so? I don't
know. Maybe that's something we'll ask Samaranch.''
</P>
<P>
   A bid committee spokesman would not respond to Upton's harsh
characterization of Atlanta's campaign tactics. ``We recognize that
the report has caught the interest of the Commerce committee,''
said Lee Echols, a spokesman for Payne, ``but if our report leads
to a progressive discussion and analysis of what can strengthen the
Olympic movement, then we believe our report will have served a
good purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs laws were broken and trade embargoes ignored, according
to disclosures in the Atlanta report, said Upton . But he added it
was unlikely the Justice Department, which is investigating the
Salt Lake City bid process, would be called into examine them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what our focus is now,'' he said. ``Our focus is to
make sure that it doesn't happen again.''

<P>
   Skye Noe was about 15 miles outside of Abilene, Texas, nearing
the end of an all-day drive from his Colorado hometown to Abilene
Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Lonzo Wallace, a Fort Worth, Texas, Fire Department deputy
chief, and his wife, Nell, were on their way home to suburban
Burleson after visiting their sons in college, one at the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs and the other at Texas Tech University
in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it was a miracle that the 18-year-old student and
veteran firefighter chanced upon each other along that dark stretch
of Interstate 20 in the early morning hours of Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a heroic and life-saving meeting, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Noe, tired and lulled to sleep by the monotonous drive, veered
off the roadway, down a steep incline and crashed into a concrete
embankment.
</P>
<P>
   His Chrysler New Yorker burst into flames, trapping him inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallaces, traveling behind him, saw the car plunge off the
highway and stopped. Lonzo Wallace raced to pull Noe from the
flaming wreckage, then just hours later drove to Fort Worth for a
meeting; his wife used their cell phone to call 911, then stayed at
the hospital with Noe until his parents arrived from Aurora, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're just both angels,'' said the teen's mother,
Kathleen Noe. ``To find someone that would take time out of their
lives to help somebody else is very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Their heroics didn't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Wallaces were honored in a ceremony during the
Fort Worth City Council meeting. On Monday, they were recognized at
a special ceremony and lunch at Abilene Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Barnard, the Dean of Campus Life at Abilene Christian,
said the Wallaces' action ``is a great message for our students
about the kind of people we're educating them to be, the kind of
people that will get involved in society and get involved in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wallaces are reluctant heroes. News about their actions
would not surface from their lips, but from an Abilene paramedic
who alerted the Fort Worth Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``God just meant for us to be there and to do what we did,''
Lonzo Wallace said. ``It's kind of amazing when you really thing
about it.''
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skye Noe had attended a church function in Denver that weekend
and was more than half way through the 12-hour drive to Abilene
when his car's starter went out in Dumas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Labor Day (weekend), so it was a real hard job to try
to find a mechanic,'' Noe said.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours later, the car was repaired and he was back on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Lonzo and Nell Wallace had attended parents weekend at the Air
Force Academy, where their oldest son is a student, and then
stopped at Texas Tech to visit their younger son.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 46, first spotted Noe on the highway leading out of
Lubbock, and the two drivers took turns following each other. They
temporarily separated when Noe stopped for gas, then met up again
on I-20, just outside of Merkle, after the Wallaces pulled over and
swapped seats for Nell Wallace to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Noe's) car came past, I said something to the effect to
my wife that, `That was the car I was following early and if you
get behind it, it's a good person to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   About 35 miles outside of Abilene, Noe said, the day's long
drive began to wear on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all my windows down and the radio on full blast just
trying to stay awake,'' Noe said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, shortly before 1 a.m., he fell asleep at
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a mile marker, woke up and slammed on my brakes,'' Noe
said. ``I remember going off the edge and going toward the concrete
embankment. I don't actually recall the collision.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling behind the Chrysler, the Wallaces had watched it veer
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went off the road onto the median and then he just
disappeared in between the two bridges,'' Lonzo Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace told his wife to stop and call 911 while he ran to the
top of the approximately 14-foot embankment. Down below, the
wrecked car lay on its side, bursting into flames.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver who had also stopped ran for his fire
extinguisher as Wallace scooted down the steep embankment toward
the burning car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear him down there. He was moaning,'' Wallace
recalled. ``I hollered to him to crawl out of the car, but he
couldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   Noe said he had been knocked unconscious and came to in a daze,
his body hanging halfway out the door. He was bleeding heavily from
a gash on the head and later would learn he also had a crushed
vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing some of my stuff on fire,'' Noe said. ``I
remember his voice yelling, but I couldn't really move. He ran up
and grabbed me under my arms and dragged me.''
</P>
<P>
   As they waited for help, Lonzo Wallace called Noe's parents in
Colorado to let them know about the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke them up and told them what was going on,'' Wallace
said. ``I put the phone up to (Noe's) ear so his dad could hear his
voice.''

   PLUM ISLAND, N.Y. _ Alarmed by what the Clinton administration
views as the growing threat of biological terrorism to America's
food supply, the Agriculture Department is seeking money to turn
the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, one mile off Long Island,
into a top security laboratory where some of the most dangerous
diseases known to man or beast can be studied.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department already operates here at Plum Island,
just across Gardiners Bay from the wealthy Hamptons, a laboratory
where such dreaded foreign animal diseases as foot-and-mouth and
African swine fever are examined. But the department is seeking $75
million this year and $140 million over the next two years to
upgrade the center to handle even more dangerous animal diseases
that can affect humans.
</P>
<P>
   While there are four civilian military laboratories in America
equipped to study such diseases _ technically known as Biosafety
Level Four facilities _ their work is focused on germs that
primarily affect humans, not domestic animals or plants.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the proposed expansion and upgrading of Plum
Island is part of a new effort by the Clinton administration to
deter terrorists who might spread germs to destroy American crops
or livestock for political purposes or financial gain, a threat
they now see as equal to that of terrorist attacks aimed at people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the contribution of crop and animal exports to the
nation's prosperity, we must do far more to protect our plant and
animal resources,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., co-author of
legislation in 1991 and 1996 that provided money to bolster
defenses against unconventional terrorism and stop the
proliferation of such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about food per se; Americans would not go hungry
if we were attacked,'' said Floyd P. Horn, the administrator of the
Agricultural Research Service, who helped persuade the
administration to include his agency in January in its
counter-terrorism plans and programs. ``But such an attack, or even
a credible threat, would severely disrupt America's economic and
social infrastructure for weeks, if not months or years.''
</P>
<P>
   Plum Island, which was once operated by the U.S. Army Chemical
Corps, was designated as an animal-disease research center and
transferred to the Agriculture Department in the early 1950s. It is
already what scientists call an agricultural ``Biosafety Level
Three'' center, which means that its containment areas, which hold
germs dangerous to animals, have filtered air, sealed doors and
negative air pressure that prevents germs from leaking out of the
labs. Liquid waste is decontaminated.
</P>
<P>
   All who enter the labs wear white lab coats and slippers. After
leaving the containment areas, they are required to shower, shampoo
their hair, scrub their nails and rinse their mouths, since lethal
germs can live in human throats and infect animals up to two days
later. To stop viruses or microbes from escaping to the mainland,
no clothing or articles, even eyeglasses, are permitted to leave
the labs without being soaked in disinfectant, said Dr. Alfonso
Torres, the deputy administrator of the Agriculture Department's
Veterinary Services Division and former director of the center, who
conducted this reporter on a tour.
</P>
<P>
   The building's perimeter is also tightly guarded. While Torres
declined to discuss specific security measures, the shores of this
pork-chop-shaped, 840-acre island are said by federal officials to
be monitored by electronic sensors and patrolled by boats and
helicopters. Once a year, deer and other animals that have swum
across to the island are killed in what island officials call a
controlled hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease on the island in
1978, which led Plum scientists to abandon their holding areas for
large animals, ``there has never been a leak of a dangerous
pathogens to the mainland from Plum Island,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the next level of biosafety would require that
scientists working with dangerous pathogens wear the protective
decontaminated suits portrayed in movies like ``Outbreak,'' and
breathe only filtered air pumped into their hoods. Such precautions
would allow scientists to work with even more dangerous animal
pathogens that can affect humans, like the Hendra virus, which
afflicts horses, and the Nipah pig virus, named for the Malaysian
village in which it was first isolated this year. The virus has
already killed more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to work closely with local officials and community
groups to allay any concerns about safety,'' said Horn, who
acknowledges that Plum Island has long been shrouded in mystery and
plagued by what he and Torres call unfounded rumors and fears.
</P>
<P>
   The 850-acre island was opened to news organizations only in
1992 in response to concerns about safety at the center. In 1995,
the Department of Agriculture was fined $111,000 for illegally
storing hazardous chemicals here. Since then, the agency has
changed the contractor who operates the island, and there have been
no other violations.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the threat posed by agro-terrorism remains in
dispute, even within the Clinton administration. Some scientists
and terrorism analysts argue that there is little reason to believe
that terrorists would attack American agriculture or livestock,
since germs that cause such diseases have been around for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence reports increasingly conclude that several
countries, including Iraq, have developed germs to attack the food
supplies of their adversaries. And senior American officials now
believe that an outbreak of screw worm, a disease that afflicts
animals and people, was spread deliberately 14 years ago in Mexico
less than 50 miles from the Texas border by Mexican workers who
were employed in a screw worm eradication program and feared the
loss of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one was ever arrested or charged in the incident,
John Wyss, an Agriculture Department veteran of 25 years who
supervised the project from Washington, said that the agency's
investigations showed that the outbreak, given its nature and
location, had to have been deliberate.

49ERS PONDER HOW TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ One of the first things Steve Mariucci did
on Monday morning was pull right tackle Jeremy Newberry into his
office.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers coach wasn't looking to extend blame. He only wanted
to see where Newberry's head was a day after the New Orleans Saints
rocked Steve Young's world. Apparently, Newberry was OK enough that
Mariucci didn't lose faith in him for Monday's game against
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just asked me what the deal was,'' said Newberry, a
second-year player who moved from center to tackle in the
offseason. ``I told him I wasn't playing like I normally do. I was
just trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Newberry wasn't the sole reason Young endured one of his
worst beatings in Sunday's 28-21 victory, he is the least
experienced lineman and the one who protects Young's backside.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Newberry is the lineman the coaches have to be most
concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci acknowledged he has considered replacing Newbrry with
right guard Derrick Deese, who also has experience at tackle. But
for now, Mariucci doesn't seem willing to make a quick alteration
to his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy had a tough game,'' Mariucci said. ``He got frustrated
early in the game and never recovered mentally. He has to grow and
get better. He's been much better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   The personnel will remain the same for another week, Mariucci
said, but he realizes something has to change. The Saints sacked
Young five times and knocked him down 21 times overall. They
reached him by rushing four down linemen and by sending waves of
blitzers as well, leaving the 49ers to ponder how best to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci emphasized that normally sacks aren't totally the fault
of offensive linemen. Good coverage, a missed assignment by a
running back or a passer's refusal to unload the ball in a timely
fashion all can contribute to a quarterback's demise.
</P>
<P>
   However, offensive line coach Pat Morris felt otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line will take the brunt of the criticism and
they should,'' Morris said. ``It's the nature of the position. You
have to protect the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' problems with the Saints' pressure can be traced to
two factors.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the 49ers, as in a season-opening loss to
Jacksonville, were forced to use come-from-behind tactics. That led
them to abandon a running game that didn't intimidate anyone to
begin with, enabling the Saints defense to tee off on Young (who
said he felt fine Monday).
</P>
<P>
   The other factor was personnel. Starting left tackle Dave Fiore
underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Sept. 4 and
still isn't 100 percent. The 49ers also will be without their best
blocking back (Garrison Hearst) throughout the season and their
best blocking tight end (Greg Clark) is still recovering from five
broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really appreciated having a good blocking tight end,''
Young said. ``I always liked having a tight end like Brent Jones, a
guy who could get open in space. As far as the running game and
having a sixth guy to protect in the passing game, and still be
able to get down the middle of the field, I really value that
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the 49ers are able to run effectively and return Clark to
the lineup, they will have to contemplate their offensive line
situation, one that is muddled by a lack of depth. If Deese has to
move to tackle, Mariucci would have to choose from a host of
unproven guard candidates (Newberry, rookie Tyrone Hopson and
second-year man Phil Ostrowski) or play reserve Ben Lynch at center
and move starting center Chris Dalman to guard.
</P>
<P>
   These appear to be options Mariucci will only seriously consider
if what happened on Sunday becomes a weekly occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blitz game,'' Mariucci said. ``Pressuring the
quarterback is a sign of the times. We have to handle it. We got
blitzed last year. This is nothing new. What's different is Steve
got hit 21 times. That's what we have to correct.''

 PLUM ISLAND, N.Y.: been deliberate.

<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews in Russia and Kazakhstan, former Soviet
scientists also disclosed that they had developed weapons
specifically aimed at crops and livestock. Sadigappar Mamadaliyev,
the director of the Scientific Agricultural Research Institute, now
in the Republic of Kazakhstan, said that in Soviet times, his was
one of four centers dedicated to developing lethal germs as weapons
against foreign crops and animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviets here concentrated on cow and sheep pox and blue
tongue,'' he said. ``We also cooperated closely with the
All-Russian Institute of Animal Health in Vladimir, Russia, which
worked on foot-and-mouth disease, and with the Pokrov Institute of
Veterinary Virology, which specialized in African swine and horse
fevers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamadaliyev said he had more than 200 strains of dangerous
animal pathogens at his institute, whose former scientific staff of
150 has shrunk by half from budget cuts and which is struggling to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 10,000 Russians working on plant and animal
pathogens in the former Soviet germ warfare program, said Ken
Alibek, a senior germ researcher who defected to the United States
in 1992 and who recently wrote a book, ``BioHazard'' (Random
House), in which he describes the vast scale and depth of the
Soviet Union's illegal germ offensive warfare program. Many of
those scientists are now without jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Several Russian scientists said that Iranians had recently
visited their institutes, some offering huge salaries to work in
Tehran and specifically expressing interest in research on animal
and plant microbes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by growing concern about the proliferation of such
expertise and of such dangerous germs, President Clinton ordered
the government last year to prepare defenses against germ and other
unconventional attacks on the nation's plants and animals. In
January, Horn recruited four former Pentagon intelligence analysts
and terrorism experts to form the Agricultural Research Services'
first unit to evaluate such threats. In April, the White House
formally included the Agriculture Department in the group of
agencies that meet regularly under National Security Council aegis
to weigh plans to deter or respond to unconventional terrorism, a
$2.8 billion effort.
</P>
<P>
   At a public meeting in September in Washington, Horn discussed
his concern about the nation's growing vulnerability to
agro-terrorism, mentioning his desire to upgrade Plum Island and
make it a centerpiece of the government's effort to protect the
nation's food supply.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, who is chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, plans
to hold hearings on agro-terrorism in October that will explore the
administration's plans for Plum Island.
</P>
<P>
   Plum Island has 300 employees, 60 of whom are scientists, 70
buildings, many of them closed or deteriorating, independent power
and water treatment plants, and a fleet of four boats. Torres calls
the $14.5 million that the government spends a year on Plum Island
a ``small investment'' in the nation's food security, given the
$140 billion earned from commodities exports.
</P>
<P>
   As disease after disease has been eradicated, Torres said,
Washington has reduced the budget for veterinary services, which
now stands at $116 million a year. Yet demand keeps growing.
Agriculture scientists now conduct about 500 investigations of
foreign animal diseases a year, more than half of them in birds
brought back to the country by the millions of American travelers
each year. ``Our emergency response systems are becoming very, very
thin,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Franz, a vice president of the Southern Research
Institute and former director of the U.S. Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases, a Biosafety Level Four center,
maintains that recent changes in the structure of American
agriculture have heightened vulnerability. Increased trade and
international travel, reduced genetic diversity in farm animals and
the high concentration of animals in yards have increased the risk
that highly infectious diseases will emerge and spread, ``be they
naturally, or deliberately introduced, '' Franz said.
</P>
<P>
   The changing nature of terrorism also heightens the threat, says
Thomas W. Frazier, president of a consortium of private companies
called GenCon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now hundreds of attacks a year on agricultural
targets in the United States, Canada, and Britain as a form of
violent protest by extremist environmental protection or animal
rights groups,'' he said. Plus, the nation's intelligence analysts
expect increased assaults by state-sponsored bioterrorists,
militant religious cults and other extremist groups on such targets
as food and agriculture.

   The largest animal disease outbreak in America in recent
history, wrote Corrie Brown, the head of the pathology department
at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine, was
one caused by avian influenza that erupted in Pennsylvania some 15
years ago. A deadly viral variant spread quickly, prompting
agriculture officials to kill all exposed chickens at a cost of $63
million to the federal government. Economists estimated that had
they not been killed, the cost to U.S. agriculture would have been
as high as $5.6 billion. Even so, Brown concluded, the six-month
outbreak caused poultry prices to rise by $349 million.

FBI WARNS THAT FREED FALN MEMBERS POSE CRIMINAL THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Puerto Rican nationalists released last week
under presidential decree are dangerous criminals who ``represent a
threat to the United States,'' a senior FBI official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are terrorists. They are criminals,'' Neil Gallagher, the
FBI's assistant director for national security, told the House
Committee on Government Reform.
</P>
<P>
   And in an embarrassing split with the White House, FBI Director
Louis Freeh also warned in a letter released Tuesday by the
committee that freeing the members of the Armed Forces of National
Liberation, known by the Spanish acronym of FALN, could be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Letting out the nationalists would ``psychologically and
operationally enhance the ongoing violent and criminal activities
of Puerto Rican terrorist groups,'' Freeh said in the draft letter
to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde, Republican of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had asked Freeh on Aug. 27 to reveal his position on the
clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   Those released ``would likely return committed, experienced,
sophisticated and hardened terrorists to the clandestine
movement,'' said the letter, which was never officially sent to
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his most detailed public defense to date
of the politically explosive decision, said he had considered the
clemency offer to the 16 FALN members case by case, and they were
all serving ``extremely long sentences'' that were ``out of
proportion to their crimes.'' No politics was involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-page letter to a political ally, Representative Henry
Waxman, Democrat of California, Clinton said the 16 FALN members _
14 of whom accepted his clemency offer _ were ``not convicted of
crimes involving bodily harm to anyone,''and the prisoners'
sentences were ``unduly severe.'' Waxman read the letter at the
start of Tuesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Those conclusions were angrily disputed at Tuesday's hearing by
victims of the FALN and by Republican House members. The
administration's own Justice Department appointees were less
critical, but pointedly refused to defend the president for his
clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher and Michael B. Cooksey, assistant director for
correctional programs at the Bureau of Prisons, detailed the crimes
the 16 were believed to have been involved in _ despite the fact
that most of them were convicted of seditious conspiracy. One
inmate, Oscar Lopez, who refused the clemency offer, is so
dangerous he had to be moved to a maximum-security prison and is
considered an escape risk, Cooksey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter-in-law is Puerto Rican, and my two granddaughters
have Puerto Rican heritage,'' said a somber Richard Pastorella, a
retired New York City police detective who was blinded during an
FALN attack. ``When they show me crayon drawings they made, I have
to pretend I see them and appreciate their effort,'' said
Pastorelli, breaking down into quiet tears.
</P>
<P>
   Acting assistant attorney general Jon P. Jennings extended his
``deepest sympathies'' to the victims of the FALN's admitted
campaign of bombing, robbery and murder. Jennings' remarks were the
first, and as yet only, public expression of condolence to the
victims from the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's session carried more theatrical than practical punch,
since Congress cannot reverse a presidential clemency decision.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of Clinton's offer are keeping up the heat. Both
the House and Senate have passed separate resolutions denouncing
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled House is now set to vote again, on the
already-approved Senate resolution. The expected passage of the
resolution would put Clinton in the awkward position of having to
sign it _ thus denouncing himself _ or not sign it, drawing another
round of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty offer to the FALN members has been a political
disaster for the White House and problematic for First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who is exploring a bid for the US Senate seat in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ruling drew criticism from some in law enforcement
that he was ``soft on terrorism.'' And Mrs. Clinton's abrupt
remarks that the clemency offer should be revoked angered Puerto
Rican politicians, not in the least because she did not inform them
before making her comments.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have expressed anger over Clinton's refusal to hand
over documents that might explain how and why the clemency decision
was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't hide behind executive privilege,'' said House Government
Reform Committee Chairman Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, adding
he would issue another document subpoena.

<P>
   Skye Noe was about 15 miles outside of Abilene, Texas, nearing
the end of an all-day drive from his Colorado hometown to Abilene
Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Lonzo Wallace, a Fort Worth, Texas, Fire Department deputy
chief, and his wife, Nell, were on their way home to suburban
Burleson after visiting their sons in college, one at the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs and the other at Texas Tech University
in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it was a miracle that the 18-year-old student and
veteran firefighter chanced upon each other along that dark stretch
of Interstate 20 in the early morning hours of Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a heroic and life-saving meeting, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Noe, tired and lulled to sleep by the monotonous drive, veered
off the roadway, down a steep incline and crashed into a concrete
embankment.
</P>
<P>
   His Chrysler New Yorker burst into flames, trapping him inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallaces, traveling behind him, saw the car plunge off the
highway and stopped. Lonzo Wallace raced to pull Noe from the
flaming wreckage, then just hours later drove to Fort Worth for a
meeting; his wife used their cell phone to call 911, then stayed at
the hospital with Noe until his parents arrived from Aurora, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're just both angels,'' said the teen's mother,
Kathleen Noe. ``To find someone that would take time out of their
lives to help somebody else is very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Their heroics didn't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Wallaces were honored in a ceremony during the
Fort Worth City Council meeting. On Monday, they were recognized at
a special ceremony and lunch at Abilene Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Barnard, the Dean of Campus Life at Abilene Christian,
said the Wallaces' action ``is a great message for our students
about the kind of people we're educating them to be, the kind of
people that will get involved in society and get involved in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wallaces are reluctant heroes. News about their actions
would not surface from their lips, but from an Abilene paramedic
who alerted the Fort Worth Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``God just meant for us to be there and to do what we did,''
Lonzo Wallace said. ``It's kind of amazing when you really thing
about it.''
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skye Noe had attended a church function in Denver that weekend
and was more than half way through the 12-hour drive to Abilene
when his car's starter went out in Dumas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Labor Day (weekend), so it was a real hard job to try
to find a mechanic,'' Noe said.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours later, the car was repaired and he was back on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Lonzo and Nell Wallace had attended parents weekend at the Air
Force Academy, where their oldest son is a student, and then
stopped at Texas Tech to visit their younger son.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 46, first spotted Noe on the highway leading out of
Lubbock, and the two drivers took turns following each other. They
temporarily separated when Noe stopped for gas, then met up again
on I-20, just outside of Merkle, after the Wallaces pulled over and
swapped seats for Nell Wallace to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Noe's) car came past, I said something to the effect to
my wife that, `That was the car I was following early and if you
get behind it, it's a good person to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   About 35 miles outside of Abilene, Noe said, the day's long
drive began to wear on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all my windows down and the radio on full blast just
trying to stay awake,'' Noe said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, shortly before 1 a.m., he fell asleep at
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a mile marker, woke up and slammed on my brakes,'' Noe
said. ``I remember going off the edge and going toward the concrete
embankment. I don't actually recall the collision.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling behind the Chrysler, the Wallaces had watched it veer
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went off the road onto the median and then he just
disappeared in between the two bridges,'' Lonzo Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace told his wife to stop and call 911 while he ran to the
top of the approximately 14-foot embankment. Down below, the
wrecked car lay on its side, bursting into flames.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver who had also stopped ran for his fire
extinguisher as Wallace scooted down the steep embankment toward
the burning car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear him down there. He was moaning,'' Wallace
recalled. ``I hollered to him to crawl out of the car, but he
couldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   Noe said he had been knocked unconscious and came to in a daze,
his body hanging halfway out the door. He was bleeding heavily from
a gash on the head and later would learn he also had a crushed
vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing some of my stuff on fire,'' Noe said. ``I
remember his voice yelling, but I couldn't really move. He ran up
and grabbed me under my arms and dragged me.''
</P>
<P>
   As they waited for help, Lonzo Wallace called Noe's parents in
Colorado to let them know about the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke them up and told them what was going on,'' Wallace
said. ``I put the phone up to (Noe's) ear so his dad could hear his
voice.''

TRUMP SAYS HE HAS SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you don't believe Donald J. Trump is serious
about running for president, the New York City developer has an
unlikely suggestion: read the National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   No, Trump said, he is not referring to the Enquirer's many
stories about Ivana or Marla, or the tales about his dates with
supermodels, or even the recent item about ``Billionaire ladies'
man Donald Trump.'' Trump is enraptured by a recent Enquirer poll
that shows he would make a strong presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the poll of just 100 people doesn't sound terribly
scientific, and it actually shows Trump in second place behind
Republican George W. Bush. But to Trump, this is a ``very powerful
poll'' that could convince him to seek the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all poll-driven,'' Trump said in an interview, adding
that he is very seriously exploring a White House run. As for his
brand of made-for-the-tabloids living, Trump said: ``My life and
lifestyle have been very well-documented. I don't think people will
vote against me or for me because I go out with supermodels.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, author of ``The Art of the Deal'' and ``The Art of the
Comeback,'' said he would tap some of his estimated $2 billion
fortune if he runs for the Reform Party nomination. He expects to
decide by January whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of speculation about Trump's plans, Trump lashed
out at Patrick J. Buchanan, a possible top rival for the party's
nomination, for writing in a just-published book that Adolph Hitler
presented no threat to the United States during World War II.
Buchanan also writes in ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' that ``After
World War II, Jewish influence over foreign policy became almost an
obsession with American leaders.'' Trump said Buchanan's comments
about Hitler ``are crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Buchanan said Sunday that his book has been quoted out of
context, the controversy might slow his plans to leave the
Republican Party and run for the Reform Party nomination, boosting
Trump's standing. Buchanan could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Trump Tuesday reveled in the attention, noting that many of the
Republican candidates for president were ``begging him (Buchanan)
not to leave the party. It is inconceivable to me that I am the
only one who took him on, and I am not even a politician, and
that's maybe why people might like me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, the highest
elected official in the Reform Party, is opposing Buchanan's
candidacy and urging Trump to run.
</P>
<P>
   Trump and Ventura share some political characteristics. Both men
are political outsiders whose celebrity gives them instant name
identification. Both declare themselves to be fiscally conservative
and socially liberal, a contrast with Buchanan, who is antiabortion
and socially conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse is a friend of mine,'' Trump said, adding that the two
have talked about a possible candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   If Trump were to run, his money might make it easier to gain the
party's nomination. Under the Reform Party rules, a national
primary will be held in July, leaving no time for a candidate to
catch on slowly by winning a few early states.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming Reform Party chairman, Jack Gargan, said in a
recent interview that he is concerned a well-financed candidate
could ``stuff the ballot box'' for the primary and walk away with
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a much easier system'' than the state contests held by
the Republican and Democratic parties, Trump said. ``It is not as
rigorous. In many respects, it is much more civil.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump is viewed as a wild longshot and could draw votes away
from both the Democrat and Republican candidates, while Buchanan
was seen mostly as taking votes away from the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume that the cash guarantees him a place at the
table,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, referring to
Trump. ``I really don't think people have a good handle on who he
is, and to the extent they do, I'm not sure it's favorable. He sure
doesn't look and dress as an outsider. But I'm prepared to look at
anybody who has lots of money and political ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump once wrote that he doesn't like the ``bad custom'' of
shaking hands because it spreads so many germs. Asked how he would
handle this staple of campaigning, Trump said, ``Well, I guess I
would just do that, wouldn't I?''
</P>
<P>
   Trump said he has a compelling life story that would resonate
with people of lesser means. His father, Fred, who died earlier
this year, made a fortune building housing for lower- and
middle-income families. Trump is fond of saying he grew up in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't always live in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue,'' he
said. ``I think my best group of people are the so-called working
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump said he watched how people initially were impressed with
the way Ross Perot, the founder of the Reform Party, made his
billions but later soured on the Texan's style. Trump said he has
Perot's upside as a self-made man of millions, but promised he
wouldn't have the downside of getting in trouble for his
statements.
</P>
<P>
   For a man once known as ``The Mouth,'' that may be the toughest
campaign promise for Trump to keep.

STOCKS TAKE A BEATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TRADE-REPORT, JAPAN-ECON)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were pummeled Tuesday, pulled down by a
further slide in the value of the dollar against the yen, warnings
about third-quarter earnings and worries about the earthquake in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who have been nervous about the market for months,
had many reasons to sell equities before the trading session even
began.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of trading Monday, Apple Computer said revenue
and earnings would fall well short of expectations in the current
quarter. Later, the Bank of Japan indicated it would not move to an
easier monetary policy, a step that might have taken some steam out
of the recent rise in the yen against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handy triggers for a selloff were in place before the open,''
said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Currency-related worries deepened a bit later, when the
government reported that July's trade deficit was a record $25.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Major market indexes were all pounded. The Dow Jones industrial
average plunged 225.43 points, or 2.08 percent, to 10,598.47.
Hewlett-Packard, Goodyear Tire, J.P. Morgan, IBM and General
Electric were all big losers. In fact, just two of the 30 stocks
that make up the blue-chip index were able to eke out gains.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market measures also fared poorly. Led by declines in
big stocks like Microsoft, Lucent Technologies, Intel and Dell
Computer, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 27.95 points,
or 2.09 percent, to 1,307.58. The NASDAQ composite index, which
came close to setting a new record on Monday, dropped 65.05 points,
or 2.25 percent, to 2,821.10, pulled down by stocks like Apple
Computer and Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyers' strike continues,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief
investment strategist at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Anxiety
about the dollar, and uncertainty about the Fed and Y2k, have given
people reasons to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some traders, without the announcement from Apple
the market might have fared better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon the metaphor, but Apple was the core of the market's
problems,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the other things you have been trying to shrug off,
from rising interest rates and a weaker dollar to the earthquake in
Taiwan, take on more importance when a leader in the narrow
technology sector says something disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple, a NASDAQ composite component, fell 9 13/16, to 69 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer makers also traded sharply lower. IBM dropped 3,
to 127 1/4. Hewlett-Packard fell 5 1/16, to 99 3/8. Dell Computer
declined 2 3/8, to 46 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   However, the rise in the yen and the bigger-than-expected
monthly trade deficit numbers also played an important role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need $6 billion a week from outside sources to balance our
accounts,'' said Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at Fleet
Financial Group in Boston. ``That is a very significant issue that
has been ignored. And the decline in the dollar is significant to
the foreign investor. If you look at the flows, the marginal buyer
who has determined the price of the big, liquid stocks has been
foreign.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Bonds Decline
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices fell Tuesday as the dollar's decline
against the yen raised concern that foreign investors will sell
their Treasury holdings to guard against further losses in the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the dollar depreciates and people sell Treasuries to go
elsewhere, that's going to cause yields to increase,'' said Alan
Day, who helps invest more than $4 billion at Stratevest Group in
Burlington, Vt. ``I can see 6.25 percent yields pretty easily by
the end of the year if the dollar doesn't turn around,'' compared
with current 30-year yields of 6.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 10/32, to 100 16/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, rose to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent on Monday.

BRADLEY CONTINUES TO GAIN SUPPORT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ As the campaign of Bill Bradley continues
gaining ground, advisers to Vice President Al Gore are hoping that
discrepancies between Bradley's campaign rhetoric and his voting
record will halt his momentum here in the first-primary state.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bradley christened his new Manchester office with an
endorsement from former Senator John A. Durkin, New Hampshire's
last Democratic senator, and Thursday Bradley is expected to
receive the blessing of New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the good news, however, Bradley delivered a warning Tuesday
to the 200 or so supporters joining him on a rainy afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still five to six months away from the day that's
important,'' Bradley said, cautioning against overexuberance after
several polls showing him statistically tied with Gore in New
Hampshire and New York. ``We're still running against establishment
power, we still don't have the same kind of forces and firepower as
the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that kind of outsider, underdog talk by Bradley, Gore's
campaign advisers hope to draw attention to the former New Jersey
senator's years of vote-taking to show that he has changed his mind
on some issues, and can be just as political as any politician.
</P>
<P>
   From Social Security to school vouchers to mandatory prison
sentences to ethanol subsidies, there are openings in which Gore or
his surrogates will likely rebuke his challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley is perceived as an outsider, and there has
been an 18-year track record as an insider engaged in major
legislation,'' said a senior Gore adviser. ``Don't think the
Bradley campaign and the candidacy, when looking in the mirror,
they're not going to see a politician and not some sort of white
knight who can say, `I've never been involved in this messiness of
politics.' You can't say you're something that you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley _ who was in Boston raising money Tuesday night, as was
Gore _ said he plans to stick to the high ground. But he said that
Gore has a record that he will have to defend as well.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley noted that he does have differences with Gore.
Bradley said he believes schools should teach evolution, while the
vice president would also allow schools to teach creationism. And
Bradley said he wants to register all handguns, while Gore would
license only gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is we'll be able to keep this on a positive tone, not
a negative tone,'' Bradley said in an interview Tuesday. ``My hope
is that at the end of the day, people will vote for two candidates
that they esteem, as opposed to one they can still tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Bradley Tuesday told his supporters inside
an overheated furniture warehouse that ``we will protect Social
Security and challenge all Americans to realize their potential.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore supporters contend he could undermine the system by
allowing some of the funds to be privately invested. In 1996, he
voted for a sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by Senator Bob
Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat, to allow workers to put part of
their Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes into the stock
market. The resolution also called for raising the retirement age
to 70 by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he was simply calling for a debate on the subject.
``It was not a vote on the merits,'' he said. ``It means nothing
other than saying, let's talk about Social Security. That's the
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not say whether he currently favors allowing workers to
invest part of their payroll taxes in private investment funds, or
whether he would like to raise the age of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the course of the campaign, I'll lay out a position on
Social Security,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of the vice president have already attacked Bradley for
voting at least seven times since 1980 to provide vouchers for
parents to send their children to private and parochial school.
They argue that government money shouldn't be diverted from public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supports spending more money on public schools, but
plays down his support for tax credits or vouchers throughout his
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he told reporters that while he was a senator, many
of his constituents complained to him about the poor quality of
their public schools. At first, he said, he told them to run for
the school board and change the policies in order to make a
difference. Eventually, he said, he realized that was asking too
much of poor parents struggling to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bradley said, he decided to vote for an experiment to see if
vouchers would create competition between public and private
schools, thereby improving the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Newark Star Ledger, during his first run
for the Senate in 1978, Bradley had already promised to vote for
tuition tax credits for parents who send their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly support aid to nonpublic schools,'' Bradley said at
the time. ``If the credits are the best and only way to do that,
then they'd have my support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged Tuesday that he made a commitment to
supporting tax credits before getting elected to the Senate. But he
said he sees a distinction between tuition tax credits and school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a methodology difference, whether it's tax credit or
vouchers,'' he said. ``The effect is a little different in terms of
having it go through your tax form as opposed to getting something
from the government. My thought is (tax credits) would have a
different effect on the private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent campaign trip to Harlem, Bradley told the
Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network that he would
abolish mandatory sentencing for criminals. When he was in the
Senate, Bradley voted for the ``three-strikes'' rule imposing a
life sentence after three felony convictions, and mandatory
sentences for gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like a good idea at the time,'' Bradley said.
``Make sure people who commit certain crimes go to jail for a time
determined by the Congress. And after the thing being in effect for
several years, it's clear that the discretion of the judge is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because, he said, many first-time offenders are being
sent to prison for 20- and 25-year sentences without allowing
judges to weigh other factors, such as the circumstances of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would drop the three-strikes law, Bradley would
not say. ``I would decide at the time,'' he said. That time would
occur when the issue comes up, he explained: ``In terms of laying
out a new criminal code, I think that's unlikely in the course of a
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsidizing ethanol is the most recent example of Bradley's
changing a long-held position. While he once called the federal
subsidies to corn farmers ``highway robbery,'' he has been
espousing a new view in his campaign stops in Iowa. Bradley said
his previous position was appropriate for a representative of New
Jersey; now, he said, he's running to represent the country as a
whole.

RYLANDER INTRODUCES TASK FORCE TO EXAMINE TEST TAMPERING IN TEXAS
SCHOOLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELANIE MARKLEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Calling herself ``the education watchdog for the
people of Texas,'' Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander introduced a
task force Tuesday that will examine test tampering and data
manipulation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander, speaking at Houston Independent School District
headquarters, said the task force will spend the next year looking
into statewide reports of cheating on tests, bogus dropout rates
and too little money being funneled into instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander's announcement comes after the Texas Education Agency
gave bad ratings to two districts _ Austin and Ysleta _ that
submitted erroneous dropout data. Fourteen other districts are
under investigation. Area districts that are affected include
Houston, Channelview, Clear Creek, North Forest, Pearland and
Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   ``TEA has been catching these problems,'' Rylander said.
``However, the emphasis has been on intervention and enforcement.
We are concentrating on the preventative aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rylander, who also spoke in Dallas and Austin, commended Houston
Superintendent Rod Paige for aggressive action at a half dozen
schools last spring where there was evidence of tampering with
answer documents to the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of an investigation into test tampering, which also
involved 10 other districts, Paige fired one substitute, dismissed
one principal, reprimanded a second principal and suspended three
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander also praised Paige for ordering schools to quit
exempting students from taking the TAAS even though including more
limited-English and special education students resulted in lower
test scores this year.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting surveys and interviews as part of the probe,
Rylander said the task force should know the extent of the cheating
and data-manipulation problems in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tell you today how widespread it is,'' she said,
``but if it is happening at all, it needs to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force will be chaired by Barry Thompson, former
chancellor of the Texas A&AMP;M University System.
</P>
<P>
   Also serving on the committee: Thaddeus Lott, director of four
HISD charter schools; Beatrice Lucio, a principal in Brownsville;
Wilhelmina Delco, a former state representative from Austin;
Michael R. Levy, founder and publisher of Texas Monthly; Roy
Barrera, San Antonio attorney; and Jeri Stone, executive director
and general counsel for the Texas Classroom Teachers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas leads the nation in developing a comprehensive
accountability system,'' Stone said. ``Unfortunately as a
corollary, we also may be a bit ahead of the game in terms of
people discovering where there are loopholes or where there are
opportunities to manipulate the system.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of instructional costs, Rylander said the task
force will study why only 52 cents out of every education tax
dollar in the state is spent on instruction. HISD officials,
however, said they spend 60.4 percent of their funds on
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said the group also will determine if school districts
are accurately reporting their administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some districts may report that they are lowering the number of
administrators, she said, but their offices stay filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we must keep a system of viable public
education,'' Delco said. ``In order to do that, we have to generate
the confidence of the people in this state and the investment they
make through their taxes for public schools.''

 C MAIN-COX &HT;    City officials ask most businesses to close; water deliveries
arrive
 &HT;    By Dawn Bryant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The city of Greenville lost water service
Tuesday, prompting officials to bring in portable toilets and
trucks of water and ask most businesses to close because of fire
and public health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Most Greenville Utilities water customers lost service or water
pressure Tuesday after floodwaters kept the submerged Old River
Road treatment station from meeting demand. Portable toilets popped
up around town as businesses struggled to cope.
</P>
<P>
   It could be at least two days before service is restored. But
GUC officials are working on ways to rig temporary equipment _
similar to efforts that restored electrical service over the
weekend _ to get the water flowing sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try something else to make it work,'' said Malcolm
Green, GUC's general manager/CEO. ``There is a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ River levels seem to have leveled keeping officials from
having to shut off power to Greenville and three-fourths of Pitt
County.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Tar River appeared to hit a crest of 29.72 feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ County officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for the
Clark's Neck area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Preliminary countywide damage estimates, based on property tax
records, are at $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Portable toilets and jugs of water arrived Tuesday to help
residents survive for the next few days without water service,
which was lost earlier that day. Three water distribution points
were expected to open late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The city issued a voluntary closing order for all Greenville
businesses except pharmacies and grocery and convenience stores to
minimize the likelihood of losses if a fire should occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get as much shut off as we can,'' said Ron Moore,
interim fire-rescue chief. ``Our only resources are the water we
carry around in our trucks.'' Those six vehicles hold about 500
gallons each.
</P>
<P>
   Five tankers of firefighting water, which isn't clean enough to
drink, was expected to arrive from Wake County late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also asked neighboring fire stations for help and
identified area swimming pools that could be drained in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County Memorial Hospital pumped water from its
rehabilitation pool for uses other than drinking, including
flushing toilets and cleaning floors. Officials were trying to line
up other water suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   They also were reviewing the possibility of moving patients to a
single unit to conserve. Signs on bathrooms warn patients and staff
not to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is the problem right now,'' said Jeannine Hutson,
hospital spokeswoman. ``This is a significant hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers of Eastern Pines and Bell Arthur water corporations
still have service, but a boil-order remains. As a safety
precaution, residents in those areas should boil cooking and
drinking water for three minutes to kill any bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions also worsened and then improved at the North Holly
Street electric substation, where a fragile setup that ended a
nearly 24-hour blackout Saturday continued to be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Water heights _ just three inches shy of forcing a blackout _
seemed to have leveled, keeping officials from having to shut off
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my feeling we will have made the threshold,'' Green said.
``We should be in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   But an oil slick on the water spotted early Tuesday posed a
potential fire problem.
</P>
<P>
   With 230,000 volts running through the lines, boat crews
guarding the equipment from floating debris had to be pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were trying to find the source of the oil and line up
means to keep it from the wires. If it gets too close, GUC would
have to shut off the power.
</P>
<P>
   A string web brought in Tuesday to collect the oil from the
water's surface should do the trick, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical setup _ one line bringing power in, another
distributing it _ still is a delicate one until the water recedes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will be past the power crisis,'' Green said.
``What we really have is an electrical system with just one switch.
This is a very patched-up substation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar River, which appeared to hit a crest of 29.72 feet
Tuesday, wasn't backing off its attack on the area with its
record-shattering levels.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuations continued Monday night, with county officials
issuing the mandatory order in the Clark's Neck area, which is on
the county's eastern border.
</P>
<P>
   Residents there were directed to shelters at Stokes Elementary
and Washington High schools.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 residents remained in the seven shelters, which
are now operated by the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters north of the river aren't accessible by road, with
officials relying on helicopters and boats to transport food,
medication and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's rains preventing choppers from flying, the Pitt
County Sheriff's Department depended on boats only.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of water service forced officials to relocate about 500
residents in shelters at E.B. Aycock and Wintergreen to two schools
in Ayden, which still has utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday evening, shelter organizers were trying to find
utility-serviced buildings to relocate residents staying in the
North Pitt and Wellcome schools.
</P>
<P>
   Officials urge anyone who had open sores or cut themselves while
in the water to get a tetanus shot, especially if they haven't had
one in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The city continued to monitor the flooded Green Mill Run, which
snakes its way through the city and has forced some of its
neighbors to evacuate. Officials don't anticipate issuing a fourth
round of voluntary notices.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tar River started flooding last week, the city has
transported 775 residents from homes threatened by floods. Hundreds
more fled in their own vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd's 13 inches of rain Wednesday and Thursday fell
on already saturated ground from Tropical Storm Dennis' repeat
visits and other recent rains. The combination has produced the
worst flood in Greenville's history.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary countywide damage estimates, based on property tax
records, are at $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of GUC's 26,130 water customers started noticing a drop in
water pressure Tuesday after the plant couldn't produce enough
water to meet demands, with it tapping overground storage tanks.
Once those 8.5 million gallons are used, the faucets will run dry.
</P>
<P>
   PCMH, which is about 90 percent full, has forestry, National
Guard and private company tankers working with area fire
departments to bring in water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to do our thing using this system,'' hospital
vice president Stephen Lawler said. ``It's probably not the ideal
situation, but it's something we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   With the water crisis, portable toilet vendors were swamped with
calls.
</P>
<P>
   About midday Tuesday, East Coast Rent-A-John received about 30
calls and had 19 messages on the answering machine. The Farmville
business was distributing the dozen or so unrented toilets to
emergency officials and a few retailers offering disaster-relief
materials.

TEXAS GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES STRONGER ENFORCEMENT OF GUN LAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Less than a week after eight people died in a
hail of bullets at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush announced plans on Tuesday to crack down on gun
crimes across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired in part by a Fort Worth program to be unveiled next
week, Bush said Texas Exile, a multi-agency initiative putting
eight new prosecutors on the trail of gun law violators, will make
Texas safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to protect our citizens is to vigorously enforce
the tough laws we have on the books,'' said Bush, who opposes
restrictions such as gun registration and licensing. ``This is a
war on people illegally carrying weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has been
criticized by political rivals for not offering more concrete
solutions to the type of violence that occurred in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the new initiative was not aimed at those critics
nor crafted in response to the Wedgwood massacre. Bush said Texas
Exile has been in the works for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he hopes the program will put a damper on gun
violence but acknowledged it might not have stopped the kind of
rampage Larry Gene Ashbrook unleashed at the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to convince a crazy man not to act,'' Bush said.
``If it wasn't a gun it might have been a pipe bomb. The idea is to
send a clear message and that maybe if somebody hears the clear
message that there will be a consequence, it will convince somebody
not to carry a gun in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush got testy when reporters asked if the drive to step up
prosecutions was an acknowledgement that past efforts have been
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now a concerted effort. We are enforcing laws on the
books in the state of Texas. People are being arrested for
illegally carrying guns,'' he said. ``This is just a more focused
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Exile will be administered by Attorney General John Cornyn
in coordination with the four United States attorneys assigned to
Texas. The program will initially be funded by a $1.6 million grant
from the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the prosecutors will be ``cross-designated'' so that
they can pursue violations of both state and federal weapon laws in
order to maximize jail time. Typically, federal gun violations
carry five-year minimum sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The program also will include a public awareness campaign and,
eventually, a toll-free hotline that will receive tips about
possible gun law violators.
</P>
<P>
   It was largely modeled after Project Exile in Richmond, Va., a
cooperative effort among federal, state and local officials aimed
at increasing jail time for gun law violators.
</P>
<P>
   Since implementing the program, Richmond, which had the nation's
second highest murder rate in 1997, has seen its murder rate drop
by more than 30 percent and its violent crime rate fall by nearly
half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas program also was inspired in part by the Safe City
USA program to be unveiled in Fort Worth next week, Cornyn said.
The initiative, pushed by Fort Worth businessmen Lee and Perry
Bass, will include a privately financed $745,000 publicity
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One example of the inspiration Fort Worth gave the state is its
slogan: ``Gun Crime Means Hard Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message today and for each day hereafter in the state of
Texas is that gun crime means hard time,'' said Cornyn. ``Texas
Exile is about incarcerating those who illegally carry, possess or
sell guns without infringing upon the rights of law-abiding
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was well received by Bruce Elfant, a Travis
County constable and member of Texans Against Gun Violence. But
Elfant questioned the timing of Bush's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that the governor hadn't waited until he was running
for president to propose something like this,'' Elfant said. ``We
do need more prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Elfant said Bush has ``done everything the NRA (National Rifle
Association) has wanted him to do,'' and faulted the governor for
not doing more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, such as
requiring a three-day waiting period for weapon purchases at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be able to build enough jails or hire enough cops to
deal with every gun crime if we don't do these preventative
strategies to reduce the access to guns by children and
criminals,'' Elfant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attributed questions about the timing of his announcement
to politics. As to why he did not act sooner, the governor
suggested the reason was that he has a better working relationship
with Cornyn, a Republican, than with former Attorney General Dan
Morales, a Democrat who retired in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general and I finally got together,'' Bush said.
``This is an attorney general that I feel comfortable working
with.'' He said it was possible he and Morales could have done
something similar, but ``we just never had a meeting of the
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales could not be reached for comment.

 &HT;    Minorities have tougher time with credit, loans than whites
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nicholas Harrell has always realized the importance of
having good credit.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell, a financial analyst at SunTrust Bank, doubled payments
to retire his school loans four years early and today, the
38-year-old Atlanta resident is debt free. ``When I walk into a
mortgage company, they should love me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Harrell likely won't have any problem getting a mortgage
loan, many other African Americans do because of poor credit
histories. According to Freddie Mac, 72 percent of white households
own homes, compared to 46 percent of African American households
and 44 percent of Hispanic households.
</P>
<P>
   A new report says African American borrowers are more likely
than whites and Hispanics to experience credit problems.
Forty-eight percent of African American borrowers and 34 percent of
Hispanic borrowers have ``bad credit records, compared to just 27
percent of whites, according to the report released this week by
Freddie Mac and five historically black colleges and universities,
including Clark Atlanta University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you horror stories about friends who have bad
credit now because of the ways things were mismanaged when they
were in undergraduate school,'' said Harrell. ``Everyone had credit
cards and people were using them. By the time they left
undergraduate school they were $4,000 to $5,000 in debt with 21
percent interest. That's a tough way to start out.''
</P>
<P>
   To help minorities avoid credit problems Freddie Mac said
Tuesday it has teamed with the schools to boost home ownership
rates by helping minority consumers understand the benefits of
having good credit reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the industry to grow in the future have to look to raising
home ownership rates,'' said Freddie Mac spokesman Sharon McHale.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac has been working with the schools _ Clark Atlanta,
Benedict College, Florida A &AMP; M, Howard University and St.
Augustine's College _ since January when it awarded the schools
$1.3 million for the effort. Since then more than 50 focus groups
have been conducted and an national survey of 12,000 consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The results will be used to develop an initiative to help
consumers obtain and maintain good credit. The National Urban
League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People have also signed up to help implement the program, including
distributing an educational curriculum for teens and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that good credit has a lot to do with the quality
of life that you have,'' said Marvin Patterson, associate dean of
the business school at CAU. ``We want to take this issue beyond the
college environment into the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Such programs help in the long run, said Carol Hetzler, manager
of the Atlanta branch of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service,
which sees about 400 clients a month. ``People don't realize until
its too late the damage they've done to their credit when they're
young,'' she said. Bad credit ``doesn't just go away. It takes
time.''

 &HT;    Church serves as rescue base north of river
 &HT;    By Bobby Burns
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELVOIR, N.C. _ Gum Swamp Church is no longer just a place of
worship _ it's a makeshift relief post and command center.
</P>
<P>
   Church members, three deputy sheriffs, four forest rangers and a
handful of volunteer firefighters have staged search and rescue
operations from the Belvoir fellowship hall, served hundreds of
meals and even delivered some by truck and by boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that live all around the community are in here for
food, water, baby supplies, whatever we can get,'' said Eugene
James, a church member and chairman of the Pitt County Board of
Commissioners. ``We're encouraging them to stay at home, stay off
the roads. They can come in here once a day and pick up what they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days after Hurricane Floyd, communities north of the Tar
River continued grassroots relief efforts to distribute vital
supplies to thousands of residents cut off by flood water from
Greenville. N.C. Forestry Service helicopters have flown Red Cross
meals to Belvoir volunteers since Sunday. When rain grounded the
planes Tuesday they used one ranger's boat to ferry supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Belvoir community roughly follows N.C. 33 from Greenville
northwest to the Edgecombe County line. Flooding has devastated the
area, the group at Gum Swamp said. The water has swept up mobile
homes along Old River Road, rolling them along with the current.
</P>
<P>
   James and others estimated that 200 to 300 people remain in
flooded areas from Belvoir Crossroads to Penny Hill to the north.
More remain to the south near Belvoir Elementary School. Dozens of
them on Tuesday wandered the half-flooded streets of soggy trailer
parks and sat on the porches of scattered homes.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Wilder, of 820 Barrus Construction Road made his way to
Gum Swamp Church Tuesday morning to pick up a cardboard box of food
for himself, his wife and three sons. Styrofoam takeout plates of
stew, bread and vegetables filled the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used up everything at the house and we've been to some of
the side stores and they're just about sold out,'' said Wilder, a
machinist at Vermont American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what makes it bad is not being able to get out
anywhere. Everybody on this side of the Tar River has to go to
Bethel or Williamston and they don't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Long lines and rationing persisted Tuesday at Pitt County's
single grocery store north of the river, Bethel IGA, although basic
necessities including milk and gasoline were available there and in
neighboring Martin County. A line also snaked outside the door at
Bethel Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   The area, like much of the county on Tuesday, also lost its
water supply. The prospect promised to pose challenges for
residents in shelters at Wellcome Middle School and North Pitt High
School.
</P>
<P>
   At Wellcome, residents and volunteers were collecting rain water
to flush toilets. At North Pitt, they were collecting water from a
nearby creek. Officials at both shelters before the Reflector's
early publishing deadline were hoping portable toilets would be
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers at both schools had declined by Tuesday as some
residents moved to a shelter set up at Stokes Elementary and others
found accommodations with family and friends. Wellcome was down to
246 from more than 400 and North Pitt was down to about 400 from
nearly 800 registered there Monday, workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Improvising make-do measures like catching rainwater has become
routine at the facilities. At North Pitt for instance, residents
are holding school for the children and at Wellcome volunteers
supplemented their cereal breakfast with sandwiches on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Food supplies at the facilities were more than adequate Tuesday.
At North Pitt, volunteers sorted through piles of donated clothing
spread out on the stage and first several rows of seats in the
school auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have been brought in by helicopter. Bad weather on
Tuesday kept ECU student Devan Raghavan longer than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 6-month-old baby and with the prospect of no water
and no power I'm a little worried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother speaks no English and his wife speaks no Malayalam,
his native tongue. He usually interprets for them. ``I'm wondering
what they are saying to each other. What are they going to do with
the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Belvoir, Derrick Moore was spending his third wedding
anniversary making sure residents were fed and safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service assistant ranger and the three other rangers
work out of Belvoir and decided to stick it out when the river
started rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck in Belvoir basically because there wasn't anybody
else up here. It's been isolated since the storm,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the supplies are in Greenville, its just that nobody could
get it to us until we got the Forestry Service helicopter .... We
were in bad shape a couple of days ago but we're doing OK now.''

BANKRUPTCY BILL IS BLOCKED IN FIGHT OVER MINIMUM PAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to force a vote on a measure to increase the
minimum wage, Democratic Senators blocked Republican legislation to
revamp federal bankruptcy laws Tuesday, at least for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy bill, a version of which was approved by the
House of Representatives in May, is one of the few Republican
legislative initiatives still in play this year. Strongly supported
by the banking and credit card industries, it would make it harder
for consumers to avoid paying debts by declaring bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, want
to attach an amendment that would raise the federal minimum wage,
now $5.15 an hour, to $6.15 in two 50-cent installments over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising the minimum wage is critical to preventing the
economic free fall that often leads to bankruptcy,'' Kennedy said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans say that raising the minimum wage would be
devastating to some small businesses and would cost many working
people their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Voting along party lines Tuesday evening, the Senate rejected a
Republican move to invoke cloture and bring the bankruptcy bill to
a vote. The vote was 53-45, seven votes shy of the 60 needed to
halt debate. If cloture had been approved, the Democrats'
minimum-wage amendment would have been foreclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, party leaders were meeting to try to
negotiate a compromise. The prevailing view in both parties Tuesday
was that a deal could eventually be worked out that would lead to
passage of both the minimum-wage increase and the overall
bankruptcy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage issue has divided Republicans and Democrats for
generations, and arguments have hardly changed since the federal
minimum wage was introduced, at 25 cents an hour, in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are the Democrats and liberal economists who hold
that market forces have failed workers in low-paying jobs. A fair
minimum wage, they say, prevents sweatshops and rewards people who
leave welfare rolls and go to work. These advocates maintain that
the resulting job loss, if any, will be trivial.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Republicans and conservative economists say
that much of the benefit will go to teen-agers who do not really
need the money. Some businesses, especially smaller ones, will go
bankrupt and others will raise prices, leading to inflation. Many
poor people, the opponents say, will lose jobs because businesses
will let them go rather than raise their pay.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the economic arguments, the political situation is
clear: This is a good issue for Democrats, and Republicans are
likely to switch rather than fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republican leaders have conceded that they do not
have the votes to defeat the Democratic bill. They are working on a
face-saving compromise that would tie the minimum-wage increase to
some modest tax breaks for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation said Tuesday that despite the
setback, they expected the bankruptcy measure to be introduced
again, particularly since a similar measure passed in the last
session by a vote of 97-1.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is adopted, the Senate legislation can not become
law until it is reconciled with a more stringent version that was
adopted by the House last May. President Clinton's advisers have
recommended that he veto that measure, although it was adopted by a
veto-proof margin of 313-108. Senate negotiators have tried to
draft a more lenient bill in the hopes of gaining White House
support.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation, largely written by Sens. Charles E.
Grassley, R-Iowa, and Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., is more
favorable to debtors.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights and consumers groups have been critical of the
House and Senate measures for largely favoring debtors over
creditors, and hitting women and the less affluent harder.

 Steven Drukman is writing a history of avant-garde theater in
America.  
 By STEVEN DRUKMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What makes a David Gallo design a David Gallo design?
Mr. Gallo will only say, ``I tend to do things
(italics)large.''(end italics) That's a rather broad esthetic
philosophy, but it sits well with the husky, garrulous man whose
latest larger-than-life set surrounds the action of ``Epic
Proportions,'' a new comedy opening Thursday at the Helen Hayes
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Still, how does Gallo explain that in a world where producers
pray that people leave the theater humming, talk of his sets may be
the buzz going up the aisle? Or how does he explain critical
notices praising his painted backdrops before weighing in on the
playwright, director or leading lady? (In the opening paragraph of
a 1997 New York Times review of ``Bunny Bunny,'' Peter Marks called
Gallo's set ``ahhh-inspiring'' and wrote that ``Mr. Gallo is one up
on any dog or child on a New York stage: he has created
scene-stealing scenery.'')
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, when hired to create a world where a comatose
patient has an out-of-body experience (as in last season's ``New
Brain'' at Lincoln Center) or giant puppets blur the line between
actor and scenery (as in ``Jackie: An American Life''), how does
Gallo find so many ways to make set pieces into sight gags?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, I don't know,'' he replies, politely pretending to
entertain these questions. ``Luck? Listening to good music? Somehow
the ability to tell a joke with an inanimate object just comes to
me. I'm not big on figuring out how.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be the only thing Gallo, 33, isn't big on. With eyebrows
swooping like a tsunami over sparkling blue eyes, he is a spiral of
energy and looks very much like the Tasmanian Devil from Warner
Brothers cartoons. In conversation, his hands help an avalanche of
words tumble out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   His frenetic style proves that suddenly being on the A-list of
designers makes downtime a scarce resource. Among his credits from
last year are three Broadway revivals _ ``Little Me,'' ``The Lion
in Winter'' (both at the Roundabout) and ``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown'' _ which overlapped with what Gallo estimates were
about 10 other shows off Broadway and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking amid the hubbub of his Times Square design studio,
Gallo admits that he consumes anything and everything in popular
culture _ vintage comic books, rock-and-roll, Cecil B. DeMille
movies _ for visual ideas. It's a pragmatic, if ad hoc, technique
and seems to work for someone with Gallo's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Already this season, in addition to ``Epic Proportions''
(directed by Jerry Zaks and starring Kristin Chenoweth, both Tony
Award winners), Gallo's set for ``Voices in the Dark'' is on view
at the Longacre Theater, and Off Broadway audiences have already
seen his work in ``Jar the Floor'' at Second Stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo's forthcoming projects include the Broadway-bound
``Thunder Knocking on the Door,'' written and directed by Keith
Glover, and two world premieres off Broadway (``The Wild Party'' at
the Manhattan Theater Club and ``Bubbly Black Girl'' at Playwrights
Horizons). For the last decade, his design has supported the
azure-tinted antics of Blue Man Group's ``Tubes'' at the Astor
Place Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo leads a busy and peripatetic life, in some ways a second
version of his childhood, when he traveled around Europe as the son
of an Air Force officer. He thinks he has designed 150 shows since
he dropped out of the State University of New York at Purchase 11
years ago to work in professional theater, but that's only a guess;
he hasn't had a moment to stop and count.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when so many set designers have advanced degrees from
Yale or New York University, Gallo seems to have an MFA of the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``While at school, I already had scripts on my desk to design
shows for (italics)real(end italics) theaters,'' he says. ``O.K.,
they were small and paid zip, but that was better than finishing my
requirements to do props for some sophomore's show.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of job offers increased steadily, and Gallo accepted
them all. ``I was broke but didn't care,'' he says. ``Still don't.
I just said, `Yeah, keep 'em comin'.' Then I'd find myself on a
train to Philly, sketching a show, and I'd spent all my money on
the ticket. So I'd hitchhike to some rinky-dink theater from the
station, having never been in Philly before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo says he worked for eight years this way, never taking a
day off, making the past ``one big blur to where I am right now.''
But he recalls that his big break was in 1989, with Michael Greif's
production of ``Machinal'' at the Naked Angels. ``Definitely '89,''
he says. ``It had to be. Spike Lee's `Do the Right Thing' was out
that year, and that Public Enemy tune was really big on the
radio.'' In 1990, ``Machinal'' moved to the Joseph Papp Public
Theater, where Gallo worked as an assistant to the designer James
Youmans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even then,'' he says, ``for what we used to call the Papp
test'' _ a meeting with Joseph Papp to approve a show's design _
``I had to jump the turnstile of the subway with a huge model of
the set in my hand, because I couldn't afford a token.''
</P>
<P>
   While at the Public, Gallo met a tyro director named Michael
Mayer (who was also working as an assistant, to the director David
Warren). This sparked a decadelong collaboration, beginning with
Mayer's first paid directing job, in the undergraduate department
of drama at Yale, and continuing with the well-received national
tour of ``Angels in America.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The two men have worked together on a total of 11 shows
(including, most recently, the Off Broadway ``Stupid Kids,'' and on
Broadway, last season's ``Lion in Winter,'' ``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown'' and the Tony-winning ``View From the Bridge'').
</P>
<P>
   Mayer explains Gallo's appeal: ``It was only a matter of time
before critics caught on to David. He works so hard and makes
(italics)huge(end italics) statements, but not at the expense of
the play. He does what a director does for a script _ lets it tell
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer and Gallo will work together again on a stage adaptation
of the movie musical ``Thoroughly Modern Millie.'' Their version,
also starring Ms. Chenoweth, is slated for a Broadway run next
year. The lighting designer Donald Holder, winner of a Tony for
``The Lion King,'' collaborated with Gallo on many shows, including
``Hughie,'' starring Al Pacino, at Circle in the Square in 1996 and
August Wilson's ``Jitney,'' which has traveled the country and is
heading for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from London, Holder said: ``David works
harder than most designers and probably wouldn't stop if he wasn't
told to. Working in the business has been Dave's graduate school.
He would have no personal life if he hadn't made a very good choice
in that his associate is also his girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder is referring to Lauren Helpern, a set decorator, who
often takes care of what Gallo calls ``the detail work that I hate
to deal with.'' Ms. Helpern lives with Gallo on the Upper East Side
and received credit as co-designer on ``Voices in the Dark,''
Gallo's most recent collaboration with Holder.
</P>
<P>
   When stretched with overlapping projects, Gallo has hired up to
12 temporary assistants to draft and build models, and he maintains
two full-time associates. He recently hired a part-time office
assistant who urged him to wear both a cellular phone and a pager,
which he attaches and detaches from his baggy jeans with nervous
energy. He claims that he's usually too busy to answer them.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo is mildly chagrined about one aspect of his growing fame:
after Marks used the word ``cartoonish'' to describe the inventive
scenery in ``Bunny Bunny,'' it seemed to Gallo that the word was
everywhere. Ben Brantley pointed out in his Times review that
``Jackie: An American Life'' was presented as ``that `little
cartoon''' that the play's subject, Jacqueline Onassis, saw running
alongside her life. ( Gallo points out that his scenery, which had
the look of live animation, merely represented Mrs. Onassis's own
description of her sometimes-surreal existence.)
</P>
<P>
   After his crayon-colored set for ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown'' gained so much attention, Gallo believes, people formed
final judgments about what makes a David Gallo design a David Gallo
design _ and it didn't matter that they were almost always
complimentary. (Writing in New York magazine, John Simon noted,
``Nobody does cartoonish scenery better than David Gallo.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, that musical is based on a comic strip!'' Gallo says.
`So suddenly it was, like, `Hey, want your play to look like a
cartoon? Get David Gallo.' As if I didn't have hundreds of other
styles in my portfolio. Look, if the play calls for realistic
detail work, that's cool with me. I'll do it; I just find it
boring. It's like doing scales and arpeggios.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo's design for ``Epic Proportions'' offers yet another
example of what is coming to be regarded as his signature style of
vibrant colors and cartoonish perspective. To suggest the location
of a 1930s biblical epic being filmed in the Arizona desert, Gallo
designed what he calls ``one big one-note joke.'' In the second
act, the goddess Isis (played by Ms. Chenoweth) is shackled to the
upstage wall in a pair of chains so enormous, they look straight
out of Looney Tunes.
</P>
<P>
   He explains: ``Because those movies were all about excess, man.
So, on stage I put the bottom 15 feet of a 1,000-foot Corinthian
column. You don't see the Sphinx, but the Sphinx's big toe.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his love for popular culture, Gallo dreams of designing
the definitive rock-and-roll musical on Broadway. He says, ``I
loved doing `Tommy,' but that wasn't it.'' ( Gallo worked as the
associate scenic designer for the international tour and Broadway
run of the 1993 production of the rock opera.) ```Rent' wasn't it.
But I bet Prince has a great musical locked inside that paisley
head of his. Or if Bruce Springsteen wrote a musical, man, I'd be
all over that!''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In a modest beginning to a campaign by a
divided opposition to oust the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, tens of thousands of people attended rallies in some 20
Serbian towns on Tuesday evening, hearing pleas to keep marching
until Milosevic goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come here every day and clean Serbia drop by
drop,'' said the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, speaking
in a light rain to some 20,000 people in the central Square of the
Republic. ``And if on the 10th day, 2 million people are on the
streets of Serbia, it means that Serbia is healthy,'' and Milosevic
will have to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Far fewer than that turned out across Serbia on Tuesday night,
with some 7,000 people in Novi Sad, 20,000 in Nis, 10,000 in
Kragujevac (with support from the car workers at the Zastava plant)
and a good turnout of 10,000 in Smederevo, in eastern Serbia,
normally a regime stronghold, according to officials of the
Alliance for Change coalition and some local media estimates. In
general, the police did not interfere.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the mood was hopeful but not confident, with many
interviewed in the crowd expressing doubts that rallies alone will
oust Milosevic. They also expressed unhappiness with the continuing
divisions in the opposition, symbolized by the rivalry between
Djindjic and his erstwhile partner, Vuk Draskovic of the larger
Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to start something that must go to the end,'' said
the popular mayor of Cacak, Velimir Ilic, in his speech. ``Whether
we succeed or not depends on us.'' But Ilic also sharply criticized
Draskovic, who chose not to take part in these rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask other opposition parties to join us and not cooperate
with the regime,'' Ilic said. ``We are the opposition and they are
the servants of Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The designated ``prime minister'' of an opposition-nominated
``transitional government,'' Dragoslav Avramovic, a former banker,
also appealed to other opposition parties Tuesday night to support
him, saying the Alliance alone was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has called for early elections as the best way to oust
Milosevic and said he believed these rallies would fail. His stance
has created bitterness among Alliance followers and some of the
people who came here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draskovic is now part of the regime,'' said Jovan Bandin, a
businessman who said he intended to demonstrate as long as
necessary. ``He does everything he can to stop real change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ognjen Pribicevic, a close adviser to Draskovic, said he thought
these rallies ``will show clearly that the Alliance for Change does
not have the strength to produce change in Serbia.'' Draskovic's
push for early, free and fair elections is the only workable policy
to change the regime, Pribicevic said. ``And still the only guy
with real credibility is Vuk Draskovic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Milosevic rejects early elections, Draskovic and his
party will go out into the streets, perhaps by the end of October,
Pribicevic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it will be different,'' he said. ``There will be a clear
issue, not just empty words.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was some scuffling with the police in Smederevo, the
only tension of the night was in Novi Sad, where Nenad Canak, an
Alliance leader and head of the League of Social Democrats of
Vojvodina, had threatened to ``take over'' the provincial assembly
and ``evict its illegal tenants.'' In the end, demonstrators chose
a symbolic path Tuesday night, marching to the doors of the
building, where only a few policemen were standing, and then
turning aside after yelling slogans and blowing whistles.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, there was some nostalgia for the three months of
daily rallies in the winter of 1996-97, when the opposition was
united in the Zajedno, or Together, coalition. Then, daily
demonstrators blowing whistles got local election results
reinstated, but Milosevic hung on.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic whistles were on sale Tuesday night from vendors for
about 50 cents, and after the rally speeches, demonstrators were
urged to walk through Belgrade as they did three years ago, blowing
their whistles in derision at City Hall, the state television
headquarters, the Serbian parliament and the offices of Politika,
the state-run newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, the Yugoslav information minister, said in an
interview earlier in the day that the opposition simply wanted to
grab power on the streets because it was afraid of elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name for someone who wants power without elections is
Lenin,'' he said. ``Djindjic doesn't want elections _ he can't win
more than 2 percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when asked if the government would call early elections,
Matic shrugged and said: ``Why? We have real work to do, to rebuild
the country, fix housing, bridges and railroads.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the participation of Draskovic, Matic said with some
satisfaction, ``these demonstrations can't be very big.''

KERRY EDUCATION SPEECH TO HIT BUSH, DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John F. Kerry, in what he is billing as a
major policy speech that expands his vision for education reform,
plans to attack Wednesday both Republican Governor George W. Bush
and the Democratic Party for education ideas that are old-fashioned
and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   The speech has the feel of a campaign announcement and borrows
from a significant education speech Kerry made last year when he
was pondering a run for president, according to an early draft
provided to the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   But this morning's address during an education forum sponsored
by the Democratic Leadership Caucus could be seen as part of
Kerry's ongoing drive to carve his niche in domestic social policy,
according to several congressional aides. Education experts also
said the speech seemed to be part of Kerry's attempt to break away
from the traditional liberal education platform, including that of
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, in favor of a more centrist approach.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said Tuesday that the thrust of his criticism is aimed at
presidential candidate Bush, who advocates taking federal funds
from disadvantaged public schools that perform poorly over three
years and giving it to parents to spend on tutors or private
schools. It is similar to a voucher program, which most Democrats
oppose out of fear the best students would be drained from the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, in his speech, also criticizes Bush for sounding like a
centrist Democrat and even repeating Kerry's ideas such as holding
schools accountable for high standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have even said that his positions on our public
schools echos a speech I gave at Northeastern last year,'' the text
reads. ``Well, it needs to be said that George Bush may have
brought our rhetoric to the Republican Party _ but he sure hasn't
taken our policies with him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kerry's draft speech does not refrain from
taking Democrats to task.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have work to do in our own caucus. We have an agenda in
real need of modernization, and we have an obligation, as the
friends of public schools, to do the real work of reform,'' the
early text reads. ``But there's a schism we need to address if
we're ever going to take those steps forward.''
</P>
<P>
   That schism, it continues, is the fault of Democrats who
``confuse reform with real spending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be a party that speaks merely of school construction
and reducing class size. These are good ideas _ we need to push for
their passage. But there is far more we must do together,'' Kerry
says in the draft. ``Unless we are ready to consent to perpetuating
a system that pits the interests of adults against the interests of
kids, we must tell the hard truths, and we must be the party of
comprehensive reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has faced obstacles in pushing his educational legislative
agenda, especially in a Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He introduced legislation with Senator Gordon Smith, a
Republican from Oregon, earlier this year that would use $25
billion in federal funds to improve the overall structure of
education. Advocates of the bill say it would fund after-school
programs, teacher training and broader early childhood development
programs. It has 12 co-sponsors, including Senator Edward M.
Kennedy and both Republicans from Maine, Senators Susan M. Collins
and Olympia Snowe _ a bipartisan list that gives Kerry hope the
bill could eventually be voted on.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how the $5 billion-a-year program would be
paid for. Kerry admits it would be ``very difficult'' to get the
legislation funded. So far, there seems to be little impetus to
bring the bill to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the number of cosponsors, Kerry has gotten a
``lackluster response'' from other Democrats in recent weeks as he
has given speeches about how the party should alter its approach to
education, according to one Senate Democratic aide on education.
That is, in part, because Kerry has different priorities from many
Democrats. For example, he rejects the idea that funding for new
school construction should come first.
</P>
<P>
   And in part, Kerry is not in a position to control the education
debate. Although he is a member of five committees, ``the reality
is, he is not on the committees in charge of education,'' said Joel
Packer, a lobbyist for the National Education Association. ``He's
not in the right place to have an impact on education. And Kennedy
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kennedy Tuesday criticized a Republican plan to cut
federal education funding. Kennedy claimed it would eliminate
millions of federal dollars allocated to states each year for
programs that aid low-income students and help school districts
hire teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, education starts first in rhetoric and ends up
last in reality,'' said Kennedy, who urged his colleagues to reject
the $15 billion in education cuts proposed by GOP leaders.

NO PROZAC FOUND IN KILLER'S HOME, POLICE NOW SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ |The head of the Wedgwood Baptist Church
shooting investigation said on Tuesday that, contrary to what he
told news media on Monday, no Prozac was found in the home of the
gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Mark Krey said his earlier account was based on
misinformation that a search of Larry Gene Ashbrook's home had
yielded a vial for the anti-depressant Prozac had been prescribed
for him.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with his lead investigator yesterday, Krey said he
learned that all medications found in the home were the type
primarily prescribed for people suffering from congestive heart
failure and belonged to Ashbrook's father, Jack Ashbrook, who died
in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point during the course of the last several days and
the subsequent search on the home of Larry Ashbrook, there was a
general conversation in which someone mentioned Prozac had been
found,'' Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't personally look at the specific inventory prior to
the interview. This morning it was pointed out to me that the
information was incorrect,'' Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   That does not detract from the police belief that the death of
Ashbrook's father probably pushed him over the edge of reason, Krey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When his father died, he lost the major stabilizing factor in
his life,'' Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, detectives pulled the medicine vials from the police
property room and inventoried them to verify what medicines had
been confiscated from the house.
</P>
<P>
   A log used by Jack Ashbrook to document his medication usage is
believed to have been used later by Larry Ashbrook, who may have
begun taking his father's medicine, police said.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several theories being investigated as police try
to determine why the 47-year-old Ashbrook, whose brother called him
a paranoid schizophrenic, embarked on the deadly rampage at
Wedgwood Baptist Church a week ago Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people were shot to death and seven were wounded before
Ashbrook sat in a back pew and shot himself in the right temple.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives face a monumentous task as they start reviewing more
than 70 witness statements to document where everyone was sitting,
what they saw, what they heard and who they saw die, Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also are awaiting toxicology reports from Ashbrook's
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives interviewed four of the more seriously injured
victims on Tuesday after physicians said they were well enough to
be questioned, Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide Detective Curt Brannan, whose duty the night of the
shooting was to interview victims who could talk, said nearly
everyone believed the shooting spree to be part of a skit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the exception of those who saw him walk in and pull
the pistol. ... The picture I immediately gained was all were in
total disbelief of the reality of this,'' Brannan said. ``There was
a lot of confusion, not all heard the explosion'' of the pipe bomb
Ashbrook threw down an aisle toward the front of the sanctuary, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who did see him come in described him raising the front
of his shirt, pulling out the handgun and start shooting at people
outside in the hallway sitting on the couch,'' Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the witnesses recognized Ashbrook or knew of any
connection between him and the church or any church member, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Receipts found in Ashbrook's belongings indicate that leading up
to the shooting, he had gone to a Home Depot store every day since
March, a federal official said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who did not want to be identified, said Ashbrook
made a purchase during each visit to the hardware warehouse store
to get items as small as a few nuts and bolts to larger items such
as hand tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept this log'' meticulously recording each purchase, the
official said, adding, ``He apparently liked Home Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the purchases was for the concrete mix Ashbrook poured
down his toilet, the official said.

RYDER STARS AWE THE CROWD _ AND IT'S ALL IN FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The spectators in the bleachers to the right
of the sixth tee prepared for fun. Back down the fairway, nearly
300 yards away, three launchers were tucked away in a tee box that
can comfortably fit four golfers, four golf bags, and four caddies
(though a shoe horn is recommended).
</P>
<P>
   It was a practice round and the crowd couldn't care less about
putting for dough. They wanted Phil Mickelson, David Duval, and
Tiger Woods to drive for show. All right, said the players, it's
show time. Titanium, please.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Mark O'Meara was allowed to hit and he calmly slapped
an iron into the middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Formalities aside and with serious competition still days away,
the players obliged. Though, quite honestly, they were using a
practice round for what it is intended _ seeing what they can do
and what they can't.
</P>
<P>
   Duval crushed first, his drive splitting the fairway and coming
to rest a mere 10-15 yards shy of the green. Ho-hum. A mere 285.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson slammed one that went right, into rough above a
bunker. Not bad, but not what the fans wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Woods. The hole measures 310 yards but in a flash
Woods's drive rocketed out of the chute. ``Left,'' he yelled, and
the crowd on the hill next to the green moved quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson wanted another go at it and he drilled one high into
the sky. It landed softly on the right side of the green and the
crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Woods blasted another, but this time it drew
a straight line to the center of the green. It hit at the front of
the green and rolled back onto the fringe. Mission accomplished.
The crowd roared again, and as they left the tee, the young and
talented trio laughed heartily.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from a month ago when these four players and
the Ryder Cup seemed as compatible as a Hollywood marriage. But the
compensation issue that scarred the PGA Championship _ during a
week in which US captain Ben Crenshaw said he was disappointed in
Woods, O'Meara, Duval, and Mickelson _ is ``ancient history,''
according to Jeff Maggert, and the matter at hand is golf.
</P>
<P>
   So golf it was under gray skies, with the 12 Europeans going off
in three foursomes, followed by three groups of Americans. It was
noteworthy that Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie, both Scotsmen,
were with Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood, best friends who are
considered a lock as a pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Jose Maria Olazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez, another
team that seems certain. With Jesper Parnevik in a group with
Sergio Garcia, it appeared as if James had pretty much shown his
opening lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Or had he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think maybe I was pairing them together to mislead you?
Pull a complete pranker on the press? I'm dealing with some devious
people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like virtually everyone else on campus Tuesday, James was having
fun. That goes for the players, because back at the sixth hole
Woods &AMP; Co. had arrived on the green. The gallery on the hill to
the left of the pin had made room for Woods, at least just enough
room for him to squeeze in with his lob wedge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to play that one, Tiger,'' said a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' said Woods, grinning, ``we're playing a match,'' well
aware that O'Meara had drilled a wedge to within 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   So Woods calmly stood over a shot that not a handful of people
in the world could have executed, a flop off hard pan to a green
sloping away from him. Somehow, Woods slid his club under the ball,
popped it in the air, and landed it just on the green. It came to
rest a few feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   Duval had a flip wedge into the green and Mickelson gave a nod
of approval to his second drive, for which the crowd again offered
its appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   All of which led to speculation that perhaps Crenshaw was
tipping his hand, that perhaps Woods and Duval, or Woods and
Mickelson, or Mickelson and Duval _ you know, long guns together _
were being auditioned.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw wouldn't budge. He saw eight of his team members play
here Aug. 30, ``and I saw the formation of a couple of thoughts for
certain teams. They may go out again tomorrow. We're going to talk
about it late this afternoon and maybe after the dinner tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   No rush. There are two more days of practice. Two more days to
grab those seats next to the sixth green. Though Scott Dickinson of
Newburyport was quite happy not to be sitting. He was one of those
who made room for Woods to hit his wedge shot, and as the world's
greatest golfer headed to the seventh tee, someone in the crowd
begged of Woods: ``Hey, Tiger, how about that ball we threw down
for you?''
</P>
<P>
   Woods chuckled, then tossed them the ball, which Dickinson
caught. Yes, it had ``Tiger Woods'' imprinted on it.
</P>
<P>
   Will he put it into play? ``No way,'' said Dickinson. ``It's
going right in the trophy case.''

   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ With the death toll from Tuesday morning's
devastating earthquake rising by the hour, rescuers around the
island worked through the day and night to reach thousands of
people still trapped inside felled buildings and houses.
</P>
<P>
   In cities across the island, many high-rise buildings listed at
eerie angles or lay flattened. In the worst-hit counties near the
epicenter, Taichung and Nantou, highways and bridges were twisted,
buckled and impassable to traffic. Much of the island, including
sections of the capital, Taipei, lay in darkness through the night.
Water and telephone services were also disrupted in many regions.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, more than 1,700 people around the island were
reported dead, and at least 4,400 injured and hundreds of thousands
homeless. The Interior Ministry said at least 30,000 homes were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Though Taipei was spared much of the devastation that ravaged
central Taiwan, the quake collapsed the lower stories of the
78-room Sung Shan Hotel, leaving it leaning precariously against a
neighboring building.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people were rescued from the hotel building, which
also houses apartments and a bank, but another 80 remained trapped
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The building's 81-year-old superintendent, Hsu Ling-mei, who
lives nearby, raced to the site early Tuesday morning and stood
vigil into the night, anxiously noting on a sheet of paper the
names of residents carried out on stretchers to ambulances waiting
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   With tears coursing down his face, Hsu explained that he knew
everyone in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't leave until I know they're OK,'' he said. ``If my
presence here alone is helping, I will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Aftershocks continued to rattle the stricken island and to
terrorize its 22 million residents. More than 1,000 were recorded,
including one that registered a potent 6.8 on the Richter scale.
The main quake, which struck at 1:47 a.m. Tuesday, measured 7.7 on
the scale and was centered 90 miles south of Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Nantou County Executive Peng Pai-hsien appealed for donations of
bulldozers, cars, quilts and food, saying 100,000 people were left
homeless in the county. He said morgues were ``full of bodies, and
the county needed body bags and freezers in the summer heat.''
</P>
<P>
   President Lee Teng-hui, who traveled by helicopter to central
Taiwan to inspect the damage, called the quake ``the island's worst
in a century.'' He called on local residents to join forces in the
rebuilding effort and pledged financial support from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first priority is to save the people who are trapped,'' he
said. ``Then we restore water and power, and then to rebuild
houses, roads, and public facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   At toppled buildings across the country, hundreds of soldiers
assisted rescuers, often by digging through the rubble with their
bare hands in search of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of profound grief for the many who lost loved ones
to the quake and joy for those who were reunited with family and
friends they had feared were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Television reports throughout the day showed soldiers pulling
bloodied bodies from buildings and relatives of the dead sitting in
front of buildings crying and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   One man who was rescued from a collapsed high-rise building in
Taichung said in a television interview that while he was trapped
in the ruins, he could hear the voices of his children also caught
in the wreckage nearby, calling to him. But after a while, he said,
their voices faded away and he did not know where they were.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, where rescue efforts were scarce, ordinary people
sifted through the debris calling the names of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Japan, Russia and Singapore agreed to send
transport planes, helicopters, and rescue personnel to help out. A
United Nations disaster assessment team was also on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent tensions between Beijing and Taipei, President
Jiang Zemin of China offered aid to the quake victims and extended
condolences, though in words that underlined Beijing's insistence
on its sovereignty over what it considers a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   The quake ``hurt the hearts of people on the mainland as the
Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are as closely
linked as flesh and blood,'' the state-run New China News agency
said in a paraphrase of Jiang's remarks. China's Red Cross said it
would provide $100,000 in disaster aid and $60,000 in relief
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Railway services were paralyzed throughout the island Tuesday
morning while schools and many company offices in northern Taiwan,
including Taipei, were closed for the day. The Taipei stock
exchange and foreign exchange market also were closed Tuesday and
Wednesday, but Taipei's international airport operated as normal.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of Taichung, in central Taiwan, called on the
government to investigate whether some of the damaged buildings
violated the country's building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, television broadcasts showed city blocks in
Taichung where apartment towers had been felled like dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not so good support in those buildings to begin
with,'' a woman told a local television newscaster. ``You should
have seen it: it was one small bam and everything was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Many were high-rise apartment buildings that had sprouted up in
recent years in a period of rapid development. Chen Jianren, a
government spokesman, acknowledged that many of the newer buildings
may not have met strict specifications. ``There may be problems
with some developers,'' he said. ``The quality of buildings, that
must be investigated.''

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Slow play at a practice round? Well, with
Europeans involved, on a course they are barely familiar with, it
happened. The foursome of Sergio Garcia, Jesper Parnevik, Andrew
Coltart, and Jean Van de Velde took their time navigating The
Country Club layout, hitting second and third shots while
evaluating the course from every angle.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to drive the US contingency of Tiger Woods, David
Duval, Phil Mickelson, and Mark O'Meara to skip some holes. Instead
of remaining behind the Europeans on the ninth hole, the foursome
skipped to No. 14 and finished their round before retiring to the
locker room. After lunch, Woods and Duval returned to the course to
play holes 9-13.

   European captain Mark James was asked why he stopped watching
the Lee Westwood-Darren Clarke pairing. Was it a good or bad sign?
``(Westwood) must have thought it was bad because Lee and Darren
birdied four of the last five.'' . . . Some of James's predecessors
have also made the trip to Brookline. Former captain Tony Jacklin
(four teams) is in the Boston area, and Bernard Gallacher (three)
was on site Tuesday, preparing for his NBC analyst job . . . Van de
Velde, the Frenchman who had the British Open won before collapsing
with a triple-bogey at the 18th hole, had no such closing woes
Tuesday. From a greenside bunker, Van de Velde holed out for a
birdie on 18 . . . After teeing off on the 15th, Colin Montgomerie
joined his father, James, off the fairway and went for a walk in
the woods . . . Butch Harmon, Woods's swing coach, also works with
Clarke and spent a lengthy time with Jose Maria Olazabal on the
driving range to work out some problems.

HMO REPORT TO CITE DEFICIENCIES TOWARD SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Aiming to boost President Clinton's proposal to
overhaul Medicare and give seniors a new drug benefit, Vice
President Al Gore will unveil a report Wednesday that says HMOs are
falling short in serving the nation's Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6 million seniors, including 228,000 in Massachusetts,
have switched from the federal Medicare insurance program to
private health maintenance organizations since the option became
available in 1997. But recently, many HMOs have cut benefits and
withdrawn from some markets, saying that the government does not
pay them enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will tell a conference of the American Medical Association
that these cutbacks, outlined in the new government report, show
that the president's broad overhaul proposal is necessary. ``Many
of America's working families that depend on Medicare cannot depend
on their HMOs to deliver the affordable, critical benefits that
enticed them to choose an HMO in the first place,'' Gore says,
according to a draft version of his remarks. ``It underscores the
need to pass comprehensive Medicare reforms'' that include a
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Paying HMOs to serve seniors should save the government money,
because managed care companies say they can control costs better
than Medicare can. But the American Association of Health Plans, an
HMO lobbying group, says that the government has built a payment
system that makes it unprofitable to offer insurance in many areas
of the country. ``We always said we could do better (than Medicare)
for less. We never said we could work miracles,'' said Susan
Pisano, spokeswoman for the HMO group.
</P>
<P>
   The association wants Congress to preserve the existing Medicare
HMO system but also boost the payments to insurers, as well as
cancel some cutbacks scheduled to take effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will argue for Clinton's broader reform. Currently, the
government uses a complicated formula to decide how much to pay
plans to provide insurance. Clinton would require the plans to
compete with each other to offer service at a lower cost than
Medicare does. Some of the difference in cost would benefit the
government, but most would be passed to seniors in the form of
lower premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton has proposed giving seniors the option to
buy partial coverage for prescription drugs through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In arguging for the president's plan, Gore will cite a new
report from the Department of Health and Human Services, which is
based on what HMOs have told the government about their business
plans. Among its findings, the report says that:
</P>
<P>
   --Medicare HMOs are cutting back on the prescription drug
benefits they now offer, or are scrapping the benefit altogether.
More plans are putting tight limits on the amounts they will
reimburse seniors. More than 1.2 million seniors are required to
make no copayment on a drug benefit this year, but all seniors will
have to make some kind of copayment next year.
</P>
<P>
   --More seniors are paying high premiums for Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   --Prescription benefits are especially limited in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report underscores the urgent need for Congress to enact
a strong prescription drug benefit for all Medicare patients,''
said Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. ``Too many senior
citizens lack any coverage for prescription drugs, and few senior
citizens have coverage that is affordable, adequate and
dependable.''

KEEPING THAT VIENNA SOUND (AND EVERYTHING ELSE) AS IS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEEWALCHEN AMATTERSEE, Austria _ Yes, 1999 is a Johann Strauss
year, filled with commemorations of the composer's death 100 years
ago. And yes, it ends in the turning not only of the century but
also of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the Vienna Philharmonic performs Strauss waltzes on New
Year's Eve and New Year's Day in the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna and
on worldwide television, it will be conducting business more or
less as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the 21st century looms and the Vienna Philharmonic
opens Carnegie Hall's classical season with four concerts beginning
on Wednesday, it is tempting to wonder to what extent the venerable
orchestra has come to terms with the 20th. And for that matter, to
what extent an institution whose form and purposes are so firmly
rooted in the 19th century (italics)should(end italics) have done
so.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, the orchestra remains a model. It may not always
perform with the sheer power or precision of its counterparts in
America and elsewhere; in fact, it prides itself in a certain
gemutlich laxness of ensemble. ``We are in Austria,'' Michael
Werba, a Philharmonic bassoonist, said recently to a young group of
musicians he was coaching here at the International Orchestra
Institute, Attergau. ``It's together, but not exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when many orchestras, drawing from the same
international pool of players and sharing the same international
round of conductors, have begun to sound alike, the Vienna
Philharmonic outdoes them all in character and individuality of
sound. That distinctive sonority is the prime subject of the
institute in this little lakeside town in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   It is directed by Wolfgang Schuster, a timpanist and the press
information officer of the self-governing Vienna Philharmonic, and
the teachers are mostly members of the orchestra, filling what few
gaps may remain in a demanding schedule of rehearsals and
performances at the Salzburg Festival, some 45 minutes west. The
Vienna Philharmonic remains, perhaps, the ultimate period
instrument for the orchestral works of Brahms, Bruckner and
Strausses of every variety, and it is a glamorous vehicle for
almost anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But socially, the 149-member Philharmonic gets more mixed
reviews. In recent years, a younger generation of players has taken
over the orchestra's management from The Professors, as Werner
Resel, a cellist and the former president, and Walter Blovsky, a
violist and the former general manager, were widely known.
</P>
<P>
   The president is Clemens Hellsberg, 47, a violinist, the
orchestra's archivist and the author of ``Demokratie der Koenige''
(``Democracy of Kings,'' 1992, not yet available in English), a
weighty, lavishly illustrated history of the orchestra, which
treats its sometimes unedifying activities during the Nazi era with
unsparing candor.
</P>
<P>
   Hellsberg has spearheaded a movement to make this proud ensemble
face up to the unsavory aspects of its own past as well as its
country's. The most notable outcome so far is a concert scheduled
for next May at Mauthausen, Austria, the site of a concentration
camp in which more than 100,000 people perished between 1938 and
1945. Sir Simon Rattle will conduct Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say: `Fight the Beginnings,''' Hellsberg writes in a
commemorative booklet. ``Instead, I believe that `Recognize the
Beginnings' is the lesson we should draw from history for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellsberg has also organized chamber concerts with orchestra
members in New York, at the Jewish Museum and at Rockefeller
University. The Rockefeller series, which continues on Tuesday in
the Caspary Auditorium, raises funds for the Salzburg-Cornell
Seminars, a project sponsored by the American-Austrian Foundation
in which American medical doctors share their expertise with
doctors from Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   All very forward-looking, it must seem to any but the most
cynical, who _ unable to judge Hellsberg's evident sincerity for
themselves _ might suspect a public-relations smoke screen. For
there is still that perennial hot button: women, or lack of them,
in the orchestra. A second woman, Julie Palloc, a harpist, has now
joined the parent Vienna State Opera Orchestra and thus embarked on
the customary long march to the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, she will join the first female member, Anna Lelkes,
also a harpist, for a trial year. Other women have auditioned for
the opera orchestra, unsuccessfully, and there appear to be no
likely candidates in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   But what about all those young players at the institute? Of the
68 fellows enrolled this year, 31 were women, but none of several
who were questioned voiced any illusions that study here might be a
path to membership in the orchestra. Nor, for that matter, did the
men who were questioned, though a few former fellows of the
institute, which is now in its fifth year, are in fact orchestra
members.
</P>
<P>
   For most, it seems, the institute is simply an opportunity to
work with respected members of the Philharmonic and to learn
something of the Viennese sound style.
</P>
<P>
   Although the institute pays for travel and for lodging in a
quaint hotel in nearby St. Georgen, funds were tight this year,
tilting the international balance. Thirty fellows were picked from
Austria, and most of the rest from Central Europe; five were from
East Asia and four from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Americans know of it,'' said Rebecca McConnell, a
French-horn player from Indiana who is studying at the University
of Southern California. She hopes to return next year, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McConnell worked with Gunter Hogner, a noted horn player
from the Philharmonic. But the big man on campus _ at least before
Sir Neville Marriner arrived to rehearse the first concert, with
Sarah Chang as soloist, in the rustic concert hall built into
Schuster's mountain home _ was a little-known horn player from the
Vienna Volksoper Orchestra, Gregor Widholm.
</P>
<P>
   Widholm, who is also a professor at the University of Music and
Performing Arts in Vienna, is the guru of the Vienna sound. With
Schuster, he has assembled an ever-expanding booklet, ``Wiener
Klangstil,'' presenting ``facts and background information on the
particular sound of the Vienna Philharmonic'' and undoubtedly
destined to become a sizable book.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of the Vienna sound, it turns out, can be taught to
performers, but others cannot, since _ especially in wind
instruments _ they depend chiefly on the manufacture of the
instrument: the size of the bore, the thickness and curvature of
the bell.
</P>
<P>
   Widholm, ensconced in a makeshift acoustical laboratory, was a
veritable Mr. Wizard, comparing the overtone production of Viennese
instruments with that of their more or less conventional
counterparts in vivid graphic displays. Specifically Viennese
instruments were found in virtually every case to produce more
overtones, thus lending more color to the tone and allowing an
easier, freer rise to loud dynamics by giving a sense of greater
sonority.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are advantages and disadvantages to both,'' Widholm
said. ``One is not `good' and the other `bad,''' he added, trying
to sound convincing.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between styles of instruments have more
practical ramifications as well. Some instruments are played
virtually only in Vienna or in Austria. And although the Vienna
Philharmonic has been criticized for its insularity toward
non-Viennese and non-Austrian players as well as women, it may be
hard to get around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Viennese oboe is played in only four or five orchestras in
Vienna,'' said Martin Gabriel, the Philharmonic oboist on the
faculty of the institute. Gabriel would not be able to pick up the
French-style oboes of the fellows and play them without extensive
retraining, he added. Even less could they play his, a model that
stems more directly from the Baroque oboe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're different instruments,'' he said. ``The reeds are
completely different.'' He added a Viennese refrain that was
becoming less convincing each of the many times it was heard:
``It's not that one is `better' than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very small market,'' Gabriel concluded. ``You can't
work up 20 to 30 students for two vacancies.'' In most cases,
students of players in the Vienna Philharmonic have an inside track
to an orchestra that so prizes tradition, oral as well as written.
Gabriel's students would seem to have it made. And the situation
with horns is only slightly less extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Such closed circles seem to be everywhere in this orchestra.
There are legitimate artistic concerns in trying to preserve
quality, trying to preserve character, and the simplest and surest
way to address them is to do things the way they have always been
done. The structure is such that without any tinkering, the pace of
change can only be glacial.
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances are changing around the orchestra, Hellsberg
explained in his summer office, which, as he gleefully pointed out,
is located in the Institute for Moral Theology at the University of
Salzburg. Cuts in government financing threaten to trigger cuts in
the level of wages and pensions for new players.
</P>
<P>
   And salary levels for the current players, whom no one has ever
accused of being slackers, already appear low, certainly by
American standards. Although Hellsberg refused to cite a typical
salary, he said that the total of all salaries is $8 million, a
figure that would put the average salary at about $54,000, $30,000
or more below the (italics)base(end italics) salary of the top
American orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   It is still hard to imagine a world in which a crack
instrumentalist would not aspire to join the Vienna Philharmonic,
and it was probably defensive bravado when fellows at the institute
suggested that they would not want the grind. ``Sometimes they have
to play nine hours a day,'' said one. Still, the orchestra does
seem to have fallen on a time when it will need all the potential
candidates it can get. So how to open those circles?
</P>
<P>
   Not through even the most innocuous affirmative action,
evidently. When it was pointed out to Hellsberg that so many
members of the orchestra, Schuster included, are sons of former
members, and that perhaps daughters could be given the same
encouragement from the cradle up, he deflected the question.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult situation, he said, one that he now faces on a
different level, because he has a son he would like to see enter
the orchestra someday, but only if he is deemed good enough by the
audition committee (from which he, as a family member, would be
barred).
</P>
<P>
   One would, of course, expect nothing less from the Vienna
Philharmonic. Certainly the current crop of sons won their places
through merit. As if to drive the point home, Peter Schmidl, a
third-generation clarinetist in the orchestra, took part in a
concert presented by Schuster's umbrella organization, Attergauer
Kultursommer, in nearby Vocklamarkt, and played like a demigod. So
why shouldn't _ at the very least _ daughters of orchestra members
have the same opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there (italics)are(end italics) potential problems, one of
them being the child leave granted by Austrian law. A woman (or
indeed, a man) is allowed up to two years' leave and guaranteed the
right to return to the same job. The players in an orchestra,
especially this one, are not dispensable or interchangeable. Still,
at a certain point, as in so many other matters, a modicum of good
faith must be applied from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure: the issue of the hiring of women will not go
away for this orchestra. Almost as sure, the orchestra will not be
pushed. It has shown that it will move at its own pace and on its
own terms. But that pace has already given way to surprising spurts
in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the fresh winds now blowing through these venerable
precincts will knock down a wall or two. Then again, it might be
simpler and more effective just to put one up: the same
camouflaging screen for the final round of auditions that is used
for the earlier rounds. And may the best ``man'' win.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Cahners Business Information chief executive
Bruce Barnet stepped down from the Newton trade publisher last
week, apparently under pressure from the company's British-Dutch
parent.
</P>
<P>
   Like other trade publishers, Cahners has faced big profit
declines recently due to growing competition from Internet-based
media. Last month Cahners said it would restructure and lay off 300
people, mostly at operations in Illinois and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barnet has joined the exodus, leaving ``to pursue other
investment and business opportunities,'' according to Tom Nutile, a
spokesman for Cahners, a unit of Reed Elsevier PLC, whose
headquarters are in London and Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the matter said Reed Elsevier's new chief
executive, Crispin Davis, sought the change because of concerns
about Cahners' profits, which fell 45 percent for the first six
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, these sources said, Cahners had failed to
capitalize on its combination with trade magazines from the Chilton
publishing group, which Reed Elsevier purchased from Walt Disney
Co. for $447 million in 1997. Barnet was ``just not meeting his
numbers,'' said one Cahners employee familiar with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Barnet, a Time Inc. veteran who joined Cahners three years ago,
didn't return telephone calls and messages seeking comment. But
others who worked with him said he wanted to devote more resources
to on-line publishing ventures than Davis would authorize.
</P>
<P>
   London-based executives at Reed Elsevier couldn't be reached for
comment Tuesday. ``We wish Bruce well in his future endeavors,''
Davis said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nutile said Barnet's job is being filled ``for the time being''
by Brian Nairn, Cahners chief operating officer, who had overseen
operations in its offices in Des Plaines, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Nutile declined to elaborate on whether the company would
consider other candidates for the top job. Davis has said he won't
outline the company's broader restructuring plans until next
spring. A sale of Cahners is also a possibility, as is a move of
the unit's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Nairn had previously overseen some of Cahners' largest
publishing groups, including those aimed at the electronics and
manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
   In August Cahners reported revenue of $442 million for the first
six months of the year, a 2 percent decline compared to the same
period in 1998. Operating profit fell 45 percent, Cahners said,
though it didn't break out the exact figures. It attributed the
drop to an unanticipated slowdown in sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   The results also reflected Cahners' heavy spending to market its
own content on the Web, said analyst Philip Olesen, executive
director at Warburg Dillon Reed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While those expenses may have staved off gains by other
competitors, they haven't led to much new advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the Web has really hurt them already,'' Olesen
said. But the Web also represents an opportunity for the company,
he said, if Cahners can ``distinguish itself with proprietary,
must-have industry information'' on its network of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Cahners didn't announce Barnet's departure, which was first
reported Friday by the New York Post. Other talent leaving Cahners
includes Brian Kardon, formerly senior marketing vice-president who
has joined the HomePortfolio.com consumer Web site, and Susan Rice,
Cahners senior vice-president for human resources, who has told
colleagues she will leave at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Cahners' best-known magazines include the Hollywood trade
journal Daily Variety, and Publishers Weekly in New York. The
company has about 550 employees in Newton, where it produces some
of its 128 trade journals such as Electronic Business, Design News
and Test &AMP; Measurement World.
</P>
<P>
   The Newton office was relatively unaffected by the latest round
of job cuts, losing just 27 positions; deeper cuts came at Cahners
units in Radnor, Pa. and in Illinois.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Another leap in the U.S. trade deficit in July
fueled fears Tuesday that the continuing surge in imports is
threatening the health of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   As the American currency dipped yet again vs. the Japanese yen,
largely because of disappointment over the widening trade gap at
home and inaction by monetary authorities in Tokyo, stocks and
bonds reacted by falling sharply in financial markets. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 225
points, or slightly more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit for July
hit $25.2 billion, higher than the June imbalance of $24.6 billion,
confounding expectations that the deficit would start to shrink as
economic growth picks up around the world. Imports from China,
Western Europe and Japan all hit new highs, well above the
projections of most economists who have followed the trade flows
with increasing concern. And exports advanced only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials sought to put the numbers in
perspective. ``The figures are still not as bad as they were in
1987,'' William Daley, the Commerce secretary, said Tuesday, noting
that in 1987 _ the last time it set a record _ the trade deficit
was 3.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Currently
it is closer to 2.8 percent, but it is rising fast. ``But the
numbers are high enough that they are a political problem, and they
could become an economic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts fear that the steady increase of the trade
imbalance _ expected to hit $250 billion this year _ is
undercutting the value of the dollar as money flows out of the
United States to pay for an apparently insatiable American demand
for imported cars, electronics and luxury goods. A weak dollar,
which makes imports more expensive for consumers, could in turn
contribute to inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to engineer
another increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each new record trade deficit, the dollar grows more
vulnerable,'' said Michael Fenollosa, an international economist
with John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Until this summer, rising imports were generally regarded as
relatively good news in the financial markets. The dollar was
strong, and the influx of relatively inexpensive electronics, auto
parts and other goods served to revive shattered Asian economies
and helped to contain inflation. That contributed to keeping
interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past two months, the calculus has started to
change. While the American economy remains strong, the dollar has
fallen more than 12 percent against the yen since July, far more
than expected. Some analysts have begun to worry that there is no
bottom in sight for the American currency.
</P>
<P>
   And what the markets received Tuesday was a double dose of news
that the challenges may only grow worse: Just before the trade
numbers came out, Japan's central bank declined to take aggressive
steps to reverse the yen's heady rise in value. Those steps might
have only been a stopgap measure. Nonetheless, a message was sent
to investors that the yen would continue to rise, and that message
soon became self-fulfilling. The dollar declined overnight from 107
yen to 104, a huge shift by the standards of the currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that there's considerable tension with the
Japanese right now,'' one senior administration official said.
``These are the kinds of shifts that can portend trouble if you
leave them untreated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan's finance minister and former prime minister, Kiichi
Miyazawa, is expected here this weekend for the annual meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and Japan's
strategy for capping the rise of its currency is expected to be the
lead item on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bank of Japan is independent of the government just as
the Federal Reserve is _ and in recent years, as the power of
Miyazawa's finance ministry has waned, the central bank has become
considerably more willing to exercise that independence.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's figures complicate the politics of trade for the
administration on several fronts. The surging imports from China _
the deficit was $6.31 billion in July and is $35.65 billion so far
this year _ greatly complicate the administration's efforts to win
congressional approval of a deal to get China into the World Trade
Organization this year, if negotiations on that deal are wrapped up
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even apart from that, the Republican majority leader in the
House, Dick Armey of Texas, said Tuesday that he doubted that any
deal struck with Beijing would make it through the House. Lawmakers
who ``have a long-term commitment to freedom of trade, they're
saying: `I don't want to go home and face the anger of my
constituents if I vote for this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Daley acknowledged Tuesday that the most disturbing aspect of
the figures was that exports to China are still falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline in our exports to China is difficult to square
with the continued strong growth in their domestic economy,'' he
said. ``China is part of the global marketplace. If China truly
wants to join the World Trade Organization, the Chinese government
must open her markets to foreign goods and services.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures also give fuel to the critics of Vice President Al
Gore. So far the rising trade deficit is the biggest chink in the
administration's economic armor, and Republicans are doing what
they can to exploit the argument that Gore has contributed to a
strategy of running up the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton suggests that such a strategy was in place: He
said in New Zealand last week that the United States deliberately
allowed its trade deficit to rise in an effort to aid the countries
of Asia after the economic crisis that struck in July 1997. But he
did not discuss how to reverse that trend now that their economies
are recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Imports in July surged by 1 percent to a record $104.2 billion,
exceeding the modest rise in exports to $79 billion from $78.6 the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit with Japan slightly exceeded the deficit with China,
at $6.78 billion in July, and $40.37 for the year so far. But the
problem is not only with Asian nations _ trade with Canada and
Mexico, America's partners in the North American Free Trade
Agreement, totaled about a third of the deficit.

 &HT;    N.C. flooding 'like water from a bathtub'
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINETOPS, N.C. _ The swirling black water had receded enough
Tuesday for Albert Reid to go back home, back to the place where he
almost drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Five of his neighbors died Thursday in Hurricane Floyd's rising
flood waters. Another, a 5-year-old girl, is missing and presumed
dead in the snaky underbrush of Town Creek, still too deep for
rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the worst tragedies spawned by Floyd last week as
it plowed up the East Coast. Some rivers are just now cresting in
North Carolina, proof that, in this storm, water was more deadly
than hurricane-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   East of Pinetops, a motor boat attempting to carry a dozen
people to safety overturned. In Thursday's early morning, the
torrent carried half of them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I thought about a lot of things under that water,'' Reid,
64, said Tuesday as he walked past his flood-ravaged home, past a
dead horse, past the cedar tree where his wife, Mary, clung in the
branches until she was rescued after the boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-rising waters covered all but the rooftops in the
neighborhood of Dodge City in Edgecombe County, so badly damaged it
warranted a visit Monday from President Clinton. Here in Pinetops,
where mobile homes and stately homes interrupt acre upon acre of
water-logged tobacco and cotton, residents have begun venturing out
from the elementary-school emergency shelter as far as the
retreating waters will allow.
</P>
<P>
   Along Town Creek, a Tar River tributary, the surge uprooted oaks
and sycamores and tossed around metallic propane gas tanks like
balloons. A jumble of logs and branches blocked Bynum Farm Road,
where rescuers spray-painted red Xs over front doors to signal that
they already had searched for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, water covered the heads of Jesus and his disciples,
portrayed in a tapestry tacked above the sanctuary door of St.
Stevenson Holy Church of Deliverance. Inside the dark hall, the
water overturned pews and the pulpit, swelled the red-carpeted
floor and perched a foot stool atop the door of the pastor's study.
</P>
<P>
   The receding waters left a smelly, chocolate-brown residue on
the tile floor of what once was a cheerfully painted daycare center
at the rear of the church. Diapers and toiler paper were among the
debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were floating in here like inside a big aquarium,''
said Glen Williams, 37, a church deacon.
</P>
<P>
   The stench of dead livestock hung in the air, seemingly pressed
down by the low gray clouds that dumped more rain Tuesday on top of
Floyd's torrential rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's downpour swelled rivers faster than people in
low-lying areas could escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden it came out like water pouring from a
bathtub,'' said Roosevelt Lewis, 70, throwing out corn Tuesday to
what remains of his chicken flock in Dodge City. He and his
brother, Milton, lost 55 goats and five horses_Diamond, Missy, Two
Step, Blackie and J.R. One was stuck in a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, police blocked the entrance to Dodge City except to
property owners and rescuers whose search for 5-year-old Teshika
Vines has turned from rescue to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Carlos Vines, won't stop looking in emergency
shelters until he knows for sure whether his daughter is dead.
Volunteer fireman Mike Stallings fears that she is. What's
uncertain is where she is.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities confirmed the deaths of five: Carlos Vines' wife,
Keisha; her parents, Ben and Vivian Mayo; and neighborhood children
Cabrina and Destiny Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for hope in the tragedy, the Rev. Carolyn Slade, St.
Stevenson's pastor, pointed to a teal-green cinderblock house. The
rising waters trapped 11 people in the attic, and all were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that we pulled 200 to 300 people to safety,'' said
Stallings, a member of the South Edgecombe volunteer fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the Lord giveth and taketh away,'' Slade said. ``But
we were not prepared for this. It hurts, it really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, when Floyd veered toward the North Carolina coast,
residents of Dodge City braced for winds, but not for rain.
</P>
<P>
   Before he went to bed last Wednesday, Albert Reid moved his two
Cadillacs and Mazda pickup truck out from under the pine trees in
his yard. He didn't want to risk falling branches denting them.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't sleep that night, anticipating howling winds that
never came. He was surprised at dusk by the water rising from Town
Creek behind his house. He cranked his pickup, but it stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Reid went back inside and told his wife they'd have to wait for
a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Ben Mayo was ferrying neighbors to safety in his
flat-bottomed aluminum boat. On a return trip to the flooding
subdivision, Mayo picked up Reid and his wife, bringing the number
of passengers to 12.
</P>
<P>
   As the boat rode against the swift current, Mayo gunned the
motor, and the bow popped up in the air. Water poured in the back,
and the boat turned over with its hull bobbing above water.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped underneath, Reid bobbed up and down, gasping for breath,
until he was able to get out from under the boat. In the half
light, he remembers two or three children clinging to the hull. He
had lost track of his wife and his step-daughter when another man
tossed him a rope attached to the boat and told him to wrap it
around a utility pole.
</P>
<P>
   The boat stopped, and Reid escaped into a nearby house with
several others. As the water rose, they climbed into the attic,
hoping for rescuers who arrived several hours later in a boat.
</P>
<P>
   They retrieved the people in the house and Reid's wife and her
daughter from a nearby cedar tree. Over the weekend, searchers
found the bodies of five victims. Officials returned Mayo's boat to
the carport of his dark empty house, at the edge of the dense woods
where they believed the current swept 5-year-old Teshika.
</P>
<P>
   Reid remembers seeing her drifting away, across Annie Mae Ellis'
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get her,'' Reid said, ``but she was too far
away.''

TAIWAN BUILDING CODES REFLECT THOSE USED IN CALIFORNIA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both Turkey and Taiwan have effectively adopted the California
building requirements for earthquakes, which are intended to enable
occupants to get out alive in a major earthquake even if the
structure is rendered unusable, American experts said on Tuesday.
The difference is in enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The basic techniques involve using reinforced concrete walls and
columns, deep foundations and joints to transfer the stresses of a
swaying structure from crossbeams to vertical columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we have reasonable conformity,'' said Peter I. Yanev,
president of EQE International, a leading international earthquake
engineering and safety company based in San Francisco, who recently
returned from a survey in Turkey after the earthquake there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Turkey, the whole thing is done without any inspection and
there's probably more corruption,'' he said. ``You wind up with
buildings that are theoretically supposed to meet the California
code but are nowhere near it, with bad architecture, bad
engineering, bad construction and inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Yanev said, Taiwan is full of buildings built by
foreign investors with construction equal in quality to
California's _ and in some cases with higher seismic tolerances.
</P>
<P>
   In Hsinchu, a northern suburb of Taipei known as Taiwan's
Silicon Valley, computer manufacturers have built factories with
designs ``even more conservative than the California code, a little
more techie about it,'' Yanev said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's greatest vulnerability, he said, is that many of its
buildings are built on soft soil, with open-air ground floors,
known as soft stories. There are also numbers of ``sliver
buildings,'' perhaps just a single room wide and a dozen stories
tall, that are especially susceptible to an earthquake's shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put that all together and what you have is a total
disaster in Turkey, and, in Taiwan, something a little more similar
to what we'll see in California in the next big one,'' Yanev said.

CLINTON DEFENDS CLEMENCY DECISION IN LETTER TO HOUSE PANEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton tried Tuesday to blunt criticism
of his clemency offer to 16 radical Puerto Rican separatists,
saying he was motivated by the prisoners' lengthy sentences,
numerous pleas for leniency and not by politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House members investigating the militants' early
release, Clinton defended his Aug. 11 decision, saying it was based
on the merits of each case and the timing was dictated by the
departure of former White House counsel Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the question ... was whether the prisoners' sentences
were unduly severe and whether their continuing incarceration
served any meaningful purpose,'' the president wrote, noting that
their prison-time ranged from 35 to 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   The president's five-page letter, read aloud during a House
Government Reform Committee hearing, was not his first explanation
of what factored into his clemency decision, but it is his most
detailed and fullest to date. It drew immediate criticism from
victims of bombing attacks attributed to the Puerto Rican
separatists, known by the acronym FALN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to commute my sentence?'' asked Richard
Pastorella, a former New York police officer who was blinded and
lost the fingers of his right hand and the feeling in his left when
a bomb exploded in 1982 outside police headquarters. The FALN
claimed responsibility for the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been bearing this cross for 17 years,'' Pastorella said.
``I'll never be free of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Connor, a banker whose father was killed in a FALN bombing
in 1975, called Clinton's explanation ``an affront.'' The
president's letter ``is not only weak, but (it) insults the
intelligence of the American people who obviously know that (the
clemency offer) was done for political purposes,'' Connor told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that clemency was opposed by federal prosecutors
and the FBI, Clinton's letter Tuesday said he followed Ruff's
guidance. ``His recommendation and my decision were based on our
view of the merits of the requests,'' the president said.
``Political considerations played no role in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's letter was delivered less than a week after he
notified the committee that he was invoking executive privilege and
would not provide Congress access to documents and testimony from
high-level administration officials involved in the clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to citing the president's limited right to
confidentiality of communications with aides, the White House
argued that Congress has no oversight over the president's
constitutional authority to grant clemency.
</P>
<P>
   The clemency information had been subpoenaed by the committee,
whose inquiry was triggered by criticism that the clemency offer
was made to help first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's anticipated
bid for the Senate in New York. The state is home to about 1.3
million Puerto Rican expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those offered clemency claimed membership in FALN _ the
Spanish abbreviation for the Armed Forces of National Liberation.
The group was blamed for 130 bombing of U.S. civilian and military
targets between 1974 and 1983. Six people were killed in the
attacks and dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Of those offered clemency, 14 accepted and two declined. Eleven
were paroled two weeks ago, another has five more years to serve
before he is eligible for parole and two had their fines reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The FALN members _ who were tried almost a decade before
Congress enacted anti-terrorism laws in 1990 _ were convicted of
seditious conspiracy and possession of weapons and explosives. Most
had been behind bars for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people urging their release were former President
Carter, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, several members of
Congress and Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights leader
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, which was addressed to Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., Clinton reminded committee members that he required the
prisoners to renounce violence as a condition of clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those who supported unconditional clemency for the
prisoners argued that they were political prisoners who acted out
of sincere political beliefs. I rejected this argument,'' Clinton
wrote. ``No form of violence is ever justified as a means of
political expression in a democratic society based on the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society believes, however, that a punishment should fit
the crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to counter Clinton's claim that none of the Puerto Rican
nationals had been involved in violent crimes, committee Chairman
Dan Burton, R-Ind., began Tuesday's hearing with a grainy videotape
from the FBI showing two of the militants making a letter bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Burton then cited court records indicating that four of the
militants had been arrested in connection with an armored car
holdup in Connecticut and were allied with a group that killed a
San Juan police officer, ambushed a Navy school bus killing two
sailors, and shot an Army officer at Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burton said one of the nationalists who turned down the clemency
offer had 15 years tacked onto his sentence after he was found
guilty of planning a violent prison break and ordering a slaying by
his confederates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the president know about this man before he offered to let
him out of prison?'' Burton asked. ``The American people believe
the time has come to put these people away and not let them back on
the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burton and other Republicans on the committee, along with
several witnesses, said Clinton's decision sends the wrong message
about U.S. policy toward terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray to God this will not start a new reign of terror,''
said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gallagher, the FBI's assistant director for national
security, said the militants freed by Clinton ``are criminals, and
they are terrorists, and they represent a threat to the United
States.'' The administration had blocked Gallagher from testifying
at similar hearings last week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the panel released a letter from FBI Director Louis
Freeh saying that he had warned the Justice Department that
releasing any of the prisoners ``would likely return committed,
experienced, sophisticated and hardened terrorists to the
clandestine movement'' for Puerto Rican independence.
</P>
<P>
   In correspondence with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., Freeh said his agency has opposed release of the FALN
members and had restated that position as recently as June 28,
about six weeks before Clinton's clemency offer.

 &HT;    RESCUERS HUNT FOR 3,000 BURIED TAIWANESE AFTER KILLER QUAKE
 &HT;    800&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAICHUNG, Taiwan _ Rescuers worked frantically into a second,
critical day Wednesday to uncover an estimated 3,000 people who may
still be buried alive in the ruins of a massive earthquake that
killed more than 1,770 people and smashed entire mountain towns in
central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete lay buckled and ripped as though a giant claw had
slashed it in the hardest hit neighborhood in Taichung, the
third-largest city on Taiwan. Apartment buildings were splintered
into giant crumbs of concrete and the earth had heaved into a new
hillock.
</P>
<P>
   Along one small street where scores perished, more than 200
survivors spent the night on blankets on an outdoor basketball
court of the Taiwan army's Dakuan Supply Base, a few hundreds yards
from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're too afraid to sleep inside,'' said Capt. Lee Tai Shen,
showing an almost vacant, temporary dormitory the soldiers had
created by giving up their own bunks. With most survivors sleeping
on hard concrete outside, fewer than a dozen people, mostly women
and children, had bunched themselves fully clothed on bunkbeds in
one corner of the room. Ranks of other available beds stood crisply
made and empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to rescue the people around here last night,'' Lee
said, describing how his troops ran out to the devastation just
after the temblor jolted the northern half of Taiwan awake at 1:47
a.m. (local time) Tuesday. They managed to save 60-70 people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the island's second deadliest earthquake after a 1935
tremor at a magnitude of 7.4 killed 3,276 Taiwanese. Every year
Taiwan trembles under the influence of dozens of earthquakes
because it sits on the western edge of the Pacific ``Rim of Fire,''
where the Philippine tectonic plate smashes against the Eurasian
land mass that historically spawned steep mountains, volcanoes and
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Just in this one neighborhood hundreds were injured, a part of
the more than 4,400 injuries reported island-wide by the Interior
Ministry's disaster management center.
</P>
<P>
   Another six shelters were set up in this area alone, and
hundreds of schools and other buildings were converted to makeshift
housing across the island for the 100,000 Taiwanese left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands refused the aid, however, preferring to
sleep outside or in small, open-front shops Tuesday night, from
which they could escape quickly if need be. In one such shop, a
family of three spread blankets on chairs clustered together like a
queen-sized bed to wait out the dark night.
</P>
<P>
   Electric power remained nonexistent Wednesday morning for about
4 million Taiwanese families, although more than a million
households had electricity restored, mostly in the area of the
capital city Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   With a population exceeding 100,000, Taichung city lies at the
periphery of the most extensive damage that radiates from the
quake's epicenter to the southeast. At a town called Puli near the
epicenter, 95 percent of the buildings were reported wrecked. That
area has been practically inaccessible except by helicopter, its
roads mostly heaved into impassable ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Near Puli, bodies were reported piling up in roadside tents,
after morgues and hospitals were filled. Radio reports said there
was urgent need for refrigeration in the late summer heat, to keep
bodies from decomposing.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals for blood, medical supplies, bottled water and
bulldozers came from the hardest hit communities there near the
center of the shockwave that registered 7.6 on the Richter scale,
according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Taiwan's Central Weather
Bureau put the quake at the 7.3 level.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologist Yi Men Wu warned that ``very strong'' aftershocks
could be in store, as high as 6.5 in the coming two weeks. He said
there already had been 1,280 aftershocks as of 9 p.m. (local time)
Tuesday, but only 28 were severe enough to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   A serious aftershock registering 6.8 rattled the island on
Wednesday morning and had its epicenter in this same central region
hit worst by Tuesday's quake.
</P>
<P>
   Already disaster teams started arriving Tuesday from Japan and
Singapore, and the United States dispatched two military aircraft
with about 70 rescue staff and sniffer dogs. Also en route was a
Turkish search and rescue team that had saved 200 people from the
earthquake that shattered Turkey last month.
</P>
<P>
   China's President Jiang Zemin put aside the searing dispute that
has rattled relations between the mainland and this island of 22
million the Chinese government calls a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster ``hurt the hearts of people on the mainland, as the
Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan strait are as closely
linked as flesh and blood,'' he said. China's Red Cross promised to
send $100,000 worth of disaster aid and $60,000 worth of relief
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's leadership, which set off the latest round in the
50-year feud when it distanced itself from the notion of a single
China by declaring the two governments should have ``special
state-to-state relations,'' expressed cautious thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a good beginning to improving ties,'' Su Chi,
chair of the Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's damage appeared less severe than the widespread
destruction in Turkey, where a 7.3 level earthquake killed more
than 15,000 people. Buildings here, especially around the island's
main north-south geological fault line, have been solidly built out
of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Recent rapid development, however, has produced complaints of
builders ignoring construction codes and bribing building officials
to wink at inferior construction. That may have contributed to the
collapse of select buildings, especially in Taipei, while adjacent
structures stood fast.
</P>
<P>
   In Taipei, where major damage was limited to a scattering of
buildings and a bridge, life already was beginning to return to
normal. Many offices and schools, including the American School of
Taiwan, announced they were reopening their doors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute in Taiwan, the U.S. government's
unofficial embassy on the island, had sent personnel to this
central Taiwan area to monitor needs and relay the requests for
help to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had this big of an earthquake here,'' said Kevin
Huang, 25, as he stood in line to rent an electric generator in
suburban Taipei. ``We thought we were safe.''

EAST TIMORESE OFFER CAUTIOUS WELCOME TO PEACEKEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ Monday this impoverished, seaside capital was
an eerie and unrelenting vision of ruin: row after row of buildings
and vehicles scorched beyond repair, streets empty of cars, people
nowhere to be found except huddled nervously in a giant makeshift
tarpaulin camp by the port.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the second day that United Nations-approved
peacekeepers poured into this island territory armed with a mandate
to use force if needed to halt the bloody backlash against the
winners of an Aug. 30 vote for independence, Dili began _ almost
magically _ to spring back to life.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Sept. 4, when a landslide popular vote
to separate from Indonesia was announced, unleashing a savage
revenge campaign by militias backed by Indonesian security forces,
terrified men who were targeted for death emerged from their hiding
places in the hills. Women, children and the elderly, meanwhile,
spilled onto Dili's streets to celebrate a new beginning for their
would-be nation.
</P>
<P>
   Children clapped and cheered as scores of heavily armed
Australian commandos strode in formation down both sides of Dili's
main street Tuesday, their eyes darting back and forth for enemies,
but encountering only grateful smiles, friendly waves and eager
cries of ``Hello mister!'' One man threw himself to his knees and
raised cupped hands heavenward to a convoy of Australian armored
personnel carriers that cruised central Dili.
</P>
<P>
   The multinational force has had a surprisingly smooth entry
considering that militia leaders had warned that they were
``thirsty for the blood of white people'' and would target
Australians for meddling in Indonesia's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the troops got an effusive emotional reception from
thousands of people here and in the mountain redoubt of Dare _ a
welcome perhaps most striking for what it revealed about the
undaunted spirit of East Timorese who favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   The ``nation'' is in tatters _ infrastructure gutted, homes,
farms and shops destroyed, and thousands of people feared dead. Yet
people said their commitment to freedom is even stronger now, and
the arrival of foreign troops and the departure of Indonesian ones
is the first step in securing that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been two or three hours that I've seen young men on
the streets. They've all been hidden for two weeks at least,''
cried a delighted Maria de Fatima, 32, a social worker. She said
displaced people squatting at Dili's port shared their limited food
with the men who came down from the hills Tuesday, because many in
the mountains were in danger of starving.
</P>
<P>
   Some separatist rebels ventured down from the hills to see the
international force for themselves, and rejoiced by showing their
flag and singing songs before returning, said a young sympathizer
who was with them.
</P>
<P>
   As for the militias, most residents say the last ones left
Monday. ``But the main worry of the people here is not the
militias, but the military,'' said de Fatima. ``The militias are
just the curtains; the army is behind it all.''
</P>
<P>
   With the supposed withdrawal of 80 percent of the Indonesian
troops in the territory, the terror and suspicion created by the
soldiers seemed to be abating. The remaining Indonesian troops _
until now, cruel adversaries of independence supporters _ were
suddenly friendly Tuesday, smiling at local residents venturing out
for the first time in weeks and waving at foreign journalists
retunring to the decimated city.
</P>
<P>
   As the people around here cheerfully hailed a passing truckload
of crimson-bereted Indonesian naval officers, de Fatima became
incensed, spitting out bitterly, ``Those are the same troops who
broke into my clinic on the 10th of September and destroyed all my
medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have not forgotten the recent horrors, of course, and
some of the mutual friendliness may be protective camouflage on
both sides. Indonesian soldiers don't want to be caught inciting
violence once peackeepers arrive, and ordinary people who survived
this month's bloodshed don't want to stand out in the crowd if
Indonesian troops turn nasty again.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, some of that camouflage has faded away. A
father of two who used to don a militia t-shirt to avoid being
targeted as an independence supporter cheerfully pointed out that
he is now proudly wearing a t-shirt with the face of Xanana Gusmao,
the longtime Timorese resistance leader.
</P>
<P>
   For some here, though, the peacekeepers are a welcome sight, but
too belated. Antonia Carvalho, 40, is a mother of eight whose
husband was slain by militias on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Forced from her home, she now has no food, clean clothes or
medicine, and her 3-year-old daughter is dying in a squatters camp
at a burned-out hotel. ``I am glad for everyone else that the
troops are here,'' Carvalho said quietly, ``but my husband is
already dead, so they are too late for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A ride through Dili and its adjacent communities paints a
sobering portrait of how methodical the militia- and
military-sponsored destruction seems to have been, and just how
long it may take to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The home of Nobel Peace Lauriate Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo was
blackened by fire, the roof missing and a gaping hole in the wall
exposing a Virgin Mary statue inside.
</P>
<P>
   Running water, telephones and electricity are almost impossible
to find now. The acrid, nose-burning stench of recent fires and
smoldering ashes hangs over several streets.
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti is everywhere, even on furniture abandoned on the road.
``Autonomy tragedy'' said one message, referring to the decisive
vote for autonomy under Indonesian rule or separation. ``Mission
impossible,'' declared another, an apparent reference to the tough
task for foreign peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Army Corporal Peter Condie, 28, who was at the front
of a platoon that marched into the decimated downtown, was neither
surprised by the destruction, nor by the warm welcome he received
from locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supporting the entire idea of their having
independence,'' Convie said, adding quickly, ``Well, I can only
speak for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely that perceived bias among peacekeepers that
grates on the government and nationalists in Jakarta, where shots
were fired at the Australian Embassy. In Medan, Indonesia's third
largest city, student protesters stormed the Australian Consulate,
burned its flag along with an American one, and raised an
Indonesian flag.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, troops met no resistance, disarming and detaining six
civilians for carrying weapons. Shots were fired near the heliport,
a command-post for the international force, but no assailant was
caught.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby mountain area of Dare, where 50,000 people fled
the violence in Dili, 2,000 people, some with tears of relief,
greeted the returning UN mission chief and his UN military escort
as saviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long live East Timor,'' and ``Viva independencia!'' chanted
the refugees who had fled to the hills, most of them men in their
20s to 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the UN people come, we are very, very happy,'' declared
Sernao Gomes, 28, a university student who has been hiding in the
jungle for 16 days, eating rice and wild plants. As for the
militias, he said confidently, ``I think they will be finished.
Militias are just tools of the military.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gomes, admitted, ``every night we still hear the sound
of shooting, so we are still afraid.''

 &HT;    Harvey makes his mark on Florida
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Last week, Hurricane Floyd spared Palm
Beach County by taking a fortuitous turn to the north. Tuesday,
Tropical Storm Harvey drooped south of its projected course,
leaving Palm Beach County residents twice lucky and relatively dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary reason is a fairly strong cold front rolling
through Alabama and Mississippi,'' said David Kosier, a National
Weather Service meteorologist in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   That cold front may have warmed the hearts of the water-logged
from Boca Raton north, but it didn't leave a dry eye anywhere from
Miami south to Key West. Particularly hard hit were people on the
west coast. Weather watchers in Naples reported over 10 inches of
rain Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was expected to curve slightly northeast as it left an
exit wound somewhere in Broward or Miami-Dade. It will also pick up
speed, Kosier said. He predicted Harvey would roll ashore on Grand
Bahama Island this morning.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Kosier said that we can all expect sunshine on the horizon.
Hurricane Gert is no threat to the eastern U.S. coast, and nothing
else is brewing in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we'll get back to normal sunshine and afternoon
showers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a steady weakening as it passed over South Florida,
Harvey still managed to cause some trouble. As it moved inland,
passing over Everglades City by late afternoon, it left streets in
the small fishing village under two feet of water and spawned flood
warnings in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, there were a few minor showers and a
little wind, but nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some strong winds _ about 15 to 20 mph,'' said Palm
Beach International Airport spokeswoman Lisa Waters. ``The tower
had some gusts.''
</P>
<P>
   But airport operations have not been affected due to Harvey, she
said. Two commuter flights to Tampa were cancelled Tuesday morning,
but other flights were running on schedule, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some flights from PBIA to the Bahamas were cancelled, but that
was a holdover from Hurricane Floyd _ not a result of Harvey, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the western side of the peninsula, where the storm made
landfall, things were wetter. More than 10 inches of rain fell in
parts of Collier County, according to the National Weather Service
in Miami. A number of secondary streets were closed due to high
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had up to 30 homes and businesses suffer some
flooding,'' said Ken Pineau, director of the Collier County
Emergency Operations Center in Naples. Monday night, almost 50 cars
in the Naples area were disabled because of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey dropped much lesser amounts of rain in other counties,
with about an inch falling in Miami-Dade and Broward by
mid-afternoon and more later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Schools closed for the day in the Keys, St. Lucie, Collier and
Lee counties, mostly out of concern for localized street flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm warnings were posted for Grand Bahama Island and
the Abacos in the northern Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, which formed late Sunday from a tropical depression in
the eastern Gulf of Mexico, had sustained winds at near 50 mph,
with higher gusts, when it made landfall, but weakened as it
crossed South Florida. Tropical storm force winds of at least 39
mph extended out 115 miles, mainly to the east of the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center is not really well defined. It's just kind of a
raggedy system,'' said Stephen Baig, oceanographer at the National
Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Essentially, the southern peninsula of
Florida is going to get lots of rain and gusts.''
</P>
<P>
   Once over the Atlantic, Harvey should accelerate northeastward
during the next day or two and become absorbed by a cold front,
according to the hurricane center.

SCALPERS FIND IT'S NOT SUCH A `HOT' TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ They are the unofficial greeters at the Ryder
Cup. No uniform comes with the job, but nervous twitches, constant
cell phone use and day-old stubble give the group away. Tuesday
just outside The Country Club, scalpers congregated along a metal
fence on Clyde Street. They welcomed visitors by asking, ``You
selling tickets?''
</P>
<P>
   The scalpers' pitch was met by both stares and questions. And
finally a few prospective customers. All sorts of deals were
proposed outside the main gate. The scalpers sought tickets for
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday _ the match play days. The spectators
wanted to swap practice days or sell tickets they couldn't use. But
by lunch time, business was so slow the scalpers used one of their
many village passes to get free meals.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup continues to be a lesson in supply and demand.
Tickets to the practice rounds: high supply, low demand,
unexpectedly low prices. Parking spaces: low supply, high demand,
exorbitantly high prices. Merchandise: high supply, high demand,
happy consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While fans walked away with bags full of golf sweaters, official
posters, and Ryder Cup Christmas ornaments _ and locals made a few
extra dollars _ the scalpers were left with pockets of unused
tickets. According to the would-be profiteers, two key factors
conspired to limit sales. First, many golf fans were not willing to
take public transportation to explore the market. They assumed a
scarcity of Ryder Cup tickets and didn't want to take the time.
Spectators who rely on scalpers always fear they won't get in.
Second, newspaper articles listed going rates for single-day
tickets ranging between $125-$650, which scared buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give them away,'' said a scalper named John as he
tried unloading tickets to the practice rounds. ``Send me some
buyers. People can't get near the place to get tickets. They've got
to get on a bus. And they don't want to get on a bus to get
tickets. They always write it up like it's a big thing, but all
you've got to do is show up, just like any other event.''
</P>
<P>
   John, who asked that only his first name be used, offered
tickets to watch Tuesday's practice for $10 and $20. He refused to
take any tickets for today, believing rain would make them an even
harder sell. Tickets to the first public practice were in such
great supply that a spectator walked up to John and gave him three
grounds passes. The man thought he was giving the scalper a gift.
</P>
<P>
   The great fear among those outside the front gate was that
business would remain slow the rest of the week. From his first day
at the Ryder Cup, John sensed the only tickets worth anything
significant were those for the competition days. But even the
asking price for those tickets will be far less than anticipated.
They should not approach the $600 to $700 range. Based on Tuesday,
the scalpers felt $200 was a more accurate number.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who got them thought they were worth a fortune,'' said
John G. from LA. ``People held on to them. They wanted top dollar,
but demand has gone way down. We'll get $200 tops, but there's
always a pigeon paying more.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the professional scalpers had the best deals of
the day. Spectators who found themselves with an extra ticket at
the last minute tried to recoup their losses along Clyde and Newton
Streets. Inexperienced at the art of reselling tickets, they
flashed grounds passes in full view of Brookline Police officers.
Although scalping tickets is illegal in Massachusetts, the local
police in four instances focused on directing traffic rather than
stopping any exchange. In fact, a security guard assisting the
police, who declined to give his name, advised a woman in her 60s
on scalping tickets, telling her how it's done at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Greene of Glastonbury, Conn., sat on a stone wall on Clyde
Street, hoping to sell extra passes to the practice rounds. He
bought a whole set a tickets through ebay.com. However, the deal
required that he purchase two tickets for each of the practice
dates. He sold a ticket for Thursday's session for $50, but by 11
a.m. his patience was waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take whatever I can get for them,'' said Greene, who
spent approximately $83 for each practice-day ticket. ``I'm not
trying to make a killing off them. I'm just trying to get some
money back and defray the cost. I probably overpaid for all of
them, but how many times can you go to the Ryder Cup?''
</P>
<P>
   Other spectators exhibited the same spare-no-expense attitude
with parking spaces. Despite tournament organizers' requests for
fans to take public transportation and keep traffic around The
Country Club to a minimum, some drove as close as they could. Then,
they searched for places to legally park. In one case, the price
for parking exceeded the price for tickets. The Exxon station at
the corner of Newton and Grove Streets charged $75 for the day. And
many motorists were happy to pay the fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to pay,'' said John Mancini of East
Greenwich, R.I., as he sifted through a roll of $20 bills. ``We
don't ask questions. I figure whatever he (owner John Douros) says,
I'm going to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 a.m., the gas station lot was nearly full. Judging from
the number of parked cars and the inconvenience the Ryder Cup posed
for his business, Douros did not think he was overcharging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm losing money because if it wasn't for the Ryder Cup, I'd
have 20 cars to repair today,'' he said. ``My customers are not
coming for gas because they are afraid of the traffic. I've got to
do what I've got to do to make up for some of the loses. At $75,
I'm losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   One mile up Newton Street, Marilyn and John Dalzell charged $30
per spot, the same price they posted during the 1988 US Open,
though the couple acknowledged they were considering a $10 price
raise. Even with the increase, its likely their driveway will
remain the best buy in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Inside The Country Club, prices were high, but none of the fans
expected to find a bargain. They entered the Ryder Cup Golf Shop to
spend. And a line that stretched from the tent's entrance almost
back to the pro shop proved they would not be deterred.
</P>
<P>
   When the weekend golfers and Tiger Woods admirers entered the
20,000 square-foot shop, they were awed. Glassy-eyed fans toted
armloads of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ryder Cup, value was in the eye of the beholder and not
in the hands of those left holding extra tickets.

 &HT;    Falcons look to fly against winds of change
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Future NFL Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen was
spotted at Hartsfield International Airport Tuesday morning, but he
wasn't on his way to try out for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Calling up a retired legend like Allen isn't the way to replace
Jamal Anderson, whose season likely ended Monday night when he tore
the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Anderson's injury isn't the only reason the Falcons are
0-2. Quarterback Chris Chandler, for example, missed Monday's game
with a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   After a run of negative events since the Falcons appeared in the
Super Bowl for the first time, just putting together back-to-back
winning seasons for the first times has become a very daunting
task.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these occurrences come as baggage for teams that
suddenly become winners. Coach Dan Reeves said Anderson's injury,
while a terrible blow, is part of pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way life is,'' he said. ``You are going to have
adversity. The teams that handle it best are going to be the teams
that are in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's absence isn't the only change.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was marked by a minimal number of serious injuries,
and the team's penchant for forcing and capitalizing on other
teams' mistakes while making few of its own.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Falcons have a minus-five turnover ratio after
leading the NFL last year with a plus-20 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The first piece of bad news came the night before the Super
Bowl, when free safety Eugene Robinson was arrested for
solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, Tony Martin, the team's leading receiver last
season, was released in connection with legal problems (he was
later cleared), and leading tackler Cornelius Bennett was released
in a cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   Before the draft, the Falcons approached the Patriots about the
possibility of trading Anderson. Then, Atlanta traded next year's
first-round draft choice to Baltimore, and got the Ravens'
second-round choice, No. 42 overall.
</P>
<P>
   They selected Mississippi State tight end Reggie Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   As Anderson began training camp in a holdout, reserve running
back Gary Downs season ended on the second day with a serious right
knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Falcons kept all four tight ends, one more than last
year, and just three running backs, one less than last year.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's injury, that became a problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the Falcons can't hold onto the ball, turning it
over seven times already, setting up or accounting directly for 31
of the their opponents' 41 points.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, the front office has taken steps to lock up some
potential free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got a five-year, $32 million contract, wide receiver
Terance Mathis a four-year, $12 million contract, and fullback Bob
Christian a five-year, $10 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven-year, $52.5 million contract signed by defensive
tackle Travis Hall is different.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had three years left on his current deal, and while he was
underpaid to begin with, Alan Herman, the agent for defensive end
Lester Archambeau said his client is underpaid, too.
</P>
<P>
   His $800,000 in salary is less than half the going rate for
starting defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Herman said, Archambeau -- who led the team
last year with 10 sacks and seven forced fumbles along with 77
tackles -- is in the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a disappointing negotiation as far as Lester is
concerned,'' Herman said. ``I'm not sure I'm clear on why you would
extend a player who has three years remaining when you have a
player like Lester who is up.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Age) has been an issue, but Terance Mathis is 32 as well.
Travis got a $5 million signing bonus, Terance a $3 million bonus.
Lester was not offered $3 million, and yet he's 32 years old, like
Terance. He's like the Rodney Dangerfield of the Falcons. He
doesn't get any respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Atlanta had uncanny chemistry on the way to a 16-3
record. There by no means appears to be unrest in the locker room,
but nine starters who can become unrestricted or restricted free
agents are wondering if they will get new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know when each other's contracts are up,'' said
strong-side linebacker Henri Crockett, who can become a restricted
free agent after the season. ``But I don't think that's the
problem. Every player is different, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons thought they solved their long-standing problem at
backup quarterback when they signed former New York Giants starter
Danny Kanell to a two-year, $2.1 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been sloppy, and Tony Graziani has likewise been
erratic, although Reeves said the play of the offensive line has
had as much to do with the offensive meltdown as anything.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been solid, though, and on the plus side,
Chandler may return for Sunday's game at St. Louis, and Atlanta is
19-5 when he starts and finishes a game.
</P>
<P>
   Also, parity is running rampant in a league where both Super
Bowl teams are 0-2, and the four teams that went to the conference
championship games last year are a combined 1-7.
</P>
<P>
   Three teams that began last season 0-2 -- the Jets, Bills and
Cardinals -- went on to earn playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Falcons' division doesn't include any juggernauts.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the end is not here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a different vibe around here as we just got
to get on the same page,'' said right tackle Ephraim Salaam. ``I
only speak for the offensive side of the ball; the defense is
playing pretty good. We got to practice, practice, practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as linebacker Keith Brooking said, ``We've got to keep our
heads up. We can accomplish the things we set out to do this year,
and that's to win the NFC West.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to get a lot of sympathy from anybody,'' he
said. ``People aren't really interested in anything other than
results.''

U.S. TO URGE WITHHOLDING INTERNATIONAL LOANS FROM RUSSIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A top Clinton administration official said Tuesday
that in light of recent accusations of Russian money laundering,
the United States will urge withholding international loans from
that country until its leaders implement more reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the pervasive problems in the rule of law in Russia, we
do not believe at this point that the provision of new funds would
be constructive,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the
House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Summers also said the Clinton administration will introduce new
policies Thursday aimed at curbing banking abuses. He defended U.S.
policy toward Russia in the face of Republican criticism that the
administration has lacked oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal will focus on how U.S. banks handle foreign
money and will include requirements that storefront check cashers,
brokerage firms and casinos notify authorities of suspicious
activities the way banks do.
</P>
<P>
   Recent allegations that Russian mobsters funneled $10 billion
through the Bank of New York largely prompted House committee
members' concerns over U.S. policy toward Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury and Justice departments launched a probe into the bank
in April when they first heard of the diversions. No one has been
charged in the case, and U.S. investigators have not commented
publicly on it. But Summers did say that no information showed
money from the International Monetary Fund was diverted to the
nation's 15th largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, which has 182 countries as members, was formed to help
maintain a stable system of buying and selling currencies so that
countries can make payments in foreign money without delay.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Tuesday that Russians
wanted the scandal investigated, even if it implicated officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an interest that is no less than the American
interest,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers told lawmakers that while the administration will
monitor Russian finances closer, the U.S. and the IMF should not
abandon the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
   To ignore Russia would ``limit our ability to support Russian
economic and financial stability; it would inhibit our ability to
promote democratization, and it would raise the risk that the
United States and the West would be labeled as scapegoats for
Russia's failure to address its problems,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, said he will
introduce legislation that will restrict how U.S. banks work with
overseas institutions and prevent them from opening and maintaining
accounts with off-shore banks that are not under the same
supervision as those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation is intended to ``pierce the veil of
secrecy that for too long has made it possible for offshore
financial institutions to skirt U.S. laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to $15 billion in Russian funds were sent to offshore
accounts over the last year, the administration acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   As concerns mount over the former superpower's decline, some
Republicans are asking, ``who lost Russia?'' and some critics blame
the fiasco on Vice President Al Gore, a presidential candidate who
has played a major role in U.S.-Russian dealings.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said only Russia can blame itself for its
troubles. ``Nobody lost Russia,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash.
``Russia was not ours to lose. It will be a Russian ... not an
American failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said continued IMF or World Bank involvement in Russia
will depend on:
</P>
<P>
   _ Completion of an investigative report, detailing offshore
operations of the Central Bank of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stronger controls at the CBR to manage reserves, markets and
extension of credit to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``regime'' of regular external IMF-reviewed audits of the
CBR.
</P>
<P>
   _ New safeguards on the use of international aid for budget
support.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers said the IMF has followed Russian finances, and that
the agency has canceled parts of loans amounting to $228 million
because of the Russia's financial crisis. He said since 1993, the
policy toward Russia has focused on a balance between what was
necessary and what was politically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   At least, Summers said, the worst case Russian-scenario has not
come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``.... Many of the things that were feared not very long ago:
hyperinflation, collapse of the Russian state, a return to
communism, and so forth, a major nationalist revival in an
anti-American fashion _ many of the things that were most feared
have also not materialized.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some members of the committee said the bottom line was
to keep Russia from reverting to Cold War ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my hope that this does not relegate into some kind of a
partisan issue, but that we keep our eye on the ball,'' said Rep.
Paul Ryan, R-Wis. ``And that is that we help the Russian people get
a healthy growing economy with a currency that has a solid store of
value.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Tuesday, Switzerland's government
announced that Swiss banks have frozen $16.8 million in accounts
suspected to be linked to the Russian laundering case.

A BRIBERY CASE TAINTS 2,000 DIVORCES IN MANHATTAN MATRIMONIAL
COURT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The chief administrator of the Manhattan Matrimonial
Court has accepted tens of thousands of dollars in bribes over the
last seven years to expedite hundreds of divorces and get approvals
on others that were fraudulently prepared, prosecutors said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The administrator, Steven Singer, admitted on Friday that he
accepted bribes ranging from $10 to hundreds of dollars to take
divorce papers and _ without having verified the authenticity of
the papers as required _ quickly forward them to a judge for
signing as uncontested divorces.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said some of the documents involved a wide array of
fraud, including husbands forging their wives signatures on divorce
settlements that required the husbands to make only paltry child
support payments. In other cases, Singer said, he took the bribes
simply to expedite the cases for impatient couples, cutting the
waiting time to a couple of days from two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The cases that were expedited, court officials said, would
likely be allowed to stand. But divorces that involved fraud would
probably be thrown out. As a result, people who believed they had
been legally divorced and then remarried may be bigamists,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, said Tuesday
that his office was reviewing about 2,000 divorces granted by the
Manhattan Matrimonial Court, but he cautioned that the
investigation was in its initial stages and that it was not yet
known how many of the divorces might have involved fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Two divorce lawyers have previously been indicted in the schemes
and two clerks were indicted Tuesday, prosecutors said, and as many
as 20 other divorce lawyers and court employees are under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that all of the cases being investigated came
from low-cost legal offices, known in the field as ``divorce
mills,'' that cater to immigrants and the poor with relatively
low-cost services.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, who was arrested in June, pleaded guilty on Friday in
state Supreme Court in Manhattan to multiple counts of accepting
bribes. He is scheduled to be sentenced by Justice John Cataldo of
state Supreme Court on Jan. 10 and faces up to seven years in
prison and a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stunned colleagues of Singer, a leading expert on
New York matrimonial law who frequently gave speeches to bar
associations on the topic. He had served as supervising clerk for
matrimonial cases in Manhattan since 1996 and been a court clerk
for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very bright fellow who was extremely intelligent
and worked all hours,'' said one court official. ``It's just
incomprehensible to so many of us, and deeply disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer oversaw a staff of 20 clerks whose duties included
verifying requests for uncontested divorces, which require both
husband and wife to sign affidavits stating they agree to the
terms. Court officials said more than 90 percent of divorces in New
York are uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows New York residents to apply for divorce in any
county they wish, and Manhattan's courts have a reputation for
quickly processing uncontested divorces, the officials said. The
Manhattan Matrimonial Court processes by far the most divorce cases
in the state, handling between 12,000 and 15,000 a year, or more
than half of the total number of uncontested divorces in the state.
Court officials attributed that case load to the concentration of
divorce mills in Manhattan and the reputation for quick processing.
</P>
<P>
   After Singer and his staff verified the validity of the divorce
papers, they forward them to a judge or court-appointed referees
for signing, court officials said. Court officials said the judges
check the papers again themselves, but divorce lawyers said they
believe court clerks are the ones who generally make sure ``all the
t's are crossed and i's dotted.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Singer ignored clear signs of fraud in exchange
for the bribes and was caught in a series of sting operations
mounted by the district attorney's office between 1997 and this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Five undercover investigators went to Singer with documents
containing forged signatures. They all received court-certified
divorces. Eight other undercover investigators filed divorce papers
using the names of Manhattan district attorneys who served in the
late 1800s. Again, all of the divorces were approved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It varied from case to case,'' one prosecutor said, referring
to the fraud. ``But for the most part it was to get the divorce
quickly and with no questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they feared that poor and immigrant women, in
particular, could have been victimized in some of the schemes.
Those women, divorce lawyers said, may be unaware of state laws
that guarantee them a percentage of their husband's income as child
support in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was started in 1997 over a child support case.
A woman complained to court officials that she had received a copy
of an uncontested divorce settlement that she never agreed to. The
settlement included a far smaller amount of child support than she
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce lawyers and court officials said the cases confirm
long-running concerns about the activities of divorce mills. The
shops, which charge as little as $500 for a divorce, have emerged
as a cheap alternative to hiring private lawyers whose divorce fees
can easily rise into the thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said they have also long suspected the shops of
submitting false forms declaring their clients to be impoverished
and unable to pay the $275 in divorce paper filing fees, but then
charging the client $275 anyway and pocketing the money.

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ At a time when pro golfers are divided into
three subsets _ long, longer and Tiger Woods _ it's important to
note that this week's Ryder Cup will not be won with a smoking
driver.
</P>
<P>
   The more crucial elements to victory at The Country Club will be
a blazing putter, red-hot wedge shots and recovery shots that
extinguish a fire before it blazes out of control.
</P>
<P>
   These factors are worth so much more in Ryder competition than
the booming tee shot. You can't win a par-4 or par-5 from the tee
box (although it can be lost with one bad swing). But a par-saving
putt or a morale-stealing chip-in that deflates the opponent is far
more valuable in team competition than a 320-yard drive. Nobody
knows that better than U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short game in match play is very, very important, because
it has to do with knitting your holes together,'' Crenshaw says.
``It's up to the players. They have to ask themselves: `How can I
get better? How can I improve my short game?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I think we're due. The Europeans have held the
Cup the last couple of times because of a couple of things. It may
sound simplistic, but they've done a better job of holing out at
the right times. And they have gotten the ball up and down in tough
situations when they needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are two areas where the Americans must improve. Crenshaw
knows it. And the players should know it, too, says Dave Pelz, the
short-game wizard who has taught Ryder Cuppers on both sides the
fine points of saving strokes around the green.
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than last year's Presidents Cup, when the
International team used a dagger-through-the-heart chip-in from
Australian Craig Parry and an unlikely long-range hole-out by New
Zealander Frank Nobilo to destroy the Americans' confidence early
in the match. They were never the same afterward and wound up
getting pummeled.
</P>
<P>
   Pelz knows intimately the strengths and weaknesses of Colin
Montgomerie, Payne Stewart and others, and he says the Americans
will have to concentrate on saving themselves with the short game
if they hope to win back the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why match play is so much different than any other
format,'' Pelz says. ``Ben is on the right track. Focus on the
short game. With these guys at their level, you don't have to teach
mechanics. But you can always sharpen those mechanics. None of
those guys have bad mechanics. If they're sharp, they're very, very
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have them hitting distance wedges to targets at least
30 or 45 minutes a day. Chipping, long lag putts, bump-and-run
shots _ players of this level should spend two to three hours a day
for two weeks working on those shots before a big event like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason why competitions like the Ryder Cup come down
to chipping and putting. The alternate-shot format leads to more
missed greens, which then requires players to recover if they want
to save par.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much margin for error in the full golf swing in
terms of power,'' Pelz says. ``If you hit a drive 270 or 290 or
300, they're all great drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with a wedge, if you're a foot short, you might be in a
bunker. And if you're two feet long, you're over the green. Only if
the shot is perfect does it turn out the way you want it to. The
requirements are so much more demanding. And when things are tense,
you have to approach the short game with soft hands. If your
muscles are tight, you have no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelz knows firsthand that at least one American has done his
short-game homework going into the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne is probably the best, day in and day out, when it comes
to having a solid all-around short game,'' he says. ``If he hits
the ball half-decent off the tee, he's in contention every week. I
would take his wedge game against anybody's. And he's become so
much of a better putter. Earlier in his career, he had trouble
making putts. Now, he's probably making more than he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Payne spent a lot of time on his short game leading up
to the Ryder Cup. He worked on it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelz, who says he will be rooting for the American team even
though he works extensively with Montgomerie and Jesper Parnevik,
believes the mental advantages of a good short game are every bit
as important as any physical edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy gets up and down two or three times, then maybe he
sinks a chip shot, he starts thinking that there's no way you can
beat him,'' Pelz says. ``That's why Freddie (Couples) has been so
good at match play for so many years. He gets his opponent so
demoralized, they start thinking they can't beat this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans know the feeling. They're hoping to reverse it
this time around.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI ``unequivocally opposed'' President
Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists,
asserting that the release of most of the prisoners would
reinvigorate their terrorist movement, according to a letter
prepared by the law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, prepared by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said the
clemency ``would likely return committed, experienced,
sophisticated and hardened terrorists to the clandestine movement''
for Puerto Rican independence. The letter also said the clemency
would ``psychologically and operationally enhance'' allies in the
militant organization FALN who had killed five people and maimed 83
in terrorist activities in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh did not sign the letter, which was addressed but never
sent to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. But senior law enforcement officials said Tuesday night
that the letter accurately reflected Freeh's opposition to leniency
for the Puerto Rican militants.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the letter was sent from the FBI to the Justice
Department for review prior to Freeh's signature. Ultimately, the
letter without his signature was sent to Democrats on Capitol Hill,
where it was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the issue of clemency had been raised since 1994
and that Freeh had objected to it as recently as June 28; even so,
the letter said, Freeh was unaware that the president was actually
contemplating any commutation when the White House announced its
offer on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   While some officials have privately acknowledged disapproval of
the president's decision, Freeh's letter is the first official
indication from within the administration of the fierce
disagreement that raged within the law enforcement community over
Clinton's offer of clemency to the 16 terrorists, 14 of whom are
now out of prison. The letter did not say what evidence had led to
the opposition to clemency.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Tuesday, Clinton provided his first full
explanation of his decision in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself in the tradition of previous presidents who have
granted clemency in cases that were unpopular, Clinton portrayed
his release of the prisoners as an act of courage. He cited
Theodore Roosevelt's grant of amnesty to Filipino nationals who
fought U.S. control of the Philippines and Jimmy Carter's
commutation of sentences of Puerto Rican nationalists who had
opened fire on the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They exercised the power vested in them by the Constitution to
do what they believed was right, even in the face of great
controversy,'' Clinton wrote of his predecessors. ``I have done the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not deal with the question of whether the
release of the prisoners might reignite the dormant terrorist
movement. But Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., asserted that recent
statements by a known Puerto Rican militant and ally of the
prisoners indicated that the release was stirring old passions.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Filiberto Ojeda Rios, the leader of Los Macheteros, a
terrorist organization allied with the ex-prisoners, as telling a
Puerto Rican radio station that if the United States committed
aggressive acts against Puerto Rico, his group would ``not remain
with their arms crossed, you can be sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's letter came to light at a congressional hearing designed
by Republicans to portray the president's act as reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans coaxed out of other law enforcement officials a
concern that the ex-prisoners constitute a threat to American
security. While the officials were bound under the president's
claim of executive privilege not to disclose internal deliberations
over the matter, they catalogued the violent actions of the FALN,
the terrorist organization to which the prisoners belong.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gallagher, assistant director of national security for the
FBI, told the panel, ``These are criminals and they are terrorists
and they represent a threat to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has acknowledged that it has no control over clemency
matters, which are the sole prerogative of the president. But
Clinton's explanation Tuesday appeared to make little difference to
those in the hearing room, who see the move as a political disaster
for the president and for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
likely to seek the Senate seat from New York. She has run into
political trouble for at first supporting, then denouncing, her
husband's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have wanted to draw out the drama. The panel,
chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the government
Reform Committee, called several victims of FALN attacks, bringing
them to testify for the third time in less than two weeks. They
included Richard Pastorella, a retired New York City detective, who
was severely injured in a 1982 attack. He lost his sight in both
eyes, and his face is held together by 20 titanium screws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who thinks of us?'' Pastorella asked in a bitter voice.
``Certainly not Mr. Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, and relatives of those who had been killed in
terrorist attacks, said that contrary to federal requirements, they
had not been notified of the prisoners' pending release.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Republicans took issue with Clinton's apparent belief that
just because the prisoners had not been convicted of doing bodily
harm, they deserved to go free. Republican after Republican
asserted that there was no distinction between people who were
accessories to violent crimes and those who actually pulled the
trigger. ``The only reason some of them didn't commit murders or
bombings is because they were arrested before they got a chance
to,'' said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats, both African-Americans, offered a minimal defense
of the clemency. Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-Ill., said, ``Democracy can
be fellowship as well as punishment.'' Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.,
urged Congress to ``move on'' and examine issues that ``have a real
effect on the lives of average Americans.'' The committee's ranking
Democrat, Rep. Henry Waxman of California, said reluctantly that he
``probably'' would not have granted the clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, the president disclosed some of the arguments
that former President Carter had used in persuading Clinton to
grant clemency in this case. He said that Carter wrote to him in
1997 that releasing the prisoners would be ``a significant
humanitarian gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also said that any concern that clemency might be viewed
as leniency was mitigated by the length of time that they had
already served, Clinton wrote. Most of them had been in prison at
least 16 years, a period that Clinton said was not commensurate
with the crimes of which they were convicted, which included
sedition, conspiracy and armed robbery but not bodily harm to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since he made the offer, Clinton said the
decision was difficult and that he had not minimized the concerns
of law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I believe equity and fairness dictated,'' he wrote.
``I certainly understand, however, that other people could review
the same facts I did and arrive at a different decision.''

BELL ATLANTIC, BRITISH COMPANY TO COMBINE IN WIRELESS NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ink is barely dry on the agreement, but already the newest
entrant in the nation's cellular phone wars is emerging as a
formidable competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's largest local phone company,
and Vodafone Airtouch PLC, Britain's largest wireless concern,
struck a deal Tuesday to combine their U.S. wireless operations and
create the nation's largest coast-to-coast network.
</P>
<P>
   The $70 billion combination will give both companies the scale
to compete against AT&AMP;T Corp., with its Digital One Rate Program,
and Sprint Corp., both of which have dominated the U.S. cellular
phone market. Together, Vodafone and Bell Atlantic _ along with
GTE, once it completes its merger with Bell Atlantic next year _
would have more than 20 million customers, compared with AT&AMP;T's 11
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instantly what this means is that AT&AMP;T isn't the big kid on
the block anymore,'' said David Berndt, an associate director of
the wireless communications group at Yankee Group, a research firm.
``They won't always be the one everyone is trying to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Working under the code names of ``Beta'' for Bell Atlantic,
``Alpha'' for Vodafone and ``Gamma'' for GTE, it took executives
and advisers five weeks to come up with the type of transaction
that Bell Atlantic sought when it tried to acquire Airtouch
Communications earlier this year. Bell Atlantic lost Airtouch to
Vodafone, which paid $60 billion for the San Francisco concern. For
Vodafone, an agreement with Bell Atlantic helps cement its position
as a truly global wireless player.
</P>
<P>
   More consumers these days depend on cellular phones both at home
and abroad and companies are hoping to capitalize on that trend.
Cellular phone use is expected to be one of the fastest-growing
segments in telecommunications, with use expected to grow fivefold
over the next five years, according to Yankee Group. It was tough
to find anyone on Wall Street who did not like Tuesday's news. But
a few critics said Vodafone might have paid too much for Airtouch
to end up walking away with only a minority share in the U.S.
business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst based in
Atlanta, said, ``We tend to look at these announcements
individually. But if you pull the camera back, the way we
communicate everything is changing. Wireless is at the heart of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Already several telecommunications companies have either
announced acquisitions or joint ventures to expand their networks.
AT&AMP;T and British Telecommunications PLC last week said they would
be partners in a venture to expand wireless phone service globally.
Voicestream Wireless Corp., which has a presence in the western
United States, recently agreed to buy Omnipoint Corp. and Aerial
Communications, giving it a presence in the East. Further, MCI
Worldcom had discussions earlier this year with Nextel
Communications, but those talks fell apart over price.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble for wireless customers is one of the reasons Chris
Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, called Bell Atlantic's chairman,
Ivan Seidenberg, last April to propose teaming up in the United
States, Gent said. The two met several times in July when Gent was
in New York. But it wasn't until a dinner in early August that the
two, along with GTE's chief executive, Charles Lee, proposed the
framework for a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Gent was willing to concede on some issues, he said, including
who would control the combined company: Bell Atlantic will own 55
percent of the entity, while Vodafone will own the rest. But Gent
also brought his own set of expectations to the table, such as
protecting job commitments he made to Airtouch executives during
those merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   Once a basic framework was agreed to, they and their advisers
worked out the details. The new company will be based in New York,
with a seven-member board of directors. Seidenberg, Gent and, if
the GTE merger with Bell Atlantic is completed, Lee, will all be
members. Bell Atlantic will nominate the chief executive of the
combined company and Vodafone will nominate the chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone too has an important out. It can sell its shares if the
company decides to go public three years after the deal closes. The
companies expect to complete the transaction in the next six to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   And what did the two companies decide to name their new venture?
Nothing _ as of yet. As the affable Gent candidly put it, ``I
couldn't convince Ivan to take Vodafone Airtouch.''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Seidenberg countered, a smile sliding across
his face, ``It would have cost you a lot.''

UPN'S `MOESHA,' THE NONWHITE HIT NOBODY KNOWS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people who make the sitcom ``Moesha'' can't help wishing
that more television executives _ and viewers _ would take a cue
from Dorothy in ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Remember when she's leaving
Emerald City and realizes that to find her heart's desire she
needn't look ``any further than my own backyard''?
</P>
<P>
   As everyone in television sounds off about desires supposedly
dear to their hearts _ to see more nonwhite actors in prime time
and to see more shows that the whole family can enjoy _ the
producers and cast of ``Moesha'' have their Oz-like wish. ``Hey,
folks,'' they wonder, ``why not look here in your own backyard?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moesha''(pronounced mo-EESH-a), which has just begun its fifth
season on UPN, is about a family. It has a mix of characters and
plot lines that can engage both adolescents and adults. And the
family, like almost all the supporting characters, happens to be
black.
</P>
<P>
   The show stars Brandy Norwood _ better known simply as Brandy,
the pop diva with a Grammy Award and two platinum-plus albums to
her credit _ in the title role, but ``Moesha'' is an ensemble show,
about a middle-class family in Los Angeles coping with many of the
problems, joys, sorrows and outrages that millions of American
families confront daily.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many black sitcoms, the show never reduces itself to
vulgar slapstick. Unlike many white sitcoms, it doesn't depict a
glamorously hip world where everyone is clever and wealthy without
apparent effort. Moesha's father, Frank Mitchell, is a Saturn car
salesman; her stepmother, Dee, is a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   This season, a rebellious young man, Frank's nephew Dorian
(played by Brandy's 18-year-old brother, Ray J, also a singer), has
been taken in, adding male teen-age emotions and issues to the
household dynamics. If past shows are a guide, such issues will be
handled with prickly humor, remaining recognizably true-to-life and
never saccharine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it so easy to overlook this show?'' asks Sheryl Lee
Ralph, who plays Dee. ``We're exactly what the American public says
it is looking for: an honest presentation of family life,
regardless of color, regardless of ethnicity. And we're doing it
with quality scripts, quality producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are crying out for quality and then acting like we're
not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they here, but despite numerous obstacles, they are
reasonably successful. ``Moesha'' has managed to increase its
audience every year and is the top-rated comedy on UPN. (Granted,
UPN is the lowest-rated of the six broadcast networks.)
</P>
<P>
   Although UPN gave the series its chance (CBS bought the original
pilot, then passed on the show) and has tried to promote the show,
``Moesha'' has been demographically isolated there in a way that
may only get worse this season.
</P>
<P>
   UPN (which went on the air in January 1995) has been more
popular with men than with women; ``Star Trek: Voyager'' is its
highest-rated show. This year, UPN decided to chase young male
viewers even more aggressively, adding a two-hour pro wrestling
show to Thursday nights, along with some action-adventure series
and sci-fi movies.
</P>
<P>
   That means promotional spots, in which a network advertises its
other shows to viewers, will be seen mostly by people not likely to
be attracted to ``Moesha.'' To make matters worse, the late-90s
audience phenomenon of white viewers tuning out shows with mostly
black casts has accelerated, as the proliferation of networks has
made viewers more clicker-happy than before. Virtually gone are the
days when people of all colors and ages enjoyed ``The Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, ``Moesha'' ranks very low on the overall
viewership ladder too. On Sept. 13, it drew a little more than 1.3
million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. ``Everybody
Loves Raymond,'' for instance, a network hit that plays opposite
``Moesha,'' had about four times as many viewers that night.
Brandy, who is far more famous than the show, is repeatedly asked
if she finds it frustrating to fail to reach a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into reaching whomever I can reach,'' she said during a
preseason promotional press session. And whatever the Nielsen
numbers, she added, ``I know we reach a lot of people, because when
I'm in malls with my brother or my friends, I'm called Moesha a lot
more than I am Brandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview, Brandy said: ``Of course, if you do good
work and you have good writing and good actors, you want people to
see it. I would love to have 20 million more people watching, not
for me, but to see how good the show is. But you can't complain.
You have to realize that's just how life is.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandy can't complain, certainly. During breaks from taping
``Moesha,'' she returns to her first love, singing. Her second
album, ``Never Say Never,'' released in June, has sold more than
seven million copies, and the first single released from it, a duet
with Monica called ``The Boy Is Mine,'' won a Grammy Award.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy's connections in the pop world also show up on the
sitcom. Now 20 years old (she'll be 21 in February), she is playing
an 18-year-old, one who has always been fiercely but endearingly
independent. This fall Moesha could have gone to college but, to
her father's distress, she chose to take a job instead, as a go-fer
at Vibe magazine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I am studying, Daddy,'' she tells him. ``I'm studying writing
and English and journalism and all that real-life-lessons kind of
stuff.'' (Typically of Moesha, she soon changes her mind and most
of this season will find her at the fictional California
University, although still living at home.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, her best friend, Niecy, worked hard to earn a
college scholarship; she has eight brothers and sisters and can't
wait to get out of the house. (Moesha's other close friend, Kim,
played by Countess Vaughn, has been spun off into her own sitcom
this season, ``The Parkers.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Vibe story line enabled the producers to feature pop stars
who appeal to the teen-agers and young adults most television
networks strive to reach (because advertisers pay handsome rates to
reach them).
</P>
<P>
   This season's opening episode, which will be repeated Monday
night at 8, features a performance by the singer Mary J. Blige. And
Ray J, Brandy's brother, bolsters the appeal to the demographic UPN
now wants to attract.
</P>
<P>
   Ray J's character, Dorian, is a good example of how ``Moesha''
manages to stay fresh, riding the crest of waves of various
contemporary family issues. ``His father is around a little bit,
sends him a check, but is not really there for him, and sometimes
stands him up,'' said Vida Spears, the show's executive producer,
who created it with Ralph Farquhar (``South Central'') and Sara V.
Finney. ``So we have a kid who now is a teen-ager and has a lot of
anger in him, but underneath there's a lot of hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   After having been stood up again by his father, Dorian runs away
from Oakland to the Mitchell home in Leimert Park, a black
middle-class Los Angeles neighborhood. Myles, Moesha's younger
brother, just entering junior high school, agrees to hide Dorian in
the house. Eventually, of course, he is taken in by his uncle Frank
and the long-suffering Dee (it's not enough that she's bringing up
her husband's two teen-agers; now she has his troubled nephew to
cope with as well).
</P>
<P>
   Brandy, the singer, has always said she revered Whitney Houston
as her role model and inspiration. Brandy, the actress, however,
has no such role model. Instead she credits William Allen Young,
who plays her sitcom father, with teaching her the fundamentals
about acting and teaching her that ``being focused is the best way
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, a veteran of many series, including ``Knots Landing,''
and television movies, said his goal on ``Moesha'' was to keep
everyone focused on striving, ``from the writing to the
performances, to bring as honest a portrayal of this American
family as we can to television.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Ralph, his on-screen wife, he cannot understand why
this show has not received more attention from the critics who
complain about both the dearth of family fare and the dearth of
black actors, producers and writers on television, or why its
success has not been more widely imitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume the audience has an intelligence level and we don't
ever want to undermine that,'' Young said. ``So when we bring up
issues like birth control, when we bring up issues like interracial
dating, when we bring up these issues, we assume that the audience
wants to hear that, that they're ready to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that UPN executives had always been supportive of
addressing these sorts of issues, within a comedy context. ``And
where it may not work at other networks, it may be because the
reverse is true,'' he said. ``That there is a fear about saying
certain things, or that certain sponsors won't get behind certain
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, Ms. Ralph and Brandy take care not to criticize the
NAACP's recent call for boycotts of network television and the
organization's plans to pressure advertisers in an effort to
increase diversity on screen and behind the scenes. But it is also
clear from their carefully chosen words and their facial
expressions that while they share the goals, they wish someone with
publicity powers would occasionally take time to notice the
positive things happening in their own backyard.

TOBACCO LAWSUITS TURN TOLERANCE ON ITS HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Unless you read the business press regularly, you
probably aren't aware of the latest effort to use the U.S. legal
system to prey on the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal and Investor's Business Daily lamented
in recent editorial page commentaries how foreign countries have
gotten on the tobacco-lawsuit crowd. The development underscores
how America's growing contempt for the spirit of tort law threatens
global destabilization of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the $200 billion-plus payoff achieved by U.S.
state governments in their depredations against Big Tobacco, six
countries from south of the border have recently consolidated cases
against the industry in federal court in Washington, D.C.
Meanwhile, a dozen other countries are initiating or considering
similar suits.
</P>
<P>
   Their hope apparently is to follow the lead of U.S. officials by
pursuing compensatory relief for health-care costs their smokers
have allegedly imposed on the citizenry at large. The litigation
undertaken by Brazil, Bolivia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Panama and
Nicaragua, however, is even more contemptuous of legal rationality
than comparable U.S. efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that these nations feign surprise at learning tobacco
is a health hazard is as amusing as it is outrageous, but it's not
as outrageous as their policy conflicts. Some not only profit
handsomely from tobacco monopolies but also ship especially
hazardous tobacco to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, for instance, is a leading tobacco exporter, but its
lawsuit ignores its tobacco industry. Moreover, its exporters,
according to George Washington University law professor Jonathan
Turley in a Journal column, were cited 11 times in the past year by
U.S. officials for exporting tobacco tainted with 20 pesticides
legally prohibited here as human health hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Turley also noted that even as Russia pursues a tobacco claim in
Washington, its legislature in Moscow is considering establishment
of a tobacco monopoly. This would allow Russia, he points out, ``to
claim both the profits and damages from this product.''
</P>
<P>
   Another irony, Turley says, is the fact that even as these
countries justify their legal actions based on public health
concerns, some have ``infamous records on human rights or the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the U.S. government seems to have no choice but to
allow foreign brigands use of our courts to prey on legal American
enterprises selling legal products to consumers for their legal
consumption.

<P>
   Two corrosive developments in American society make this bizarre
scenario possible. One is increasing public tolerance of
indefensibly unfair treatment of those singled out for demonization
by self-appointed moral crusaders. Another is the manipulation of
this tolerance by political demagogues and legal beagles to create
public acceptance of egregious distortions of the spirit of the
law. This eases the national conscience to the extent of allowing
the legal theft of huge sums of money from the demonized parties.
</P>
<P>
   If this greed-inspired corruption of the legal system is allowed
to run its logical course, America in the mid-21st century may be
as anarchic as Russia today.

`MAMBO NO. 5' SINGER TURNS OUT MONDO PARTY SONG
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a (START ITALS)vida loca(END ITAL) summer,
everyone's doing the mambo, actually ``Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit
of...),'' stylish crooner Lou Bega's saucy international smash now
zooming up the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The party song _ a zesty remake of a 1949 instrumental by Perez
``Prez'' Prado, the late Cuban king of mambo _ just hit No. 6 on
the singles chart after only five weeks. That's what happens when a
number crosses over onto several radio formats at once, including
Top 40, adult Top 40 and modern adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a song for the women of the world,'' purrs Bega, 24, from
his home in Munich, Germany. ``It's not an ordinary love song. It
makes you want to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Ugandan father and Sicilian mom, Bega recalls
hearing Prado's original version around the house as a kid. Last
summer, the obscure producer and lyricist was sitting at an outdoor
cafe putting female names to the catchy mambo rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   In the remake, the unmarried Bega sings over bubbly percussion
and brass: ``To me, flirtin', it's just like a sport ... A little
bit of Rita is all I need, a little bit of Tina is what I see, a
little bit of Sandra in the sun, a little bit of Mary all night
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bega, who sports white pin-stripe suits complete with spats and
Borsalino hats, says Prado would've understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me like a crack of lightning,'' the singer said. ``I
knew Prez would have wanted lyrics in his song and he would've
wanted it to be heard in the next millennium. The mambo was a
forgotten rhythm after the '50s. I want to take it into the new
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bega's full-length debut, naturally titled ``A Little Bit Of
Mambo,'' recently reached No. 12 on the Billboard 200. The smash
title track, available only on the album in the U.S., was issued as
a single in Germany last April; by May, it was triple platinum.
``Mambo No. 5'' has since topped the charts in more than a dozen
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bega doesn't lose his cool when the dreaded m-word (macarena) is
mentioned. In more than a few places, ``Mambo No. 5'' has been
likened to that once-ubiquitous novelty song and dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The macarena wasn't an artist, it was a song,'' Bega insists.
``It was better for them to put out a single than an album. I'm
going to go on tour and put on a real show _ a show with a band,
dancers, horns and lots of percussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't hold your breath waiting for ``Mambo No. 6.'' &QL;

MARILYN MONROE: LASTING CHARISMA THAT STILL TURNS THE ORDINARY INTO
GOLD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Deanne Stillman is the author of the award-winning one-act play
``Inside the White House,'' about John F. Kennedy and Marilyn
Monroe in the afterlife.  
 By DEANNE STILLMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over the last couple of years, the estate of
Marilyn Monroe has not been kind to the goddess whose memory it
protects. In 1997, it sanctioned a line of Marilyn Monroe lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s-style underwear was hawked at department stores. Now
comes an estate-approved perfume called Marilyn, from International
Flavors and Fragrances, the company that has recreated the essence
of Elizabeth Taylor, Victoria Principal and Christie Brinkley. This
takes the concept of celebrity perfume to a new level: the notion
of smelling like a famous dead person _ even Marilyn Monroe _ is at
best an odd one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eugene P. Grisanti, the chief executive president of
International Flavors and Fragrances, says the perfume will be
``sensual, sexy, with undertones of amber and resin, glamorous and
elegant with freesia, childish and light, like Marilyn.''
</P>
<P>
   To publicize the new perfume, International Flavors is
sponsoring an auction of Marilyn Monroe relics at Christie's in New
York on Oct. 27 and 28. The company's involvement in the auction is
not a secret, but it might as well be: the press coverage has
focused entirely on the celebrated ``Happy Birthday President''
dress _ the see-through sheath in which Monroe serenaded John F.
Kennedy at his birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   It has been unveiled publicly for the first time since Monroe
wore it in 1962 and is predicted to fetch bids into the low seven
figures. This and the other relics for sale are owned by Monroe's
estate. Without their illustrious provenance, many of them could
have belonged to almost any middle-class woman in the 1950s and
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the lode here in August revealed cook books, hair
clips, stiletto heels, gowns, dresses and tops that might be found
at vintage-clothing shops. The ordinary quality of certain items
makes them all the more appealing, physical evidence of the ``every
gal'' side of Monroe's character.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the fact that it was Monroe who actually wore
the three pairs of proffered jeans in ``The River of No Return''
places their starting price at $20,000 to $30,000. The Mexican
sweater she wore when photographed by George Barris on the Santa
Monica beach in 1962 is estimated at $30,000 to $50,000. The
cowgirl boots that she wore in ``The Misfits'' may be worth $4,000
to $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some items simply amuse (photographs of Mafia, the Maltese dog
given to her by Frank Sinatra; a plaster floor lamp in the shape of
a palm tree). One souvenir that might interest those who desire a
celebrity menorah is Monroe's for $2,000 to $4,000; her certificate
of conversion to Judaism, earned while she was married to Arthur
Miller, is also on the block, for $8,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   (Coincidentally, right now at Sotheby's, and continuing on
Amazon.com, the Barry Halper collection of baseball memorabilia is
for sale. Halper, who owns a two-percent share of the Yankees, has
acquired dozens of noteworthy items, including a letter Joe
DiMaggio wrote to his ex-wife Monroe from Rome shortly before she
sang at the president's ball. ``Just came from a very interesting
visit to the Vatican,'' he wrote in part, ``Tomorrow we have an
audience with Holy Father ... Yesterday I paid a visit to the
little leagues. Luckily after my fourth swing I connected and hit
it out of the park. As ever, Love Joe.'' The letter, released after
DiMaggio's death, is priced at $8,000 to $12,000.)
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting material at auction includes 400 books from
Monroe's library. Perhaps more than anything, she longed to be
taken seriously (and the proceeds from this portion of the sale go
to Literacy Partners, a nice gesture but really a kind of beard for
the whole shebang).
</P>
<P>
   Her friends have said that she was a reader of great passion and
curiosity, as the books in her collection indicate. They include
works by John Steinbeck, Mark Twain, William Styron, Somerset
Maugham, William Faulkner, Willa Cather and Colette. While male
authors are identified by their names or under categories like
literature, poetry and plays.
</P>
<P>
   The two women are given back-of-the-bus treatment, available in
Lot 566, ``Women Authors.'' One suspects that Monroe _ by all
accounts an egalitarian _ might have found the category puzzling,
perhaps even insulting.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most telling book in her library is ``The Little
Engine That Could,'' by Piper Watty (Lot 522), although this is a
fact apparently lost on auctioneers. According to the catalog, it
has ``childish pencil scrawls at end, possibly Marilyn Monroe's.''
Missing from the history is that Monroe carried this book with her
to the Kennedy birthday ball, according to Gloria Steinem in her
essay ``Marilyn.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now: about that dress. Studded with rhinestones on
flesh-colored silk gauze, it was stitched onto Monroe before she
made her entrance at Madison Square Garden to sing for the
president. The gown was not lined, and there was nothing underneath
but the goddess herself; the country still reverberates from the
glittering apparition she presented that night.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she was introduced by the president's brother-in-law
Peter Lawford as ``the late Marilyn Monroe.'' She led the crowd in
a breathy chorus of ``Happy Birthday,'' apparently gripped by deep
fear, propped up, according to Ms. Steinem, by pills, champagne and
the children's book. ``I can now retire from politics,'' Kennedy
said, ``after having had, ah, `Happy Birthday' sung to me in such a
sweet, wholesome way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The image of Monroe singing to Kennedy burns brightly over time,
like other images whose players have long been reduced to dust. On
that evening, in that scene of our national play, she became the
disciple ministering to the adored, the acolyte praising the
soon-to-be-martyred president, as Mary Magdalene comforted Jesus
Christ on his path.
</P>
<P>
   The gown she wore contains magic and mystery, sweat and tears;
in it she gave immeasurable mojo to Camelot. The relic ought to be
donated to the Smithsonian, not auctioned to the highest bidder; a
cloth so sacred to the national culture ought not have a price.
</P>
<P>
   Who will buy it? To what end? And would Monroe want to be a
perfume? When told by a drama coach that he felt ``sex vibrations''
as she read Checkhov, she replied, ``I want to be an artist, not
... a celluloid aphrodisiac.''

SENATE LEADER PRESSES NAVY ON A SHIP IT DOES NOT WANT 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is about to break its self-imposed
spending limits again. To help understand why, consider the LHD-8.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott wanted half a billion dollars
to start building a $1.5 billion ship called the LHD-8 at the
Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi, his home state.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, at his behest, approved the money this summer. But
the House did not. Last month, House aides asked the Navy how much
money really was needed to start the project. Last week, the Navy
drafted an answer: $295 million, a lot less than Lott wanted.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lott's senior aides, a retired Navy officer, obtained the
draft and faxed a handwritten memorandum on the senator's
stationery to an admiral at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum said $295 million was ``the wrong answer.'' The
right answer _ the answer that ``the Navy needs to support'' _ was
``at least $375 M to $500 M,'' it said. ``We have worked too hard
to give up on the $500 M now.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication, according to several people involved in the
process, was that the Navy should alter its testimony to support
Lott's position. It has not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Navy never asked for the money to buy a new LHD-8,
a miniature aircraft carrier for launching Marine assaults by
helicopter. It says it would prefer to spend the money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The LHD-8 memorandum is only one example of the pressures in
Congress to spend more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only unusual thing about this is that it was put in
writing,'' said Dale Bumpers, director of the Center for Defense
Information, who left the Senate in 1998 after 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a common practice,'' said Bumpers, who served on
Senate military spending panels. ``Everybody in the United States
Senate that I know anything about protects whatever defense
industry they have in their state.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's tenure as majority leader has been a boon for the Ingalls
shipyard in Pascagoula, where his father once worked as a pipe
fitter. The shipyard, owned by Litton Industries, is the state's
largest employer. All told, Mississippi military contractors and
bases are in line to receive about $8 billion in the coming year.
The operating budget of the state of Mississippi is $9.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, called the LHD-8 memo ``an
inartful attempt to point out a way to save taxpayers $1 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Expensive weapons systems like the LHD-8 often cost more if they
take longer to build, just as a 30-year mortgage costs more than a
15-year mortgage. The half-billion dollars requested by Lott would
save money in the long run by speeding up production of the ship,
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference on the military spending bill, set to
begin on Wednesday, will decide the fate of the LHD-8, the F-22
fighter jet and other high-priced weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous pressure has been placed on the House by the Senate and
Speaker Dennis Hastert to restore $1.8 billion for the first six
F-22 jets. The House cut the money this summer, after Republican
opponents argued that the F-22 was too expensive and too untested.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and the prime contractor, Lockheed-Martin, have
fought back with lobbying, arm-twisting, and paid announcements on
National Public Radio news shows. They are likely to win: Some of
the money for the F-22's will probably be put back. But that deal
is far from done, House aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When that conference is over, Congress will likely have approved
$17 billion or more in new increases for the coming year, creating
a Pentagon budget of roughly $270 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than half the money Congress allotted to run all
government agencies in the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the money, $268 billion, is supposed to run
the rest of the government. Republican lawmakers are beginning to
acknowledge that that is not enough and that the spending caps
imposed in 1997 will be broken, just as they were last year.
Military spending will be the force that breaks them, said Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should ``acknowledge what is obvious,'' said Lott's
spokesman, Czwartacki. ``We'll spend more than the caps permit.
Let's be honest with ourselves and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the acknowledgment remains a bare whisper.

   GROWTH IN TRADE DEFICIT PROMPTS CONCERN FOR DOLLAR
</P>
<P>
   Another leap in the U.S. trade deficit in July fueled fears that
a continuing surge in imports is threatening the health of the
dollar. The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit for
the month hit $25.2 billion, higher than the June imbalance of
$24.6 billion, confounding expectations that the deficit would
start to shrink as economic growth picks up around the world.
Imports from China, Western Europe and Japan all hit new highs,
well above the projections of most economists who have followed the
trade flows with increasing concern.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices were pulled down by a further slide in the value of
the dollar against the yen, warnings about third-quarter earnings,
worries about the earthquake in Taiwan and the trade deficit. The
Dow Jones industrial average plunged 225.43 points, to 10,598.47.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 27.95 points, to
1,307.58. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 65.05 points, to
2,821.10.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDMAN POSTS STRONG RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group reported surprisingly strong earnings in its
first full quarter as a public company, a striking reversal from a
year ago when fallout from Russia's economic woes forced the
investment banking firm to postpone plans for its initial public
offering of stock. Goldman, which went public with an offering of
$3.7 billion on May 4, said it earned $638 million, or $1.32 per
diluted share, in its fiscal third quarter, exceeding the
expectations of Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   DISPARITY IN MINORITY CREDIT RATINGS
</P>
<P>
   Even in the current flush economic times, with home ownership
rates reaching record highs, a disproportionately large number of
minorities, chiefly African Americans, have poor credit ratings,
according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   PENSION FIGHT MOVES TO CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
   The fight over cash-balance pensions has moved to Congress,
where lobbyists and congressional aides say the dispute over IBM's
pension switch will probably help spur legislation to rein in the
plans.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN MONETARY POLICY UNCHANGED
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese central bank voted to leave monetary policy
unchanged, defying Government officials and economists who have
been demanding that the bank take aggressive steps to reverse the
yen's heady rise in value.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA PLANS TO MAKE PAYMENTS
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, in an effort to reassure
foreign investors, said his Government would make all its debt
payments while at the same time work on a market-friendly proposal
that would allow it to pay off its current debt over a longer
period of time. His comments came as investors are keeping a close
watch on emerging markets in Latin America. Ecuador is struggling
to avoid a default on its foreign debt and Brazil is still working
to come back from the devaluation of its currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   HEWLETT AND ORACLE TO COLLABORATE
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard strengthened its Internet presence with the
announcement of a deal with Oracle to collaborate on developing and
selling Oracle's electronic commerce software on Hewlett-Packard
computers.
</P>
<P>
   AIR CANADA REJECTS HOSTILE BID
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada rejected a hostile takeover proposal from Onex, a
conglomerate that wants to merge Air Canada with its weak rival,
Canadian Airlines International.
</P>
<P>
   3COM EARNINGS BEAT EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   3Com attributed its strong first-quarter earnings, which
exceeded estimates, to strong growth in hand-held computing
products and improved operating efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   HARPERCOLLINS ANNOUNCES CUTS
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, which recently acquired William Morrow &AMP; Company
and Avon Books, announced a series of moves to consolidate its
imprints, which resulted in layoffs of 74 employees and the
departure of top executives from Morrow.

DRUG AGENCY APPROVES ANTIBIOTIC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With drug-resistant bacteria on the rise, doctors
have watched helplessly as patients died from germs that cannot be
cured by vancomycin, long considered the antibiotic of last resort.
Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new antibiotic
that promises to rescue some patients when vancomycin fails.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Synercid, manufactured by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., is
not a panacea for antibiotic resistance. It is effective only
against a handful of disease-causing microbes, and does not work in
all cases. And experts worry that resistance to Synercid could
develop as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug could be a lifesaver for some of the 16,000
hospital patients who become infected each year with a resistant
strain of the enterococcus bacterium, enterococcus faecium, that
has emerged over the past decade. And so the federal agency gave
the drug fast-track approval, permitting the company to market it
even though tests of its effectiveness are still going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important drug to help patients who have no
alternative therapies,'' said Dr. Sandra Kweder, who heads the drug
agency's division that evaluates new antibiotics. She urged doctors
to use Synercid ``judiciously in order to attempt to minimize the
likelihood of widespread resistance to this drug as well.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, scientists at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and elsewhere have been sounding alarms
about the growth of antibiotic resistance, a problem that is
particularly prevalent in hospitals, where microbes spread quickly
and attack the elderly, people with weak immune systems and other
vulnerable patients.
</P>
<P>
   Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, which goes by the
scientific acronym VREF and is a leading cause of infections from
surgical wounds, on the skin and in the urinary tract, was first
reported in this country in 1989. By 1997, according to the
centers, more than half of all enterococcus faecium strains could
not be treated with vancomycin. Dr. David M. Bell, who coordinates
antibiotic resistance programs for the centers, called the approval
of Synercid ``very good news'' for patients with the infections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the first alternative to vancomycin in 30
years, Synercid is the first drug in the class known as
streptogramins to be approved for sale in the United States. The
drug is given by injection only; it will cost hospitals $85 a dose
and will be available next week, a spokesman for the manufacturer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhone-Poulenc has been making Synercid available in emergencies
to treat VREF infections since 1993; so far, the company said,
7,000 patients around the world have received the drug, including
5,000 in the United States. But conducting rigorous scientific
tests of Synercid's effectiveness has proved tricky, said Dr.
Kweder of the drug agency, in part because the patients were so
sick they often died of their underlying diseases, and in part
because there is no other treatment with which to compare the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Synercid was tested in 1,222 patients with VREF infections.
Overall, the drug agency said, the antibiotic proved effective for
52 percent of patients who were not too sick to be fully evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to drug-resistant enterococcus bacteria, scientists
have grown increasingly concerned about the rise of another
microbe, staphylococcus aureas, which has outwitted most
antibiotics. Just last month, the federal centers announced that
more than 200 people in North Dakota and Minnesota had become sick,
and four children had died, from a drug-resistant strain of staph
that, in theory, should succumb to vancomycin. The deaths suggest
that the bacterium, which until recently has been confined to
hospitals and nursing homes, may now threaten the public.
</P>
<P>
   Rhone-Poulenc asked the drug agency to approve Synercid for use
against these microbes, known as methicillin-resistant staph
aureas. But the agency refused, saying the company had not proved
the drug's effectiveness. However, the drug did win government
approval to be marketed for treatment of skin and soft-tissue
infections caused by staph bacteria, as well as Group A
streptococcus microbes, that are susceptible to other medications.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Synercid is whether, or when, widespread
resistance will develop to it. Virginiamycin, a chemical cousin of
Synercid, has been used over the past decade to promote growth in
animals, and some experts say it is only a matter of time before
resistance to Synercid will develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the answer,'' Dr. Stuart B. Levy, an expert in
antibiotic resistance at Tufts University, said of Synercid. ``It
is just a temporary Band-Aid.''

 &HT;    Course set-up suits aggressive players
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It is a U.S. Open golf course, having hosted
the 1988 championship won by Curtis Strange, but it is not a U.S.
Open set-up.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody's complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rough's not going to be eight inches thick,'' Justin
Leonard said, ``and I think that's going to make for some
aggressive play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw, the United States captain, didn't want The Country
Club to be unplayable from the rough for the 33rd Ryder Cup this
week. Fans want to watch birdies beat pars, he surmised; they don't
want to see players hack out wedges from the rough and halve a hole
with bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought that maybe just a little lighter rough off the
fairways would be a little more conducive, a little more exciting
in match play, especially hitting into these little greens,''
Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful course reworked by Rees Jones, The Country Club has
two short par-4's on the front nine that will tempt U.S. players
such as Tiger Woods and Davis Love III to try drivers, depending on
their match status. The course also has European-style bunkers with
massive lips and surrounding high grass and the high fescue common
in England and Scotland. It is a shotmaker's golf course, not a
TPC-type layout that might favor the U.S. But as David Duval said,
anyone on either team ``can manage OK on just about any golf course
you put them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy the course,'' Scotland's Colin Montgomerie said.
``It's got a European feel to it. It's not one of your Florida-type
courses or a modern American course. It's an Old World American
course, and we tend to enjoy them more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some home cooking
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of about 20,000 for a Tuesday practice round, roaring for
individual shots as though it were the weekend of a major, are a
big part of Ryder Cup week. It might be a distraction, but at least
Americans are unlikely to cheer a U.S. missed putt, as the European
fans did at Valderrama. ``I played with Scott Hoch last year in a
match at Valderrama,'' Jeff Maggert said. ``When we teed off, he
said, `Man, you guys aren't used to this, but I'm used to people
rooting against me every week on the PGA Tour.' ''. . . . After a
first-day outfit of pea-green and khaki, the U.S. came back strong
Tuesday with dark blue shirts and gray slacks. . . . The four
players of the Medinah money issue were contained in one foursome
Tuesday _ Woods paired with Duval and Mark O'Meara with Phil
Mickelson. . . . Two European players have American caddies _ Lance
Ten Broeck with Jesper Parnevik and Jerry Higginbotham with Sergio
Garcia. When Ten Broeck misclubbed Parnevik by 10 yards at Akron
last month, the Swede kidded him by saying, ``Was that to prepare
me for the Ryder Cup?''

COMMENTARY: FORREST GUMP BIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fourteen years ago, Edmund Morris, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian, began a quest to find Ronald Reagan's
inner life.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled far and wide, basking in unprecedented access to his
president, hunting for the golden fleece of biography _ the inner
life.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the seasons faded away, as the Random House deadlines
faded away, as the poor former president faded away, it became ever
more apparent: the futile search for the inner Reagan had driven
his biographer barking mad.
</P>
<P>
   The more access Morris got, the more elusive Dutch became. Every
time the biographer scratched away one veneer, he found an
identical veneer underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Was Ronald Reagan an ``airhead,'' to use Morris' words, or ``a
colossus''? A colossal airhead? An airy colossus?
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from a historic case of writer's block, the historian
distracted himself by swanning around town, dining at fancy tables,
whining that he couldn't quite get a grip on his subject.
</P>
<P>
   He was beginning to suspect the worst: the president who had
helped bring down global communism and shore up global capitalism,
the president who loomed larger a decade out of power, had no inner
life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Morris confessed his despair to fellow historians in a
speech at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   He described the former president as ``the most mysterious man I
have ever confronted. It is impossible to understand him.'' He said
he had gone through ``a period of a year or so of depression
because I felt that with all my research, how come I can't
understand the first thing about him?'' Reagan, his Boswell said,
``grew more puzzling the more I tried to study him. I only came out
of this despair when I found out that everybody else who had ever
known him, including his wife, is equally bewildered.''
</P>
<P>
   But in our society, nothing succeeds like failure. After 14
years, Edmund Morris had a brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   He would squander the unparalleled _ and contemporaneous _
access. Unable to find Reagan's inner drama, not satisfied with
such an intriguing president, Morris decided to make up some drama
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In an exercise of fearless egotism, he inserted himself into the
life of his subject, appearing in Ronald Reagan's biography as
Forrest Gump, historian. In his book, Morris, who in real life was
born in 1940, first meets Dutch at Dixon High in the '20s and then
encounters him regularly throughout the course of Reagan's career.
He invented a different Morris family tree, a more patrician family
from the Midwest with different first names and professions.
(Morris was born in Kenya to a middle-class family.)
</P>
<P>
   Looking for different foils, he invented a son for himself, a
member of the Weathermen, to comment on Reagan from a radical '60s
perspective, and stuck in an imaginary newspaper columnist to be
snide about Reagan in the Hollywood years. He even devised bogus
footnotes to document his bogus characters.
</P>
<P>
   His most delightful stratagem is to omit all acknowledgment of
this fiction from his book. He fears that the dramatic effect will
be ruined; and he worries more about dramatic effect than
historical veracity.
</P>
<P>
   Random House got nervous and mentioned it on the book flap,
struggling to present Morris' lunacy as a virtue: ``Morris'
biographical mind becomes, in effect, another character in the
narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   Biographers say they have to guard against taking on the
characteristics of their subjects. But Morris has surrendered
completely. He has himself become a creature of Reaganesque
unreality. He has become ``an authentic phony,'' as James Reston
described Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   It was very rich to hear the same Reagan aides who used to have
to defend the Reagan figments expressing outrage over the Morris
figments.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' batty book is surely destined for commercial success.
There's a lot of nostalgia for Reagan and Reaganism. And we have
become a culture of morphing. Entertainment has overwhelmed truth,
and the universities are riddled with professors who deny that
objectivity is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' timing is fortuitous. He has pioneered the Ally McBeal
school of historiography, in which we regularly cut away from the
action for wacky out-of-body fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the authorized biography of Ronald Reagan,'' says
Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, ``I think
I'll wait for the unauthorized biography.''

BUSH ANNOUNCES INITIATIVE ON GUN CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Less than a week after the fatal shootings in a
Fort Worth church prompted scrutiny of his record on gun control,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday announced a two-year, $1.6
million program to improve prosecution of gun-related crimes in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   He said the main component of the effort would be the addition
of eight prosecutors devoted solely to helping local and federal
prosecutors in Texas make sure that crimes involving firearms were
punished to the fullest extent of existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters if the offensive was a reaction to renewed
charges by many Democrats that he was soft on guns, Bush, the early
favorite for the Republican presidential nomination, said the
program had been in the works for months.
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere around the announcement was indisputably
tinged by presidential politics, and Bush's answers to reporters'
questions underscored the differences between him and Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, on the issue of gun
control, which would clearly receive considerable attention in the
2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush's news conference, the Democratic National Committee
issued a statement calling it ``an effort to distance himself from
his abysmal record on gun safety.''

Committee, speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.
Underlying the current convoluted political maneuvering on the Hill
is a complaint shared by Senate Democrats and the White House that
most of President Clinton's judicial nominees have been languishing
in the Senate. At the same time, Senate Democrats and the White
House insist, the Republicans are pushing through with
extraordinary speed the nomination of Ted Stewart, a friend of Sen.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ With the death toll from Tuesday morning's
devastating earthquake rising by the hour, rescuers around the
island worked through the day and night to reach thousands of
people still trapped inside felled buildings and houses.
</P>
<P>
   In cities across the island, many high-rise buildings listed at
eerie angles or lay flattened. In the worst-hit counties near the
epicenter, Taichung and Nantou, highways and bridges were twisted,
buckled and impassable to traffic. Much of the island, including
sections of the capital, Taipei, lay in darkness through the night.
Water and telephone services were also disrupted in many regions.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, more than 1,700 people around the island were
reported dead, and at least 4,400 injured and hundreds of thousands
homeless. The Interior Ministry said at least 30,000 homes were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Though Taipei was spared much of the devastation that ravaged
central Taiwan, the quake collapsed the lower stories of the
78-room Sung Shan Hotel, leaving it leaning precariously against a
neighboring building.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people were rescued from the hotel building, which
also houses apartments and a bank, but another 80 remained trapped
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The building's 81-year-old superintendent, Hsu Ling-mei, who
lives nearby, raced to the site early Tuesday morning and stood
vigil into the night, anxiously noting on a sheet of paper the
names of residents carried out on stretchers to ambulances waiting
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   With tears coursing down his face, Hsu explained that he knew
everyone in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't leave until I know they're OK,'' he said. ``If my
presence here alone is helping, I will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Aftershocks continued to rattle the stricken island and to
terrorize its 22 million residents. More than 1,000 were recorded,
including one that registered a potent 6.8. The main quake, which
struck at 1:47 a.m. Tuesday, measured 7.7 and was centered 90 miles
south of Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Nantou County Executive Peng Pai-hsien appealed for donations of
bulldozers, cars, quilts and food, saying 100,000 people were left
homeless in the county. He said morgues were ``full of bodies, and
the county needed body bags and freezers in the summer heat.''
</P>
<P>
   President Lee Teng-hui, who traveled by helicopter to central
Taiwan to inspect the damage, called the quake ``the island's worst
in a century.'' He called on local residents to join forces in the
rebuilding effort and pledged financial support from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first priority is to save the people who are trapped,'' he
said. ``Then we restore water and power, and then to rebuild
houses, roads, and public facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   At toppled buildings across the country, hundreds of soldiers
assisted rescuers, often by digging through the rubble with their
bare hands in search of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of profound grief for the many who lost loved ones
to the quake and joy for those who were reunited with family and
friends they had feared were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Television reports throughout the day showed soldiers pulling
bloodied bodies from buildings and relatives of the dead sitting in
front of buildings crying and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   One man who was rescued from a collapsed high-rise building in
Taichung said in a television interview that while he was trapped
in the ruins, he could hear the voices of his children also caught
in the wreckage nearby, calling to him. But after a while, he said,
their voices faded away and he did not know where they were.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, where rescue efforts were scarce, people sifted
through the debris calling the names of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Japan, Russia and Singapore agreed to send
transport planes, helicopters, and rescue personnel to help out. A
United Nations disaster assessment team was also on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent tensions between Beijing and Taipei, President
Jiang Zemin of China offered aid to the quake victims and extended
condolences, though in words that underlined Beijing's insistence
on its sovereignty over what it considers a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   The quake ``hurt the hearts of people on the mainland as the
Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are as closely
linked as flesh and blood,'' the state-run New China News agency
said in a paraphrase of Jiang's remarks. China's Red Cross said it
would provide $100,000 in disaster aid and $60,000 in relief
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Railway services were paralyzed throughout the island Tuesday
morning while schools and many company offices in northern Taiwan,
including Taipei, were closed for the day. The Taipei stock
exchange and foreign exchange market also were closed Tuesday and
Wednesday, but Taipei's international airport operated as normal.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of Taichung, in central Taiwan, called on the
government to investigate whether some of the damaged buildings
violated the country's building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, television broadcasts showed city blocks in
Taichung where apartment towers had been felled like dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not so good support in those buildings to begin
with,'' a woman told a local television newscaster. ``You should
have seen it: it was one small bam and everything was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Many were high-rise apartment buildings that had sprouted up in
recent years in a period of rapid development. Chen Jianren, a
government spokesman, acknowledged that many of the newer buildings
may not have met strict specifications. ``There may be problems
with some developers,'' he said. ``The quality of buildings, that
must be investigated.''

MARKET PLACE: NASDAQ, ONCE HOT FOR A PUBLIC ISSUE, NOW HEADING
PRIVATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just a few months ago, the buzz among the NASDAQ
market's members and advisers was IPO _ an initial public offering
of NASDAQ shares that would transform the market where some of
America's hottest technology stocks are traded.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, the talk has shifted. Now, the emphasis is on a
private placement, an arrangement that would allow the National
Association of Securities Dealers, NASDAQ's owner, to sell a
minority part of its stake privately to outsiders, including Wall
Street firms and even technology giants like Microsoft and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   For NASD leadership at least, a private placement would be an
interim step toward the goal of a public offering of NASDAQ shares.
But the placement, expected to be on the agenda for discussion when
the NASDAQ board meets in two weeks, raises two serious questions
for the association and its chief executive, Frank Zarb.
</P>
<P>
   Can Zarb attract the strong investors he needs? And can he do so
without alienating the small brokerage firms, which may feel
threatened if their giant rivals become the dominant investors in
the new NASDAQ market?
</P>
<P>
   On the first issue, early signs are encouraging. A Wall Street
executive who has been briefed on the association's plans said that
major investment banks have already been approached about the
possibility of taking a minority stake in the NASDAQ market, and
have been ``impressed by how forward-looking this really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he confirmed that there were plans to offer some of
those shares to certain NASDAQ-listed companies like Microsoft and
Intel. ``By bringing in the leading listed companies, there is a
much higher likelihood that those and other companies like them
would remain listed on the NASDAQ system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That should not come as a surprise, several market executives
said privately. In the fine print of a news release that NASD
issued in July, one item on a list of next steps was ``move toward
a possible private placement to key participants,'' including
companies whose shares are listed on NASDAQ and technology
partners.
</P>
<P>
   But as for the second question, Zarb obviously still faces a
delicate balancing act. The association's leadership still hopes
that it can eventually spin off NASDAQ as a publicly traded
company, with a private placement as a sort of halfway house on the
road to public ownership sometime in the future, perhaps by the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   A private stock sale would generate cash to help finance the
association's regulatory arm, which would remain under the control
of the parent group. And, advocates say, a private sale might
inject healthy profit motives into an organization that has
sometimes been hamstrung by competing interests.
</P>
<P>
   Private placements have been done by several foreign stock
exchanges that subsequently became publicly traded companies,
according to Benn Steil, a senior fellow in foreign economic policy
at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ``But the key to
its effectiveness is to make sure that the shareholder base is as
diverse as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If powerful NASDAQ companies like Microsoft and Intel are being
invited to participate in the private placement, along with giant
Wall Street firms and active NASDAQ market makers, that could be a
very healthy development, Steil added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft only owns 1 percent of NASDAQ, then their
ambition will be to maximize the value of those shares, whereas if
all the shares are given to members, that would not be the case,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, if NASD members are able to limit
the private placement to themselves _ or if no more than a minority
stake is ever sold to outsiders _ it would probably have little
effect on NASDAQ's ability to confront the competition it now faces
from the stock trading services called electronic communications
networks, or ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange have
explored the possibility of changing their ownership structure so
that they can better compete with these new rivals for America's
stock-trading business.
</P>
<P>
   Both markets are, in effect, owned by their members. But while
the Big Board's members own the exchange directly through their
ownership of seats, association members have only an indirect stake
in the NASDAQ market, John Coffee Jr., a securities law professor
at Columbia University, noted.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ market, created in 1969, is already structured as a
for-profit company with shares of stock outstanding. But all of
those shares are owned by NASD, a nonprofit association with a
33-member board representing roughly 5,500 member firms.
</P>
<P>
   Because those members have competing and sometimes conflicting
interests, the association's leadership has not been able to
respond quickly enough to new competitors in new technologies,
Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What brought all this about was the inability of the NASD
leadership to get the small broker-dealers to buy into their
vision,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   If theory, the association's board could sell a minority stake
to outside investors without a full membership vote, since the
association would still retain control of NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   But Zarb and his staff are very sensitive to the views of the
organization's smaller members, according to the executive who has
been briefed on the association's plans. ``I don't think they are
going to go too far down the road without trying to make sure that
they have support from the membership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next test will come at the association's board meeting Oct.
7, when the organization continues its discussions about the future
of NASDAQ.

UCLA PREDICTS GOLDEN ERA FOR STATE WILL END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY   J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- California's economy will remain in a growth mode
over the next 20 years, but don't expect a sequel to the Golden
State's gilded past, concluded a long-range forecast released
Wednesday by UCLA's Anderson School.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the state will close out the century on a strong
note, with nonfarm employment growing 3.4 percent this year, almost
matching the average annual increase from 1950 through 1990.
Coupled with 1998's rate of 3.7 percent, the last two years of this
tumultuous decade will be the best.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA's economic forecast predicts job growth to fall sharply
next year before settling into a sustainable rate of 2.1 percent
over the long term. In the four decades between 1950 and 1990, the
state churned out jobs at a 3.5 percent annual growth rate, nearly
double that of the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   California will be able to maintain that kind of gap but not the
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely, however, that the next 20 years in California
will see a repeat of the golden era of the 1950s, '60s, '70s and
'80s,'' said economist Tom K. Lieser, executive director of the
UCLA Business Forecasting Project.
</P>
<P>
   And while the state is entering the next decade from a position
of economic strength, the dynamics of today are vastly different
from those of the past. So too is the world stage, always a big
role player in the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 1980s, the United States was fighting the
Cold War, much to the benefit of California's defense industry.
Home computers were an oddity, not a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse of that is true today, major factors that led to a
total restructuring of the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The maturing of this new economy should see the creation of 8.2
million jobs over the next two decades, bringing the state's total
to 21.85 million jobs, said Lieser's forecast. More than half of
the increase will come from firms that provide a variety of
business services.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a snapshot of UCLA's take on California:
</P>
<P>
   The expanding economy will be led by a robust service sector;
Lieser predicts that 20 years from now, residents will take care of
most of their finances online. The most dynamic element has been
and will continue to be high-tech services such as software
development and other data processing activities.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace has reached critical mass and further large cuts are
not likely, but growth of in-state production and employment will
be limited. California will still be a top-flight location for
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture was the state's other major industry 10 years ago,
and the farm sector is still strong today. It will remain a growth
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment will remain above 5 percent during the next 20
years, above the national average, as the state continues to draw
new residents.
</P>
<P>
   Real personal income will grow by 3.3 percent annually through
2020.
</P>
<P>
   Permits for new residential construction will average about
220,000 annually between 2006 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, said the UCLA forecast is not overly optimistic. His
department only looks 10 years into the future, and the forecast is
for job growth of 2.2 percent annually for the last five years of
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big news, of course, is that it's still twice the U.S.
(rate). The big difference now is demographics. Things are just not
as favorable for employment growth over the next 20 years as they
have been for the last 50 years,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, UCLA's long-range forecast this year is not different
from the one issued at this time last year. The biggest difference,
Lieser noted, is pegging the state's population at 47.7 million by
2020, a reduction of 2 million from last year's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   And while the state will be more crowded in 20 years, it's a
condition that California residents have coped with in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day-to-day life is similar. The sun shines, and we're still
clearly different from most other places in the nation,'' Lieser
said. ``It just takes a little more time out of your day to deal
with the congestion. And you may have to work a little harder or
longer to keep up with the house payments.''

 &HT;    U.S. tries to quiet money flap
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ A month ago, they were branded as Malcontents
at Medinah. Some were campaigning for payment from the Ryder Cup,
charitable or otherwise, and getting ripped publicly by others.
Their captain boiled over at a PGA Championship news conference,
singling out players with misplaced priorities. A week later, one
of them called the captain ``out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for ideal Ryder Cup preparation. U.S. captain Ben
Crenshaw surely must need an electron microscope to measure team
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the guys concentrate on winning and forget about
all the controversy,'' three-time Ryder Cup participant Paul
Azinger said. ``If there's animosity, I think that's the only way
we can lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that the team has been fatally
fragmented. The Americans, who begin Ryder Cup play Friday against
the Europeans, might not have become ``The Waltons'' since Medinah,
but they appear to be focused. Satisfied that the PGA of America
will have some form of charitable donation plan in place later this
year, the players and Crenshaw insist that the issue is dead.
</P>
<P>
   They met Monday at a Boston restaurant for a causal lobster
dinner with wives or girlfriends, laughed a lot and continued the
bonding process. David Duval led the team in a song that neither he
nor a grinning Tiger Woods cared to detail for the media. They also
appointed Justin Leonard to give a statement in Tuesday morning's
opening news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to get asked about compensation, so I'd
like to put an end to that right now,'' Leonard said. ``We're here
to play the matches, and compensation is no longer a part of this
with the players. . . . If we could just keep the questions away
from that . . . we would all really appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a forgotten issue. The daily view of The Country
Club's sea of corporate tents will serve as a reminder of the
event's financial power _ revenue reportedly is $63 million _ but
the U.S. players seem genuinely united in their mission to reclaim
the Cup after two consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't noticed a lot of nonunity from the beginning,'' Jeff
Maggert said. ``I don't think anyone was really mad at other
players. . . . I really think (for) all the players, that's ancient
history, what happened a month ago at Medinah. We're ready to play
some golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very unified,'' Mark O'Meara said. ``Ben is a
great guy. I think no one denies that. He's got a lot of emotion, a
lot of fire; he showed that (at Medinah). And he has a lot of
compassion for the game and for the Ryder Cup. I know that Ben
probably feels badly about what happened. I feel badly that that
happened. . . . But I think we're all on the same page. I don't
think the players at any time were ever thinking about boycotting
the Ryder Cup. They know it's an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans have seemed somewhat aghast that a financial issue
could dominate a competition built on emotion and pride. England's
Lee Westwood has been among the most critical of the American
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we play for money 51 weeks of the year,'' Westwood
said, ``so one week playing for pride and honor is not too much to
ask. . . . I grew up watching Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros, Ian
Woosnam and people like that, and the last thing on their mind
looked to be money. You knew they were there for the honor of
representing their country and their continent. That's the way I
was brought up. I just don't think money should come into it at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Europe has managed to lead up to the matches without
controversy. Two years ago, some wondered about their cohesion
after the flap that pushed injured Miguel Angel Martin off the
squad. They won anyway. This year, despite seven rookies and some
controversy about European captain Mark James' selection of young
Andrew Coltart instead of veteran Bernhard Langer, Europe's image
sparkles. Its players seem looser, perhaps a result of the U.S.
team facing more pressure, particularly on home soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our focus is solely on winning the Cup back,'' said
Tom Lehman, who with Payne Stewart, is expected to emerge as a team
leader. ``We haven't won for a few years, and I know, personally,
I'm sick and tired of being on a losing team.''

 &HT;    RESCUERS HUNT FOR 3,000 BURIED TAIWANESE AFTER KILLER QUAKE
 &HT;    800&AMP;ADDS
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAICHUNG, Taiwan _ Rescuers worked frantically into a second,
critical day Wednesday to uncover an estimated 3,000 people who may
still be buried alive in the ruins of a massive earthquake that
killed more than 1,770 people and smashed entire mountain towns in
central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The earth began trembling again at 8:14 a.m. (local time)
Wednesday as two consecutive aftershocks registering 6.8 on the
Richter scale rumbled across the island. Seismologists at the
Central Weather Bureau warned that Taiwan could experience
aftershocks as frequently as every hour throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The morning's big tremors sent may Westerners and Taiwanese out
onto the streets of Taichung as the shaking continued more than 30
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was much, much weaker than the big one that hit us the
other night,'' said Kevin Rhea, 41, a businessman from Bolder,
Colo. ``Still, it's scary because you don't know how structurally
sound these buildings are.''
</P>
<P>
   Concrete lay buckled and ripped as though a giant claw had
slashed it in the hardest hit neighborhood in Taichung, the
third-largest city on Taiwan. Apartment buildings were splintered
into giant crumbs of concrete and the earth had heaved into a new
hillock.
</P>
<P>
   Along one small street where scores perished, more than 200
survivors spent the night on blankets on an outdoor basketball
court of the Taiwan army's Dakuan Supply Base, a few hundreds yards
from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're too afraid to sleep inside,'' said Capt. Lee Tai Shen,
showing an almost vacant, temporary dormitory the soldiers had
created by giving up their own bunks. With most survivors sleeping
on hard concrete outside, fewer than a dozen people, mostly women
and children, had bunched themselves fully clothed on bunkbeds in
one corner of the room. Ranks of other available beds stood crisply
made and empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to rescue the people around here last night,'' Lee
said, describing how his troops ran out to the devastation just
after the temblor jolted the northern half of Taiwan awake at 1:47
a.m. (local time) Tuesday. They managed to save 60-70 people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the island's second deadliest earthquake after a 1935
tremor at a magnitude of 7.4 killed 3,276 Taiwanese. Every year
Taiwan trembles under the influence of dozens of earthquakes
because it sits on the western edge of the Pacific ``Rim of Fire,''
where the Philippine tectonic plate smashes against the Eurasian
land mass that historically spawned steep mountains, volcanoes and
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Just in this one neighborhood hundreds were injured, a part of
the more than 4,400 injuries reported island-wide by the Interior
Ministry's disaster management center.
</P>
<P>
   Another six shelters were set up in this area alone, and
hundreds of schools and other buildings were converted to makeshift
housing across the island for the 100,000 Taiwanese left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands refused the aid, however, preferring to
sleep outside or in small, open-front shops Tuesday night, from
which they could escape quickly if need be. In one such shop, a
family of three spread blankets on chairs clustered together like a
queen-sized bed to wait out the dark night.
</P>
<P>
   Electric power remained nonexistent Wednesday morning for about
4 million Taiwanese families, although more than a million
households had electricity restored, mostly in the area of the
capital city Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   With a population exceeding 100,000, Taichung city lies at the
periphery of the most extensive damage that radiates from the
quake's epicenter to the southeast. At a town called Puli near the
epicenter, 95 percent of the buildings were reported wrecked. That
area has been practically inaccessible except by helicopter, its
roads mostly heaved into impassable ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Near Puli, bodies were reported piling up in roadside tents,
after morgues and hospitals were filled. Radio reports said there
was urgent need for refrigeration in the late summer heat, to keep
bodies from decomposing.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals for blood, medical supplies, bottled water and
bulldozers came from the hardest hit communities there near the
center of the shockwave that registered 7.6 on the Richter scale,
according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Central Weather Bureau
put the quake at the 7.3 level.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologist Yi Men Wu warned that ``very strong'' aftershocks
could be in store, as high as 6.5 in the coming two weeks. Before
Wednesday morning's tremors, he said there already had been 1,280
aftershocks as of 9 p.m. (local time) Tuesday, but only 28 were
severe enough to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   Already disaster teams started arriving Tuesday from Japan and
Singapore, and the United States dispatched two military aircraft
with about 70 rescue staff and sniffer dogs. Also en route was a
Turkish search and rescue team that had saved 200 people from the
earthquake that shattered Turkey last month.
</P>
<P>
   China's President Jiang Zemin put aside the searing dispute that
has rattled relations between the mainland and this island the
Chinese government calls a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster ``hurt the hearts of people on the mainland, as the
Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan strait are as closely
linked as flesh and blood,'' he said. China's Red Cross promised to
send $100,000 worth of disaster aid and $60,000 worth of relief
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's leadership, which set off the latest round in the
50-year feud when it distanced itself from the notion of a single
China by declaring the two governments should have ``special
state-to-state relations,'' expressed cautious thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a good beginning to improving ties,'' Su Chi,
chair of the Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's damage appeared less severe than the widespread
destruction in Turkey, where a 7.3 level earthquake killed more
than 15,000 people. Buildings here, especially around the island's
main north-south geological fault line, have been solidly built out
of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Recent rapid development, however, has produced complaints of
builders ignoring construction codes and bribing building officials
to wink at inferior construction. That may have contributed to the
collapse of select buildings, especially in Taipei, while adjacent
structures stood fast.
</P>
<P>
   In Taipei, where major damage was limited to a scattering of
buildings and a bridge, life already was beginning to return to
normal. Many offices and schools, including the American School of
Taiwan, announced they were reopening their doors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute in Taiwan, the U.S. government's
unofficial embassy on the island, had sent personnel to this
central Taiwan area to monitor needs and relay the requests for
help to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had this big of an earthquake here,'' said Kevin
Huang, 25, as he stood in line to rent an electric generator in
suburban Taipei. ``We thought we were safe.''

   NEW YORK _ As grand pianos go, the one going on the block at
Christie's next month is nothing special. Paderewski did not play
it. Neither did Liberace, though he would have swooned over its
fondant-white finish and maybe added some stylistic flourishes of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   And as far as Christie's knows, no one but Marilyn Monroe, its
last owner, ever tickled its ivories, though it is possible that
Frank Sinatra, a Monroe beau, might have plunked out a tune or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we do know for certain is that it needs
tuning,'' said Vredy Lytsman, a spokeswoman for Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Out of tune and bearing a few bumps and scratches, the baby
grand piano is a highlight of the sale of Marilyn Monroe's personal
effects at Christie's new salerooms at Rockefeller Center on Oct.
27 and 28. Like most of the celebrity-driven sales of late, this
one offers lots (more than 1,000) that range widely in quality,
from the brash (the transparent Jean-Louis sequinned gown she wore
to serenade John F. Kennedy at his Madison Square Garden birthday
extravaganza in 1962) to the banal (the kind of battered
mass-produced 1950s furniture found in any thrift shops).
</P>
<P>
   Stored since the actress' death in 1963, at 35, the belongings
are being sold by the heirs of Lee Strasberg, the acting coach, to
whom Monroe's will left ``all of my personal effects and
clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Charles Foster Kane's sled, Rosebud, the piano is a
touchstone in Monroe's history, the sole surviving relic of a
childhood that, while sad, was not as Dickensian as Monroe's
overzealous press agents _ and the actress herself _ often claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Background information provided by Christie's states that the
piano was sold, along with the rest of the family's belongings,
after her mother, Gladys Baker, a film lab technician at Columbia
Pictures, was hospitalized with paranoid schizophrenia and her
younger daughter, Norma Jeane, was placed in an orphanage. It is
expected to bring $10,000 to $15,000, but, given its celebrity
ownership, it will doubtless bring much more.
</P>
<P>
   As the official Monroe narrative goes, she stumbled across it at
another auction, and the struggling actress and model shuttled it
from one Southern California storage unit to another until she was
able to move it into her own home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I didn't have enough money to eat, I borrowed money
to keep that piano in storage,'' the actress said an early
interview, her comments shaped and dramatized at the encouragement
of her press agent and her guardian-business manager, Grace
Goddard. Whether Goddard and the agent came up with the piano's
provenance, too, is unknown _ it reportedly was once owned by the
movie star Frederic March _ but Monroe's feelings for the piano
seemed genuine. ``My happiest hours as a little girl were around
that piano,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing from the tale _ and the Christie's entry _ are
the details. ``My Sister, Marilyn'' (Algonquin Books, 1994), an
affecting memoir written by the actress' half-sister, Berniece
Baker Miracle, and her niece, Mona Rae Miracle, relates that the
piano was a seventh-birthday present from Monroe's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Baker bought it on credit, as she did all the furniture
in her little two-story house near the Hollywood Bowl, where Monroe
sat and practiced with a local teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Miracle (pronounced MIRE-cuhl) wrote that after her
mother's breakdown, the piano was saved by an elderly family
friend, who took over the payments and placed it in her living
room. The friend later brought Norma Jeane home, too, after it
became apparent that her mother would be unable to care for her
again. The piano lessons began anew, and Monroe passed on a bit of
that knowledge to her niece, who recalled her aunt teaching her how
to play ``Chopsticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the piano accompanied Monroe from house to
house, marriage to marriage. Eventually, around 1957, it ended up
in the Manhattan apartment that she and her second husband, the
playwright Arthur Miller, bought. That is also when the
instrument's complexion went from its original classic black to
musical-comedy white.
</P>
<P>
   The three-bedroom, two-bath, 13th-floor apartment at 444 East
57th Street was decorated in a movie-star chic style befitting
America's reigning silver-screen beauty. Apartment 138 was,
Beatrice Miracle recalled, ``a world of white'' reflected in a
multiplicity of mirrors: white walls, white furniture, white
louvered doors, white carved fireplace and, in a surprising touch
of sophisticated whimsy, a 1930s white plaster floor lamp by the
French designer Serge Roche, shaped liked a palm tree (a presale
estimate of $2,000 to $3,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``Decorating takes my worries away,'' said the actress, who even
had a white poodle, a gift from Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   To fit in with the blanched scheme, the piano was custom-coated
with shining white lacquer, thick enough to obscure the
manufacturer's name on the keyboard cover. ``Unknown American
manufacturer'' is Christie's best guess. The actress' sister wrote
that it was made by Franklin, a company that a sales manager at
Steinway identified as the Franklin Piano Co. of New York City,
which manufactured inexpensive but well-constructed instruments
from 1900 until 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Though the piano was always front and center in Monroe's
surroundings, it seems that the platinum-blond bombshell was, at
the end of the day, a typical music-loving homeowner with memories
of afterschool arpeggios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't play,'' she told her sister. Which explains,
perhaps, why it was more often used as a display stand for a vase
of her favorite flowers, red anthuriums.

TEXAS A&AMP;M'S OFFENSE FACING FIRST TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M running back Dante Hall was
surprised yesterday to learn that the fifth-ranked Aggies are
second nationally in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are?'' Hall said. ``Hey, that feels good. I feel proud.
Times change, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The Aggies' offense was 91st in Division I-A last
season. One of coach R.C. Slocum's off-season goals was to
dramatically improve that standing. Early returns indicate
resounding success. After two games, A&AMP;M is averaging 538.5 yards a
game, 0.17 of a yard behind national leader Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies also rank second nationally with a 49.5-point scoring
average, behind Louisville's 50 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that says that finally things are coming together a
little bit,'' quarterback Randy McCown said. ``We've always had a
great defense. Now, we've got a pretty good offense as well.''
</P>
<P>
   How good remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game at Kyle Field against Southern Mississippi (2-1)
might shed more light. The Golden Eagles' defense (No. 19
nationally) held Nebraska to 185 yards total offense and gave up
only one offensive touchdown in last week's 20-13 loss on the
Cornhuskers' turf. Nebraska had not been handcuffed offensively
like that since gaining only 179 yards against Oklahoma in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt Southern Miss has an excellent defense,'' A&AMP;M
offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe said. ``We respected them
before. The country respects them now because of what they did last
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles held A&AMP;M to 171 yards offense last season, though A&AMP;M
won 24-6 as the Aggies' defense forced five turnovers that resulted
in 13 points. Hall, playing with a sore hamstring, led the limited
offense with touchdown runs of 44 and 16 yards, gaining 76 yards on
eight carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the most confusing defense we play all year,''
Hall said. ``They move around a lot and don't give you time to
read. It will definitely be a test.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum is looking for a better yardstick to judge his offense
after victories over Louisiana Tech and Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to proclaim that we are a great offensive team
at this time because I don't think we are,'' Slocum said. ``I don't
think we've been tested under fire yet. We haven't had to line up
and really grind it out yet. I expect we \Rmight have to\S this
week, and that will be good for us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Skye Noe was about 15 miles outside of Abilene, Texas, nearing
the end of an all-day drive from his Colorado hometown to Abilene
Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Lonzo Wallace, a Fort Worth, Texas, Fire Department deputy
chief, and his wife, Nell, were on their way home to suburban
Burleson after visiting their sons in college, one at the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs and the other at Texas Tech University
in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it was a miracle that the 18-year-old student and
veteran firefighter chanced upon each other along that dark stretch
of Interstate 20 in the early morning hours of Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a heroic and life-saving meeting, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Noe, tired and lulled to sleep by the monotonous drive, veered
off the roadway, down a steep incline and crashed into a concrete
embankment.
</P>
<P>
   His Chrysler New Yorker burst into flames, trapping him inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallaces, traveling behind him, saw the car plunge off the
highway and stopped. Lonzo Wallace raced to pull Noe from the
flaming wreckage, then just hours later drove to Fort Worth for a
meeting; his wife used their cell phone to call 911, then stayed at
the hospital with Noe until his parents arrived from Aurora, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're just both angels,'' said the teen's mother,
Kathleen Noe. ``To find someone that would take time out of their
lives to help somebody else is very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Their heroics didn't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Wallaces were honored in a ceremony during the
Fort Worth City Council meeting. On Monday, they were recognized at
a special ceremony and lunch at Abilene Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Barnard, the Dean of Campus Life at Abilene Christian,
said the Wallaces' action ``is a great message for our students
about the kind of people we're educating them to be, the kind of
people that will get involved in society and get involved in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wallaces are reluctant heroes. News about their actions
would not surface from their lips, but from an Abilene paramedic
who alerted the Fort Worth Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``God just meant for us to be there and to do what we did,''
Lonzo Wallace said. ``It's kind of amazing when you really think
about it.''
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skye Noe had attended a church function in Denver that weekend
and was more than half way through the 12-hour drive to Abilene
when his car's starter went out in Dumas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Labor Day (weekend), so it was a real hard job to try
to find a mechanic,'' Noe said.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours later, the car was repaired and he was back on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Lonzo and Nell Wallace had attended parents weekend at the Air
Force Academy, where their oldest son is a student, and then
stopped at Texas Tech to visit their younger son.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 46, first spotted Noe on the highway leading out of
Lubbock, and the two drivers took turns following each other. They
temporarily separated when Noe stopped for gas, then met up again
on I-20, just outside of Merkle, after the Wallaces pulled over and
swapped seats for Nell Wallace to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Noe's) car came past, I said something to the effect to
my wife that, `That was the car I was following early and if you
get behind it, it's a good person to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   About 35 miles outside of Abilene, Noe said, the day's long
drive began to wear on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all my windows down and the radio on full blast just
trying to stay awake,'' Noe said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, shortly before 1 a.m., he fell asleep at
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a mile marker, woke up and slammed on my brakes,'' Noe
said. ``I remember going off the edge and going toward the concrete
embankment. I don't actually recall the collision.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling behind the Chrysler, the Wallaces had watched it veer
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went off the road onto the median and then he just
disappeared in between the two bridges,'' Lonzo Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace told his wife to stop and call 911 while he ran to the
top of the approximately 14-foot embankment. Down below, the
wrecked car lay on its side, bursting into flames.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver who had also stopped ran for his fire
extinguisher as Wallace scooted down the steep embankment toward
the burning car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear him down there. He was moaning,'' Wallace
recalled. ``I hollered to him to crawl out of the car, but he
couldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   Noe said he had been knocked unconscious and came to in a daze,
his body hanging halfway out the door. He was bleeding heavily from
a gash on the head and later would learn he also had a crushed
vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing some of my stuff on fire,'' Noe said. ``I
remember his voice yelling, but I couldn't really move. He ran up
and grabbed me under my arms and dragged me.''
</P>
<P>
   As they waited for help, Lonzo Wallace called Noe's parents in
Colorado to let them know about the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke them up and told them what was going on,'' Wallace
said. ``I put the phone up to (Noe's) ear so his dad could hear his
voice.''

PUTTING NEW PICTURES TO FAMILIAR OLD WORDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Mass.)  (af) 
 Miles Unger's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
Boston Cyberarts Festival.  
 By MILES UNGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATFIELD, Mass. _ In the beginning was the word. The pictures,
as every illustrator knows, can only follow, flowing from those
words but also subtly shaping their course, directing our gaze here
or there and fixing vividly in our minds the more abstract and
open-ended text.
</P>
<P>
   Who today can read Scripture immune to the blandishments of
Raphael's pretty, blond Madonnas or picture David without the
perfect physique Michelangelo gave him?
</P>
<P>
   Putting pictures to words is Barry Moser's profession, but never
has the challenge been greater than in his latest project: a
monumental, fully illustrated version of the King James Bible. Not
only is this the most central, most revered and surely most
contested text in our culture, but it is one already firmly fixed
in our collective minds by religious inclination and by the
countless artists who have already left their mark.
</P>
<P>
   Moser, while keenly aware of those precedents and
preconceptions, has approached this daunting project by returning
to the words themselves to confront familiar stories as if for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millenniums-old project of depicting religious
stories in books, paintings and sculpture, when Moser's Pennyroyal
Caxton Bible comes out on Friday it will be the first time a major
artist has illustrated the complete texts of both the Old and New
Testaments since the French artist Gustave Dore's Bible of 1865.
</P>
<P>
   The rarity of modern illustrated Bibles is not difficult to
explain. Philip Cronenwett, the special collections librarian at
Dartmouth College, points out that the popularity of illustrated
Bibles declined in the 15th century with the invention of printing,
which increased literacy and decreased the need for didactic visual
accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even more critical reason for artistic caution is the
realization that any image is an act of interpretation that cannot
possibly please each of the many groups that regard the text as
divine revelation. ``It's scary for an artist to approach something
like this,'' says Cronenwett. ``You're taking theology into your
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser, a burly, white-bearded man with an irreverent sense of
humor and an oratorical flourish that betrays his Tennessee
origins, does not seem intimidated, apparently relishing the
thought that his choices will ruffle a few feathers. Armed with
decades of experience as one of America's foremost illustrators and
book designers and a youthful interlude as a Methodist preacher _ a
vocation prompted by a near miss by a hunter's bullet _ Moser seems
more than ready to take on the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   For the opening image of this Bible, ``Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden,'' he had originally toyed with the idea of giving
the first couple African features: ``I decided that since all the
evidence points to the human race originating in Africa, I was
going to make (italics)my(end italics) Adam and Eve black,'' Moser
recalls, grinning slyly.
</P>
<P>
   While he eventually rejected the idea, he struggled to find an
appropriate form in which to represent the father and mother of all
humanity. ``Much as I would like to fly in the face of the white
establishment, especially the ultra-right-wing Christian groups,
and show a black Adam and Eve, I ultimately didn't, because the
question is: Whose literature is it? And the answer is: It's Jewish
literature. And who did the Jewish writers have in mind? Jews _ not
Africans, not Scandinavians.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Moser showed Adam and Eve at a distance, their faces
deep in shadow, a solution that allowed him to remain true to the
text while giving them an iconic universality. ``I wrestled with
the problem, and that wrestling is what ultimately gave rise to
that particular image.''
</P>
<P>
   This wrestling is typical of Moser, who relies on the text to
jolt the reader from the comfortable expectations that can be a
barrier to understanding.
</P>
<P>
   For his ``Tower of Babel,'' Moser has avoided the usual
cloud-scraping turret, directing our gaze instead to a stretch of
barren land on which we see only the base of an apparently massive
edifice. It is an image that emphasizes desolation. ``What struck
me on the umpteenth reading,'' he explains, ``was that what
happened was, the inability to communicate caused everyone to
leave. They abandoned the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his choice of image, Moser has shifted the emphasis from
the line ``Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach
unto heaven,'' to ``So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence
upon the face of all the earth,'' in keeping with his often dark
vision of Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Moser, despite his brief association with organized religion and
an abiding interest in what he calls ``the idea of God,''
subscribes to no particular creed, and this has freed him to tell
the story in his idiosyncratic way. His hope is to ``make the book
more accessible in the intimacy of the imagery.''
</P>
<P>
   One characteristic of Moser's interpretation is its
human-centered drama, particularly when compared with Dore's
cast-of-thousands pageantry, which could well have served as the
model for many a Hollywood epic.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pervasive sense of solitude that reveals much about
Moser's approach to religious experience. ``If we think about God
at all, we think about it in our own heads, and in our quiet
moments, when we're alone,'' he says. ``One's relationship with God
is necessarily a private and solitary thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the images, from ``Joseph in Prison'' to the
``Annunciation'' to the deeply moving image of Christ raising his
cup to proclaim ``This is my blood of the new testament, which is
shed for many,'' emphasize the frailty of the solitary man or woman
who must bear the weight of the world. It is a world in which the
actions and convictions of fallible humans count for more than the
supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire Bible is moved along by people, it's about
people,'' Moser insists. A haunting image of Abraham and Isaac
reveals no interceding angel to stop the hand of the grieving
father, and the ``Annunciation'' shows Mary alone with her
thoughts. Even Satan, though certainly a sinister-looking
character, makes a solo entrance without his usual pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Moser has very much taken his own tack, he has enlisted a
team of advisers to steer him clear of potential missteps. In
addition to hewing closely to the text, he looked for guidance to
the Midrash, the medieval Jewish commentary on Scripture. According
to Professor Shalom Goldman of Emory University, who served on his
advisory panel, ``Not only did he not want to offend anyone, but I
think he wanted to actively respect the Jewish tradition. His
approach was to be inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, the Pennyroyal Caxton edition, named for
Moser's press and his sponsor's company, is not a work of theology
but of art. At $10,000 a copy _ a trade edition will be available
from Viking Studio for $65 _ this two volume, 1,100-page work is of
superb craftsmanship meant for the rarefied fine-book market, where
bibliophiles are willing to pay for hand binding, archival paper
and old-fashioned letterpress printing.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Cohen and Sarah Creighton, bookbinders in whose
Easthampton, Mass., studios the Bibles are being assembled, explain
the cost as a factor not only of the materials _ including the
imported vellum used for the covers and custom-manufactured paper
imported from Germany _ but also of the hours of skilled labor
demanded by a technology that has remained essentially unchanged
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Moser, while uncomfortable with the elitism implied in the
five-figure price tag and the limited edition of 400, is a
perfectionist unwilling to cut corners and sparing neither himself
nor his potential buyers. Not only has he engraved each of the
roughly 230 images himself _ Dore, in contrast, shipped out his
drawings to professional engravers _ but he labored on almost every
aspect of the book's design.
</P>
<P>
   Countless hours were spent finding exactly the right typeface to
stand up to the density of the engraved images _ he finally hit on
a 13-point Galliard and commissioned a new set of Hebrew letters
from Matthew Carter, its designer _ and he recalls the agonizing
process of tinkering with the exact dimensions of the gutter
between the two columns of type that form each page, a crucial
element in what he describes as ``the vertical monumentality of the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he aims to create a masterpiece in this most traditional
of art forms, Moser is happy to employ new technologies when they
will serve to deliver the product more efficiently. (For example,
the engraving blocks he used for the images are made from a
synthetic polymer, replacing the traditional but increasingly rare
boxwood.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the engraving technique itself _ in which the block is
carved by hand, leaving those raised areas left untouched to carry
the ink that will form the image _ is an old and notoriously
difficult medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bear of a technique,'' Moser admits, ``mostly because
it doesn't forgive mistakes.'' Demonstrating that technique in his
light-filled, hilltop studio, he uses the time-tested tools of the
trade _ burins, spitz stickers and gravers _ to conjure deftly a
face half lost in shadow, a process he once compared to a biblical
separating of light from dark.
</P>
<P>
   Concessions to modern technology are not simply a matter of
convenience. Near the solid wooden desk with its leather engraver's
bag and hand tools sits another desk with a large computer monitor
on which many of the images for the Bible were composed through a
seamless blending of drawing and scanned, collaged photographs,
which were then transferred to the block for engraving.
</P>
<P>
   The photographic origin of many images shines through the
linear, abstract quality of the engraving medium, often giving a
startling immediacy to the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   For the image to accompany the line from Mark ``Suffer the
little children to come unto me,'' Moser has portrayed a Jesus
whose frank smile and unidealized face seem to capture a candid
moment on the wing. ``There are no made-up faces here,'' he says,
noting that he used a local chef to model for Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Reimagining this sacred cast of characters as living, breathing
men and women lies at the heart of Moser's project. For all its
traditional splendor, the Pennyroyal Caxton Bible is not a
comfortable book; it has the power to startle as readers begin to
recognize themselves in those iconic, larger-than-life characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these people are flawed,'' Moser says, ``just like the
people who will be picking up the book and reading it.'' In
bringing a sacred text down to earth, Moser may just have created
the Bible for our time.

TREASURY CHIEF DEFENDS U.S. AID TO RUSSIA, BUT CALLS FOR
SAFEGUARDS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers Tuesday
vigorously defended the Clinton administration's policy of
supporting aid to Russia, but warned that the Russian Central Bank
had to comply with safeguards to maintain American backing for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions are not new. But taken together in the climate of
a running federal inquiry into allegations of Russian money
laundering, they represent a new and hardening tone by an
administration official who, in July 1998, was the chief American
architect of a multibillion-dollar loan to Russia from the
International Monetary Fund to prop up the ruble. Within a month,
however, President Boris Yeltsin of dismissed his team of reformers
and devalued the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Summers was testifying before a House Banking Committee hearing
on the investigation into reports of laundering billions of
dollars. He sought to blunt congressional criticism that the
administration had done too little to combat Russian corruption and
should cut off international economic support to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``To quarantine, contain or write off Russia as too corrupt
would ill serve our national security,'' raising the risk that the
United States and the West would be branded as scapegoats for
Russia's failures, Summer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new lending agreement signed in July, Russia has
received the first $640 million of a $4.5 billion loan, just enough
to keep it from defaulting on its existing debt to the IMF.
Approval for a second installment of roughly the same size hinges
on an external audit of the central bank and some affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said there was no evidence that any IMF money had
been diverted through laundering, Summers added that the
administration was insisting that the Central Bank strengthen how
it managed foreign-currency reserves and submit to regular external
audits that would be made public. The administration is also
awaiting a review of the bank's offshore operations.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress opens the first of a series of inquiries into
corruption and money laundering, including at least $4.2 billion
diverted through the Bank of New York in the last 18 months, the
federal investigation is highly likely to take many twists and
turns. Investigators are examining bank transactions that involve
Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Facing his first major test since he succeeded Robert Rubin,
Summers said the Treasury and Justice departments would announce on
Thursday the administration's strategy to combat money laundering.
The plan would tighten bank regulations and offer legislation to
apply money-laundering laws to foreign officials and arms
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is trying to stay in front of Congress on the
fast-breaking inquiry. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who leads the
Banking Committee, introduced legislation Tuesday to require U.S.
banks to pay closer attention to their foreign customers and impose
new restrictions on their dealings with offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats quickly threw their support behind the
legislation. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York said he would
introduce a companion bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has taken on sharply partisan overtones. Rep. Dick
Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader, last week called the
administration's Russia policy ``the biggest foreign policy failure
since Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are trying to protect the administration, especially
Vice President Al Gore, who has been an influential voice in Russia
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearing Tuesday was surprisingly devoid of drama. About
15 of the 60 panel members were present at any given time during
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans threw few pointed questions at Summers. When Rep. Ed
Royce, R-Calif., asked why Summers and other senior Treasury
officials agreed to the $4.5 billion IMF loan this summer, even
though they had known of the federal inquiry since April, Summers
said that the reports only reinforced changes that the fund had
instituted in its lending practices to Russia after the ruble
collapsed in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' refrain throughout his testimony was that the
administration had faced a set of admittedly bad choices in dealing
with Russia as it evolved from a communist dictatorship afflicted
with corrupt officials to a free-market economy governed by the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results have not been ideal, he said, the
pessimistic predictions that Russia would collapse under
hyperinflation, political chaos and civil unrest have not come
true. Moreover, Russia has dismantled more than 1,500 nuclear
warheads, slashed its military spending and offered new, if still
somewhat limited, personal freedoms to ordinary citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Summers also underscored that the United States and the West
could be only limited help in Moscow's painful economic and
political transformation. ``We cannot want successful market reform
in Russia more than Russia's government and its people do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses warned that ordinary Russians were increasingly
cynical toward their government and an economy dominated by
oligarchs, resentment that is spilling over to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seen, in short, by average Russians as supporting the
system and the individuals who are exploiting them,'' said former
CIA Director R. James Woolsey.

 BAY AREA A BIG LURE FOR FOREIGN FIRMS TO RELOCATE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By PETER SINTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Everyone talks about the problems of doing
business in the Bay Area, including highway gridlock, a serious
housing shortage, &UR;  &LR; astronomical living costs and so-so public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the region's high-tech companies are being
aggressively recruited by other states and countries.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is ditching the Bay Area. In fact, local
startups are getting venture capital financing in record amounts
and going public in record numbers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies are even relocating to the area because it
remains the epicenter of the information technology revolution and
the explosive growth of the Internet and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Data on the number of foreign firms moving to the bay is hard to
find but there is strong anecdotal evidence. Consider these
examples:
</P>
<P>
   -- Former Israeli paratrooper Eli &LR;   &LR; Barkat moved BackWeb
Technologies from a Tel Aviv suburb to San Jose, Calif., two years
ago because the Internet communication software market is here. The
company went public in June and is now worth more than $650
million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Germany's Marco Boerries got hooked on computers when he was
an exchange student at High School in Palo Alto, Calif., 15 years
ago. After returning to Hamburg, he dropped out of school to start
an office productivity software company called Star Division. Last
year, he moved its headquarters to Fremont, Calif., and three weeks
ago, he sold the company to Sun Microsystems in a
multimillion-dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
   -- Canadian Bill Lipsin, CEO of Ironside Technologies, relocated
the e-commerce order management software company from Toronto to
Pleasanton, Calif., a year ago at the suggestion of U.S. investors.
He figures the move has raised Ironside's credibility and should
position it for a successful public offering sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   BackWeb's Bold Move
</P>
<P>
   Eli Barkat started BackWeb Technologies in 1995 while he was a
partner at BRM, an Israeli venture capital company. Within a year,
the company had landed a few customers for its product, which
provides Internet access to critical, time-sensitive company
information. BackWeb also was looking for more financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to immediately establish headquarters in Silicon
Valley,'' said Barkat, 36. ``The CEO has to be where the market is.
And with the Internet, that's North America. This is the center of
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also a great believer in the influence of culture on a
company. In Silicon Valley, people live, breathe and dream the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For online businesses, getting a product to market quickly to
beat competitors and build customer acceptance is crucial. ``It's
hard enough to learn about the business and build the product,''
said Barkat. ``You don't want to have to learn about the culture,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkat also moved BackWeb because he was tired of spending 90
percent of his time in the air or on the road. BackWeb opened its
headquarters in San Jose with a handful of Israeli managers and
hired local talent from companies such as Netscape, Oracle,
PeopleSoft and Silicon Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   By moving to the Bay Area, Barkat figures he had much better
success attracting key employees. ``Top executives in the valley
don't want to work for a company a 10-hour time zone away and have
to wake up in the middle of the night to convince someone about
something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other foreign companies that have relocated to the
Bay Area, BackWeb kept its research and development staff back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works like a charm.'' said Barkat. BackWeb has about 200
employees, including 70 in Silicon Valley, 60 in Ramat Gan near Tel
Aviv and the rest at offices in Canada, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In its drive to become what Barkat calls ``The FedEx of the
Internet'' in delivering time-sensitive information, BackWeb has
signed some major customers. Compaq uses it to deliver software
updates to customers of its Presario computers. Cisco Systems uses
BackWeb to deliver video alerts to thousands of salespeople, and
Hewlett-Packard uses it to update manuals of its field service
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling the dream of most high-tech startups, BackWeb went
public in June and is now worth more than $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israeli Internet companies also are taking flight to
Silicon Valley. GuruNet, which started in Jerusalem in December to
make Web information access easier, has just set up temporary
headquarters in Palo Alto and is looking for a permanent Bay Area
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic jams or not, you have to be close to your customers
and market,'' said Chairman Robert Rosenschein, who grew up in
Pennsylvania but spent the past 16 years in Israel. The company
will keep its research staff in Israel but expects to have up to 50
local employees by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   GuruNet's mission is to deliver free instant information in a
simple one-click, pop-up window within any Windows application. It
delivers real-time information such as news and stock quotes as
well as dictionary and other reference information when users
simply point to words in a document.
</P>
<P>
   Another Israeli Internet software company planning to move to
Silicon Valley is Personetics. Founder and CEO Moshe Raccah, 33,
said the move ``is only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has some of the best software engineers, and Intel, IBM
and Microsoft all have development centers in Israel. But Raccah
said, ``Most Israeli managers don't have the necessary experience
in marketing and selling to U.S. customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, very few Israeli venture capital firms have
participated in building top Internet companies. But Raccah noted
that perhaps the most important reason to move to Silicon Valley is
the sheer number of Internet companies. ``Being close to your
customers, your partners and your competitors, means that you will
have the opportunity to build stronger partnerships and have better
access to the information, the so-called buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Star's Flight
</P>
<P>
   When Marco Boerries moved Star Division from Germany to Fremont
in 1998, it was almost like coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was infected with the Silicon Valley virus in 1884 when I
was 16 and a foreign exchange student at Palo Alto High School,''
said Boerries. ``From that point, I didn't want to go back to
Germany,''
</P>
<P>
   On his first journey to the Bay Area, Boerries stayed with an
American family who had an Apple IIe. Soon he was hooked not just
on games but on VisiCalc, the first electronic spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Boerries' parents wanted him to return to Germany and he did.
But nine months after leaving Palo Alto, he dropped out of high
school and used $2,000 in savings to create what he feels is ``the
best office productivity software in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Star Division started small and remained that way for some time.
By 1996, however, it was expanding beyond Germany into the rest of
Europe before it entered the U.S. market in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Boerries moved the company to Fremont and himself,
his wife and two kids to a tony Peninsula suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to explain why,'' said Boerries in perfect English.
``Silicon Valley is where dot-com strategies get born, get made,
get successful. If you are not here, you don't have the opportunity
to grow as fast and find the right partners.``
</P>
<P>
   Boerries also got tired of making eight trips a year to North
America. With 200 employees, Star Division kept its research team
in Germany and had 30 employees at Fremont headquarters, including
Boerries and three other Germans. Then three weeks ago, Boerries
sold the company in which he owns an 80 percent stake to Sun
Microsystems for undisclosed millions.
</P>
<P>
   Boerries is now Sun's vice president and general manager of
Webtop and Application Software.
</P>
<P>
   Ironside Goes for Gold
</P>
<P>
   Ironside Technologies moved from Toronto to Pleasanton a year
ago ``to gain extra credibility and access to a much larger source
of financing,'' said CEO Bill Lipsin.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started in 1995 to make e-commerce software that
would allow companies to take customer orders and fill them over
toll-free phone lines without the need for costly call center
employees. It was initially financed by Canadian companies. Later,
General Electric and Euclid Partners of New York agreed to invest,
but they suggested that the company move to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area was the obvious choice. ``Investors pay premiums
for companies headquartered here because within 30 miles you have
unparallelled technical engineering skills, the venture capital
community and business decision-makers,'' said Lipsin.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the panache that the Bay Area adds to a name and
investment, it's the place to develop business relationships and
find partners. Such links are crucial to the success of many
e-commerce businesses, and Ironside has made several of them. For
example, it has partnered with Ariba Inc., another e-commerce
company that recently went public and has a market value topping $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ironside chose Pleasanton as its new home because it noticed a
lot of East Bay residents who commuted across the bay preferred not
to. In addition, housing prices are generally less than around
Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Ironside has 105 employees, including 35, mostly local hires, in
Pleasanton and 70 in Toronto, where R&AMP;D is still based.
</P>
<P>
   It's an advantage ``paying 65-cent dollars for world-class
skills in Toronto,'' said Lipsin.
</P>
<P>
   He figures it's also worth the additional costs to relocate to
Silicon Valley and capture the attention of business partners,
customers, financiers and ultimately U.S. stock market investors.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a phrase from California's Gold Rush 150 years ago,
Lipsin said, ``We don't want to be a flash-in-the-pan IPO.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you'd never seen Eve Ensler's one-woman show ``The
Vagina Monologues'' and if you knew she had also written plays
about Bosnian refugees, women in prison and nuclear war, you might
expect her to be humorless, single-minded, even didactic. But to
step into Ms. Ensler's apartment in Chelsea is to confront a
positively bubbly figure, wearing bright red lipstick, her dark
hair cut in a bob.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always expect me to be really, really serious,'' Ms.
Ensler, 46, said. She giggled as she told about a television
station that had tried to produce a show about ``The Vagina
Monologues'' without using the word vagina.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ensler's good humor masks a serious purpose and a troubled
personal history that gave rise to ``The Vagina Monologues,'' which
began its second New York run last Tuesday (in previews at the
Westside Theater).
</P>
<P>
   The monologues are part of Ms. Ensler's crusade to wipe out the
shame and embarrassment that many women still associate with their
bodies or their sexuality. On the other hand, she has good reason
to smile. Ms. Ensler's career is on a roll, with one play recently
staged, three other works being produced in the next six months, a
new book and a budding professional relationship with Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But it all began with ``The Vagina Monologues,'' which opened at
Here, the SoHo theater, in 1996, ran for nearly three months and
won an Obie. Based on Ms. Ensler's interviews with more than 200
women, the monologues are both a celebration of women's sexuality
and a condemnation of its violation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the play was first staged in New York, it has become
something of a phenomenon, performed around the world, in London,
Stockholm, Athens, Zagreb and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   By last February, the show had become such an event that Ms.
Ensler was able to persuade a large number of celebrities to
perform it as a benefit to call attention to violence against
women. She called the event V-Day. Whoopi Goldberg, Glenn Close,
Susan Sarandon, Lily Tomlin, Winona Ryder, Marisa Tomei, Rosie
Perez, Calista Flockhart and others gathered at the Hammerstein
Ballroom Theater in New York to recite the monologues with all
their bald frankness and ribald humor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg read ``My Angry Vagina,'' a lament about pelvic
exams that declared ``There's got to be a better way'' and asked,
among other things, ``Why the scary paper dress that scratches?''
and ``Why the Nazi steel stirrups?'' Shirley Knight recited a piece
about an elderly woman who said she had not ``been down there''
since 1953. Susan Sarandon read Ms. Ensler's piece about witnessing
her granddaughter's birth. And Ms. Ensler cajoled Ms. Close into
doing a riff about an obscene four-letter word for vagina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I don't know if I can do that,''' Ms. Close recalled.
```I don't know if I can tell my mother and my daughter.''' But she
did, enumerating associations with each letter of the pejorative.
For the letter T, for instance, there was ``texture, take, tent,
tight, tantalizing, tensing.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ms. Ensler says, there will be V-Day celebrations at
more than 100 colleges plus events in Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Toronto, Santa Fe and Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   But the monologues are now only one part of her busy
professional life. Last summer her play ``Conviction,'' about two
sisters, one of whom has been in prison, was at the Berkshire
Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass. On Oct. 12, at Alice Tully
Hall, Hazelle Goodman, Joanne Woodward, Ms. Close, Ruby Dee and Ms.
Perez will read ``Borrowed Light,'' writings of women prisoners at
the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, arranged by Ms. Ensler and
Gary Sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Ms. Ensler's plays, ``Lemonade,'' about a man who
murders his family and takes on a new identity, will be at the
Alley Theater in Houston, starting Oct. 8. ``Necessary Targets,''
her play about Bosnian refugees, is to be staged in London next
March.
</P>
<P>
   She has a contract from Villard for a book, ``Points of
Re-entry,'' based on interviews with women about ``parts of their
bodies that they systematically hide, destroy and transform and
mutilate in order to fit in with their particular culture,'' she
said. She hopes to publish it in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   And to cap things off, Hillary Rodham Clinton has invited Ms.
Ensler to join her exploratory committee for her United States
Senate run. Mrs. Clinton is also writing the forward for a book
version of ``Necessary Targets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to be friends,'' Ms. Ensler said of Mrs.
Clinton, whom she met at a Kennedy Center reading of ``Necessary
Targets'' staged in Mrs. Clinton's honor. ``I said, `I'd really
like you to become involved.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful meeting at the White House,'' said Ms.
Ensler. ``She's committed to stopping violence towards women. What
she hopes to do is bring all kinds of women into this movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ``victimhood'' comes up frequently in Ms. Ensler's
conversation. The foundation for ``The Vagina Monologues,'' Ms.
Ensler said, lies in her childhood experience as a victim of sexual
and physical abuse. The monologues have been an effort to redeem
the experience with humor, to enable others to confront painful
truths that have been repressed through fear and shame. ``When
you're dealing with issues that are complicated and sad, the best
way people can hear things is through humor.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like talking about her childhood abuse, she said,
out of fear of seeming conquered and destroyed by it. ``Do me one
favor,'' said Ms. Ensler. ``If you talk about my past, don't make
it seem like I feel sorry for myself or that it's in control of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ensler grew up in Scarsdale in a prosperous family. Her
father, who died 10 years ago, was a food company executive, her
mother a homemaker. ``I was deeply abused both sexually and
physically by my father from an early age,'' Ms. Ensler said. ``He
hit me with belts, beat me, threw me. He invaded me in ways
completely and totally inappropriately.'' The sexual abuse stopped
when she was 10, she said, though the punishments continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason why I've devoted my life to stopping
violence towards women,'' she said. Her mother was unaware of the
sexual abuse at the time, she said, but knew of the punishments.
``My mother was scared'' to intervene, said Ms. Ensler. She and her
mother are now close, she said. ``She's completely opened herself
to a healing between us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Eve's mother, Chris Ensler, said: ``I
didn't know she was being sexually abused. I always regret that I
didn't.'' As for the punishments, ``There was a time when I finally
said, `No more!''' She is proud of her daughter's work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the abuse, Ms. Ensler began drinking heavily in high
school. ``I was self-medicating,'' she said. ``When you're abused
on a regular basis, you come to believe you're bad.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she entered Middlebury College in Vermont, Ms.
Ensler said, she was ``a raging lunatic.'' She wrote an
undergraduate thesis on suicide in contemporary poetry. ``It was a
way of stopping myself,'' she said. She was accepted at Yale Drama
School but couldn't afford to go.
</P>
<P>
   After college she drifted. ``I drank myself across the
country,'' she said. ``I was in and out of the most bizarre
situations. Getting in bar fights. Hanging out with the Mafia,''
she said. ``When I saw `Looking for Mr. Goodbar,''' about a woman
murdered by someone she meets in a singles bar, ``I felt, `Lucky
her.''' She had relationships with both men and women, she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Ms. Ensler became sober _ just how, she won't say _ and
began writing for the theater. A play about abolishing nuclear
energy was performed in churches and at rallies. She worked for
Chelsea Against Nuclear Destruction United, an organization that
helped her learn grass-roots organizing.
</P>
<P>
   She married Richard McDermott, owner of the West Fourth Street
Saloon, and legally adopted his son, Dylan, whose mother had died
when he was 5. Dylan is now the star of the hit television series
``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the adoption, he was 19 and Ms. Ensler 26. ``I
always wanted him to know he had a mother,'' she said, though she
never wanted to give birth. She and the elder McDermott divorced,
but she remains close to Dylan and to his daughter, Coco, 3.
``Loving Dylan,'' she said, ``was central to me learning how to be
a loving human being.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Dylan who introduced Ms. Ensler to Joanne Woodward, his
acting teacher at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Manhattan. Dylan
showed Ms. Woodward Ms. Ensler's play ``Coming From Nothing,''
about a girl trying to remember her childhood, and Ms. Woodward
directed a reading with her students. Then, ``in a huge moment of
chutzpah,'' Ms. Ensler recalled, ``I said, `I really want to write
you a show.''' The result was ``The Depot,'' a one-woman play about
nuclear disarmament, which Ms. Woodward directed, with Shirley
Knight as the star. The play toured for two years and was performed
at a nuclear test site in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and Shirley were my mentors,'' Ms. Ensler said of Ms.
Woodward and Ms. Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life forever changed as a result of this,'' she said. ``It
was the first time I ever found a way to bring my politics and my
art self together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward credits Ms. Ensler with helping her become a
director. ``She has this quality that nothing is impossible. It's
sometimes overwhelming,'' Ms. Woodward said. ``She was very
inspiring to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Depot'' Ms. Ensler wrote ``Scooncat''; it was produced
at the Samuel Beckett Theater with Dylan McDermott playing a man
ruled by technology. Then the Music Theater Group asked her to
write ``Cinderella/Cendrillon,'' an adaptation of Massenet's opera
about Cinderella, which was performed at St. Clement's Church.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Holland praised its ``inventive approach to reconciling
musical time with the `real' time of characters on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Music-Theater Group in association with the Women's Project
and Productions also commissioned ``Ladies,'' about homeless women.
Directed by Paul Walker, it was based on Ms. Ensler's interviews as
a shelter volunteer. Mel Gussow praised the production at St.
Clement's but criticized it for being ``schematic, with monologues
failing to merge into a moving dramatic portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Ms. Ensler met Ariel Jordan, an Israeli
psychotherapist. ``I was absolutely terrified,just separated,''
she said. ``I was into the throes of dealing with my childhood. He
is an incredibly kind, generous, brilliant person.'' They began
living together, though they have no plans to marry. ``I feel I'm a
gender-fluid person. I'm attracted to both men and women,'' said
Ms. Ensler. ``I don't believe in having people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was with ``Extraordinary Measures,'' written and directed by
Ms. Ensler and inspired by the death from AIDS of her friend Paul
Walker, that Ms. Ensler became known to a wider audience. ``It is
hard to imagine a more fitting requiem for an acting teacher,'' Ben
Brantley wrote in The New York Times. After that play came
``Floating Rhoda and the Glue Man,'' about a woman having a hard
time loving a good man, also with McDermott, and produced at Here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vagina Monologues'' began with a conversation with a
friend about menopause. ``She started talking about her vagina with
such contempt and hatred,'' said Ms. Ensler. ``I was appalled.''
</P>
<P>
   She began interviewing women from all walks of life about their
bodies. ``In the beginning,'' she said, ``they were tentative,
nervous,'' but then they were ``dying to reveal this other aspect
of the self.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ensler used humor to break down her audience's natural
reserve. To simply read ``The Vagina Monologues'' on paper, Anita
Gates, a critic for The Times, wrote when she reviewed the V-Day
benefit in New York, ``you might roll your eyes, put the book back
on the shelf and remind yourself not to go on any more New Age
get-in-touch-with-your-inner-goddess weekends. But when Ms. Ensler
speaks the words on a stool in front of a microphone, wearing a
spaghetti-strap black dress trimmed in red, a mischievous smile
beneath her dark Louise Brooks bangs, she's very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward took her husband, Paul Newman, and the actress
Marisa Tomei to a performance of the monologues at Here. Newman at
first seemed taken aback by its frankness. ``I glanced to the left
at my husband sitting stony faced and bemused,'' she said. ``Marisa
was sitting there sobbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Ms. Ensler was able to break through Newman's
reserve. ``Paul wrote me the nicest letter afterwards,'' Ms. Ensler
said. And Ms. Tomei became another convert to Ms. Ensler's cause.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Ms. Ensler is writing a screenplay for Glenn
Close about women prisoners. As with other prominent women, Ms.
Close's praise for Ms. Ensler is on the extravagant side. ``I love
her so much,'' she said. ``Her coming into my life. I feel my life
has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just hook up with Eve,'' Ms. Close added. ``You
become part of her crusade. There's a core of us who are Eve's
army.''

 HOPE FADES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID LAZARUS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Despite President Clinton's declared ambition to ``save Social
Security first,'' the ``odds have dimmed'' for reform of the system
this year, Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the system can be overhauled before retiring Baby
Boomers drive it into projected bankruptcy by 2032, Apfel conceded
that younger workers _ those now in their 30s and 40s _ will have
to finance most if not all of their retirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Americans are going to need more than
Social Security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apfel was making the rounds of local media outlets to publicize
what is being billed as the ``largest customized mailing'' ever
undertaken by a federal agency. Beginning October 1, the Social
Security Administration will send out annual benefits statements to
125 million workers.
</P>
<P>
   The statements, at a cost to the government of about $70 million
a year, are intended to help people with their retirement planning.
They will include estimates of monthly payments if one retires at
62, 67 or 70, based on present earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help people understand what Social Security is, and
what it isn't,'' Apfel said.
</P>
<P>
   What it isn't is solvent in about three decades, unless
officials in Washington decide to stop playing Frisbee with the
program and hunker down to make some serious, and politically
painful, changes.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that as the Boomers start heading out to
pasture, payments to Social Security beneficiaries will outstrip
taxes by as much as $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is raise the retirement age,'' said David
Levine, an associate professor of economics at the University of
California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business. ``But that would
cut back on benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a prospect clearly holds little favor with those of more
advanced years, who have toiled for decades with an understanding
that the ``normal retirement age,'' when full Social Security
payments kick in, will come between 65 and 67, depending on date of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trimming benefits is obviously the least popular alternative
as far as public opinion goes,'' said John Rother, director of
legislation and public policy for the influential American
Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped that we would have gotten Social Security reform
done this year,'' he said. ``That we didn't is a disaster. The
uncertainty about the future will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate its new benefits statement, the Social Security
Administration created a fictional 39-year-old worker earning
$68,400 a year. (Of course, the scenario assumes that the Social
Security system will remain fully functional in years ahead.)
</P>
<P>
   If this worker retired at 62, she would receive $1,105 a month
in Social Security payments (unadjusted for inflation). By retiring
at 67, she would get $1,580, and retirement at 70 would gain her a
monthly check of about $1,905.
</P>
<P>
   Those earning less than $68,400, would reap considerably less.
In any case, few such individuals would be able to get by on $1,000
to $2,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent State of the Union address, Clinton proposed
dedicating a projected $2.7 trillion in budget surpluses over the
next 15 years to salvaging Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican lawmakers are pushing instead for those surpluses
to be applied to a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut, which Clinton has
vowed to veto. There is no certainty that future budget windfalls
will go to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   No less a prognosticator than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan has called the current Social Security system
``unsustainable,'' and told Congress in January that either payroll
taxes will have to be raised or benefits cut if the program is to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was critical of proposals that some or all of Social
Security funds be invested in the stock market to boost their rate
of return.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Apfel isn't ruling out making such investments.
``I think it would be good to see a more diversified portfolio,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Seidman, a professor of economics at the University of
Delaware and author of the recently published book ``Funding Social
Security,'' believes the government should hire a handful of
established brokerages to manage a more aggressive mix of stock and
bonds on behalf of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees no way around trimming benefits and boosting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get something for nothing,'' Seidman said. ``We have
to be willing to make sacrifices now to make the system stronger in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Apfel conceded that ``a full package'' of reforms is likely in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may see a lower benefit structure,'' he said. ``We may also
look at raising the wage cap for payroll taxes,'' which now stands
at $72,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is not an obsolete institution,'' Apfel
stressed. ``It's been a part of the country's fabric for 65 years,
and it will be for the next 65 years.''
</P>
<P>
   One way or another.

 SILENCE ISN'T GOLDEN IN VENTURE CAPITALISM
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By PETER SINTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the signs that your pitch for money is going
nowhere? Venture capital firms don't always come right out and say
``no.'' And in many cases, they don't say anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   A: At last week's ``Boot Camp for Startups'' sponsored by
Garage.Com, veteran entrepreneur Kamran Elahian had several
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   If venture capital firms do not return calls or e-mail, that's
an ominous signal, said Elahian, who has founded about 10
companies, including NeoMagic and Centillium.
</P>
<P>
   If you are lucky enough to win a face-to-face meeting and at its
conclusion the investors ``are not chomping at the bit to plan the
next meeting,'' he added, ``that's a good indication the answer is
`no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If you are meeting with assistants instead of partners, that's
also a sign ``you still have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   VCs talk about the importance of compelling business models,
competitive advantage and market potential of the companies they
invest in. But Elahian said that ultimately ``a good VC only
invests in people, good people. The rest is mumbo jumbo.``
</P>
<P>
   UCLA electrical engineering professor John Villasenor listed a
number of no-no's that will kill a VC deal: 1. refusing to divulge
key technology details; 2. bluffing about expertise or anything
else; and 3. having technical personnel who don't understand how
their work relates to the product and business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW22 (9381 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; Sites for Soar Eyes
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last week, you mentioned a number of helpful business Web
sites but you left out an awful lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right. The problem is that there suddenly are so many
online sites specializing in helping small businesses manage their
operations, sell their products, and buy goods and services over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been inundated by Web-hosted services and portals
targeting small and medium-size businesses,'' said Jack Wilson,
editorial director of ComputerLetter, which is published by
Technologic Partners and this week covers the wave of venture
capital-backed startups. ``As many as 15 or 20 venture deals are
announced every day and many deal with small business.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is huge. It is estimated that more than half of the
4.3 million U.S. businesses with up to 10 employees already use the
Internet and are ripe for e-mail, online calendar, ``virtual disk''
data storage and other Web-based services.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Wilson said many online sites offer small
businesses a way to get sophisticated solutions cheaply for
everything from strategic planning to managing financial and human
resources, with no need to install software or hire technical
specialists. But there are negatives, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trusting sensitive information, the life blood of your
company, to a brand new, untested and unknown quantity and hoping
the centralized system doesn't go down like eBay is a lot to ask,''
he noted. New Web companies often offer their services, or trial
memberships, for free. But be aware that once they build traffic,
they might want to sign you up for pay-only services. Free sites
also often make money if you buy from listed partners or
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sites I mentioned last week,
Freemerchant.com, Bigstep.com and eCongo.com are local companies
that put small businesses online with custom Web sites at no
initial cost. Another company, Hotbiz.com, offers four e-commerce
subscription services ranging from free to $30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of new sites (for sore eyes) continues: On Monday, San
Francisco's Desktop.com unveiled a free Internet service that
allows users to integrate the favorite sites, services and files.
The same day, IBM announced Small Business Web Connections. But Big
Blue is not giving its comprehensive Internet solutions away; it
will charge users at least $99 a month.  &LR; Wednesday &LR; , Microsoft is
expected to announce its own set of new small-business offerings.

EXCERPTS FROM 2 LETTERS ON COMMUTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLEMENCY-CONGRESS) 
(pr) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from two letters about
President Clinton's commutation of prison sentences of Puerto Rican
nationalists. The first is a draft of a letter written by the
director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, to Rep. Henry Hyde. The second is
a letter dated today from Clinton to Rep. Henry Waxman.
</P>
<P>
   FREEH'S LETTER
</P>
<P>
   The request for commutation of the sentences of these imprisoned
Puerto Rican terrorists associated with the F.A.L.N. was first made
in 1994. Since that time, in response to requests for comments, the
F.B.I. has consistently advised the Department of Justice (D.O.J.),
in writing, that the F.B.I. was opposed to any such pardon and/or
commutation of sentences for any of these individuals. As recently
as June 28, 1999, the F.B.I., in written correspondence, advised
D.O.J. that the F.B.I. continued to oppose the release of these
terrorists. Specifically, the F.B.I. pointed out to D.O.J. that as
active members of Puerto Rican terrorist groups, these individuals
sanctioned, supported and/or directly or indirectly participated in
activities resulting in no fewer than nine fatalities, hundreds of
injuries, millions of dollars in property damage and armed attacks
on U.S. Government facilities.
</P>
<P>
   D.O.J. was also advised the F.B.I. had reason to expect the
release of these individuals would ``psychologically and
operationally enhance'' the ongoing violent and criminal activities
of Puerto Rican terrorist groups. The F.B.I. also pointed out that
any such pardon of the ``currently incarcerated terrorists would
likely return committed, experienced, sophisticated and hardened
terrorists to the clandestine movement.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   With respect to the condition attached to the commutation of
sentences by the President, (i.e., that the terrorists renounce
violence as a form of protest) the F.B.I. had previously advised
D.O.J. that ``few of the current prisoners have expressed remorse
for their crimes or for their victims; rather, most remained
committed to violence as a means to achieve Puerto Rican
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON'S LETTER
</P>
<P>
   The question of clemency for these prisoners was a very
difficult one. I did what I believe equity and fairness dictated. I
certainly understand, however, that other people could review the
same facts I did and arrive at a different decision.
</P>
<P>
   In making my decision, I did not minimize the serious criminal
conduct in which these men and women engaged. I recognize and
appreciate that there are victims of F.A.L.N.-related violence who
feel strongly that these individuals, although not directly
convicted of crimes involving bodily harm to anyone, should serve
the full sentences imposed. Before making my decision, I sought and
considered the views of the Department of Justice. Press reports
note that certain Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice
Department officials, including the U.S. Attorneys in Chicago and
Connecticut, were opposed to clemency. I did not dismiss those
concerns as some have implied. Rather, I carefully weighed them in
making this difficult decision. ...
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who supported unconditional clemency for the
prisoners argued that they were political prisoners who acted out
of sincere political beliefs. I rejected this argument.
</P>
<P>
   No form of violence is ever justified as a means of political
expression in a democratic society based on the rule of law. Our
society believes, however, that a punishment should fit the crime.
Whatever the conduct of other F.A.L.N. members may have been, these
petitioners _ while convicted of serious crimes _ were not
convicted of crimes involving the killing or maiming of any
individuals. For me, the question, therefore, was whether the
prisoners' sentences were unduly severe and whether their
continuing incarceration served any meaningful purpose. ...
</P>
<P>
   The timing of my decision was dictated by the fact that my
former counsel, Charles Ruff, committed to many of those interested
in this issue that he would consult with the Department of Justice
and make a recommendation to me before he left the counsel
position. Pursuant to this commitment, I received his
recommendation in early August. As he recently indicated to The New
York Times, his recommendation and my decision were based on our
view of the merits of the requests _ political considerations
played no role in the process.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, last week I asserted executive privilege in the
face of Chairman Burton's subpoena seeking memoranda and testimony
concerning the decision process. I did so, after receiving the
opinion of the Attorney General that such assertion was proper, as
the demand clearly intruded on areas reserved to the President
under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Grants of clemency generate passionate views. In vesting the
pardon power in the President alone, the framers of our
Constitution insured that clemency could be given even in cases
that might be unpopular and controversial. The history of our
country is full of examples of clemency with which many disagreed,
sometimes fervently. When Theodore Roosevelt granted amnesty to
Filipino nationals who attempted to overthrow U.S. control of the
Philippines, when Harry Truman commuted the death sentence of Oscar
Collazo, and when Jimmy Carter commuted the sentence of Collazo and
other Puerto Rican nationalists who had fired upon the House of
Representatives, they exercised the power vested them by the
Constitution to do what they believed was right, even in the face
of great controversy. I have done the same.

 11-DIGIT DIALING FOR 408 AREA CODE ON HOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DEBORAH SOLOMON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators late Tuesday put on hold a
plan that would have required everyone in the 408 area code to dial
11 digits when making a phone call, saying they want more time to
determine whether the region is actually in need of a new area
code.
</P>
<P>
   The order by the state Public Utilities Commission puts off
until Jan. 8, 2000, a decision on whether to permanently stop a
planned ``overlay.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an 11th-hour reprieve for San Jose, Calif., area residents,
who were supposed to start dialing 11 digits on October 2. The
suspension is also an indication that overlays planned for the Bay
Area in the 415, 510 and 650 &UR;  &LR; area codes soon may meet a similar
fate, industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC's executive order was issued after Pacific Bell sent a
letter asking state regulators to suspend the 408 overlay until
January 8.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision adds to growing momentum to end overlays in
California.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the PUC scrapped California's first overlay in the
310 area code in the wake of a federal decision that should free up
phone numbers across the state.
</P>
<P>
   After halting the overlay, PUC Commissioner Joel Hyatt said he
wants to avoid implementing 11-digit dialing in any region and will
try to end the seven overlays planned for California.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a consumer group asked the PUC to do just that,
filing a motion to temporarily halt 11-digit dialing across
California
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Ratepayer Advocates, an independent arm of the
California Public Utilities Commission, asked the PUC to stop
California's seven planned overlays until it determines whether
11-digit dialing is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to overlays comes in the wake of several decisions
by the Federal Communications Commission, which give California
more flexibility in how it assigns phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the FCC gave California the right to hand out new
numbers to phone companies in blocks of 1,000 instead of 10,000.
The FCC also told the state it could require phone companies to
return any unused phone numbers so they could be reassigned to
other phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both decisions should free up more phone numbers for California
and could avoid the need for overlays.
</P>
<P>
   Overlays have been implemented to deal with the growing shortage
of phone numbers across the state. Instead of dividing a ``maxed
out'' region geographically and giving customers in one half a new
area code, an overlay lets existing customers keep their area code
and assigns a new area code to new phone lines. However, everyone
in the overlay area must dial 11 digits _ 1 plus the area code and
seven-digit phone number _ on every call, even when making calls
within their own area code.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in 415, 510 and 650 are supposed to get overlays in
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The 310 overlay in West Los Angeles was plagued with problems.
Customers, who were confused and frustrated at having to dial 11
digits, flooded the PUC with complaints. The overlay, which began
in April, did not work with some security systems, and customers
had trouble getting through to some phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC voted to pull it last week, saying the FCC's decision
could free up phone numbers and end the need for 11-digit dialing
in 310 and other regions across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Billingsley, a telecommunications expert with ORA, said
the FCC's decision merits a suspension of the planned overlays
until the state is certain they are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to suspend them'' than to implement and then
stop them as is happening in the 310 area, Billingsley said. It
will take about two months to undo the 310 overlay and reprogram
the switches in that region.
</P>
<P>
   Billingsley said ORA wants to avoid seeing something similar
happen in other regions and wants the PUC to approve the suspension
so customers aren't inconvenienced.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Getzug, a Pac Bell spokesman, said the phone company also
wants to avoid putting an overlay in place if the PUC may
eventually decide it's not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to eliminate any customer confusion that would
arise,'' Getzug said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Berkeley's mayor also asked the PUC to halt the
overlay planned for 510.

   TORONTO _ Ralph Fiennes sat alone at one of the big round tables
that sprouted like mushrooms around the half-darkened hotel meeting
room overlooking Bloor Street. He doodled idly on a small pad of
lined yellow paper, geometric shapes wrapped around letters and
half-finished faces. Empty water glasses and scraps of paper
littered the tables.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day Toronto International Film Festival ended its 24th
incarnation last Saturday after playing host to more than 300
films, dozens of major stars and filmmakers and hundreds of
journalists and industry types from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Private parties at fancy restaurants, art galleries and even S&AMP;M
clubs had lit up the Canadian night. Limousines choked every major
hotel entryway.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes had done his bit and was contemplating escape. ``I find
it can be very difficult to just move around in public during the
festival,'' he said. ``It's as though everyone has their antennas
out, they're on alert, on the lookout for celebrities.''

``Sunshine'' _ a Hungarian generational epic by the director Istvan
Szabo in which he plays three roles _ Fiennes was collecting his
thoughts after the last of the journalists had left and was
preparing to make a 36-hour getaway before he had to return for yet
another push, this time for ``Onegin,'' an adaptation of Pushkin's
narrative poem directed by Martha Fiennes, his sister.

   The Toronto festival has always been a gourmet shop for film
lovers _ all the best produce, artfully arrayed, glistening with
the mist of celebrity. But it is also part publicity frenzy, in
which actors and directors try to generate buzz for movies about to
open, and part film marketplace, in which finished films that do
not yet have distributors try to attract a company willing to buy
the rights to exhibit them. The highbrow shares a berth with the
mainstream, the obscure with the familiar, the serious with the
daffy.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities seem to overrun Toronto, where the local newspapers
offer a daily roster of who's in town and where they might be
spotted (hint: the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel is
(italics)the(end italics) place for star sightings) _ Bruce Willis,
Meryl Streep, Ed Harris, Denzel Washington, Claudia Schiffer, Kim
Basinger, Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Spacey, Ethan Hawke, Maggie
Smith, Catherine Deneuve, Robin Williams and on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the most basic level, it's a lot of free publicity,'' said
the director Steven Soderbergh, who brought his new film, ``The
Limey,'' to the festival. ``You can jump-start a buzz and hope it
reaches a tipping point where it becomes a movie people want to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a single film will burst from the pack and emerge as a
festival favorite, as Robert Duvall's ``Apostle'' did in 1997.
While no one film stood out this year, there were several that
attracted coteries of admirers: ``Boys Don't Cry,'' based on the
true story of a girl named Teena Brandon who passed herself off as
a boy; ``A Map of the World,'' with Sigourney Weaver starring in an
adaptation of Jane Hamilton's bleak, bleak novel, and ``Happy,
Texas,'' a slightly trimmed-down version of the wacky Sundance hit
about escaped convicts posing as beauty pageant organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood studios brought some of their prestige fall and
holiday releases, among them Lasse Hallstrom's adaptation of ``The
Cider House Rules,'' based on the John Irving novel; Scott Hicks'
adaptation of ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' the enormously popular
novel about prejudice and obsession in the Pacific Northwest, and
Norman Jewison's version of the Rubin Carter saga, ``The
Hurricane,'' which was shown as a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' a Dreamworks debut by the British stage
director Sam Mendes about suburbia gone rancid, won the People's
Choice Award. But to give some idea of the breadth of the festival,
and the eclecticism and sophistication of the Toronto audience, the
runners-up for that award were ``The Cup,'' a delightful film from
Bhutan about Buddhist monks who are obsessed with playing soccer,
and ``Yesterday's Children,'' a drama from the Philippines about
outcasts in a drought-stricken village.
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone was on the lookout for the hot, undiscovered
film that would engender a bidding war, it never appeared. Several
movies were picked up, and talks were begun for several more that
are expected to be finalized soon, but there were no reports of
gigantic checks written or feverish midnight negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the best independent films were bought up in the weeks
leading up to the festival,'' said a top executive with one
distribution company who was still scouting for films late in the
festival. ``I think we'll find when we look back that this festival
did a little bit of good for a large number of films, but was
make-or-break for none of them. Mostly, I think people will
remember the parties.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton urged other members of the
United Nations on Tuesday to strengthen their collective capacity
for intervening to prevent the kinds of mass killings and ethnic
repression that ravaged Kosovo and East Timor, saying that there
are limits to what individual nations can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promising too much can be as cruel as caring too little,''
Clinton said in a speech to the General Assembly. ``But
difficulties, dangers and costs are not an argument for doing
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are faced with deliberate, organized campaigns to
murder whole peoples, or expel them from their land,'' he
continued, ``the care of victims is important, but not enough. We
should work to end the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president offered no specific proposals for helping the
United Nations take responsibility for peacekeeping, even though
its efforts in that regard have been hobbled by the failure of the
United States to pay what it owes the world organization.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton waited till the end of his speech before turning
to the subject uppermost on the minds of most of his audience: the
$1.6 billion in arrears that the United Nations says Washington
owes in back dues, interest and other assessments.
</P>
<P>
   The president described the United Nations as ``indispensable''
and said that ``the United States also has the responsibility to
equip the U.N. with the resources that it needs to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I think most of you know, I have strongly supported the
United States meeting all its financial obligations to the United
Nations, and I will continue to do so,'' he continued. ``We will do
our very best to succeed this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the delegates, who greeted him with a standing ovation last
year, partly to show sympathy for his problems over the Monica
Lewinsky affair, failed to applaud his intentions Tuesday. He
received polite but unenthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said there has been ``obvious
and articulated concern from many quarters'' about the United
States' unpaid debt to the United Nations. But he described the
response to Clinton's speech in the General Assembly as positive
and appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a basketball arena where people are standing,
loudly cheering,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started his day at the United Nations by discussing the
American arrears with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been
critical of the debt.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said, ``The president again
indicated that this was a high priority for him and that he was
very much going to work hard to try to see if we could resolve this
problem this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.N. Charter, the United States could be stripped of
its vote in the General Assembly at the end of 1999 unless it pays
sufficiently on its arrears. In a report released in July, the U.S.
General Accounting Office estimated that the United States would
need to pay about $153 million in addition to the $508 million the
State Department expects to pay before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a bill on June 22 that authorized a payment
of more than $800 million to the United Nations, but it attached
conditions unilaterally cutting the American share of the budget
from 25 percent to 20 percent and its share of peacekeeping
expenses from 31 percent to 25 percent. The House has yet to vote
on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats and representatives of nongovernmental
organizations said Clinton had lost credibility in terms of his
ability to get the American dues paid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his remarks about stopping mass killings and ethnic
cleansing, Clinton acknowledged the United States' reluctance to
get drawn into other deadly internal conflicts like those in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that some are troubled that the United States and
others cannot respond to every humanitarian catastrophe in the
world,'' Clinton said. ``We cannot do everything everywhere. But
simply because we have different interests in different parts of
the world does not mean we can be indifferent to the destruction of
innocents in any part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended NATO's decision to begin an air war against
Serbia, saying that it followed a consensus in the Security Council
that Serbian atrocities against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians were
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we chosen to do nothing in the face of this brutality, I
do not believe we would have strengthened the United Nations,''
Clinton said. ``Instead, we would have risked discrediting
everything it stood for.''
</P>
<P>
   His assertion was implicitly contradicted by the Russian foreign
minister, Igor S. Ivanov, who said that the United Nations'
authority had been ``seriously and painfully tested'' by the crises
over ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and weapons inspections in Iraq.
Russia objected to military action in both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have managed through joint efforts to bring the settlement
of the Kosovo problem back within the legal and political framework
of the United Nations,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed two other long-term goals for the United
Nations: eradicating poverty and disease, and helping poorer
countries join the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must refuse to accept a future in which one part of
humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy, while the
other lives at knife edge of survival,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second goal was stopping the spread of nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said cooperation was especially needed to keep weapons
of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorist groups. ``They
may have weaker capabilities than states, but they have fewer
compunctions about using such weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton held meetings with several other
leaders, including President Andres Pastrana of Colombia, whose
country has been destabilized by guerrilla warfare and drug
trafficking.

HARVARD ENDOWMENT SEES DECLINE IN INVESTMENT RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard can't shake its thirst for diamond-in-the-rough
start-up companies. And the result is parched investment returns.
</P>
<P>
   The university's mega-endowment, the largest of its kind in the
world, has fallen far short of its investment goals, mostly because
it cannot place as much money as it would like into high-flying
venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Management Co., the university's investment arm, said
Tuesday that the endowment returned 12.2 percent over the last
fiscal year, and now stood at $14.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While that increase is nothing to sneeze at, and is a big
rebound from losses in the summer of 1998, it comes up well short
of Harvard's lofty goal of gaining 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year ended June 30, the university's portfolio,
which started the 12-month period at $13.2 billion, earned about
$900 million. It also received donations and pledges totaling about
$400 million.
</P>
<P>
   By ordinary standards, Harvard's investments did quite well. But
the university measures its performance against its own internal
benchmarks, which required it to do much better.
</P>
<P>
   More shortfalls may be in the works. In its annual letter to
investors, Harvard Management warned that the good times of
previous years may dry up in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital funds, the object of Harvard's lust, provide
seed money to small, young companies that then grow and issue
publicly traded stock, handing windfall returns to their initial
investors. Many Internet companies began life as venture
capital-funded startups before going on to become lucrative
household names.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Harvard's behemoth portfolio _ it is about
twice the size of Princeton's or Stanford's _ sought to invest 15
percent of its holdings in the world's top 10 venture capital
funds. (Harvard wants to buy only the leading funds). But with so
much competition among investors for a piece of that action, the
funds limit how much individual institutions can invest. The result
was that Harvard found itself with nearly a billion dollars it had
to place in non-venture capital investments just as its venture
capital benchmark took off, mostly on a rash of Internet initial
public offerings in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the endowment's private-equity section, which
includes venture capital, gained 29.2 percent last fiscal year,
about half its target of 56.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 27.7 percent.
Harvard does not compare itself against the common market measure,
which it says does not reflect the endowment's particular mix of
stocks, bonds, and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply have been unable to place as much money as we would
like with the top venture capital funds,'' said Harvard
Management's president, Jack R. Meyer. If the venture capital
benchmark ``continues to produce triple rates of return, things
will be difficult.'' Harvard Management has since scaled back
private-equity assets to 12 percent of its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lofty but unreached goals, the Cambridge institution
is still doing slightly better than the average university
endowment. The median performance of 100 large institutional funds,
including large-university endowments, was 11.2 percent for 12
months through June, according to the Trust Universe Comparison
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual among universities, Harvard manages just over two-thirds
of its portfolio internally, and farms out the rest to money
managers. Meyer said that nearly all the internal managers
outperformed their benchmarks, and that some ``external'' managers
at unnamed money management companies did not measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring broad downturns, the Cambridge institution's holdings
in emerging market stocks, commodities, and real estate also failed
to do as well as expected. Harvard's emerging markets assets, which
constitute 9 percent of the endowment's portfolio, gained only 3.8
percent last fiscal year, far below the 21 percent benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's money managers appear best at picking foreign stocks.
These shares, representing 15 percent of the university's
portfolio, rose 11.5 percent, nearly twice their target level.
Harvard has nearly one-quarter of its assets in US stocks, which
outperformed their benchmark of 21.3 percent by more than 4
percentage points. The gains were calculated after fees were paid
to Harvard's investment managers.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's endowment has done well in recent years. With a
five-year annualized return of 20.1 percent, in line with the
university's expectations, the portfolio is in the top 5 percent of
all institutional funds. For the previous fiscal period ended June
1998, Harvard's endowment rose 20.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Meyer ended his letter on a cautionary note, saying that
``the past five years have provided extraordinary returns _ returns
that we do not expect to persist.'' He said the portfolio could
have a negative return this year for the first time in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's endowment, which has had to worry about portfolio
manager defections in recent years, lost high-yield manager Tim
Peterson this month. Meyer said Harvard had placed $220 million in
Peterson's new Boston firm, Regiment Capital.

BAY STATE HOSPITALS STRIVING TO BECOME Y2K PROOF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite setbacks, Y2K prognosis is good, state's
hospitals say
</P>
<P>
   A survey released Tuesday has found that most Massachusetts
hospitals have yet to complete work that will ensure their
computers and automated medical equipment will perform normally
after the millennial date change.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, mailed July 27 to all Massachusetts hospitals, found
that only 49 percent of hospitals had finished upgrading biomedical
devices, 52 percent had contingency plans ready in the event power
and lights go out, and 68 percent had confidence in their phone and
voice-mail systems.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jacobsen, deputy commissioner at the Department of Public
Health, said the survey showed improvement from one carried out
last January. ``But I would say they have a long way to go,''
Jacobsen said. ``Hospitals have good reason to maintain quality of
care after January 1, and they're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Tuesday, officials at many hospitals said they had
finished their Y2K projects since the survey was done, or that they
were on schedule for completion in the next month or two.
</P>
<P>
   Some others said they were waiting for software upgrades from
manufacturers or had one or two devices left to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   For example, technicians at Massachusetts General Hospital are
expecting corrective software to fix a General Electric
electrocardiogram system, said James Noga, chief information
officer, ``and we will be installing it this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, all other vulnerable computers, elevators,
phone, heating and cooling, and other systems are ready for the
date change. ``That really leaves us focusing on contingency
planning,'' much of which is already in place because it's similar
to planning for large winter storms, said Noga.
</P>
<P>
   Like other industries, hospitals are heavily dependent on
computerized equipment and systems. Many older systems contained a
programming shortcut, leaving them potentially vulnerable to errors
or failure when the date changes from 1999 to 2000. Previously,
many programmers provided only for two-digit years, so that next
New Year's Day a computer might read 00 as 1900, and some
computer-containing devices could fail.
</P>
<P>
   The DPH can't directly regulate computer equipment at the
hospitals, but does, through its licensing function, have
responsibility for ensuring that the facilities maintain their
quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant DPH Commissioner Nancy Ridley said, ``We're very
pleased with the cooperation we've received from the hospitals''
and are confident that those not yet in compliance are working
diligently to be ready. Jacobsen said that DPH will ``hold their
feet to the fire'' with follow-up checks of hospitals that are
lagging.
</P>
<P>
   At Melrose-Wakefield Health Care, information services head
Scott Blanchett said that all life-critical medical equipment has
been checked and updated. ``I think we are going to be prepared for
whatever happens,'' he said. Several contingency plans have been
drawn up, he said, adding that ``our intent is to roll them out
during November and December _ we want them to be fresh in the
employees' minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson Hospital in Concord tested its contingency plan during
Hurricane Floyd's visit last week, said Charleen Sotolongo,
director of safety and security. As at other facilities, she said
that only a few medical devices remain to be upgraded as soon as
the software arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a number of hospital officials told the Globe they
were worried mostly about utilities, phone service, and other
external factors. That concern still exists, Y2K planners said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Testing of information systems is still in progress at Care
Group's hospitals, which include Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center and New England Baptist Hospital, said Dr. Alan Robbins,
head of Care Group's Y2K preparations. But none of those systems
has a role in health care or is critical to the hospitals'
functioning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As confident as they are that equipment will work normally when
the date changes, officials at Care Group are taking no chances,
said Robbins. ``We're going to have someone, literally, standing
next to every patient at 12:01'' on New Year's Day, he said.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ OK, sports fans, try this one on: A few years from
now you're watching a ballgame on your 10-foot High Definition
Television with 16-speaker Super Surround Sound but growing weary
of that constant center-field camera angle.
</P>
<P>
   So you push a button and now you're watching from the Catcher
Cam. Flick again and you're watching the manager's neck veins bulge
as his pitcher goes 3-0 to a .220 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you're watching the Masters, and instead of the network
feed, you'd rather take in Tiger Woods II's entire round. Or it's a
NASCAR race and you just as soon go in circles exclusively with the
in-car camera of Jeff Gordon, who now looks almost 30.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom ahead another 50 years and imagine donning some Michael
Crichton-inspired helmet and watching an NFL playoff game (sorry,
still no L.A. team) through a virtual-reality experience that keeps
making you want to duck.
</P>
<P>
   It could all happen. A new order awaits the world of sports and
not just in how we view it. The new millennium brings an eclectic
sports offering, and if much of it is uncertain, what it does
promise is there will be more of it.
</P>
<P>
   More teams, more specialty sports, more technology, more
commercialization, more TV influence, more global, and naturally,
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be everywhere anytime you want it and almost any
way you'd like it. There will be a sport for everyone. Some might
come with flashy whiz-bang gizmos, some won't change a lick, some
might be pushed aside by the latest and greatest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to keep getting overspecialized and be more like
`Rollerball' _ a more violent and unpredictable society, and more
schizophrenic society,'' said former major-league pitcher Bill
``Spaceman'' Lee. ``Not really your agrarian vegetarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that meat eaters don't need sports, too. As it is, baseball,
basketball and football might remain the three most popular sports
in the U.S., but they have been getting squeezed for the past 20
years, bombarded by sports no longer satisfied with some one-line
mention in the roundup sections of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the next century, new sports will continue to multiply and
flourish. Fashions change, at least on the periphery. The continued
specialization of cable channels only opens additional entrees for
every sport this side of the ``Geraldo Lawn Bowling Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal Pilson, whose Pilson Communications in New York is a TV
sports consultant company that includes such clients as NASCAR, the
Arena Football League and the LPGA, is the former president of CBS
sports. And he's bullish on the continued growth of sports in the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make an argument that in the next century we will be
in a 1,500-channel universe,'' Pilson said. ``I could make an
argument that the major sports properties in the 1,500-channel
universe will remain unchanged because of the unique nature of the
event. There is only one World Series. There is only one Super
Bowl. There is only one NFL, one NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you have it, your 1,499 competitors won't. There are
really no other distinguishing programming properties similar to
sports. Everyone has movies. Everyone has news. Everyone has sports
news. Everyone can create entertainment series and specials. But
the unique nature of a sports event distinguishes your distribution
service from everyone else's, makes it special. Sports will
continue to give you that unique opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear. Sports are not going away, they just figure to
mushroom out all over the place. Not that there won't be plenty of
changes. &QL; 
TECHNO FREAKS UNITE &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Technology and the Internet will continue their growing
influence on the way we view sports, if not play them. Pilson can
see the remote that customizes your TV viewing in the
not-so-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have more and more opportunities to select our
viewing platform, to watch from unique perspectives, whether it's
camera locations or special advantages not available to the
spectator,'' Pilson said. ``We're going to see more participants
being miked. You'll get more audio out of sports events _ find out
what the pitcher said to the catcher, what the quarterback said in
the huddle, what the manager or coach are saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to find you will be even closer to the event
itself, and given the opportunities that will be available with
digital television and the compression of signals, you'll be able
to select how you watch sports events, rather than in the past
being dictated to by the director who sits in the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you might learn a new appreciation for the guy in
the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual reality and entertainment _ which just underwent an odd
research marriage with the Pentagon at USC _ already has sports
imaginations flying.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Prazmark is the senior vice president for new business
development at International Management Group, the largest sports
and event marketing group in the world, and is already toying with
the idea of virtual-reality sports viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very interesting,'' Prazmark said. ``I want to do a
sales presentation where, let's say, I'm selling the Olympic Games.
I want to bring them in a presentation theater and have them do
virtual-reality experience as if they're going down the luge or
walking through the sponsor village. And we're pretty close to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee thinks that would offer a definite upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``For fans who (complain) and moan about guys swinging at a bad
pitch, have him stay in there and look slider low and away from
Clemens, and then have him throw one right at his ear,'' Lee said.
``He'd get the feeling. It's called the Tony Conigliaro effect.''
</P>
<P>
   David Carter, who teaches the business of sports at USC and owns
a sports-marketing company in Los Angeles, said the most immediate
technological impact on sports might be the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech component, the Internet in particular, is going
to be critical because it is largely untapped in terms of selling
broadcast rights over your computer, to getting a better handle on
how to maximize the amount of merchandise you can sell over these
different sites,'' Carter said. ``Players themselves may
increasingly not want to be part of their own league deals, if they
can create their own Web sites and sell merchandise directly.''
</P>
<P>
   HDTV is already on its way, offering a particular advantage to
viewing sports. Jeff Shell, president of Fox Sports Networks, saw a
recent HDTV demonstration in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to be just wowed by the crystal-clear image, which
was very impressive and made you feel like you were almost there,''
Shell said. ``But what was really interesting about the HDTV stuff
was that because the picture is much wider and longer, when you're
watching a basketball game, you don't have to keep moving the
camera around. You can see the whole half court. You can see the
plays developing, players cutting, and not just focusing on the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell, though, sees the future offering options, not necessarily
a life-style change for the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is, it's not going to completely effect the way
people watch sports if they're not at the game,'' he said. ``I
think people still want to sit down on their couch, grab a beer and
watch the game if they can't get out to the park.'' &QL; 
YEAH, IT'S A SMALL WORLD &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And shrinking by your DSL micro-second. Sports increasingly
reach out across the globe. In a digitalized, Internet, satellite
world, all things seem possible. And sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think five years from now, if you're a cricket fanatic and
you're sitting here in the United States and there's a live match
in India, you could turn on your computer and find that cricket
match on your TV in real time and in imagery that we're used to,''
Prazmark said. ``You're going to be able to span the globe for the
sport you want.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. professional leagues, too, have been flirting with reaching
out beyond the northern border. The NFL has a league in Europe. The
NBA plays a game in Japan. The San Diego Padres have played in
Mexico. The Chicago Cubs and New York Mets are set to play in Japan
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we've done about as much as we can with the
local markets,'' said Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros, who has
his own Web site. ``In the last 10 years the local markets have
been exploited a lot more than in the past. How much more can you
do? I think the next logical step is global.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel time, however, is still extensive across the Pacific and
Atlantic, and it's difficult to imagine the Lakers making regular
trips to Europe. The future calls, but that Star Trek ``energize''
thing is not in the offering.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean there isn't some kind of international pro
competition looming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we may find is that the teams are not involved in
league play, but down the road an NBA division or an NHL division
may be located in Europe,'' Pilson said. ``And while they might not
play the U.S. and Canadian teams on a regular basis, they might be
one of six divisions that participate in the Stanley Cup or the NBA
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, of course, has his own unique slant on the future of global
sports. Sort of John Lennon meets Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a complete world market, with no flags, no borders, no
bounderies, no federal governments _ just local governments, kind
of a Machiavellian city-state _ where the marketplace dictates
everything without military involvement,'' Lee said. ``I see more
of a utopian game, with nice parks and natural grass and no foul
territory, no designated hitter, wood bats in Little League. It all
hinges on getting rid of all your flags.'' &QL; 
THE LATEST AND GREATEST &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So what will we all be watching in this shrunken world? Lee's
``Rollerball,'' the James Caan movie of a corporate-run sports
world where international cities compete in a violent game that
denounces individuality? Will soccer finally have its day in the
U.S.? Will a minor sport now become big, or a new sport emerge that
captures the national imagination? What's next?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the WWF,'' Lee said. ``More people watch junk.
`Never underestimate the ignorance of the American public' _ P.T.
Barnum. You know? Hell, everything's gotten that way. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Most agree with Pilson, that it will be difficult for any new
sport to challenge the existing sports dominating the national
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see it, but who's to say everybody won't be playing
soccer 25 years from now,'' said Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn.
``Who's to say that football will still be looked upon as it is
now? Who knows, pool might become the sport of 2025. Ping-Pong,
tennis maybe. X-Games _ now that I can't watch.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's Carter said if there's a perceived market for those who
follow any new sport, however unique, it has a chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable channels essentially have cable channels of their own
now,'' he said. ``As that happens, the audiences reached by those
channels _ like the Golf Channel, Classic Sports _ might become
smaller, but they also might become demographically more desirable.
They might be delivering to advertisers and sponsors a tighter
group of desired viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, there's room for everybody. Each in his own little sporting
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   David Simon, president of the Los Angeles Sports Council, said
growing immigration means an increased diversity of U.S. sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this community, immigration has had a tremendous impact on
sports,'' Simon said. ``Soccer is the most noticeable example, but
it's not the only one. Another that doesn't get talked about very
much is badminton. Southern California is a hotbed of badminton
because it is especially popular in a handful of Asian countries,
and we have a lot of people here who come from those counries. It
is the national sport in Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sport rising in popularity today can quickly become
passe tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at beach volleyball,'' Karros said. ``Four or five years
ago, that was a hot thing. Guys were making a hundred grand, you
had rival leagues. I mean, it was big. You had coverage on NBC. Now
it kind of ran its course.'' &QL; 
WHEN IS ENOUGH ENOUGH? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At some point, can it become sports overload? Is there a
saturation level waiting on the sporting horizon? How fragmented
can sports continue to become?
</P>
<P>
   Carter said a saturation level will only be reached in sports
when advertisers feel they're no longer getting enough bang for
their buck. Pilson said don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we've seen so far would appear to indicate a
saturation level,'' Pilson said. ``America's love affair with
sports and sports properties doesn't show any signs of abatement.
Teams come and go. Some teams do better than others. It's a cylical
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't see the NBA or the NHL or NFL or major-league
baseball going out of business because people decide they want to
go jogging or ride a bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   How specific can we continue to develop? Can the NASCAR Channel
be far off? Is there room for the badminton hour, the cricket
marathon, the women's-sports channel, the world Poke'mon playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Listen up: Money rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's women's sports, amateur sports or other types of
professional men's leagues just emerging _ like Arena football _
unless the networks and the corporations believe they have a
coveted demographic audience, whether it's on TV or the Internet or
reading in the papers, then it's not going to be worth their
time,'' Carter said. &QL; 
BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A SLEEVE? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For now, advertisers continue to flow into sports, into those
unique marketing opportunities, like some never-ending money
fountain. Every event now seems sponsored. Arenas, stadiums and
ballparks without a corporate name are becoming the exception.
Luxury boxes are reinventing the looks and priorities of our
stadiums. Advertising signage is squeezed into more spots at
venues, into more corners of the TV screen. Baseball is talking
about letting some advertising slip onto uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to look like a NASCAR driver and that ain't
too good,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   But Prazmark said companies could grow weary of shelling out
millions to advertise events, when they might be able to just own
the entire show.
</P>
<P>
   And then reap some of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the business of sport will change,'' he said. ``I
believe corporations will want to truly become partners with these
events and not renters of signage and buying some tickets. The big
corporations will want to begin to create and fund their own events
and also use their marketing expertise to build a business out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing commericalization of sports, a visit to the
ballpark continues to take a growing hunk out of the wallet. And
it's not just the common fan who notices rising prices at sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're kind of forced into the new sports, just
because how pricey the existing sports are,'' Gwynn said. ``When I
came to Dodger Stadium with my dad and brother, it was 50 cents for
us under-12 guys to sit in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy season tickets in San Diego behind home plate, and
they're $125 a game. I shell out some hefty coin to get my season
tickets, so I can only imagine the average fan coming to the
ballpark and paying $6 for parking, tickets for a family of four,
hot dogs, popcorn, peanuts, soda _ man, that's a C-note to come to
the game. And the way the game is going, 25 years from now that
could be two, three hundred dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports in the future figure to come with a price.

SUMMATIONS OFFERED IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost a year after it began, the Microsoft
antitrust trial wound to a close Tuesday with final arguments from
lawyers for the company and the government that ranged from
scornful to contemptuous of the other side's case.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, at dusk Tuesday evening, Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson said simply, ``Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted,''
as he rose from the bench and marched unceremoniously from the
packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, probably before Thanksgiving, Jackson is
expected to issue his findings of fact, a first brush at a verdict
that sets out which version of events, the Microsoft Corp.'s or the
government's, he takes to be closest to the truth. A verdict should
come a few weeks after that.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, two government lawyers argued that Microsoft
was guilty of every charge and that the Justice Department's case
against the company was strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your honor, the overwhelming weight of evidence in this case
establishes not just that Microsoft has substantial monopoly power
but that Microsoft has wielded its power to the detriment of
consumers,'' said Stephen Houck, the lead lawyer for the 19 states
that joined the Justice Department in the antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market remains structured as it is,'' he added,
``Microsoft will retain both the means and the incentive to do what
it's done for many years now _ to restrict consumer choice, to
raise prices and to stifle innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Microsoft's lead lawyer, John Warden, variously
characterized the government's case as ``specious,'' ``fiction,''
``fantasy,'' ``silly'' and ``pure baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any extraordinary relief requires an extraordinary showing of
evidence,'' he asserted, ``and hearsay, semantic games and
accusations of deals that were never consummated does not stand as
an extraordinary showing.''
</P>
<P>
   No new evidence could be introduced in closing arguments; the
lawyers could only summarize and repackage evidence they had
already presented during the long trial.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers believe that their strongest hand is the
copious documentary evidence they subpoenaed from Microsoft:
thousands of e-mail messages and other internal corporate records
from the last five years. Tuesday, David Boies, the lead lawyer for
the Justice Department, repeatedly exhorted the judge to ignore
what Boies portrayed as revisionist explanations Microsoft had
offered in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the court considers its findings,'' he said, ``I urge the
court to look at the contemporary records. Look at what they were
saying at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That record, he said, clearly supports the government's central
allegation, that Microsoft chose to merge its Web browser into its
Windows operating system as a means of crushing its chief
competitor in the browser business, the Netscape Communications
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft argues that they're doing this to improve Windows,''
he said. ``I urge your honor to look at the documents. They're not
saying they're tying these two things together so they'll sell more
Windows. No, they are using Windows'' to put Netscape at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   When computer manufacturers complained that they did not want a
bundled browser with Windows, Boies recounted from testimony,
Microsoft countered that the manufacturers could not hide or remove
Microsoft's browser because the company ``wanted to protect the
Windows experience.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he added, ``They were trying to throw some kind of
patina over what they were really trying to do: stop distribution
of competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Running through most of the government's allegations, Boies
repeatedly contrasted the Microsoft lawyers' explanations in court
with contemporaneous internal discussions laid out in the Microsoft
documents, arguing that they were at variance or directly
conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, trying to show that Microsoft is not a
monopolist, the company's lawyers argued that other companies could
unseat Microsoft at any time. But Boies showed statements in which
Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said he did not think those
threats were real.
</P>
<P>
   The government, as part of its presentation Tuesday, also played
parts of Gates' videotaped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came, Warden argued that nearly all the
government's witnesses were either paid experts or representatives
of Microsoft competitors, companies that had ``lobbied the
government for the chance to appear.'' Too often Warden asserted,
``these witnesses said one thing here in court and then did
something quite different in the marketplace.'' He called the
government's documentary evidence ``marginal e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Boies' repeated success at humiliating Microsoft's
witnesses in court early this year, Warden said: ``It did win the
rapt attention of the gallery, but in the real world it is clear
that the government has failed to make its case. There are
astounding failures of proof and glaring inconsistencies from the
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly directed the judge's attention to a Court of
Appeals ruling in June 1998 that Microsoft had the right to
integrate a browser with Windows if the integration benefitted
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   He held out his harshest criticism for Edward W. Felten, a
Princeton University computer scientist who served as a government
witness and professed to be able to pull the browser out of Windows
without damaging the performance of the operating system. This was
an attempt to disprove Microsoft's assertion that the browser had
been so thoroughly integrated into Windows that neither would work
any longer without the other.
</P>
<P>
   Felten sat in the courtroom with several of his students Tuesday
afternoon as Warden called his testimony ``a shame, the crudest
form of sleight of hand, a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden dismissed the government's many-layered argument that
Microsoft holds a monopoly in personal computer operating systems
by saying ``If there is no commercially viable alternative to
Windows 98, then it's because there is not demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to one possible remedy should Microsoft be found guilty
_ giving the government a role in product development _ he said,
``I think all of us agree that central planning is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In his rebuttal, Boies took up that line and said, ``I agree
that central planning is bad.'' The judge then allowed that he,
too, opposed ``central planning.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Boies added, ``Central planning is bad _ by
governments, and by monopolies.''

BOSTON'S MILLENNIUM TO PLAY OUT IN GREENWICH TIME 
</HEADLINE>

 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fireworks will explode, bands will play, couples will
kiss, and champagne corks will fly.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston this New Year's Eve, the city will greet the year
2000 not at midnight, but five hours earlier, at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement timed to mark the countdown to the new
century, which is 100 days from today (Sept. 22), city officials
say they have decided to start ringing in the New Year when it
arrives in Greenwich, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be marking the millennium when it's midnight in
Greenwich, according to Greenwich Mean Time, which is the
universally accepted standard of time for the world,'' Mayor Thomas
M. Menino said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement may sound quirky and could be controversial.
</P>
<P>
   But it means Boston will be the first city in the nation to
celebrate the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It means that children, who will be leaders in the new
millennium, can join in the festivities and get home before
bedtime, Menino said.
</P>
<P>
   Planners do not appear concerned that the early party could
reinforce a perception that the city shuts down unfashionably
early.
</P>
<P>
   They expect about 2 million to attend First Night, about 500,000
more than in previous years. The city will continue entertainment
between the first countdown and the more traditional one.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the celebration starting early, citizens panicky about
possible Y2K computer system crashes, electric grid failures, or
runs on banks and food supplies can ``return to the comfort and
safety of their own homes before midnight,'' said David Mugar,
chairman and executive producer of millennial events for Boston
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mugar stressed that city officials think there's no need for
alarm. ``We don't believe there will be more than a few minor
computer glitches,'' he said. ``But if people are apprehensive,
this gives them a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for First Night's 5:30 p.m. Grand Parade down
Boylston and Charles streets to culminate at Boston Common. Just
before 6:59 p.m., the mayor and some children from Boston's
neighborhoods will light a sterling silver replica of Paul Revere's
lantern, ``symbolizing Boston's leadership role as a beacon of
freedom in the new millennium,'' Menino said.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-second countdown will commence at 6:59 and at 7 p.m.,
midnight in England, a huge Jumbotron television screen on the
Common will broadcast the scene live from Greenwich, England, and
other countries in the first time zone, as they welcome the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, there will be 15 minutes of fireworks from the
Common, the site of the first fireworks shows when First Night
began 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Night owls should not despair. An additional fireworks display
will occur as usual over Boston Harbor at midnight Boston time,
preceded by a two-hour Boston Pops concert.
</P>
<P>
   Planners acknowledge that many revelers may ignore the official
early start and toot their party horns at midnight Boston time.
</P>
<P>
   But the 7 p.m. event gives families an opportunity to celebrate
``at the exact time considered the offical international turning
point of the millennium,'' said Michael Taylor, president of Boston
2000.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, Greenwich Mean Time has been the
world's official clock.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, most towns around the world kept their own local
time using sundials. Noon was the time when the sun passed directly
overhead. This worked pretty well until the development of railways
in the mid-19th century. With most towns having their own time,
arranging timetables became a scheduler's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1884, representatives of 25 countries gathered in
Washington to create a standardized system. They decided to fix one
line, which would be 0 degrees longitude, running from the North
Pole to the South Pole. Every country could then establish its
position relative to that meridian.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable debate, the delegates chose the meridian that
passed through the main telescope at the Royal Observatory in
Greenwich, England. They opted for Greenwich because the
observatory's astronomers, by tracking the movements of heavenly
bodies, had played a key role in early navigation and timekeeping
at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Time zones were created at uniform distances from this line,
with the first time zone using what became known as Greenwich Mean
Time.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Observatory was moved from Greenwich to Herstmonceux
in 1948 and in 1990 it moved again to Cambridge, England, where it
is now. But the prime meridian, as it is known, still passes
through Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Boston is the only city in the United States to
announce that it will celebrate the new millennium when it arrives
in Greenwich. But its festivities will be coordinated with
ceremonies in the United Kingdom, Iceland, the Ivory Coast,
Portugal, Ghana, Mali, Morocco, and other countries in the world's
first time zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making this an international celebration, which is
appropriate since we're a city of immigrants,'' Taylor said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For their season that opens on Friday at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music, Robert Spano and the Brooklyn Philharmonic have
put together a set of programs to survey the 20th century from the
vantage point of its end.
</P>
<P>
   This is a 20th-century season in two ways: not only does all the
music come from the last hundred years, but the planning has a very
20th-century feel. Spano and his orchestra are concerned less with
great composers than with great themes _ war, politics, pop
culture, the environment, faith _ and there is no attempt to see
that all the outstanding creative personalities are represented.
Even Stravinsky, the century's musical giant, is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   An approach based on ideas and influences, rather than artists,
works well for 20th-century music, because so few composers have
been able, or wanted, to avoid winds of thought and feeling blowing
in from right outside their art. If one wanted to assemble thematic
programs of 19th-century music, it might be hard to find evidence
of, say, industrialization, widening democracy and the growth of
science, though it would be interesting to try.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks above all, perhaps, to increased communications,
composers in the 20th century have generally lived less separate
lives.
</P>
<P>
   War, in particular, has struck many, and the first Brooklyn
program focuses, almost inevitably, on World War II, which _ not to
underestimate its other effects _ disrupted the careers of most
leading European composers and left the United States a major
musical power, strengthened by the presence of so many
distinguished immigrants and a new self-confidence among native
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Bartok wrote his Divertimento for a performance in Switzerland
in 1939, when there was no chance of his getting a new work played
in the musical heartland of Germany and Austria. Richard Strauss'
``Metamorphosen'' was a response to the bombed German cities of
1945. That both scores are for strings is partly an accident: they
were both written for a string orchestra directed by the patron
Paul Sacher.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the string-ensemble medium allowed
these composers to reflect on war in ways that were, whether ironic
or tragic, distanced from noisy militarism.
</P>
<P>
   The third work in this war concert _ Shostakovich's Chamber
Symphony, an adaptation of the composer's Eighth String Quartet by
the conductor Rudolf Barshai _ comes from 1960, a time when the war
was cold. (If Stravinsky had been admitted, a pairing of his almost
contemporary ``Movements'' with the Shostakovich might have said a
lot about artistic contradictions across the Iron Curtain.)
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich offers a prime example, too, of a composer affected
by politics, though the Brooklyn choice for that theme _ John
Adams' opera ``Nixon in China,'' to be performed in concert in
early December _ is equally interesting. Alice Goodman's libretto
gives voice to the world leaders of 1972 _ Nixon and Henry
Kissinger; Mao and his wife; Chou En-lai _ but what they engage in
is all small talk and personal reminiscence, bobbing along on the
grand sweep of time that is conveyed by the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon sings of making history, but really, history is making
him. We are a long way here from the heroic deeds and majestic
self-assertion of kings and princes in operas by Handel or Verdi.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Shostakovich's music looks forward from the first
concert to the subject of the second, so Adams' opera anticipates
the Brooklyn Philharmonic's next theme: popular culture. Adams,
like many composers in the classical tradition who have grown up
since World War II, found something he wanted in rock and pop, but
the third Brooklyn concert, in February, will skip back to
musicians influenced by jazz (Kurt Weill and Conlon Nancarrow),
tango (Astor Piazzolla) or the movies (Toru Takemitsu).
</P>
<P>
   This looks like the most heterogeneous mixture. The dissonant
feelings for jazz shown in Weill's ``New Orpheus'' _ optimistic and
anxious, embracing and eschewing _ are perhaps characteristic of a
European reaction in the 1920s and '30s, whereas Nancarrow's
joyful, zestful exploration of jazz motifs and rhythmic
complexities is more typical of an American and of a later time:
the orchestra will perform some of his player-piano studies of the
'50s, in realizations by Yvar Mikhashoff.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside all this come Piazzolla's Concerto for Guitar and
Accordion and three film scenes scored by Takemitsu. But maybe the
jostle is pop culture's, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, comes a look at how a composer's music might be
shaped by the environment: specifically, the Finnish environment of
lakes and forests, of wide horizontals, of white, gray and green,
of long winters and sudden springs. &QL; 
Sibelius' Fifth Symphony is the big work, preceded by pieces from
living Finnish composers: Magnus Lindberg, Aulis Sallinen and
Einojuhani Rautavaara.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pity that Kaija Saariaho was not included (there are,
indeed, no women composers in the series), but the concert offers a
rare chance to hear Rautavaara's classic ``Cantus Arcticus,'' a
concerto for recorded bird songs and live orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   More birds will be heard in May, but now from the orchestra,
when David Wilson-Johnson and Heidi Grant Murphy sing three scenes
from Messiaen's opera ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' ending the series
on notes of conviction, openness and hope. And perhaps, after all,
the season will show that what will be remembered from the 20th
century, as from the 19th, will not be the themes but the
individual voices: Bartok's furious and vigorous, Nancarrow's
crazily mechanized, Messiaen's resplendent.

MEDICARE HMOS TO END FREE DRUGS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Del.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Tuesday that health
maintenance organizations would no longer provide free drug
coverage to any Medicare recipients next year, and White House
officials expressed alarm about the trend toward fewer benefits and
higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many HMOs attracted elderly and disabled patients
by offering prescription drugs at no charge. But in a new report,
to be issued on Wednesday, the White House says that all Medicare
HMOs offering drug coverage will charge co-payments for the
medicines next year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it says, more than 1.2 million Medicare
beneficiaries who now have access to free drugs will have to make
co-payments, and many more will have to pay higher premiums for
such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Co-payments for brand-name drugs will rise an average of 21
percent, while co-payments for the generic versions of such drugs
will rise 8 percent, the White House said. Co-payments now
typically range from $5 to $20 a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore plans to highlight the trend in a speech
here on Wednesday to the American Medical Association, saying it
shows that Congress should approve Clinton's proposal to guarantee
coverage of prescription drugs in both Medicare HMOs and the
original fee-for-service Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families that depend on Medicare cannot depend on their HMOs
to deliver the affordable critical benefits that enticed them to
choose an HMO in the first place,'' Gore says in remarks prepared
for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the speech and the report were obtained Tuesday by
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.3 million of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are
in health maintenance organizations. But, the White House says,
recent trends have undermined confidence in these health plans, as
many HMOs have decided to pull out of Medicare or reduce the areas
they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers say the government should increase payments to
them, or they will drop even more of the drug benefits they now
provide voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, which represents HMOs, said: ``President Clinton is
proposing new prescription drug benefits on the one hand while
promoting policies that erode existing benefits on the other. The
first order of business should be to make sure no beneficiaries
lose the benefits they currently have.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House report suggests that elderly people cannot
depend on HMOs for generous benefits. ``More managed-care plans are
charging Medicare beneficiaries higher co-payments for prescription
drugs,'' it says. ``In 2000, no Medicare beneficiaries will have
access to a prescription drug benefit without any co-payments. In
1999, however, over 1.2 million Medicare beneficiaries had access
to a prescription drug benefit where there are no co-payments.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, Medicare officials contended that the
cutbacks by HMOs were just routine business decisions. Lawmakers
from both parties, deluged with complaints from constituents, say
the officials misjudged the severity of the problem and its
political implications.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people enrolled in Medicare HMOs are expected to hold
a rally on Wednesday at the Capitol, where they will plead with
Congress to pump money into the program so they can keep their
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The White House report documents what Gore describes as
troubling trends:
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs have reduced coverage for prescription drugs used by
Medicare beneficiaries. This year 21 percent of Medicare plans
limit drug coverage to $500 or less. But next year 32 percent of
Medicare HMOs will have such limits.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of beneficiaries who have access only to the most
expensive HMOs _ those with annual premiums of $960 or more _ will
quadruple, to 207,000 next year, from 50,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some states, like Iowa and Delaware, will see ``a substantial
decrease in the number of beneficiaries'' who have access to drug
coverage through Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, drug coverage will still be available, but at
much higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare program generally does not pay for drugs outside
the hospital. Medicare HMOs are not required to offer drug
benefits, and the government does not pay them for such benefits,
even though patients have come to expect them.
</P>

US PLAYERS IN TALKATIVE MOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON AND JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ With the start of the 33d Ryder Cup closing
in, the Americans were in a talkative mood Tuesday. Almost all of
it was business-related.
</P>
<P>
   You had David Duval talking about playing on a team ``with 11
personalties.'' Tiger Woods needed a history lesson when he said
Jack Nicklaus had a losing record in the Ryder Cup (actually
17-8-3), and Jim Furyk stating that ``if I knew for sure we weren't
going to win, I wouldn't play at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the normally taciturn Jeff Maggert offering this
food for thought on the possible matchups. ``Let's face it. We've
got the 12 best players in the world and if they just go out and
play golf and hit golf shots, it's hard to mess up putting two guys
together.''
</P>
<P>
   When Duval was asked about team chemistry, he responded, ``I
think that's where we've got a big advantage. We only have 11
people with personalities on our team. So you only have to get 11
people to get along together.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, this is a chance for redemption after his 1-3-1
record two years ago at Valderrama. ``I really didn't know all the
guys on the team that well,'' he said. `I didn't know their wives,
didn't know their girlfriends, their kids. This year it's
different. I know everybody on the team. It's a big difference. It
makes you feel a little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Love looks sound
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there was any question about the health of Davis Love III, it
seemed to be answered during Tuesday's practice round. Paired with
Tom Lehman, Steve Pate, and Justin Leonard, Love appeared to be
swinging free and easy. He took good rips at several drives and
when faced with a testy, long bunker shot at the underrated eighth
hole, Love executed it perfectly. His sore neck and back appear
fine after taking a lengthy break prior to arriving in Brookline.
That's bad news for Bob Estes, who finished 11th in the Ryder Cup
point standings and would have been Love's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sutton back after 12 years &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, who once said he might forgo another Ryder Cup
opportunity because of abuse from the gallery that drove his former
wife to tears, is back after 12 years. ``It's changed a lot in
those 12 years,'' he said. ``When you drive into the gate, you see
all the tents. I heard there's 4,000 volunteers here this week. It
would take me awhile to tell you about all the things I've noticed
just in the first 45 minutes here. It's pretty interesting to see
where the Ryder Cup has come from and where it is today.'' . . .
Leonard, winner of the 1997 British Open, noted The Country Club is
similar to a US Open course. ``It's a little different from the way
the USGA would set it up,'' he said. ``We want to go out there and
make birdies to win holes. That's what people enjoy watching. In
general, the rough's not going to be eight inches deep. Guys are
able to take chances. It should provide for some pretty aggressive
play.''

AMERICA'S THEME PARK JUST PART OF JONES' DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dedicated this
season to remembering the past.
</P>
<P>
   And rightfully so. Few organizations have had a greater first 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake Jones' nostalgia for contentment.
</P>
<P>
   While looking back, Jones is also considering major changes in
the future with a franchise icon: Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Cowboys' lease at Texas Stadium doesn't expire until
2008, Jones said it's not too early to start thinking about a new
home because it takes five or six years to build a stadium. That
could be a new stadium in a new location like Arlington or that
could be a renovated Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that the current building has gone from state
of the art to obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this juncture we've got 17 new or renovated stadiums in the
NFL with several more on the drawing board,'' Jones said. ``The
facts are that Texas Stadium will be one of five or six stadiums
that haven't had major renovations.''
</P>
<P>
   Already mindful of state legislation that paved the way for two
new stadiums in Houston, Jones is also paying attention to Dallas'
Olympic bid. A Cowboys representative attends every meeting of the
Dallas 2012 committee, for, as Jones concedes, ``the Olympic thing
is something that has be considered for a venue like this, and we
need to see where it fits in the Olympic plan.''
</P>
<P>
   You see, Jones is not looking for a simple Texas Stadium
face-lift. He's talking about a tummy tuck, liposuction and colored
contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have the very best stadium in sports, and that's what I
want,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   What Jones wants is Jerry's World: a 100,000-seat stadium with a
retractable dome, and a theme park. The extra seats and the dome
would guarantee a Super Bowl would be played there. The theme park
is Jones' answer to Six Flags Over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have a 350-day-a-year destination point, not a place
that plays 10 or 11 games a year and makes do on the other days,''
Jones said. ``We can be the focal point of Texas and the focal
point of sports. It's the idea of having a place themed toward
sports and the activities of sports. We want to have different
activities that people can come on Tuesday in June and enjoy as
much as they can on Sunday in November. That's my goal.'' Honoring
the past and dreaming for the future, Jones is still Jones. Put Tex
in This message is for Jerry Jones. It's time to bring former
Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm back into the fold. What better
way to commemorate the franchise's 40-year anniversary than by
putting the man who helped start] it all into the Ring of Honor.
More than one former player noted that it was nice to see Schramm
at the team's official anniversary reception Sunday _ though they
also acknowledged that Schramm didn't look good, health-wise. Jones
should do the right thing and honor Schramm for what he's meant to
the franchise while Schramm can still appreciate it. Red Rock's
future Get one thing straight about last week's signing of fullback
Tim Lester to replace injured starter Daryl Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   Lester is the Cowboys' fullback for now. Robert Thomas, who was
moved from linebacker to fullback in training camp, is the Cowboys'
fullback of the future.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the word from Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who
says he's excited about the 6-foot-1, 260-pound Thomas' potential
as a fullback. The former Henderson State star certainly has the
size, decent speed and bulldog-like tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Thomas is passionate about the game and
succeeding in it. Thomas started out as the longest of long shots.
He was undrafted out of college and he has endured stints in the
Canadian Football League and NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is here because he refused to give up on his dream to
play in the NFL. The Cowboys know if he takes that same
perseverance while learning his new position, they have a fullback
of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Talking Moose
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after being sidelined for the season and
possibly his career with another neck injury, Johnston was on the
sideline with his teammates Monday. He said he plans to stay around
to lend moral support and guidance to his fellow fullbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised, however, if Johnston leaves the sidelines
for a radio booth in the near future. KVIL play-by-play man Brad
Sham has approached Johnston about joining him and Babe Laufenberg
on the Cowboys' broadcasts. Prime Time ballet Ever wonder why
cornerback Deion Sanders went to Dr. Bill Hamilton for his toe
surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is considered the leading authority on sports-related
toe injuries, and he is the doctor of choice for the nation's top
ballet dancers.
</P>
<P>
   No Deion-hits-like-a-ballerina jokes, please.

JORDAN TEES IT UP _ BUT ON NANTUCKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds, in third graf, speculation on whereabouts   late in day.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The Ryder Cup, also known as the Where's
Jordan Jubilee, moved into its second day Tuesday with former NBA
icon Michael Jordan not to be spotted among the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was nearby, and he was on a golf course, but he wasn't on
the Massachusetts mainland. For the second straight day, he teed it
up with friends at the tony Nantucket Golf Club, the same course he
played Monday with ex-NHL great Mario Lemieux, former Pittsburgh
Penguin Dan Quinn, and Mike Eruzione, the former Boston University
Terrier who captained Team USA's hockey gold medal triumph at the
1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was rumored to be headed back to Brookline late last
night, accompanied by friends, increasing the possibility that he
could be seen at The Country Club Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, along the fairways here at The Country Club, the most
often heard question among the spectators was, ``Have you seen
Michael?'' Tiger Woods is all the rage on the course, but that's
only inside the ropes. The biggest buzz of the tournament could
come when MJ hits the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is believed to have rented a home bordering the course
through the tournament's final matches Sunday. Just where that
house is, and just how much of a ransom Jordan shelled out to rent
it this week, remains speculation. The latest rumor had Jordan
occupying a beige, two-story colonial, with Victorian touches,
located just behind the course's International Pavilion adjacent to
the No. 2 tee box.
</P>
<P>
   However, a young man who answered the door at 195 Newton Street,
with its backyard abutting the International Pavilion, denied
Jordan would be staying there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``this is a private residence. He is on the
street, though, from what I hear. I wish he was staying here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan golfed all the courses he was rumored to play, he
would be one tired hacker. Varying reports had His Airness teeing
it up at Wannamoisett in Rumford, R.I., Farm Neck on Martha's
Vineyard (a Bill Clinton favorite), and both Brae Burn and Charles
River in Newton. Spokesmen for all four noted courses said Jordan
had not golfed there Tuesday and there were no plans for him to
play there later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan played in a traveling Nantucket foursome Monday,
accompained by Lemieux (new owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins),
Quinn, and Eruzione. They opened with nine holes at Sankaty Head,
which was being aerated, and then moved on to play a full loop at
nearby Nantucket Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some notification that (Jordan) was coming out,'' said
Mark Heartfield, the pro at Sankaty Head. ``I believe that Mario
Lemieux is a member at Oakmont in Pittsburgh and the pro there, Bob
Ford, called here and asked if they could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Word around Sankaty Head was that Jordan shot 37, 1 over par, on
the front nine before moving on to the next course.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with Jordan's plans for later this week said
the retired superstar will host a party at his rented home for
members of both Ryder Cup squads. Two other retired icons, former
NHL star Wayne Gretzky and ex-Denver Bronco John Elway, are
expected to attend. The crowds along the fairways could hold more
famous faces than the fairways themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, US Ryder Cup star Tiger Woods said he
spoke with Jordan Monday night. Jordan played for the US Dream Team
that won the basketball gold medal at the 1984 and '92 Olympics _ a
tournament with an international profile akin to the Ryder Cup _
but Woods said he didn't trade tournament comparisons with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of talked about what he's doing and just kind of
shooting the breeze,'' said Woods. ``That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice resumes bright and early Wednesday and the real stuff
begins Friday. Until then, the Where's Jordan Jubilee continues.

   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Tuesday that health
maintenance organizations would no longer provide free drug
coverage to any Medicare recipients next year, and White House
officials expressed alarm about the trend toward fewer benefits and
higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many HMOs attracted elderly and disabled patients
by offering prescription drugs at no charge. But in a new report,
to be issued on Wednesday, the White House says that all Medicare
HMOs offering drug coverage will charge co-payments for the
medicines next year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it says, more than 1.2 million Medicare
beneficiaries who now have access to free drugs will have to make
co-payments, and many more will have to pay higher premiums for
such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Co-payments for brand-name drugs will rise an average of 21
percent, while co-payments for the generic versions of such drugs
will rise 8 percent, the White House said. Co-payments now
typically range from $5 to $20 a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore plans to highlight the trend in a speech
here on Wednesday to the American Medical Association, saying it
shows that Congress should approve Clinton's proposal to guarantee
coverage of prescription drugs in both Medicare HMOs and the
original fee-for-service Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families that depend on Medicare cannot depend on their HMOs
to deliver the affordable critical benefits that enticed them to
choose an HMO in the first place,'' Gore says in remarks prepared
for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the speech and the report were obtained Tuesday by
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.3 million of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are
in health maintenance organizations. But, the White House says,
recent trends have undermined confidence in these health plans, as
many HMOs have decided to pull out of Medicare or reduce the areas
they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers say the government should increase payments to
them, or they will drop even more of the drug benefits they now
provide voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, which represents HMOs, said: ``President Clinton is
proposing new prescription drug benefits on the one hand while
promoting policies that erode existing benefits on the other. The
first order of business should be to make sure no beneficiaries
lose the benefits they currently have.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House report suggests that elderly people cannot
depend on HMOs for generous benefits. ``More managed-care plans are
charging Medicare beneficiaries higher co-payments for prescription
drugs,'' it says. ``In 2000, no Medicare beneficiaries will have
access to a prescription drug benefit without any co-payments. In
1999, however, over 1.2 million Medicare beneficiaries had access
to a prescription drug benefit where there are no co-payments.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, Medicare officials contended that the
cutbacks by HMOs were just routine business decisions. Lawmakers
from both parties, deluged with complaints from constituents, say
the officials misjudged the severity of the problem and its
political implications.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people enrolled in Medicare HMOs are expected to hold
a rally on Wednesday at the Capitol, where they will plead with
Congress to pump money into the program so they can keep their
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The White House report documents what Gore describes as
troubling trends:
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs have reduced coverage for prescription drugs used by
Medicare beneficiaries. This year 21 percent of Medicare plans
limit drug coverage to $500 or less. But next year 32 percent of
Medicare HMOs will have such limits.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of beneficiaries who have access only to the most
expensive HMOs _ those with annual premiums of $960 or more _ will
quadruple, to 207,000 next year, from 50,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some states, like Iowa and Delaware, will see ``a substantial
decrease in the number of beneficiaries'' who have access to drug
coverage through Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, drug coverage will still be available, but at
much higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare program generally does not pay for drugs outside
the hospital. Medicare HMOs are not required to offer drug
benefits, and the government does not pay them for such benefits,
even though patients have come to expect them.

   KINSTON, N.C. _ There were whitecaps on the water rushing
through the lobby of the Best Western Riverview Hotel _ a name that
no longer signifies a choice location _ but Fire Chief Greg Smith
noticed something even more ominous floating behind the building
this afternoon: a large tank of liquid propane, about to break
loose from its moorings.
</P>
<P>
   If the tank ruptured, it would spill its contents into the vast
plain of water now covering large sections of eastern North
Carolina. If it found an ignition source, the consequences could be
worse. The chief radioed for a National Guard boat to secure the
tank, but he knew it was a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got tanks like that floating all over the county,'' he
said. ``We've got water flowing right through gas station storage
tanks. And who knows what else is coming from the hog farms. You
set one foot in that water, and your health is at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic flood that crept in after Hurricane Floyd is now
known to have killed 37 people in North Carolina, and left about
6,000 homeless. Although most of those who were trapped by the
floodwaters have been rescued, the state now faces an environmental
problem with enormous and long-term consequences. The water has
risen so high, and in so many places, that the number of
contaminants drifting downstream toward the ocean is impossible to
guess. The potential health problems could linger long after the
water begins to recede later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we can't even imagine the environmental
consequences,'' said Richard Slozak, the city manager of Goldsboro,
35 miles west of here. ``I just flew over the area, and I could see
any number of large petroleum spills, thousands of dead animals and
their waste, you name it, it's in the water. Our own city is
pumping raw sewage right into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the city's sewage treatment plant, designed to
withstand a flood the size of the one in 1929, is now mostly under
water and has stopped functioning. As a result, whenever anyone in
town flushes a toilet, waste leaves the sewer system untreated and
becomes part of the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing has happened here in Kinston, a city of 25,000,
where the second of two wastewater plants went under earlier on
Tuesday, and state officials said at least seven or eight more
counties have also lost their plants. Kinston officials on Tuesday
urged factories to stop discharging waste water _ which may require
some of them to shut down for several days _ and also suggested
that residents not use their plumbing as often as normal.
</P>
<P>
   Public safety workers around the state got tetanus boosters on
Tuesday, and anyone making any contact with the water was advised
to wear gloves and boots. In some larger cities, the drinking water
systems were still safe, but in rural areas residents were told not
even to turn on the tap.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been no outbreaks yet of E. Coli, cholera or
typhoid, the flood is only three days old, and the risk gets
greater the longer the water stays high and full of animal remains.
The state says that 2.5 million chickens, 500,000 turkeys and
100,000 hogs have drowned in the last four days, and the
agriculture department began distributing portable incinerators on
Tuesday to help farmers dispose of those carcasses that have not
floated away.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas on Tuesday, the water receded a bit, but a
sporadic rain through the day and the likelihood that dams upstream
will have to release some water later this week kept the threat
high.
</P>
<P>
   The state emergency management office also said that many more
bodies are expected to be found once crews can examine houses and
cars now under water. About 1,600 homes were ruined, and 6,000
people remained in shelters on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as it is, the bacterial contamination from farms and
sewers is only considered a short-term problem. The lasting effects
of chemicals and petroleum swirling through farmland and business
districts could take many years to clean up. An Occidental Chemical
plant near Wilmington spilled more than a million gallons of
wastewater that might have contained chromium, the federal
Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday, and mercury may
have spilled from a nearby containment pond.
</P>
<P>
   Water is also flowing freely through junkyards, warehouses of
farm pesticides, and underground storage tanks. Environmental
officials were particularly concerned about the lasting effect on
wildlife and coastal fisheries once the pollutants flow downstream
to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is devastating not just for our water quality but for the
whole coastal environment,'' said Don Reuter, a spokesman for the
state's Department of Environment and Natural Resources. ``It's
such a hodgepodge mix of all these different pollutants that it's a
real significant mess. The diversity of the state's ecology is so
tremendous, and we're just hoping the losses are not so severe that
we don't get to see a restoration.''

U.S. HELPING CANADA TRACK MIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY AND JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canada and the United States are using a network of spy
satellites, underwater acoustic sensors and electronic interception
techniques to track smuggling ships from Chinese ports, across the
north Pacific Ocean and into Canadian waters where they have been
intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 20, Canada has seized four ships carrying more than
600 Chinese. They are believed to have paid smugglers about $38,000
apiece to be slipped into Canada after a long sea trip under
primitive conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth ship is believed to have unloaded its human cargo before
it was spotted sinking south of the Queen Charlotte Islands early
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials have been reluctant to explain how their
CP-140 Aurora patrol aircraft have known where to spot boatloads of
illegal Chinese along Canada's vast coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give an advantage to people we are trying to
intercept,'' said Lt. David McKinnon, a Canadian Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, Canada and the United States are cooperating
closely in tracking the smuggling ships. It is a matter of great
interest to both nations _ Canada doesn't want a flood of illegal
immigrants, while the United States is concerned that many of them
will end up in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an ongoing agreement between the U.S. Navy and the
Canadian Navy to foster cooperation in intelligence in that part of
the world,'' one U.S. Navy intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. Navy official confirmed that the service _ along
with other U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies _ has
been sharing information with the Canadians, although he declined
to specify the source of the data or how it was shared, saying such
information is classified.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians also decline to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``In conjunction with our allies, we can be wherever we need to
be. We are working with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Department of
Defense all the time,'' McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Such information-sharing is conducted in part through the
Northwest Regional Naval Intelligence Center at Whidbey Island
Naval Air Station.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the center has operated at a heavily guarded
facility staffed by several hundred military intelligence
specialists, including Canadian military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Non-military experts point to several types of
intelligence-gathering methods available.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Richelson, a senior fellow at the nonprofit National
Security Archive in Washington, D.C., said, ``There are
(intelligence-gathering) assets under the sea, on land, in the air
and in space that can be used to monitor'' smuggler ships.
Richelson specializes in U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies,
and has studied the 40-year intelligence-sharing partnership
between the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Richelson and retired Adm. David Jeremiah, former commander of
the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said in separate interviews that the
U.S.-Canadian military partnership is structured to handle ``new''
security problems such as drug trafficking or illegal migrant
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not surprise me to find there is collaboration,''
Jeremiah said of the illegal immigrant situation, particularly
since immigration officials suspect Chinese aliens who make it
ashore in Canada are headed to find work in urban centers like New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   While Canada has naval ships and patrol aircraft, it is the U.S.
Navy and U.S. intelligence agencies that are able to shadow the
smuggler ships from the moment they leave China, Richelson said.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon acknowledged that ``you (the United States) have assets
as far as Guam, on the other side of the Pacific. We certainly work
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, the United States developed overlapping
surveillance systems to track the Soviet Navy and its nuclear
submarine fleet in the Pacific, and many of those systems are still
active.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, Richelson said, they have been modified to
conduct surveillance on other activities, including drug smuggling,
illegal driftnet fishing and now, the smuggling of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The at-sea surveillance is far more effective than trying to
track down illegal immigrants once they have entered Canada and can
cross virtually at will into the United States. Many New York-bound
illegals choose a notorious smuggling area near Cornwall, Ontario,
where Mohawk Indian reserves straddle the U.S.-Canada boundary
along the St. Lawrence River.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, U.S. and Canadian officials used a sting
operation to crack an illegal human smuggling ring operating there.
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno called it ``the largest global
alien smuggling ring'' operating in the two countries and estimated
that it had carried as many as 3,800 illegal aliens into the United
States over a two-year period. Many were from China's Fujian
Province, where most of those aboard the ships seized this summer
were from.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the methods available for tracking smuggling
ships:
</P>
<P>
   Satellites: Since the early 1970s, the United States has
operated a family of powerful spy satellites that can locate and
track ships by photographing them or triangulating their radio
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater sensors: The multi-billion-dollar Sosus (for sound
surveillance) System originally designed to locate and track Soviet
submarines has been altered since the decline of the Soviet/Russian
Navy to monitor surface ships as well. Navy officials say Sosus has
been effective in detecting illegal driftnet fishing vessels as
well as smuggling ships.
</P>
<P>
   Patrol aircraft: Both the U.S. and Canadian military in the
Pacific Northwest operate land-based aircraft that can locate
suspicious ships and submarines. The P-3C Orion and CP-140 Aurora
aircraft usually patrol areas the surveillance networks say harbor
suspicious vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians: Tips from members of the public can be part of the
arsenal combating smuggling ships. ``We use sonar sets, ships at
sea, everything up to Joe and Jane Canada sitting on their deck and
spotting something suspicious on the water below their home,''
McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   SUGGESTED BOX:
</P>
<P>
   The surveillance of the smuggling ships intercepted off Canada
this summer is the latest example of the U.S. military tracking
civilian targets. Here are some other incidents:
</P>
<P>
   In April 1988, U.S. Navy officials revealed that four Iranian
grain ships heading for Vancouver, B.C., through the Strait of Juan
de Fuca had been tracked all the way from the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over possible terrorism was high because U.S. Navy
aircraft had sunk two Iranian warships in the Gulf the same week as
the Iranian grain ships entered the strait.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted the vessel
Encounter Bay with 72 tons of high-grade Laotian marijuana 600
miles off the Washington coast.
</P>
<P>
   Officials disclosed in a federal court hearing the Encounter Bay
had been under U.S. surveillance since it was loaded with the drug
cargo in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, officials disclosed that a special U.S. Navy
intelligence unit based on Vancouver Island was involved in
surveillance of a Russian commercial shipping company operating in
western Canadian ports and in Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The company's vessels were suspected of carrying out Russian
military intelligence missions, including snooping on Trident
submarines based at Bangor Submarine Base on Hood Canal.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Navy intelligence officer assigned to the unit suffered
eye burns from a laser while photographing a Russian freighter from
a helicopter.

SURVEY DETAILS PROBLEMS OF MINORITIES AND CREDIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even in the current flush economic times, with home
ownership rates reaching record highs, a disproportionately large
number of minorities, chiefly blacks, have poor credit ratings,
according to a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by Freddie Mac, indicated that only 36
percent of black adults aged 20 to 40 and 51 percent of Hispanics
have good credit histories, compared with 61 percent of whites. In
addition, the report noted that 48 percent of blacks and 34 percent
of Hispanics have poor credit records, compared with only 27
percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which consisted of a survey of 12,000 consumers with
household incomes of less than $75,000, a group for whom securing
and maintaining credit is most critical, indicated that the
disparity in credit ratings persisted across all income spectrums.
Black and Hispanic people tend to have worse credit ratings than
their white counterparts, whether they live in households earning
less than $25,000 or in homes with earnings between $65,000 and
$75,000.
</P>
<P>
   The survey defined consumers with ``bad'' credit records as
those who have been either 90 days late on a bill payment in the
last two years, 30 days late on a payment more than once during the
last two years, have a record of delinquent liens or have filed for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The study is part of a new initiative by Freddie Mac to help
develop strategies to increase the number of minorities who own
their own homes. Though home ownership rates are at record levels,
racial disparities remain firmly in place. Currently 72 percent of
white adults own their own residence, compared with only 46 percent
of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which deal in the
secondary market, have been saying that the market for white
homeowners is becoming saturated and that for continued growth to
occur, banks and savings and loans must figure out how to increase
the lending to minorities, many of whom often have poorer credit
histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasing the pool of qualified minority home buyers will
play an important role in future expansion of the home mortgage
industry,'' said Leland Brendsel, chairman and chief executive
officer of Freddie Mac. ``This initiative is not only good for our
nation, but makes good business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, Freddie Mac's sibling, Fannie Mae, has
moved aggressively to persuade lenders to increase the number of
mortgages that are extended to minorities, underwriting $6 billion
in loans using experimental means to assess risk during the last
five years, according to Ann Logan, Fannie Mae's executive vice
president for single-family business.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Freddie Mac has been slower in moving to help lenders
raise their mortgage activity among minorities. Tuesday's release
of its study and its announcement that it will grant $2 million to
six historically black colleges to develop programs to teach black
people the importance of maintaining a good credit rating indicate
that Freddie Mac is beginning to move more assertively into this
area.
</P>
<P>
   While the study points out the stark differences in credit
ratings between whites and blacks and Hispanics, it is less clear
why the disparity exists. For example, all groups studied say they
have been unable to follow a relatively simple set of financial
behaviors such as controlling their spending, planning for the
future and saving money that would help them avoid credit problems.
</P>
<P>
   The study did find disparities between whites and blacks and
Hispanics when it came to events like a significant involuntary
drop in income, a large medical expense, a major tax or legal
problem or an extended period of unemployment that could cause a
person to fall behind on bill payments.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of unemployment, the disparities were not
large. For example, 30 percent of blacks surveyed reported an
involuntary reduction in income during the last two years. But so
did 24 percent of Hispanics and 20 percent of the whites.

BRIBERY CASE TAINTS 2,000 DIVORCES IN MANHATTAN MATRIMONIAL COURT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS first two grafs; CORRECTS `administrator' to `top clerk')  (rk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For $10 a case and up, prosecutors say, the top clerk
of the Manhattan matrimonial court routinely rushed divorce cases
through the court, no questions asked _ including cases in which
husbands forged their wives' signatures to win uncontested
divorces.
</P>
<P>
   The court's supervising clerk, Steven Singer, admitted on Friday
that he accepted bribes ranging from $10 to hundreds of dollars to
take divorce papers and _ without having verified the authenticity
of the papers as required _ quickly forward them to a judge for
signing as uncontested divorces.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said some of the documents involved a wide array of
fraud, including husbands forging their wives signatures on divorce
settlements that required the husbands to make only paltry child
support payments. In other cases, Singer said, he took the bribes
simply to expedite the cases for impatient couples, cutting the
waiting time to a couple of days from two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The cases that were expedited, court officials said, would
likely be allowed to stand. But divorces that involved fraud would
probably be thrown out. As a result, people who believed they had
been legally divorced and then remarried may be bigamists,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, said Tuesday
that his office was reviewing about 2,000 divorces granted by the
Manhattan Matrimonial Court, but he cautioned that the
investigation was in its initial stages and that it was not yet
known how many of the divorces might have involved fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Two divorce lawyers have previously been indicted in the schemes
and two clerks were indicted Tuesday, prosecutors said, and as many
as 20 other divorce lawyers and court employees are under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that all of the cases being investigated came
from low-cost legal offices, known in the field as ``divorce
mills,'' that cater to immigrants and the poor with relatively
low-cost services.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, who was arrested in June, pleaded guilty on Friday in
state Supreme Court in Manhattan to multiple counts of accepting
bribes. He is scheduled to be sentenced by Justice John Cataldo of
state Supreme Court on Jan. 10 and faces up to seven years in
prison and a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stunned colleagues of Singer, a leading expert on
New York matrimonial law who frequently gave speeches to bar
associations on the topic. He had served as supervising clerk for
matrimonial cases in Manhattan since 1996 and been a court clerk
for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very bright fellow who was extremely intelligent
and worked all hours,'' said one court official. ``It's just
incomprehensible to so many of us, and deeply disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer oversaw a staff of 20 clerks whose duties included
verifying requests for uncontested divorces, which require both
husband and wife to sign affidavits stating they agree to the
terms. Court officials said more than 90 percent of divorces in New
York are uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows New York residents to apply for divorce in any
county they wish, and Manhattan's courts have a reputation for
quickly processing uncontested divorces, the officials said. The
Manhattan Matrimonial Court processes by far the most divorce cases
in the state, handling between 12,000 and 15,000 a year, or more
than half of the total number of uncontested divorces in the state.
Court officials attributed that case load to the concentration of
divorce mills in Manhattan and the reputation for quick processing.
</P>
<P>
   After Singer and his staff verified the validity of the divorce
papers, they forward them to a judge or court-appointed referees
for signing, court officials said. Court officials said the judges
check the papers again themselves, but divorce lawyers said they
believe court clerks are the ones who generally make sure ``all the
t's are crossed and i's dotted.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Singer ignored clear signs of fraud in exchange
for the bribes and was caught in a series of sting operations
mounted by the district attorney's office between 1997 and this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Five undercover investigators went to Singer with documents
containing forged signatures. They all received court-certified
divorces. Eight other undercover investigators filed divorce papers
using the names of Manhattan district attorneys who served in the
late 1800s. Again, all of the divorces were approved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It varied from case to case,'' one prosecutor said, referring
to the fraud. ``But for the most part it was to get the divorce
quickly and with no questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they feared that poor and immigrant women, in
particular, could have been victimized in some of the schemes.
Those women, divorce lawyers said, may be unaware of state laws
that guarantee them a percentage of their husband's income as child
support in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was started in 1997 over a child support case.
A woman complained to court officials that she had received a copy
of an uncontested divorce settlement that she never agreed to. The
settlement included a far smaller amount of child support than she
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce lawyers and court officials said the cases confirm
long-running concerns about the activities of divorce mills. The
shops, which charge as little as $500 for a divorce, have emerged
as a cheap alternative to hiring private lawyers whose divorce fees
can easily rise into the thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said they have also long suspected the shops of
submitting false forms declaring their clients to be impoverished
and unable to pay the $275 in divorce paper filing fees, but then
charging the client $275 anyway and pocketing the money.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLEBORO, Mass. _ Cranberries have been good to Betty Brown's
family for generations. Her grandfather staked out cranberry bogs
here on the sandy shoulder of Cape Cod in the 1930s, and now Mrs.
Brown and three of her cousins farm the land they are in the
process of buying from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   And the family has been good to Ocean Spray, the 69-year-old
company that dominates the cranberry business and sold about $1.4
billion of cranberry drinks and other products last year. Mrs.
Brown even had her photograph featured in last year's Ocean Spray
annual report.
</P>
<P>
   But lately the relationship has soured, and Mrs. Brown has
become one of the company's most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hardest things we had to do was look the two dads
in the eye and say, we can't pay you this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot pay because Ocean Spray, besieged by crises ranging
from an oversupply of cranberries to increased competition to some
costly marketing mistakes, has sharply cut the price it pays
farmers for the fruit. The situation has become so dire that
management has commissioned a total review of its operations,
hiring Bain &AMP; Co. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. as its consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The review could lead to big changes that might include a sale
of Ocean Spray to a consumer-products company like Unilever or
Pepsico. ``At this point, every possible solution is being
evaluated,'' said Paul Jonjak, a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Being under someone else's wing would be a radical departure for
Ocean Spray, a cooperative based in Lakeville, Mass., that is owned
by 920 cranberry farmers and citrus growers, most of them in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company historically has prided itself on coming up with its
own answers to its problems, though not always in the most
methodical manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their culture can be summed up as ready, fire, aim,'' said one
analyst who follows the business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, part of the problem may be the cooperative structure
itself. Ocean Spray has a board composed exclusively of growers who
are also the owners and suppliers of key raw materials and who may
not be the most objective critics of the rest of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company was a trendsetter,'' said Michael Bellas, chief
executive of Beverage Marketing, a trade group. ``What happened was
they didn't keep evolving.''
</P>
<P>
   What also happened was that Ocean Spray lost control of the
cranberry supply, something it had carefully managed over the
years, and with it went prices. The company now confronts bulging
inventory and growing overproduction with no quick fix in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say it will be 10 years,'' said David N.
Farrimond, who oversees cranberry marketing for the Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brown blames a series of mistakes by management. Tom
Bullock, 53,the departing chief executive, announced his retirement
in June after less than three year at the helm, but he plans on
staying around for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been oversupplies and all kinds of problems in the
past,'' Mrs. Brown said, perched on the edge of a bog recently and
nibbling tart raw cranberries, something she said was an acquired
taste. ``We've been able to overcome them with good marketing and
management. But our marketing and management have let us down. They
have dropped the ball completely.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last few months, a Web site run by Mrs. Brown's husband,
Hal, a clinical social worker who helps out on the bogs as well,
has provided a forum for comments from farmers, not all of whom are
disgruntled. ``Ocean Spray is so poor in communicating,'' he said.
``They treat growers as if they aren't really the owners of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Activity on the Web site (www.cranberrystressline.com) escalated
in February, after Ocean Spray announced, at the co-op's annual
meeting in Florida, that prices for a 100-pound barrel would fall
to a range of $42 to $48 from $55 the year before. Brown posted a
picture of the Titanic to accompany an article about the company's
problems, and the comments flowed in. Ocean Spray dismisses the Web
site as divisive, but others say it has been helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it impossible for the growers within the
organization to ignore the outside world,'' said Tom Gelsthorpe, a
grower based in Sandwich, Mass., whose father is a former executive
at Ocean Spray. ``The disadvantage of a private company is, if the
company's not well run, there's no dispassionate analyst to shed a
different light on things. Secrecy has turned out to be our worst
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts describe an organization divided against itself. ``It
does appear that the whole board-management interaction the last
few years has been somewhat dysfunctional,'' said Rex Green, a
managing director at Advest in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of all this is the sudden price collapse. For most
of the last decade, farmers who belonged to the Ocean Spray
cooperative received about $60 a barrel. Last year, the price fell
to $55, and in June, only a few months after the February
announcement, the company said it would pay just $32 to $38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is the surplus, and part of it is the competitive
activity,'' Bullock said. ``People are unhappy,'' he said of the
growers. ``These are good, solid, hard-working farmers, and this is
their paycheck. They'll remain unhappy until this turns around.
We're doing a lot of things, but it's going to take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock announced his retirement only a day after an advisory
committee of growers expressed no confidence in management,
although the company said that was not a factor in Bullock's
decision. He remains in charge of day-to-day operations, including
the job of choosing his successor, and says he has an agreement to
stay on for a year to insure a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time for a change,'' he said, explaining his
retirement, ``and that's what they'll have _ a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Others note that as strained as relations may have become
between growers and management, the farmers might not like the
alternative any better.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone like Kraft or Coke or Triarc is going to come along
and seduce them, and then someone they can't control will be
controlling them,'' said one industry analyst. ``The Ocean Spray
brand would become just another brand in some company's big-brand
portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray created the cranberry-juice market in the 1960s when
company executives were casting about for ways to expand beyond the
fruit's once-or-twice-a-year appearance on holiday tables. The
cranberry, believed to have been served in stew form at the first
Thanksgiving, had long had patriotic associations.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray pushed the health aspect of drinking cranberry
juice, citing its high vitamin C content and other attributes _ a
tactic that helped the company grow from $300 million in sales in
1969 to more than $1 billion by 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the health aspects of Ocean Spray drinks have come back to
haunt the company lately. In 1996, Northland Cranberries, founded
by a renegade Ocean Spray member, came out with a 100 percent juice
version of Ocean Spray's top-selling Cranberry Juice Cocktail. The
marketing took dead aim at the ingredients in Ocean Spray, noting
that it was only 27 percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a new federal labeling law required companies
to display the sugar, sodium and other ingredients prominently on
packages. Since then, Northland has carved out about 10 percent of
the cranberry juice market at Ocean Spray's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labeling law was going into effect, and I asked what we
were going to do,'' said John Swendrowski, Northland's founder,
recalling his decision to break away from Ocean Spray in 1993.
``They said it was no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray, countering with a study of its own that tried to
convince consumers that sugar was sugar, whether it came from fruit
juice or corn syrup, thought the appeal of Northland's
100-percent-juice would only be fleeting, Bullock said. ``It's been
around for years,'' he said of such products, ``and when Northland
came into the market, we thought it was more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray finally struck back a year ago with a
100-percent-juice product called Wellfleet Farms, proudly
proclaiming the move as the ``most successful new product launch''
in company history.
</P>
<P>
   Wellfleet Farms, however, sold badly, hindered by what Bullock
called ``a little trouble communicating'' with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Wellfleet Farms is slowly vanishing from store shelves, and the
company plans to reintroduce the product next month as Ocean Spray
Premium, belatedly taking the advise of critics who said the
company made a mistake not capitalizing on its well-known name.
</P>
<P>
   With Northland outside the fold, Ocean Spray also lost control
of its careful balance between cranberry supply and demand.
``Northland is what people now point to and say, that was the
beginning of the Bataan Death March,'' a consultant who knows the
business well said. ``People are saying now, under no circumstances
should they have let the Northland growers leave the co-op.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the company's efforts to upgrade its computer systems
wreaked havoc. A big $30 million investment in a system from SAP
that is intended to manage the business from farm to grocery shelf
went on line in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the summer, we had difficulty with people learning to
run the system,'' Bullock said, calling the change a difficult
transition. Deliveries were snarled, and options were limited with
the new system when it came to correcting them, others in the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans several new products this fall, including a
grapefruit drink, Ruby Red Strawberry. And it will soon introduce a
vitamin- and calcium-enhanced cranberry drink aimed at
health-conscious consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reassert our cranberry leadership with the
customer,'' said Nancy MacDermott, the company's senior vice
president for sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several growers are working together in search of
alternatives to the way Ocean Spray is run. One of them is the A.D.
Makepeace Co., a founder of Ocean Spray, and the co-op's largest
single grower.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time we would like to encourage debate, discussion and
information sharing among the growers to build understanding of the
strategic merger alternative,'' said Robert L. Rosbe Jr.,
Makepeace's vice president for finance. ``We've defined that as
merging the juice company and consumer packaged goods with a major
global giant,'' while keeping the co-op intact.
</P>
<P>
   A report from Ocean Spray's consultants is expected by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to figure out the best way to handle the
change in the industry,'' said Mary Brazeau Brown, who has 330
acres planted with cranberries in Cranmoor, Wis., and is not
related to Betty Brown. ``It's not an easy solution for anybody.'' &QL;

 &HT;    N.C. rain just won't go away
 &HT;    (EDS: UPDATES death of missing girl.)
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINETOPS, N.C. _ The swirling black water had receded enough
Tuesday for Albert Reid to go back home, back to the place where he
almost drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Five of his neighbors died Thursday in Hurricane Floyd's rising
floodwaters. Another, a 5-year-old girl, disappeared into the snaky
underbrush of Town Creek. Her body was found Tuesday. The flooding
was one of the worst tragedies spawned by Floyd as it plowed up the
East Coast last week. Some rivers are just now cresting in North
Carolina, proof that, in this storm, water was more deadly than
hurricane-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   East of Pinetops, a motor boat attempting to carry a dozen
people to safety overturned. In Thursday's early morning, the
torrent carried half of them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I thought about a lot of things under that water,'' Reid,
64, said Tuesday as he walked down Dodge Street, past his
flood-ravaged home, past a dead horse, past the cedar tree where
his wife, Mary, clung in the branches until she was rescued after
the boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-rising waters covered all but the rooftops in the Dodge
City neighborhood, so badly damaged it warranted a visit Monday
from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Pinetops, where mobile homes and stately homes interrupt
acre upon acre of water-sogged tobacco and cotton, Edgecombe County
residents have begun venturing out from the elementary school
emergency shelter as far as the retreating waters will allow.
</P>
<P>
   Along Town Creek, a Tar River tributary, surging water uprooted
oaks and sycamores and tossed around metallic propane gas tanks
like balloons. A jumble of logs and branches blocked Bynum Farm
Road, where rescuers spray-painted red X's over front doors to
signal they had searched for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, water covered the heads of Jesus and his disciples,
portrayed in a tapestry tacked above the sanctuary door of St.
Stevenson Holy Church of Deliverance. Inside the dark hall, the
water overturned pews and the pulpit, swelled the red-carpeted
floor and perched a foot stool atop the door of the pastor's study.
</P>
<P>
   The receding waters left a smelly chocolate-brown residue on the
tile floor of what once was a cheerfully painted day care center at
the rear of the church. Diapers and toiler paper were among the
debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were floating in here like inside a big aquarium,''
said Glen Williams, 37, a church deacon.
</P>
<P>
   The stench of dead livestock hung in the air, seemingly pressed
down by the low gray clouds that dumped more rain Tuesday on top of
Floyd's torrential rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's downpour swelled rivers faster than people in
low-lying areas could escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden it came out like water pouring from a
bathtub,'' said Roosevelt Lewis, 70, throwing out corn Tuesday to
what remains of his chicken flock in Dodge City. He and his
brother, Milton, lost 55 goats and five horses _ Diamond, Missy,
Two Step, Blackie and J.R. One was stuck in a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, police blocked the entrance to Dodge City except to
property owners and rescue workers whose search for 5-year-old
Teshika Vines came to a tragic end.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Carlos Vines, had refused to stop looking in
emergency shelters until he knew for sure whether his daughter was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities confirmed five other deaths: Carlos Vines' wife,
Keisha; her parents, Ben and Vivian Mayo; and neighborhood children
Cabrina and Destiny Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for hope in the tragedy, the Rev. Carolyn Slade, St.
Stevenson's pastor, pointed to a teal-green cinder block house. The
rising waters trapped 11 people in the attic, and all were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that we pulled 200 to 300 people to safety,'' said
firefighter Mike Stallings, a member of the South Edgecombe
Volunteer Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the Lord giveth and taketh away,'' Slade said. ``But
we were not prepared for this. It hurts, it really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, when Floyd veered toward the North Carolina coast,
residents of Dodge City braced for winds, but not for rain.
</P>
<P>
   Before he went to bed last Wednesday, Albert Reid moved his two
Cadillacs and Mazda pickup out from under the pine trees in his
yard. He didn't want to risk falling branches denting them.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't sleep that night, anticipating howling winds that
never came. He was surprised at dusk by the water rising from Town
Creek behind his house. He cranked his pickup, but it stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Reid went back inside and told his wife they'd have to wait for
a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Ben Mayo was ferrying neighbors to safety in his
flat-bottomed aluminum boat. On a return trip to the flooding
subdivision, Mayo picked up Reid and his wife, bringing the number
of passengers to 12.
</P>
<P>
   As the boat rode against the swift current toward Bynum Farm
Road, Mayo gunned the motor and the bow popped up in the air. Water
poured in the back, and the boat turned over with its hull bobbing
above water.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped underneath, Reid bobbed up and down, gasping for breath,
until he was able to get out from under the boat.
</P>
<P>
   In the half light, he remembers two or three children clinging
to the hull. He had lost track of his wife and his stepdaughter
when another man tossed him a rope attached to the boat and told
him to wrap it around a utility pole.
</P>
<P>
   The boat stopped, and Reid escaped into a nearby house with
several others. As the water rose, they climbed into the attic,
hoping for rescuers who arrived several hours later in a boat.
</P>
<P>
   They retrieved the people in the house and Reid's wife and her
daughter from a nearby cedar tree.
</P>
<P>
   Overthe weekend, searchers found the bodies of the five
victims. Officials returned Mayo's boat to the carport of his dark
empty house, at the edge of the dense woods where the current swept
away 5-year-old Teshika.
</P>
<P>
   Reid remembers seeing her drifting away, across Annie Mae Ellis'
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get her,'' Reid said, ``but she was too far
away.''

 &HT;    FBI arrests Texas man on securities fraud charges
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Brian Russell Stearns came to Austin last year
spreading money around. He bought a $2 million-plus mansion
overlooking Lake Austin. He donated to charities, invested in a
fleet of million-dollar aircraft and rubbed shoulders with
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   He attended President Clinton's fundraiser in Austin last May
and sat at the head table with Hillary Clinton when she visited
here in August to raise money for a possible U.S. Senate campaign
in New York. He paid off Garry Mauro's $100,000 campaign debt from
his unsuccessful run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   What no one knew at the time was that the FBI was investigating
Stearns, 29, for securities fraud. On Monday, the FBI arrested
Stearns at his Lake Austin home, charged him with securities fraud,
then seized the house, two jets worth more than $10 million, a $2
million helicopter and $800,000 in vehicles, plus undisclosed
amounts of money in bank accounts. Stearns was in custody Tuesday
awaiting a bail hearing in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint, the FBI accused Stearns, who is married with a
small child, of selling $3.3 million in bogus securities to a
Georgia man. Stearns, according to the FBI, also is on five-year
probation for a 1994 conviction for grand theft in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Copeland, head of the FBI's white-collar crime unit in
Austin, said the six-month investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other victims out there,'' said Copeland, declining
to speculate on how many.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Butler, a partner with Realtor Tosca Gruber, said
Stearns came to them in the spring of 1998, looking at homes up to
$4 million and using an alias.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all sorts of people in this price range,'' she said.
``He told us he did international money handling _ in large sums.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said Stearns bought the 8,000-square foot house. She said
he later deposited $900,000 as earnest money to buy 137 acres of
Lake Austin waterfront for $6 million, but he forfeited the money
when he did not come up with the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he also hired off-duty police officers to guard his
house and planes. Law enforcement officers, who requested
anonymity, said Stearns liked to hang around police.
</P>
<P>
   No Austin Police Department officers are believed to have worked
for Stearns, but the Police Department is conducting an
``administrative inquiry'' into what role, if any, the city's park
police or marshals may have played, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be unusual for park police or city marshals to be
doing off-duty security,'' said Joe Canales, chief of staff for the
city manager. ``The police are just checking to make sure
everything is correct and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Byland, an Austin businessman, said Stearns had been a
partner of his in the aviation business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know him long,'' said Byland, who added that he knew
nothing of Stearns' dealings in securities.
</P>
<P>
   He declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Garrett with Capitol Wings said Stearns chartered planes
from the company for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Then Stearns invested in a Gulfstream III, a jet about the size
of a DC-9, that is capable of making trans-Atlantic flights. The
jet's plush interior seats 12 to 14 people and is worth $10 million
to $20 million. According to the FBI, authorities also seized a
Learjet 35A and an Italian helicopter, a $2 million craft with jet
turbines.
</P>
<P>
   Among the vehicles seized: two 1999 BMWs, a 1998 Mercedes LS
600, a 1998 Toyota Land Cruiser and a 1999 Four Winds power boat.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns' wealth quickly put him inside Austin's social circles.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he was introduced at various charity events and gave
great parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked to spend money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   His spending included giving $1,000 to attend Clinton's
fundraiser at the house of advertising executive Roy Spence, a
longtime friend of Clinton's. Stearns paid another $1,000 to attend
Hillary Clinton's event in August.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, another longtime friend of the Clintons, said he
metStearns through a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Stearns promised to raise $80,000 for Hillary Clinton
by selling tickets to the event. However, Mauro said Stearns failed
to do so. Mauro said he had Stearns checked out by the White House
and the Democratic Party but he was unaware of Stearns' problems
with law enforcement, even his conviction in Maryland for grand
theft.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, who lost to Gov. George W. Bush in 1998, said he met
Stearns for breakfast to discuss a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for $5,000,'' said Mauro, trying to erase his 1998
campaign debt. ``He asked, 'How much do you owe?' I told him
$100,000 and he said, 'Why don't I just write you a check?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The check cleared.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, Stearns got his money by lying to
investors. In an affidavit, FBI agent Evan Rae said Stearns
convinced Brent R. Butts of Ellijay, Ga., to invest $3.3 million in
bogus securities with a promise of a 40 percent return every 35
days without putting the money at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``These schemes purport to invest in very high yield, European
bank debentures in a secret world market open only to select
individuals,'' Rae wrote. According to the Federal Reserve, Rae
wrote, ``These instruments do not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The money, according to the FBI, went into Stearns' personal
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Butts could not be reached for comment.

FORK IN THE ROAD LOOMS FOR HENSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a two-sport athlete, with one of the sports outside his
university, Michigan's Drew Henson has more leverage than most
sophomore quarterbacks. But he does not plan to use it to force his
coach, Lloyd Carr, to choose him as first-string quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told everyone that I'm not going to leave early,'' Henson
said. ``I'm here for the long run. I can't guarantee anything. A
person my age, how much better situation would you want to be in as
a quarterback with the Michigan Wolverines, with the season we have
a chance of having? I wouldn't trade it for any other situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees are hoping that Henson will eventually trade it
for another situation _ major league baseball. Henson is also a top
prospect in the Yankee farm system, a third baseman who played for
the Yankees' Class A team in Tampa, Fla., this summer. In 69 games,
he batted .280, with 71 hits in 254 at-bats, including 13 homers
and 12 doubles. He had 37 runs batted in, walked 26 times and
struck out 71 times.
</P>
<P>
   Henson said he follows the Yankees, the defending World Series
champions, in newspapers, on television and on the Internet. ``I'm
a huge sports fan,'' he said after leading his team to an 18-13
victory over Syracuse last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Many people around Ann Arbor, Mich., are becoming Henson fans,
as the Wolverines have streaked to a 3-0 start and the No. 4
ranking in the nation. Although he entered the game in relief of
Tom Brady for the third consecutive week, Henson played all of the
final three quarters, his most time so far. He seemed more nimble
and poised than Brady, a fifth-year senior, who completed 5 of 10
passes for 26 yards. Carr said Brady would start next week at
Wisconsin when the Wolverines open their Big Ten schedule. Henson
said that decision was all right with him. For now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to play, everyone's got a certain role, and
mine's changing as the course of the season goes,'' Henson said.
``Whatever they tell me to do, I'm going to do it. No one likes to
sit, but it's something that I've got used to. And I've learned
from. Right now I'm playing well, so I'm happy about my role as it
is on the team at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the Yankees, even if they wanted to move him to
the major league roster next season. ``They wouldn't,'' Henson
said, ``and I'm not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not yet, but the Yankees appear to have no doubt he will
be sometime soon. According to Mark Newman, who will soon be named
director of baseball operations for the Yankees, Henson improved
steadily over the summer, mixed well with his teammates and made
several acrobatic plays at third base. ``It was more than we could
hope for,'' Newman said. ``Actually, it was kind of stunning.'' At
19, he was one of the youngest players in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said Henson hit a ball over the scoreboard beyond the
left-center fence at Legends Field, the Yankees' minor league park
in Tampa, and hit a home run in Jupiter, Fla., that was ``Ruthian,
McGwiresque.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows tremendous raw power, agility and athleticism, and
all the kinds of mental skills you could want,'' Newman said.
``He's a special, special guy. He's in the Jeter category, that
kind of person, that kind of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that Henson could become the successor to Scott
Brosius at third, and he might be tantalized by the prospect of
playing alongside Derek Jeter, who grew up in Kalamazoo and became
a high-school star in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Henson may be ready for a larger football role. Against
Syracuse, his touchdown pass to the fullback Aaron Shea came with 3
minutes 4 seconds remaining in the first half and gave Michigan a
13-7 lead. On second down and 10 from the Syracuse 22, Henson took
the snap, backpedaled and drew the Syracuse rushers toward him
before tossing softly and accurately to Shea, who caught the pass
on a screen pattern and rumbled into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Henson finished with 16 completions in 28 pass attempts for 151
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said the Yankees had not talked to Henson about football.
``That's going to play out over time,'' Newman said. ``We don't
pressure him, we don't bug him about this. We knew this going in,
and we definitely understand. It's just a wait-and-see issue. He's
a guaranteed major league player, and a good one. This guy is going
to be a great one.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman was asked about the possibility that Henson might want to
play both sports professionally, like Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll cross that bridge when we get to it,'' he said. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: CALL TO ARMS FOR THE BATTLE OF ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first two months of this season, Dave Wallace
was cruising along, minding his business, as the Mets' senior
executive of player personnel and adviser to general manager Steve
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly in early June, when the Mets dismissed their
pitching coach, Bob Apocada, and two other coaches, Wallace found
himself plucked from the front office and sent in to coach the
team's wobbly pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Wallace and the Mets find themselves here at
Turner Field with three opportunities to run down and catch a team
and a franchise that has tormented them for much of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have reminded the Mets of everything they lacked:
consistency, depth and an awesome arsenal of pitching. The Mets and
the Braves are still a study in contrast, the differences framed by
their respective pitching staffs, specifically the three who
started this crucial series: John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg
Maddux for Atlanta; Rick Reed, Orel Hershiser and Al Leiter for the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's rotation is part of baseball lore, like Tinkers to
Evers to Chance. Reed, Hershiser (in recent years) and Leiter are
part of the less glorious journeyman tradition, one in which
careers rise and fall, are discarded and salvaged. Then one season,
they fall into the right space, the stars are aligned correctly,
and they find themselves staring a pennant in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's role in crunch time is to allow the staff to feel the
adrenaline but keep it in check. Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux put
their own pressure on a staff like the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to encourage guys to do what they do best and do what
they've done all year,'' he said, ``Stay within themselves, execute
the pitches they know how to execute and not get carried away with
all the hype and the moment and the `Oh my gosh, I'm facing Greg
Maddux, I've got to be perfect because he's going to be perfect.'
We just have to go after their hitters the best way we know how
within the realm of our strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a burden of proof always, especially at this time of
year. When you combine September, being in a pennant race and the
fact that you're facing those guys over there _ the Smoltzes and
the Glavines and the Madduxes _ they enjoy those confrontations,
those challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have the best record in baseball since June 6, which
corresponds with Wallace's arrival and Apodaca's departure. There
have been no sudden innovations, no pitching epiphany. Mostly
Wallace has been a mound psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   While Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux have been the Braves'
foundation for a decade, Reed, Hershiser and Leiter have had
multiple careers in alternating cites with varying results. Reed,
Tuesday night's starter, was a replacement player in 1995 for the
Reds. After a frosty beginning Reed became a force for the Mets,
finishing 13-9 in 1997 and 16-11 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, the star of the Dodgers' 1988 championship team and
the unanimous choice that year for the Cy Young Award in the
National League, is the oldest on the staff and the most
analytical.
</P>
<P>
   ``He breaks the game down as well as anyone I know,'' Wallace
said. ``He'll know what he has to do. He'll know who he's pitching
against, what the situation is, who's on base, who the next hitter
is who he doesn't want to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who was at the core of the turmoil that brought Wallace
from the front office to begin with, is the wildest card of a
pitching staff full of wild cards. He has had two careers within a
career. He broke in in 1984 but never won more than four games
until 1993, when he was 9-6 with Toronto. After two dismal seasons
with Toronto, the last an 11-11 effort, Leiter went to the Marlins,
where he experienced a two-season resurrection. Last season Leiter
was 17-6, but this season Leiter is 11-11 (coincidentally, the same
as Glavine).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real emotional, but that has to be controlled'' Wallace
said of Leiter. ``If he controls himself emotionally, he'll be
fine. That's my job to keep these guys in tune and not get caught
up in the hoopla.''
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla is growing. With 11 games to go, the Mets, who spent
so many years wishfully looking at Atlanta from a distance, find
themselves in touching distance. Will Wallace's inherited staff
finally pull the Mets ahead?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that those guys are going to keep their team in the
ball game,'' Wallace said, nodding toward the Braves' clubhouse.
``That's all you can ask _ for your guys to keep you in the game
for most of the game.''
</P>

 &HT;    Jones secures win for Braves with dual homers
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chipper Jones was sick of all the talk, and sick of
all the waiting.
</P>
<P>
   It showed on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He started Game 1 of The series against the Mets with a home run
from the left side of the plate, and finished it with a home run
from the right to power the Braves to a 2-1 win and a 1-0 lead in a
game he's promised would be key.
</P>
<P>
   The National League MVP candidate hit the magical 100 RBI
plateau at the perfect time _ the bottom of the eighth inning with
left-hander Dennis Cook on to turn him around at the plate. Jones
burned Bobby Valentine for the second time this season as the 1999
power-hitting right-handed version of Jones homered from both sides
of the plate for the third time this season, second against the
Mets. Of his 43 homers, 14 have come from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   On his bat and John Smoltz's arm, the Braves got a two-game lead
with two games to go in Part 1 of this series, that continues next
week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The series to all but decide the NL East pennant began Tuesday
night with traffic backed up down Capital Ave, the press box
packed, an undeniable October chill in the air, and the major
league scoreboard in left center field finally rendered
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Matching that backdrop, the Braves sent the all-time winningest
postseason pitcher Smoltz to the mound, sleeved, bearded and jacked
up, judging by the 95's popping up on the speed of pitch sign.
Smoltz had had only one win in his previous 14 starts. His Mets
counterpart, Rick Reed, meanwhile, had brought the Mets 11 wins in
his last 14 starts.
</P>
<P>
   But in a series like this - that feels like the postseason - and
the season on the line, the past is moot. And so together they
pitched the way postseason games are supposed to be pitched, with
runs at an absolute premium. They fought to a 1-1 draw, leaving the
bullpens to decide the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves drew first blood on a Chipper Jones home run in the
first inning, a rip to right center for his 42nd home run and 99th
RBI of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the peskiest bunch of hitters in the National League (tops
as a team with a .366 on-base percentage) weren't going to stand
for that long. Rey Ordonez singled to lead off the third inning and
after a blown Rick Reed bunt attempt, scored on consecutive singles
from Rickey Henderson and Edgardo Alfonzo. Alfonzo's liner glanced
off Jose Hernandez's glove and into center field for the game-tying
blow, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz saved his best pitching for the No. 3 and 4 hitters in
the inning as he retired John Olerud and Mike Piazza on a pair of
groundouts to the middle infield to hold it right there.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams haven't budged all year and weren't about to
start on Tuesday night. Through six innings they matched each other
with a run on five hits for the Mets and six for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz's night ended with a big seventh inning when he stranded
runners at second and third, striking out Rickey Henderson on his
eight pitch of the at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Braves closer John Rocker sealed the win with 3 strikeouts in
the ninth inning.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI ``unequivocally opposed'' President
Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists,
asserting that the release of most of the prisoners would
reinvigorate their terrorist movement, according to a letter
prepared by the law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, prepared for FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, said the
clemency ``would likely return committed, experienced,
sophisticated and hardened terrorists to the clandestine movement''
for Puerto Rican independence. The letter also said the clemency
would ``psychologically and operationally enhance'' allies in the
militant organization FALN who killed five people and maimed 83 in
terrorist activities in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's letter came to light at a congressional hearing intended
by Republicans to portray the president's act as reckless. Also
Tuesday, Clinton provided his first full explanation of his
decision in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh did not sign the FBI letter, which was addressed but never
sent to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. But senior law enforcement officials said Tuesday night
that the letter accurately reflected Freeh's position.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the letter was sent from the FBI to the Justice
Department for review prior to Freeh's signature, law enforcement
officials said. The letter was among the thousands of documents
sent by the White House to Congress in response to subpoenas for
information about the president's clemency decision.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said that Freeh had objected to clemency when it was
first raised in 1994, and again as recently as June 28; even so,
the letter said, Freeh was unaware that the president was actually
contemplating any commutation when the White House announced its
offer on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   While some officials have privately acknowledged disapproval of
the president's decision, Freeh's letter is the first official
indication of the fierce opposition among law enforcement officials
to the clemency offer to the 16 terrorists, most of whom have
accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself in the tradition of previous presidents who have
granted clemency in cases that were unpopular, Clinton portrayed
his release of the prisoners as an act of courage. He cited
Theodore Roosevelt's grant of amnesty to Filipino nationals who
fought U.S. control and Jimmy Carter's commutation of sentences of
Puerto Rican nationalists who had opened fire on the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They exercised the power vested in them by the Constitution to
do what they believed was right, even in the face of great
controversy,'' Clinton wrote. ``I have done the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not deal with the question of whether the
release of the prisoners might reignite the dormant terrorist
movement. But Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., asserted that recent
statements by a known Puerto Rican militant and ally of the
prisoners indicated that the release was stirring old passions.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Filiberto Ojeda Rios, the leader of Los Macheteros, a
terrorist organization allied with the FALN, as telling a Puerto
Rican radio station that if the United States committed aggressive
acts against Puerto Rico, his group would ``not remain with their
arms crossed, you can be sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans coaxed out of other law enforcement officials a
concern that the ex-prisoners constituted a threat to American
security. While the officials were bound under the president's
claim of executive privilege not to disclose internal deliberations
over the matter, they catalogued the violent actions of the FALN,
the terrorist organization to which the prisoners belong.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gallagher, assistant director of national security for the
FBI, told the panel, ``These are criminals and they are terrorists
and they represent a threat to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has acknowledged that it has no control over clemency
matters, which are the sole prerogative of the president. But
Clinton's explanation Tuesday appeared to make little difference to
those in the hearing room, who see the move as a political disaster
for the president and for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
likely to seek the Senate seat from New York. She has run into
political trouble for at first supporting, then denouncing, her
husband's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have wanted to draw out the drama. The panel, led by
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the government Reform
Committee, called several victims of FALN attacks, bringing them to
testify for the third time in less than two weeks. They included
Richard Pastorella, a retired New York City detective, who was
severely injured in a 1982 attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who thinks of us?'' Pastorella asked in a bitter voice.
``Certainly not Mr. Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, and relatives of those who had been killed in
terrorist attacks, said that contrary to federal requirements, they
had not been notified of the prisoners' pending release.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Republicans took issue with Clinton's apparent belief that
just because the prisoners had not been convicted of doing bodily
harm, they deserved to go free. ``The only reason some of them
didn't commit murders or bombings is because they were arrested
before they got a chance to,'' said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats, both African-Americans, offered a minimal defense
of the clemency. Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-Ill., said, ``Democracy can
be fellowship as well as punishment.'' Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.,
urged Congress to ``move on'' and examine issues that ``have a real
effect on the lives of average Americans.'' The committee's ranking
Democrat, Rep. Henry Waxman of California, said reluctantly that he
``probably'' would not have granted the clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, the president disclosed some of the arguments
that former President Carter had used in persuading Clinton to
grant clemency in this case. He said that Carter wrote to him in
1997 that releasing the prisoners would be ``a significant
humanitarian gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also said that any concern that clemency might be viewed
as leniency was mitigated by the length of time that they had
already served, Clinton wrote. Most of them had been in prison at
least 16 years, a period that Clinton said was not commensurate
with the crimes of which they were convicted, which included
sedition, conspiracy and armed robbery but not bodily harm to
anyone.

FORD IN PACT WITH CANADA'S AUTO WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Ford Motor Co. reached a tentative, three-year
contract Tuesday evening with the union representing its Canadian
workers, three hours before a threatened strike at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was similar to the generous deal that
DaimlerChrysler AG negotiated with the United Automobile Workers
union last Thursday, although that contract is for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Both deals call for workers to receive annual wage increases of
3 percent plus annual cost of living adjustments nearly equal to
the inflation rate. With Canadian inflation running at close to 2
percent, the union said that this would mean total annual wage
increases would be roughly 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both deals also provide large increases in pension benefits, to
encourage older workers to retire, partly to make way for younger
workers and partly to allow auto workers to reduce their work
forces slowly so as to become more competitive. The Canadian
retirees will receive an immediate, 13.5 percent increase in
monthly pension payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an excellent agreement,'' said Basil Hargrove, the
president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, which represents
13,300 Ford workers in Canada. The union's members will vote on the
agreement on Sunday; similar ratification votes in the past have
been easily approved.
</P>
<P>
   The final issue in the negotiations involved the union's
contention that Ford planned to move the production of minivan
seats in 2002 from a unionized supplier, the Lear Corp., to Magna
International Inc., which is not unionized. Hargrove said that this
issue had not been resolved, and would be the subject of further
talks with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union plans to ask the General Motors Corp. and
DaimlerChrysler to accept similar deals. Hargrove said that the
union had not chosen which company would come next in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's peaceful settlement is a coup for Ford. Canadian
auto workers have a militant tradition of going on strike against
at least one auto maker each time a labor contract expires; the
contract in force for the last three years expired at midnight. The
union has checked its records back to 1970 and found a strike every
time that a contract expired except in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Armstrong, a union spokeswoman, said that she believed that
there had also been strikes after every contract expiration before
1970, going back to the first contracts in the late 1930s, although
the union has not checked its records back that far. The Canadian
Auto Workers union split off from the less militant UAW union and
became independent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian workers have almost always struck the first company
with which their leaders have sought a deal. An exception to that
rule came on the last contract, in 1996, when the Canadian workers
staged a three-week walkout against GM after reaching a
pattern-setting contract with what was then the Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frequency of strikes, auto makers have been willing
to expand their operations in Canada. While auto workers used to
earn the same on both sides of the border, the weakness of the
Canadian dollar in recent years has made auto workers' wages and
other costs there a third lower than in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Another leap in the U.S. trade deficit in July
fueled fears Tuesday that the continuing surge in imports is
threatening the health of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   As the American currency dipped yet again vs. the Japanese yen,
largely because of disappointment over the widening trade gap at
home and inaction by monetary authorities in Tokyo, stocks and
bonds reacted by falling sharply in financial markets. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 225
points, or slightly more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit for July
hit $25.2 billion, higher than the June imbalance of $24.6 billion,
confounding expectations that the deficit would start to shrink as
economic growth picks up around the world. Imports from China,
Western Europe and Japan all hit new highs, well above the
projections of most economists who have followed the trade flows
with increasing concern. And exports advanced only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials sought to put the numbers in
perspective. ``The figures are still not as bad as they were in
1987,'' William Daley, the Commerce secretary, said Tuesday, noting
that in 1987 _ the last time it set a record _ the trade deficit
was 3.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Currently
it is closer to 2.8 percent, but it is rising fast. ``But the
numbers are high enough that they are a political problem, and they
could become an economic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts fear that the steady increase of the trade
imbalance _ expected to hit $250 billion this year _ is
undercutting the value of the dollar as money flows out of the
United States to pay for an apparently insatiable American demand
for imported cars, electronics and luxury goods. A weak dollar,
which makes imports more expensive for consumers, could in turn
contribute to inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to engineer
another increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each new record trade deficit, the dollar grows more
vulnerable,'' said Michael Fenollosa, an international economist
with John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Until this summer, rising imports were generally regarded as
relatively good news in the financial markets. The dollar was
strong, and the influx of relatively inexpensive electronics, auto
parts and other goods served to revive shattered Asian economies
and helped to contain inflation. That contributed to keeping
interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past two months, the calculus has started to
change. While the American economy remains strong, the dollar has
fallen more than 14 percent against the yen since July, far more
than expected. Some analysts have begun to worry that there is no
bottom in sight for the American currency.
</P>
<P>
   And what the markets received Tuesday was a double dose of news
that the challenges may only grow worse: Just before the trade
numbers came out, Japan's central bank declined to take aggressive
steps to reverse the yen's heady rise in value. Those steps might
have only been a stopgap measure. Nonetheless, a message was sent
to investors that the yen would continue to rise, and that message
soon became self-fulfilling. In New York Tuesday, the dollar
settled at 104.87 yen, vs. 106.38 yen on Monday, a significant
shift by the standards of the currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   (In early trading in Tokyo on Wednesday, the dollar strengthened
a bit against the yen.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that there's considerable tension with the
Japanese right now,'' one senior administration official said.
``These are the kinds of shifts that can portend trouble if you
leave them untreated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan's finance minister and former prime minister, Kiichi
Miyazawa, is expected here this weekend for the annual meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and Japan's
strategy for capping the rise of its currency is expected to be the
lead item on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bank of Japan is independent of the government just as
the Federal Reserve is _ and in recent years, as the power of
Miyazawa's finance ministry has waned, the central bank has become
considerably more willing to exercise that independence.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's figures complicate the politics of trade for the
administration on several fronts. The surging imports from China _
the deficit was $6.31 billion in July and is $35.65 billion so far
this year _ greatly complicate the administration's efforts to win
congressional approval of a deal to get China into the World Trade
Organization this year, if negotiations on that deal are wrapped up
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even apart from that, the Republican majority leader in the
House, Dick Armey of Texas, said Tuesday that he doubted that any
deal struck with Beijing would make it through the House. Lawmakers
who ``have a long-term commitment to freedom of trade, they're
saying: `I don't want to go home and face the anger of my
constituents if I vote for this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Daley acknowledged Tuesday that the most disturbing aspect of
the figures was that exports to China are still falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline in our exports to China is difficult to square
with the continued strong growth in their domestic economy,'' he
said. ``China is part of the global marketplace. If China truly
wants to join the World Trade Organization, the Chinese government
must open her markets to foreign goods and services.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures also give fuel to the critics of Vice President Al
Gore. So far the rising trade deficit is the biggest chink in the
administration's economic armor, and Republicans are doing what
they can to exploit the argument that Gore has contributed to a
strategy of running up the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton suggests that such a strategy was in place: He
said in New Zealand last week that the United States deliberately
allowed its trade deficit to rise in an effort to aid the countries
of Asia after the economic crisis that struck in July 1997. But he
did not discuss how to reverse that trend now that their economies
are recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Imports in July surged by 1 percent to a record $104.2 billion,
exceeding the modest rise in exports to $79 billion from $78.6 the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit with Japan slightly exceeded the deficit with China,
at $6.78 billion in July, and $40.37 for the year so far. But the
problem is not only with Asian nations _ trade with Canada and
Mexico, America's partners in the North American Free Trade
Agreement, totaled about a third of the deficit.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ The tradition of causing turnovers is alive and
well at Texas A&AMP;M, where the 1999 version of the Wrecking Crew
defense has come up with six interceptions and three fumble
recoveries that have led to 41 points in two games.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Aggies are averaging 538.5 yards and 49.5 points per game
after easy wins over Louisiana Tech and Tulsa, ranking second in
the NCAA in both categories. The new-look offense is on a roll, but
the defense is at the root of the big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gamble, a redshirt freshman who has worked his way into
the linebacker position vacated by Dat Nguyen, says the turnovers
aren't by coincidence. It's what the defense tries to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mindset for us, the Wrecking Crew mindset,'' said
Gamble, who recovered a fumble in his first game with the Aggies
against Louisiana Tech. ``When you fly around the ball like we do,
good things are going to happen. Turnovers have a chance to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do that, you're helping your offense, putting them in
position to have a short drive. That's definitely part of the
Wrecking Crew defense. We practice every day to cause turnovers.
Whether it's stripping the ball or putting ourselves in position to
get an interception, we're trying to cause them. Turnovers are
game-breakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-ranked Aggies will get their toughest test to date
this season Saturday afternoon when they host Southern Mississippi
at Kyle Field. The Golden Eagles lost 20-13 at Nebraska last week,
with the Cornhuskers needing two touchdowns by their defense to
avoid a major upset.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Aggies will look for this week, a continuation
of the pressure defense that causes turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tradition here. It's encouraged,'' said senior
cornerback Jason Webster, who has two interceptions this season and
five in his career. ``The Wrecking Crew had a tradition of
turnovers, and we're here to carry on that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pride ourselves on three-and-out _ or less if we can get a
fumble or interception _ and getting the offense back out on the
field. We just don't think about stopping teams. We want to help
our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed at Texas A&AMP;M, but there is one big
difference this year in the defense. Gamble, a former two-way star
at Alto High School, has been so active and effective he is now
listed as the starter at strong-side linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   That means Gamble gets the defensive signals from the sideline
and relays them in the huddle. The position of leadership doesn't
faze Gamble in the least. He comes from football stock _ his
father, Lucky, played at Baylor and is the coach at Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable getting in the huddle and talking in the
huddle and being a leader,'' Gamble said. ``I was a quarterback for
three of my four years in high school. I called the defense in high
school, too. I'm used to being vocal. To tell you the truth, I
wouldn't like to be in a position where it wasn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies did not shift their linebacking corps just
because they like Gamble's leadership. They like his ability to
make tackles _ he's tied with Webster for the team lead with 16 _
and his intensity in pursuing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of his collegiate career, Gamble says it
almost seems like something is missing. After playing quarterback
and linebacker in high school, he's not used to resting half the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, because I'm so used to playing both ways that it's
like I've got all this energy left late in the game,'' Gamble said.
``I'm flying around every play. You can bust it every time and
don't have to worry about getting tired in the fourth quarter.
After you play defense, you get to go over to the sideline and
chill out. That's been the easiest thing for me to adjust to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble, 6-2 and 227 pounds, seems a natural for the Wrecking
Crew. During his redshirt season, he impressed the coaching staff
by playing with abandon on the scout team. Wherever the ball was,
Gamble was right there.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies intended to replace Nguyen with Cornelius Anthony,
last year's starter at weak-side linebacker. After Gamble's
excellent showing in the season opener at Louisiana Tech, Anthony
was shifted back to the weak side to give Gamble more playing time.
This week, Gamble is listed as the starter at strong-side
linebacker for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was going to be a good player, so it was really a
matter of finding more playing time for him,'' said Aggies coach
R.C. Slocum. ``If he was playing behind Cornelius, he wasn't going
to be on the field as much as we'd like.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble was the Class 2A defensive player of the year in 1997
after making 212 tackles, including 66 stops behind the line. On
offense, he passed for 1,501 yards and rushed for 1,025, but he
knew defense was his future at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum always has liked players who force the action, and
Gamble's aggressiveness fits into the Aggies' scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our philosophy is having pressure defense, being able
to make something happen on defense,'' Slocum said. ``We kind of
expect that. Part of playing good defense is expecting to knock
balls loose and intercept balls and pick up fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a pretty good history of doing that. I think our
guys go into games expecting to do that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the four-term Democrat
from New York, will endorse former Sen. Bill Bradley for president
Thursday in New York City, potentially providing Bradley a lift in
the state's crucial primary and among Democrats across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement was expected, since Moynihan and Bradley have
been close friends and comrades on a variety of issues, including
tax and welfare policy, since Bradley joined the Senate in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But in scheduling the announcement just before a meeting of the
Democratic National Committee in Washington this weekend, Bradley
seemed intent on sending a message to Democratic leaders from
around the country that his campaign is gaining strength against
the party's presumed front-runner, Vice President Al Gore. Both
candidates are to address the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is on a bit of a roll right now and this just adds to
the momentum,'' said Steve Murphy, a Democratic consultant who is
not allied with either campaign. ``Nationally, it adds a little bit
more political credibility to the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also comes amid a spate of endorsements
released by Gore's campaign in recent days, including support from
California officials, Hispanic leaders and 10 members of Congress
from New York, including the dean of the delegation, Rep. Charles
B. Rangel of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan is the third, and most prominent, senator to endorse
Bradley, who represented New Jersey in the Senate for three terms
before retiring in 1996. The others are Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska
and Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. He has also been endorsed by
one member of the House, Rep. William O. Lipinsky, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been endorsed by more than 100 members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is always difficult to measure the importance of political
endorsements, and with Moynihan, the task is even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been an influential force within the New York state
Democratic Party for years, and thus his endorsement is not likely
to pull a significant number of Democratic officials into the
Bradley camp.
</P>
<P>
   But polls indicate that Moynihan, who is retiring at the end of
next year, remains popular with voters across New York, including
in the more conservative northern and western reaches of the state.
So his support could give Bradley a lift in the New York primary on
March 7, when 292 delegates will be at stake. Many Democrats say
Bradley must win the primary to keep his insurgent campaign alive.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan _ who has been an adviser to four presidents, the
ambassador to India, a Harvard professor and the author of numerous
books _ is also widely regarded as the Senate's reigning
intellectual, and his endorsement could help burnish Bradley's
image with well-educated voters.
</P>
<P>
   More difficult to measure is whether Moynihan will help Bradley
among Democrats who are unhappy with the Clinton administration,
either for policy reasons or because of the president's affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky. Moynihan has often clashed with the Clinton
White House. He disagreed with its health care plan when he was the
chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee. He voted against
the 1996 welfare bill that Clinton points to as a signature
achievement, and after it passed, Moynihan strongly denounced it.
</P>
<P>
   He also applauded Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman's denunciation of
Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky as ``disgraceful'' and
``immoral.'' But Moynihan later voted against convicting Clinton on
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bradley and Gore campaigns, as well as Moynihan's
office, declined to comment on the endorsement. But an official
close to Moynihan said that it more reflected his friendship with
Bradley than discontent with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The two became friends in 1978 when Moynihan endorsed Bradley in
his first campaign for Senate. In the Senate, Moynihan supported
Bradley's efforts to revamp the tax code, which led to the sweeping
Tax Reform Act of 1986, which reduced rates and closed loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   They also cut similar figures in the Senate as somewhat aloof,
thoughtful and academic outsiders who seemed less than comfortable
with the roiling floor battles and partisan politics of legislative
life.
</P>
<P>
   When he endorsed Bradley, a former professional basketball star,
in 1978, Moynihan quoted Woodrow Wilson, saying, ``Men of ordinary
physique and discretion cannot be presidents and live, if the
strain be not somehow relieved. We shall be obligated always to be
picking our chief magistrates from among wise and prudent athletes
_ a small class.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the chairman of Al Gore's presidential
campaign, Tony Coelho routinely meets with wealthy Democratic
fund-raisers to offer encouragement and listen to their views. But
these feel-good pep talks are rarely as blunt or as riveting as the
one held with about two dozen Asian-Americans here late one
afternoon last month.
</P>
<P>
   As several participants later recounted, Victor W. Hwang, a
young lawyer who worked for the Democratic National Committee in
1996, broke the usual pattern of pleasantries and insisted that if
Asian-Americans were to be pressed for millions of dollars in
donations once again they expected clear benefits like prime-time
speakers at the Democratic convention next summer and a firm
promise of a Cabinet-level appointment in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just a warm-up for Mary Miyashita, a highly
regarded Democratic fund-raiser for more than 40 years. Ms.
Miyashita burst into sobs as she asked whether Gore could make a
courtesy telephone call to John Huang, a Chinese American who was
at the center of the furor that erupted over illegal donations by
Asians to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign. Like many
Asian-Americans, Ms. Miyashita feels that Huang was unfairly
vilified in the fund-raising scandal, less because of any
violations of the law than because of his Asian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listened very silently with his head bowed,'' Ms. Miyashita
said, breaking into tears again as she recalled the meeting with
Coelho. ``Maybe I put him on the spot, but it was my personal way
to begin the healing. I don't think it's started yet, but it so
needs to happen because so many people are bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the relatively brief span of one presidential cycle, the role
of Asian-Americans in national politics appears to have changed in
fundamental ways. After years as one of the most financially
generous but underrepresented ethnic minorities in American
politics, many Asian-Americans are nursing deep wounds from what
they regard as a string of insulting scandals. And this time, they
say, things will be different.
</P>
<P>
   There will be less interest in photo opportunities with the
candidates, the groups say, and instead a laserlike focus on
getting more Asian-Americans appointed to positions in Washington
and to judgeships, and on bolstering government efforts to fight
hate crimes and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Asian-Americans say they are now taking
political matters into their own hands by trying to transform the
diverse Asian-American groups into an electoral bloc where the
population is most concentrated, in California, which is also the
biggest prize in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts are backed by a great deal of emotion, too,
because of the shock of the campaign finance scandals. No one
doubts now that some election finance laws were broken by Huang as
well as two political newcomers who had ties to Clinton, Johnny
Chung and Yah Lin Trie. All have pleaded guilty to charges
involving improper political fund-raising and hundreds of thousands
of dollars of donations they solicited had to be returned.
Privately, some Asian-Americans have expressed anger that the
reckless efforts of these people harmed the reputation of the whole
community.
</P>
<P>
   But many Asian-Americans feel that the fund-raising scandals put
anyone with an Asian surname under a humiliating cloud of suspicion
_ with many perfectly legitimate donors receiving calls from the
FBI. They hold both political parties partly responsible. The
Republicans, they say, exploited racist fears for political gain,
while the Democrats did little to openly defend the loyalty and
integrity of Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pain, some Asian-American leaders say the process
was ultimately beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been a great experience,'' said Thomas Chan,
a founder of the newly formed Asian Pacific American Bar
Association of Los Angeles. ``Finally, there's something
galvanizing the Asian-American community. It's sad, but you have to
have an event that shakes people to make them care. There was a
paradigm shift. The focus now has got to be on practical things,
like discrimination in jobs, glass ceilings at work, hate crimes
and the appointment of Asian-Americans to important jobs in the
next administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Coelho is regarded here as a harbinger of some
tough bargaining ahead by the Asian-American groups _ a collection
that includes Americans of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino and
and Vietnamese descent, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were expecting the usual meeting where everyone was real
nice and just said their platitudes,'' Warren Furutani, an aide to
the speaker of the California state Assembly, Antonio Villaraigosa.
``But there is a definite residue of bitterness, and that
bitterness has really created a political vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bitterness, no one is suggesting that the flow of
Asian money into American politics will subside. Furutani and
others said donors will scrutinize candidates more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund raising is a mechanical part of the system, and it can't
be avoided,'' said Henry Tang, an investment banker and the
chairman of the Committee of 100, an influential group of Chinese
Americans in society and the arts. ``But we will be getting into
much more of the philosophical core of the candidates and what
their policies will do for us.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made the campaign finance scandals a particularly
bitter pill to swallow is that Asian-Americans have been one of the
most generous ethnic groups in the country. They contributed, quite
legally, about $10 million in each of the last two presidential
elections, by some estimates, but the money seems to have brought
little open support from the political parties they had financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't completely come to grips with what I would call
maltreatment by both parties,'' Tang said. ``People drew a linkage
between Asians who were breaking the law and Asian-Americans that
was completely unfair. We felt helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were heightened earlier this year when a Chinese
American scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed, on charges
that he had violated security policies by downloading secret data
to an unsecure computer.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was widely reported to be under suspicion of handing over
nuclear secrets to China, but he has not been charged with a crime
and has denied any spying. Adding to the concerns, last month the
former head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos, Robert S.
Vrooman, said that Lee was singled out in large part because of his
race, something the Energy Department denied.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's case has particularly enraged Asian-American scientists
and engineers who had generally steered away from politics and had
felt their work for the national defense would place them above
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing remains the same today,'' said Bill Chang, a former
bank chairman and now the president of the Chinese American
Engineers and Scientists Association of Southern California, which
has about 800 members. ``I do have reports from other scientists,
even professors, that they have suffered some kind of prejudice
since this happened. It is just amazing to many of us. A lot of
times we are looked at not as Americans, but as Chinese, even after
all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Fong, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully against Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., for a U.S. Senate seat in 1998 and is now
a fund-raiser for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said the attacks on
Lee were a catalyst for the new strains of political thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new mood of activism that hadn't existed before, and
it has a different flavor,'' Fong said. ``The different flavor is
Wen Ho Lee. That has caused a far more broad-based chill. What the
community fears is the broad brush strokes, in which everyone of
Chinese ancestry is suspected of spying for China.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, party loyalties are being abandoned and
Asian-Americans are looking to candidates who appear to offer
benefits to their community. Jackson Tai, an investment banker and
a lifelong Republican, said he had abandoned his old party because
of what he felt was its eagerness to fan the flames of Asian
racism. Now, he is raising money for former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bradley has been picking up significant support in some
Asian-American circles, in part because of what he is not: neither
a Republican nor a member of the Clinton administration. ``The
biggest failure was the administration's unwillingness to openly
defend Asian-Americans in the campaign financing scandal,'' said
Dale Minami, who heads the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans,
based in San Francisco, and was a co-chairman of Clinton's northern
California committee in 1992. ``That kind of sticks in the craw of
a lot of Asian-Americans, and will for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he did make a small number of appointments of
Asian-Americans, Clinton is perceived as having not been vocal
enough in supporting them during the scandals. And Gore has his own
problems. He participated in a fund-raiser for Asian-Americans at a
Buddhist temple here in 1996 at which, it was later disclosed, many
improper contributions were made at a venue, a nonprofit religious
institution, where candidates are prohibited from soliciting
donations. Gore's staff returned many of the improper donations,
and some Asian-Americans say they detect a reluctance on his part
to be identified too closely with them.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, a Gore campaign spokeswoman, denied this, saying,
``Absolutely not. This is a community he wants to work with.''
Also, it appears that Gore will address later this fall a
convention of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has endorsed Gore, said she
thinks he will win over many Asian-Americans once they hear his
views, but she conceded he has a problem. ``The vice president,
because of the Buddhist temple thing, may not have wanted to have
ventured forth,'' Feinstein said. ``My own view is that the
community itself needs to come together and speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what many Asian-Americans are doing. They are focused on
the local, grass roots level, and are working on long range plans
to develop a broader base for influence over the political process.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a new group was formed here, called Vision 21, to
quicken the pace of voter registration and to do extensive exit
polling after elections. Much of the polling will be used to
convince candidates of the importance of the Asian-American votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are also efforts to get more Asian residents to become
citizens and, importantly, to find and train potential
Asian-American candidates for public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community needs more facets and dimensions,'' said Don T.
Nakanishi, director of the Asian-American Studies Center at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``One can't participate
effectively with just one means, like giving money.''
</P>
<P>
   Another effort is called the 80/20 Initiative. This is a
campaign to persuade the Asian-American community in California to
vote as a bloc for the candidate _ no matter from which party _ who
demonstrates the strongest commitment to offering tangible policy
benefits. The aim is to get 80 percent of registered Asian-American
voters in the state to back the endorsed candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a completely fanciful strategy. In the 1998
elections here, Fong, a Republican, received nearly 59 percent of
the Asian-American community's vote in his unsuccessful campaign
against Boxer. In the gubernatorial race, 64 percent of
Asian-Americans voted for the Democratic candidate for governor,
Gray Davis, who defeated a Republican candidate perceived to be
anti-immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian-Americans consider the initiative slightly
unrealistic, but at the least a potent symbol of the new mood.
``It's a vehicle for peoples' frustration,'' said Tang of the
Committee of 100. ``80/20 is one of the new arrows in our quiver.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The word naivete is too simple a word for where we
were four years ago. Maybe sophomoric, in terms of the whole
process. We were probably set back 10 years by what happened, but
at least we're far more realistic now.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Releasing a report showing that President Clinton's
travels to Africa, China and Chile had cost the government $72.1
million, the Senate's third-ranking Republican accused the
president Tuesday of traveling overseas to an extent that was
``almost abusive of the right and the privilege and the
responsibility'' of his office.
</P>
<P>
   The draft study by the General Accounting Office of three of
Clinton's overseas trips was made public by Sen. Larry E. Craig of
Idaho, along with Sens. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Craig Thomas
of Wyoming, who are also Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who is chairman of the Senate Republican Policy
Committee, pointed in particular to the president's six-nation tour
of Africa last year because it cost $42.8 million and involved more
than 1,300 government officials who accompanied the president and
his delegation or went ahead as advance teams. The total does not
include Secret Service security expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that's an awful high price tag to pay for an
apology,'' Craig said, apparently referring to Clinton's speech in
Uganda in which he expressed regret for the role of the United
States in African slavery. Clinton also spoke of a list of errors
in American policy toward Africa, like embracing dictators as
allies during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters to further explain his remark, Craig said:
``I'm not saying we shouldn't express that point of view. I'm
saying it's a very costly way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Congressional Black Caucus, many of whom
accompanied Clinton on the Africa trip, took issue with Craig's
remark about a costly apology and asked why the senators had not
looked at the costs of the president's trips to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot measure in dollars and cents the value that this
historic trip by a president of the United States had to Africans
throughout the continent,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., ``and
how proud it made African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., said Craig's remark ``reflects a
profound lack of sensitivity to the history of our two continents,
which speaks volumes about the Republican Party as we head into the
next election season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican news conference was the latest salvo from a
Republican Congress now investigating the 1993 siege at Waco, the
president's granting of clemency to Puerto Rican nationalists and
Clinton's Russia policy.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that the General Accounting Office report had been
commissioned long ago and that the timing of its release had been
coincidental. But he added, ``If the house of cards is crumbling, I
would suggest that while it may be a brick at a time, it will bring
a whole wall down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, as the senators noted, has traveled to 59 countries as
president. The three men said they had asked the accounting office
to focus on the three trips in particular because of news accounts
that they were expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The study of the costs of presidential travel was released as
Republican leaders in Congress were struggling to find a way to cut
spending bills to the levels required by the 1997 balanced budget
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The senators Tuesday blamed Clinton for some of their problems,
noting that much of the financing for his trips came from military
readiness accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember in the closing days of our military engagement over
Kosovo, we ran out of smart bombs?'' Craig said. ``The amount of
money on these three trips would have acquired 3,000 smart bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions said the $60 million the trips had cost the Pentagon
could have been used for things like military recruitment, or
veterans affairs or to give men and women in uniform extra money so
that they would no longer need to rely on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Defense paid 88 percent of the estimated
costs of the Africa trip, 83 percent of the Chilean trip and 74
percent of the trip to China right out of our defense budget,''
Sessions said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, Tuesday staunchly
defended the president's overseas travel, saying the trips ``more
than pay for themselves.'' He said, ``One-third of the 20 million
new jobs created in this country under this administration comes
from increased exports. The president has been very aggressive
about opening markets so that jobs can be created here at home.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lockhart said that much of the costs incurred by the Pentagon
were for secure communication and physical security. He said that
in Africa in particular the Pentagon had had to create a system for
security and secure communications.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office found that the Pentagon had spent about
$37.7 million on the Africa trip, with the bulk of the costs going
for ``passenger and strategic lift'' and refueling. The airlift and
refueling missions were made to transport 13 Army and Marine Corps
helicopters. The Pentagon also deployed troops to provide medical
services and aircraft maintenance and to erect temporary aviation
sites and accommodations for travel in Africa.

ADVERTISING: CAMEL'S KINDLER, GENTLER CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most unusual recent campaigns for a mainstream
consumer product is being replaced with a series of softer, less
confrontational advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1998, a brash, unconventional campaign carrying the
deliberately hyperbolic theme ``Mighty tasty!'' has peddled the
Camel line of cigarettes sold by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. The
oddball, almost surreal ads, created by Mezzina/Brown in New York,
have mocked the anti-tobacco movement and celebrated those who
continue to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement ads by the same agency, which are scheduled to
begin appearing this week as October issues of magazines reach
newsstands, take a different tack. Rather than lampooning critics
of smoking, they seek attention with a playful commemoration of the
Camel brand's history, which dates to 1913, as well as a new theme,
``Pleasure to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift is indicative of the increasingly frequent changes in
campaigns for products marketed in the mass media. The goal for
such ads is to remain fresh and appealing to avoid a fate that may
be worse than alienating consumers: boring them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found the `Mighty tasty!' campaign highly successful with
adult smokers, who appreciated it as a spoof of many of the social
conventions of our time,'' said Fran Creighton, marketing vice
president for Camel at R.J. Reynolds in Winston-Salem, N.C., a unit
of RJR Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign ``is a `re-expression' of what Camel is
about,'' she added, ``an authentic, original brand with an
irreverent personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the change, Ms. Creighton said, was ``our
ability to meet the challenge of getting our message across in all
the media available to us'' now that limits on cigarette
advertising, which started in November, rule out billboards and
other outdoor posters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Pleasure to burn'' ads are simpler, less graphically busy
and thus more likely to ``telegraph their message'' than the
``Mighty tasty!'' campaign, she added, making them more appropriate
for the remaining venues for cigarette advertising: print, direct
mail and signs in stores, bars and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mighty tasty!'' campaign, shot by David LaChapelle, the
fashion photographer, in bright, saturated colors, featured some of
the most offbeat images and characters ever created by Madison
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``politically incorrect parade'' with floats
promoting meat, beer and Camels; a tribe of cannibal women cooking
``man stew''; a prisoner who escapes from his cell by fashioning a
dummy from scores of Camel packs; a man and woman held captive by a
lizardlike alien that keeps them happy by providing them with
Camels; a maid who brazenly flicks her cigarette ash into the meal
she is cooking for her stuffy rich employers, and a family racing
to a bomb shelter as a giant meteor hurtles earthward, their arms
overflowing with cartons of Camels.
</P>
<P>
   With so many of the ads being centered on flattering smokers by
portraying them as defiant rebels, laughing at trouble, danger and
even death, the subtext seemed to paraphrase the last line of a
Dorothy Parker poem, ``You might as well smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the prisoner ad was a sly reminder that prison is one
of the few indoor public facilities that still permit smoking, Ms.
Creighton replied, laughing: ``I don't know. I haven't been
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign even offered outlandish versions of the warning
labels affixed to films and television shows admonishing ``viewer
discretion advised.'' For instance, ``package tampering'' and
``self-parole'' were among the fake advisories for the prison ad,
while the maid was flagged for ``premeditated ashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained that the make-believe advisories subtly
mocked the surgeon general's warnings against smoking required on
all cigarette packs and ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly trying to undercut the authority of the surgeon
general,'' said Bob Garfield, the ad critic for the trade
publication Advertising Age, ``and clearly aimed at people below
age who are encouraged to flout authority.'' In a review in July
1998, Garfield castigated the campaign as ``Mighty nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the ``Pleasure to burn'' ads are mild as May, to
quote an old slogan for a Camel competitor, Marlboro. The idea is
to ``mix the contemporary and classic with a little bit of fun,''
Ms. Creighton said, ``looking for characters who represent all the
decades of Camel's popularity'' who are ``celebrating the heritage
of the brand yet relevant to today.''
</P>
<P>
   The device used in the new ads, which are hand-painted and
airbrushed for a vintage effect, is a graphic game that could be
called ``find the anachronism.'' The first two ads show images
seemingly from the 1930s or 1940s, a leggy pinup girl talking on
the phone and a man in a trenchcoat and battered fedora. But on
closer inspection, the reader notices that the phone she is using
is cellular and he is wearing a small gold earring.
</P>
<P>
   After the new ads were described to Garfield, he said: ``I'd
find it difficult to quibble with that, short of someone finding
some similarity to `what's wrong with this picture?' in Highlights
for Children. To a degree that looking for the little anachronisms
gets people involved, it can only improve the advertising.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Creighton said that criticism of the ``Mighty tasty!''
campaign had nothing to do with its discontinuation because ``we
got very positive feedback from our smokers as well as smokers of
competitive brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Camel line has risen to No. 4 among all American
brands in shipments for the first eight months of 1999, compared
with seventh for the full year 1998 and sixth for the full year
1997.
</P>
<P>
   While the market share for Camel products like Camel Lights and
Camel Menthol has remained flat, shipments for brands that had
ranked ahead of Camel like GPC and Basic have slipped. Camel is now
the second-largest R.J. Reynolds brand, behind Doral but ahead of
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Creighton declined to discuss spending for the ``Pleasure to
burn'' campaign. Ad spending rose substantially in 1998, to $77.9
million, from $61.4 million a year earlier, according to
Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks advertising expenditures.
For the first six months of 1999, ad spending declined to $24
million from $34.8 million in the corresponding period of 1998.

TWO HOME RUNS BY JONES POWER BRAVES TO 2-1 VICTORY OVER METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves entered this series one game ahead
of the Mets, but well behind the image of invincibility they had
constructed during this decade. As their disabled list began to
look like an overstuffed social registry for baseball players, the
Braves had struggled to hold off the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   When Chipper Jones stepped to the plate in the bottom of the
eighth inning, his first-inning home run having produced Atlanta's
early lead before the Mets tied the score in the third inning,
first place in the National League East rested on his bat. There
really was no other appropriate way for the first game of this
series to be decided: the Mets' bullpen, one of the best in the
league, against one of the league's best players.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had replaced Turk Wendell with Dennis Cook to face
Jones, trading a pitcher who had given up four hits to Jones this
season for a pitcher who had yielded just one. But on a 1-1 pitch,
Jones smacked his second home run of the night _ they came from
different sides of the plate _ to give the Braves a 2-1 lead and a
victory that boosts them to two games ahead of the Mets in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   As are so many games involving the Braves, this one was
determined by pitching, but not the kind normally expected of the
Braves. If the names sounded familiar, then the results did not.
This was a matchup of two pitchers struggling to reestablish
themselves at the tail end of what had been unexpectedly
disappointing seasons. The aces will come later in the series with
a glamour matchup in the third game; this was one for the gritty
working stiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed's season had been marred by injuries to his calf and
finger, interrupting what had been an uneven season, at best. On
July 25, he held the Braves to one run in 6 and one-third innings,
but opposing batters are hitting almost .300 against him this
season and he has walked more batters than he had in his previous
two season. The finger injury that put him on the 15-day disabled
list for most of August had sent him on an even more tortuous quest
for consistency.
</P>
<P>
   In his two starts, both no decisions, since his return, he had a
6.30 earned run average and Bobby Valentine was convinced that Reed
was leaving his pitches up. Reed disagreed and Valentine dropped
Octavio Dotel from his six-man rotation rather than Reed, but it
was no surprise when Jones, the Braves' most valuable player
candidate, and the third batter Reed faced, hit his 42d home run of
the season on a 2-1 pitch that Reed left up in the strike zone to
give the Braves a quick 1-0 lead. It looked like an inevitably long
night for Reed and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But John Smoltz is not the same pitcher who once won the Cy
Young. For one thing, he doesn't even look the same, having
completely remade himself into a side-armer to alleviate the
chronic pain in his right elbow when he pitches. His results have
not been the same, either and that has been astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz was 9-8 with a 3.51 ERA entering the game, but since
changing his motion Aug. 9, he is 1-3 with four no decisions and a
3.38 ERA. Valentine said none of Smoltz's pitches even looked
similar to what he used to throw _he called Smoltz's remolding
``remarkable'' _ and that he hoped the Mets would approach Smoltz
as an entirely new pitcher, one they had never seen before. Smoltz
walked two batters in the first two innings, but did not allow a
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally got to him in the third, when Rey Ordonez
singled to center field. Reed struck out, but Rickey Henderson hit
a line drive single to center and Edgardo Alfonzo hit a shot that
tipped off shortstop Jose Hernandez's glove and rolled into center
as Ordonez came around to tie the score 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Reed had settled down, and, although still
inconsistent, he showed his best stuff since his return. With
pitches routinely clocked in the low to mid-90s and his pitches
staying down, in the second inning, he allowed two singles, but
also struck out three. In the third, he struck out Bret Boone, the
number two hitter, and caught line drives from leadoff hitter
Gerald Williams and Jones. Reed had not made it past the sixth
inning in his two starts since coming off the disabled list, but,
after the second, he got ahead of almost every hitter he faced.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow a runner into scoring position until the sixth,
when Ryan Klesko slapped a one-out double down the left-field line
and moved to third on a wild pitch. But Reed got Andruw Jones to
fly out to right field _ it was the seventh out recorded by the
outfield on a gusty night _ to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets fared no better against Smoltz. After the run scored in
the third inning, the Mets had only two baserunners through the
sixth, and Mike Piazza's baserunning snafu after he hit a one-out
single _ he stepped off first when Robin Ventura lined out to
second baseman Bret Boone, who then threw to first for the double
play _ ended that threat abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   But with the game deadlocked _ and Reed having thrown 106
pitches in six innings _ Valentine pinch hit for Reed in the
seventh. Reed had done all the Mets could have hoped. In six
innings, he had shown the control that had eluded him recently,
giving up just one run and striking out six with no walks. With two
out and Roger Cedeno having walked to first, Bonilla _ who was
batting .280 against Smoltz with four doubles _ smacked a double to
the right field wall. But the hard-hit shot got to the wall quickly
and right fielder Gerald Williams got there just as fast. Cedeno
had to hold up at third.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Henderson, who had singled and doubled already, to
the plate. He took Smoltz to a full count. But Smoltz threw
Henderson high heat and Henderson swung and missed to end the
inning. He pitched seven innings, allowing just the one run on six
hits, with three walks and six strikeouts.

PETTITTE SHARP AS YANKEES DROP WHITE SOX, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The infamous right-center-field bleachers were almost
empty Tuesday night as fewer than 100 people paid $7 to sit in
soggy seats and watch the best team in the American League play. It
was a blustery night, and the rain that had fallen throughout the
day put the game between the Yankees and the White Sox in peril. At
least that was what the normal bleacher denizens must have thought.
</P>
<P>
   But the rain stopped, a blue tarp was removed from the field and
the Yankees began their final home stand of the regular season with
a game that was more important than some fans realized. The Yankees
are virtually guaranteed to reach the postseason, but they are
still trying to clinch a division title and still trying to
maintain the finest record in the league, serious goals for a team
that has not won anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the precise way Andy Pettitte pitched and the
intelligent way the Yankees played in the 3-1 victory, the Yankees
displayed how crucial this game was to their future. If the Yankees
want to subdue the Red Sox in the AL East and remain ahead of the
Indians and the Rangers for home-field advantage during the
playoffs, they must treat every night the way they treated Tuesday
night. As if it is already October.
</P>
<P>
   That was how Pettitte pitched. Other than Carlos Lee's homer in
the second, Pettitte allowed no runs on five hits to the White Sox
over seven and one third innings. When Pettitte's cut fastball is
really operating, he treats runners on base like dust beneath his
cleats. That was what happened Tuesday night as Pettitte held the
White Sox to no hits in eight at-bats with runners on base,
destroying rally attempts and winning for the seventh time in his
last 10 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   With Paul O'Neill delivering two runs, the Yankees won for the
sixth time in their last seven games and stayed three games ahead
of the Red Sox, who also won. The Yankees (91-59) kept a one-half
game edge over the Indians (91-60) for the top record in the league
as Cleveland also won. Even with bleachers barren, these games are
still important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you play for the Yankees, if you don't win, it's
disappointing,'' said David Cone, who was talking about winning the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   After James Baldwin had tamed the Yankees on three hits in the
first four innings, Ricky Ledee and the rookie D'Angelo Jimenez,
who started at third base for Scott Brosius, stroked back-to-back
singles to start the fifth. With runners on first and third, Joe
Girardi pushed a beautiful bunt along the first-base line. Ledee
did not leave third until the ball was bunted successfully and he
easily scored to even the score, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi, who peeked toward third as soon as the bunt was down,
was greeted in the dugout like a player who had just ripped a
two-run homer after his team-best sixth sacrifice hit of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch lined a sharp single to left field, but Jimenez
was nailed at the plate by about eight feet when Darrin Jackson
made a powerful throw home.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees continued attacking Baldwin and Derek Jeter
reached first on a single into the shortstop hole to put runners on
first and third. O'Neill, who had slammed his bat and his helmet
after third baseman Craig Wilson made a leaping catch on his liner
in the third, rocketed a ball to where it could not be caught. It
was close. O'Neill's shot to right-center was almost grabbed by
Magglio Ordonez, but he was tentative in the wet grass and the ball
nicked off his glove for a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   With the two runs batted in, O'Neill has 100 and has knocked in
at least 100 for three straight years. O'Neill, who revealed last
week that he wanted to play one more year with the Yankees before
retiring after the 2000 season, has been hitting like someone who
has a lot of productive years left.
</P>
<P>
   In O'Neill's last nine games, he has 6 homers and 19 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson replaced Pettitte with a runner on first and one out
in the eighth and retired two straight batters, pumping his arms
like a chain saw as he returned to the dugout. Mariano Rivera, the
invincible closer, handled the ninth for his 42d save and the
Yankees moved closer to attaining some serious goals.

HEWLETT-PACKARD IN DEAL WITH ORACLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hewlett-Packard Co., long a laggard behind Sun
Microsystems and IBM in computer systems for electronic commerce,
took a step toward strengthening its Internet presence with the
announcement Tuesday of a deal with Oracle Corp. to collaborate on
developing and selling Oracle's electronic commerce software on
Hewlett-Packard computers.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said it would make HP-UX, Hewlett-Packard's version of
the Unix operating system, a ``strategic development platform'' for
all of Oracle's e-business software applications. In practical
terms, this should ensure that each new version of Oracle's
software runs as well on Hewlett-Packard's computers as it does on
machines made by Sun, Hewlett-Packard's archrival in the network
and Internet server market.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement of Oracle, the clear leader in software for
electronic commerce, is key to Hewlett-Packard's Internet products,
which it calls ``e-services.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefit to Oracle is less clear, but it could give a boost
to the company's new customer relationship management applications,
or CRM, which manage tasks like sales contacts and service calls.
Hewlett-Packard has agreed to use and co-sell the Oracle Sales
component of Oracle's CRM suite of software programs. Oracle has
said it views CRM as a major growth driver for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of broad market downturns, Hewlett-Packard shares
closed at $99.375, down $4.6875, on the New York Stock Exchange,
while Oracle shares closed at $44.50, down 62.5 cents, in NASDAQ
trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are together addressing the CRM market first because it is
the fastest-growing market today,'' Carly Fiorina,
Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executive officer, said at a
press conference at the company's Palo Alto headquarters Tuesday
morning. ``This is a major shift from the way Hewlett-Packard has
done business in the past when we were more of a Switzerland,
partnering with everybody. Today we are making a clear choice.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first major announcement from Hewlett-Packard since
Ms. Fiorina took the company's reins in July. It is part of a
strategy articulated by Ann Livermore, president of the enterprise
computing division, to announce a new strategic partnership every
week, emphasizing deals designed to irritate Sun and IBM and
counter the perception of Hewlett-Packard as the also-ran of the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Earle, Hewlett-Packard's senior vice president and chief
marketing officer for the enterprise computing division, noted that
the company's stock price had doubled since the e-services strategy
was announced. ``The Internet aura has been successfully applied to
HP,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal helped Hewlett-Packard at the expense of
Sun, which every year sells billions of dollars worth of servers
running Oracle's database software. But Gary Bloom, Oracle's
executive vice president, insisted the company would not emphasize
one hardware platform over another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the close relationship with Sun has changed at
all,'' Bloom said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said the major benefit to Oracle would be adding
Hewlett-Packard's sales force to the marketing of its customer
relationship management software. ``I get a virtual extension of
the Oracle sales organization,'' he said.

IN SENATE PARADOX, DEMOCRATS STALL CLINTON NOMINEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Tuesday added a new chapter to the
strange and complex history of judicial politics as Republicans
tried and failed to end a Democratic effort to block votes on three
of President Clinton's nominees to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were Democrats blocking the nominees of a Democratic
president, but White House officials were sympathetic to their
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the convoluted political maneuvering is a complaint
shared by the Senate Democrats and the White House that most of
President Clinton's nominees have been languishing in the Senate.
At the same time, Senate Democrats and the White House insist, the
Republicans are pushing through with extraordinary speed the
nomination of Ted Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who is one of the three nominees being held up, is a
Utah Republican and friend of Sen. Orrin Hatch, also a Utah
Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Clinton
nominated Stewart last July as a courtesy to Hatch, hoping that the
gesture would encourage the Republicans to move swiftly on some of
Clinton's other nominees, the ones he really wants to put on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   It was meant to be a a classic political bargain to get things
going, but both sides seem to have taken away a different
understanding of the terms of the deal. A result of Tuesday's
stalemate, several senators agreed, is the potential to end
consideration of all judicial nominations until after the
presidential election of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has been adamant that Stewart must be confirmed to a
federal district court seat in Utah before others are considered. A
Clinton administration official said this week that it was
fundamentally unfair that Stewart, nominated barely two months ago,
gets a vote in the Senate while other nominees have waited for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict intensified Tuesday as the Republicans tried to
invoke cloture, a procedure to force a vote on the Stewart
nomination and end the threat of a filibuster, an extended debate.
The vote, along party lines, was 55 to 44, leaving the Republicans
five votes short of the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a filibuster and a cloture vote have rarely
occurred in judicial nomination fights. Even during the hotly
contested Supreme Court nominations of Robert H. Bork in 1987 and
Clarence Thomas in 1991, no filibuster was even contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Baker, the Senate historian, said the procedure seems
to have been used on only a handful of occasions in the Senate's
history. Although there was no filibuster threat in the cases of
Bork or Thomas, cloture was invoked, for example, in 1971 to force
a vote on President Nixon's nomination of William H. Rehnquist, now
the chief justice, to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republicans failed in their cloture attempt, the
Democrats tried and failed to force votes on two Clinton nominees
they say should be considered before Stewart. Republicans used
their majority to block votes on Marsha L. Berzon and Richard A.
Paez to fill seats on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Paez, a district court judge, has waited more than four years
for a floor vote, setting a record. Democrats have argued that the
Republicans are opposed to him, and would rather kill the
nomination by simply never bringing up his nomination rather than
allowing a vote that would leave them in the politically difficult
position of opposing a Hispanic jurist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berzon has waited about three years to be considered by the
full Senate.

NO GAIN SEEN IN SEAT BELTS ON SCHOOL BUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., La., Calif.)  (jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding seat belts to school buses will cause
additional head injuries and probably additional deaths in some
crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday, and
instead it recommended better padding to protect the students.
</P>
<P>
   While the safety board's findings are influential, they have no
regulatory authority and the announcement will have no legal power
over New York and New Jersey, the only two states that currently
require seat belts on school buses.
</P>
<P>
   School buses built since 1977 rely for safety not on seat belts,
but on closely spaced seats with high, padded seat backs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been growing agitation for belts: For the last
seven years, New Jersey has required that the belts be installed on
new buses and, where installed, that students use them; New York
has required their installation on new buses for 12 years. Florida
and Louisiana will require their installation on new buses in a few
years. California's Legislature just passed a school bus seat belt
law, although Gov. Gray Davis has not said if he would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   But engineers determined in a study that was unanimously
endorsed by the five board members Tuesday that the belts, by
holding a child's pelvis firmly in place, allowed the torso to
crack like a whip, with a child's head striking a seat back or a
hard object with greater force than if the child's whole body had
been thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been unable to determine if there is going to be a
safety benefit derived from those seat belts,'' said Joseph
Osterman, director of highway safety at the board, who noted that
the severity of head impact is a major predictor of the likelihood
of death.
</P>
<P>
   Lap belts alone are clearly a problem, investigators said. And
lap-shoulder combinations are not much better, because the forces
pushing sideways in bus crashes are often much stronger than in
passenger cars and can shake a body loose from the shoulder belt.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the board, James E. Hall, said that the close
spacing of seats with padded seat backs, called
compartmentalization, ``appears to work very well in the frontal
crash,'' but is not adequate for side-impact and roll-over crashes.
He added that ``the only way to reach additional safety benefits is
with the redesign of the seats.''
</P>
<P>
   That could include arm rests, ceiling pads, making the seat
backs even higher, or molding the seats and seat backs, now flat
slabs, to the human form, and covering them with something less
slippery, board engineers said. One problem, they said, is that
molding the seats might reduce their capacity to two children a
seat, from three.
</P>
<P>
   While the board found the evidence ambiguous enough to avoid
recommending the belts, it also was not persuaded to endorse taking
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Both board officials said that school buses are a safe form of
transportation, with an average of nine deaths a year, and that
even with better protection against side impacts and roll overs,
there would still be five or so deaths annually.
</P>
<P>
   One side effect of the low death rate, officials said, is a
sketchy database. Investigators said they could not find accidents
involving belt-equipped buses to analyze, so instead they had
resorted to models of accidents in which students had been killed
or badly hurt, and used a computer to determine what would have
happened if they had been wearing belts.

EXUBERANT SERGIO GARCIA COULD BREAK HEARTS OF HIS AMERICAN FANS AT
RYDER CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids, especially ``ni$os'', say the darndest things. Art
Linkletter drove home that point on network television in the 1950s
and 1960s. He even wrote a book about it.
</P>
<P>
   But no one, least of all U.S. Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw,
saw this request coming. It happened in May at the Memorial
Tournament, when Sergio Garcia offered an introduction and a
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 19, is known simply as ``El Ni$o'' (The Kid) to fans in
his native Spain. Throughout Europe, the youngest player in Ryder
Cup history is acclaimed as the visiting team's shining hope to
keep the trophy on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean when the
33rd Ryder Cup matches conclude Sunday at The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Back in May, however, Garcia was merely three tournaments into
his professional career. He was playing week-to-week on sponsor's
exemptions and working every angle to gain access into high-profile
events. That's why he tracked down Crenshaw at Muirfield Village
Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over and looked at me with that baby face and said,
`Mr. Crenshaw, this is the first time I meet you,' '' Crenshaw
recalled. `` `I have played well enough to be on the U.S. PGA Tour.
Would you pick me on your Ryder Cup team?' That says everything
about Sergio. He is so endearing. How could you not love this
kid?''
</P>
<P>
   For a fleeting moment, Crenshaw found himself hating those pesky
Ryder Cup rules mandating that members of his U.S. squad must be
born in America or be the child of U.S. citizens. Imagine, as
Crenshaw did, heading to the first tee for Friday's opening match,
with Garcia and Tiger Woods paired together in an alternate-shot
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, professional golf's most engaging, emotional players
are destined to be adversaries during Ryder Cup week. This could
create a quandary for galleries at The Country Club. American fans
have become so smitten with the smiling, bubbly Garcia that most
gallery members cheered against Woods _ the PGA Tour's top gate
attraction _ and for Garcia during the final round of the PGA
Championship on Aug. 15 in Medinah, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like I was an American, or more than that,'' said
Garcia, who finished second to Woods by one stroke. ``The crowds
were amazing. Inside of me, I felt like I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia hoisted no hardware that day. But he captured the
imagination of the golf world with his blend of youthful
exuberance, guts, guile, creativity and ability. In many ways, said
Tom Lehman, Garcia reminds veteran players of his mentor, Seve
Ballesteros. But with a refreshing twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio is Seve with a smile,'' Lehman said. ``That's really
what he is. He's a very creative and swashbuckling kind of a
charismatic guy. You can't help but just love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's road to becoming the youngest competitor in Ryder Cup
history reads like a Hollywood script that would be rejected for
being sappier than ``Rocky'', and less realistic. The son of a club
golf professional in Borriol, Spain, Garcia began playing at 3, won
his club championship at 12 and was European amateur champ at 15.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he earned low-amateur honors at the Masters
Tournament before turning professional April 22 at the Spanish Open
in Barcelona. In his first PGA Tour event as a pro, the GTE Byron
Nelson Classic, Garcia tied for third and won $144,000. He claimed
his first professional victory July 4, at the European Tour's Irish
Open, and posted his best career finish in a major championship by
finishing as the runner-up to Woods at the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's $378,000 payday from the PGA provided the boost he
needed to clinch a spot on the European Ryder Cup team despite
spotting fellow competitors an eight-month head start in
accumulating points toward an automatic berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, to be honest, has probably been a little over my
expectations,'' Garcia said. ``But I really love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia began eliciting that emotion at the PGA, where his
miraculous par save at the 16th hole in the final round. With his
ball nestled next to a tree root in the right rough, Garcia ignored
the advice of caddie Jerry Higginbotham to chip safely to the
fairway and play for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he shaped a slicing shot around the tree with a 6-iron.
Because he feared a ricochet, Garcia turned his head and closed his
eyes as he swung. The ball zipped through a narrow opening, covered
the 189 yards to the green and stopped 40 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia began sprinting up the fairway as he followed its path,
jumping for joy as it stopped on the putting surface. He doffed his
cap to cheering fans, then smiled and covered his heart in mock
cardiac arrest, like Redd Foxx on ``Sanford &AMP; Son''.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the running and jumping, Garcia said: ``I'll
probably do it till I can't. I was so excited, that was the first
thing that came from me. When I won't be able to do that, I'll
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a career-threatening injury, that leaves Garcia three
decades worth of similar spontaneous outbursts before reaching the
more sedate surroundings of the Senior Tour. Considering their
respective ages, Garcia joins the 23-year-old Woods on the short
list of players most likely to challenge Nick Faldo's career
records for Ryder Cup matches played (46), victories (23) and
points scored (25).
</P>
<P>
   He'll get his first opportunity at The Country Club, where
Garcia said he is not nervous and would like to butt heads with the
world's top-ranked player in singles, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play Tiger,'' Garcia said. ``When I turned pro, I
wanted to be the No. 1 golfer in the world. So I knew that meant I
was going to be a rival for Tiger. We might as well get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers anticipate a long series of head-to-head encounters
because the two share more than youth, long drives and a
willingness to display emotion between the gallery ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most impressive thing about Sergio is that when you look
at his irons and there's hardly a quarter-inch of clubface worn
away at the center. He hits the ball that squarely,'' said David
Feherty, a CBS golf analyst and member of Europe's 1991 Ryder Cup
team. ``Sergio and Tiger do that better than anyone in the game
today. It's like Tiger raised the bar and Sergio is going to jump
over it.''

   Then, of course, there are the intangibles. Crenshaw, normally
an eloquent speaker, gets tongue-tied on the subject of Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can come up with enough adjectives for
this kid,'' Crenshaw said. ``He's something that we've never seen.
You watch him and think, `What do you have to do to beat this guy?'
He's incredible. This is magic, here.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's only regret is that Ryder Cup rules dictate that ``El
Ni$o'' must wave his magic wand against the U.S. team, rather than
for it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Wagner, a director and choreographer who worked in
theater, dance and television, died on Sept. 12 in the Health Park
Care Center in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 77 and lived on Sanibel
Island, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of multiple myeloma, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner was perhaps best known for his work at the International
School of Dance at Carnegie Hall in New York, where he taught
modern jazz movement for more than 25 years. Among his students
were Chita Rivera, Rita Moreno, Shirley Jones and innumerable
Broadway dancers. He also taught at the International Dance
Festival in Cologne, Germany, and at the Royal Danish Ballet in
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   His theatrical credits included ``New Faces of 1968,''
``Hallelujah Baby'' and ``Comes a Day.'' He also directed and
choreographed several productions at the Jones Beach Theater,
including ``Damn Yankees'' with Joe Namath, ``West Side Story'' and
``The Sound of Music.'' Wagner was also director and choreographer
for Julius Monk's cabaret theater, Upstairs at the Downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he lived and worked on Sanibel Island, where he
wrote about arts and entertainment for the weekly The Islander.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marsha Reynolds; a daughter, Lisa
Wagner Lieb, of London; two brothers, Cecil, of Pennington, N.J.,
and Jerry, of Williamstown, W. Va.; a sister, Rhoda Triplett, of
Marietta, Ohio; and two grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: KOFI ANNAN'S CRITIQUE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 22:
</P>
<P>
   This century's last General Assembly debate at the United
Nations opens as a U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping force lands in East
Timor. The timing is appropriate, because the U.N.'s role in
conflicts around the world is perhaps the most important _ and most
complex _ issue facing the institution today. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan made U.N. intervention the subject of a provocative
opening speech on Monday. It should focus attention on a growing
consensus that the world cannot simply watch mass slaughter when
effective action is possible to prevent or stop future Kosovos and
East Timors.
</P>
<P>
   The problem Annan outlined is that the globe is bubbling with
internal conflicts that make civilians the victims of their own
governments, armed forces or guerrilla groups. Although
intervention by outside forces cannot halt the killings in every
afflicted country, it can in many cases. Since the world's failure
to prevent genocide in Rwanda in 1994, the feeling has grown that a
state's sovereignty should not allow it to brutalize its own people
when effective intervention is possible.
</P>
<P>
   This page has long been cautious about the use of American
troops abroad and will continue to be so, especially when there is
no clear security interest involved. But in today's world, civil
war and genocidal conflicts can be broadly destabilizing, and it is
often in the American interest to be one participant among many in
a well-designed U.N. peacekeeping force rather than face constant
pressure to lead an intervention or go in alone. In 1994, the
United States blocked action in Rwanda. Today, it is usually Russia
or China that does the blocking. Both countries are wary of
endorsing uninvited intervention in internal conflicts lest they
become targets for their own actions in Chechnya and Tibet. The
United States and Western Europe rightly used NATO to intervene in
Kosovo when it became clear that Russia or China would veto a U.N.
action.
</P>
<P>
   Annan criticized the NATO bombing, but recognized that such
regional approaches _ which lack the worldwide credibility of
U.N.-endorsed actions _ are bound to continue as long as the
Security Council cannot unite. He stopped short of recommending
reform of the Council's veto powers or its composition, which still
reflects the balance of world power after World War II. Such issues
deserve discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Less controversially, Annan extolled preventive measures to
reduce the need for interventions. He cited the international
tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia as one useful step
to deter future war crimes. There are numerous cases where
diplomacy has succeeded, for example in averting a war between Iran
and Afghanistan last year. A peacekeeping force on the border
between Macedonia and Kosovo before the war there successfully kept
Kosovo's tensions from spreading, and other peacekeeping missions
keep old conflicts from escalating into new wars. U.N.
peacekeeping, however, has been crippled by Washington's failure to
pay its U.N. dues. Prevention, sadly, lacks the urgency to win
financing and attention.
</P>
<P>
   When the 20th century began, civilians accounted for 15 percent
of war casualties. Today the figure is 90 percent, mainly because
most wars today are not international conflicts waged by armies on
a battlefield, but internal conflicts fought in streets and
villages. This has made intervention both more difficult, as claims
of sovereignty have trumped humanitarian considerations, and more
urgent. At last, the world's conscience is catching up with the
changing nature of war. The challenge for the U.N., as Annan points
out, is to find ways to honor what that conscience urges.

TAIWAN'S CHIP PLANTS LEFT IDLE BY EARTHQUAKE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The earthquake that shook Taiwan has also shaken up the global
semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, the world's No. 4 chip producer, has a 5 percent share
of the world's chip market and its annual revenue of $8.4 billion
is expected to reach $43 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Factories and transportation links serving Hsinchu Science Park,
the Silicon Valley of Taiwan, were unscathed by the quake early
Tuesday. But a widespread power failure shut down foundries and
caused substantial losses in chips partway through the
manufacturing process, which must now be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research Inc. of San Jose,
Calif., which tracks the semiconductor industry, said the result
was likely to be higher prices, both for chips and personal
computers, as companies start hoarding chips in response to the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of semiconductor makers supplied by Taiwan fell Tuesday,
along with other technology companies in a broad market decline.
Motorola was off $2.8125, to $87.875; National Semiconductor fell
$1.8125, to $34.125, and Broadcom dropped $5.1875, to $104.125.
</P>
<P>
   At the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Taiwan's largest
chip maker, it will take up to two days after power is restored to
resume full production, said Chuck Byers, a company spokesman in
San Jose. Initial estimates are that the company, whose customers
include Adaptec, the Altera Corp., and Motorola, will lose 10
percent of its production for the month.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutcheson said that figure was optimistic. ``It'll be closer
to 15 to 20 percent given how long they're likely to be down,'' he
said. He estimated that the company would lose $15 million to $20
million for each of its six Taiwanese factories.

LAKERS TRADE AGING HARPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Derek Harper might have retired last
offseason had the Lakers not offered the lure of an NBA
championship. But the Lakers' title run ended prematurely and now
Harper's career might be over as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a salary-dumping move, Harper, a 16-year veteran, was traded
to the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday for a rookie who probably won't
ever draw a Lakers paycheck. But Harper, who turns 38 next month,
will retire rather than play for a noncontender. The move could
void the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit General Manager Rick Sund, who drafted Harper in Dallas
in 1983, is trying to talk Harper into playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's probably not enough icing in the world to put on
the cake,'' Harper said. ``I don't want to go to Detroit. I don't
want to play there. It has nothing to do with anybody there. . . .
But I don't like the chances of winning a championship there.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'd prefer to spend time with his wife and four
children in Dallas and possibly take a long-standing offer of a
front-office job with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Harper started 29 of 50 games at point guard last season but
appeared to run out of gas late in the season and gave way to Derek
Fisher. New coach Phil Jackson apparently decided Harper had little
left to offer and he's lobbying management to sign former Chicago
Bulls guard Ron Harper, who turns 36 in January. That is likely to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also are considering guard Brian Shaw and center
Benoit Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Harper, the Lakers obtained Melvin Levett, a
6-foot-3 guard out of Cincinnati who was the 54th overall pick in
the June draft. The Pistons never tendered Levett a contract and
the Lakers probably won't either.
</P>
<P>
   If Harper retires, and if that voids the trade, the Lakers will
probably waive him, leaving them responsible for paying his $1.2
million salary for 1999-2000.

EDITORIAL: CORRUPTION INQUIRY IN LOS ANGELES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 22:
</P>
<P>
   An expanding corruption scandal in the Los Angeles Police
Department bodes ill for a city where residents in poor minority
communities have long complained of police arrogance and brutality.
A dozen officers have been suspended in an investigation that has
produced allegations of breathtaking misconduct. The scandal
widened into public view when one former officer, Rafael Perez,
agreed to cooperate with authorities in exchange for a lighter
sentence on his conviction for stealing cocaine from a police
evidence locker.
</P>
<P>
   Perez told investigators that in 1996 he and a former partner
intentionally shot a young unarmed Hispanic gang member, planted a
weapon beside the man and framed him for assaulting them. The
victim, who was left paralyzed, was convicted and sentenced to 23
years in prison as a result of the officers' false testimony. Last
week, prosecutors asked a judge to release the convicted man
immediately. Investigators are looking into another 1996 shooting
involving officers from the same division.
</P>
<P>
   The city's political leaders are pushing for a thorough criminal
investigation. A scandal in which an officer admits that an
innocent man was framed can have a devastating effect on the
credibility of other officers. Merely bringing the accused officers
to justice will not fully mend the broken public trust. Unless
there are intense efforts to expose misconduct and to impose
effective citizen oversight, the public is liable to believe that
other bad officers have simply not been caught. In Los Angeles, as
in episodes of police misconduct in New York, the difficult work of
building trust has been dealt a setback.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI ``unequivocally opposed'' President
Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists,
asserting that the release of most of the prisoners would
reinvigorate their terrorist movement, according to a letter
prepared by the law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, prepared for FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, said the
clemency ``would likely return committed, experienced,
sophisticated and hardened terrorists to the clandestine movement''
for Puerto Rican independence. The letter also said the clemency
would ``psychologically and operationally enhance'' allies in the
militant organization FALN who killed five people and maimed 83 in
terrorist activities in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's letter came to light at a congressional hearing intended
by Republicans to portray the president's act as reckless. Also
Tuesday, Clinton provided his first full explanation of his
decision in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh did not sign the FBI letter, which was addressed but never
sent to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. But senior law enforcement officials said Tuesday night
that the letter accurately reflected Freeh's position.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the letter was sent from the FBI to the Justice
Department for review prior to Freeh's signature, law enforcement
officials said. The letter was among the thousands of documents
sent by the White House to Congress in response to subpoenas for
information about the president's clemency decision.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said that Freeh had objected to clemency when it was
first raised in 1994, and again as recently as June 28; even so,
the letter said, Freeh was unaware that the president was actually
contemplating any commutation when the White House announced its
offer on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   While some officials have privately acknowledged disapproval of
the president's decision, Freeh's letter is the first official
indication of the fierce opposition among law enforcement officials
to the clemency offer to the 16 terrorists, most of whom have
accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself in the tradition of previous presidents who have
granted clemency in cases that were unpopular, Clinton portrayed
his release of the prisoners as an act of courage. He cited
Theodore Roosevelt's grant of amnesty to Filipino nationals who
fought U.S. control and Jimmy Carter's commutation of sentences of
Puerto Rican nationalists who had opened fire on the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They exercised the power vested in them by the Constitution to
do what they believed was right, even in the face of great
controversy,'' Clinton wrote. ``I have done the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not deal with the question of whether the
release of the prisoners might reignite the dormant terrorist
movement. But Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., asserted that recent
statements by a known Puerto Rican militant and ally of the
prisoners indicated that the release was stirring old passions.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Filiberto Ojeda Rios, the leader of Los Macheteros, a
terrorist organization allied with the FALN, as telling a Puerto
Rican radio station that if the United States committed aggressive
acts against Puerto Rico, his group would ``not remain with their
arms crossed, you can be sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans coaxed out of other law enforcement officials a
concern that the ex-prisoners constituted a threat to American
security. While the officials were bound under the president's
claim of executive privilege not to disclose internal deliberations
over the matter, they catalogued the violent actions of the FALN,
the terrorist organization to which the prisoners belong.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gallagher, assistant director of national security for the
FBI, told the panel, ``These are criminals and they are terrorists
and they represent a threat to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has acknowledged that it has no control over clemency
matters, which are the sole prerogative of the president. But
Clinton's explanation Tuesday appeared to make little difference to
those in the hearing room, who see the move as a political disaster
for the president and for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
likely to seek the Senate seat from New York. She has run into
political trouble for at first supporting, then denouncing, her
husband's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have wanted to draw out the drama. The panel, led by
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the government Reform
Committee, called several victims of FALN attacks, bringing them to
testify for the third time in less than two weeks. They included
Richard Pastorella, a retired New York City detective, who was
severely injured in a 1982 attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who thinks of us?'' Pastorella asked in a bitter voice.
``Certainly not Mr. Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, and relatives of those who had been killed in
terrorist attacks, said that contrary to federal requirements, they
had not been notified of the prisoners' pending release.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Republicans took issue with Clinton's apparent belief that
just because the prisoners had not been convicted of doing bodily
harm, they deserved to go free. ``The only reason some of them
didn't commit murders or bombings is because they were arrested
before they got a chance to,'' said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats, both African-Americans, offered a minimal defense
of the clemency. Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-Ill., said, ``Democracy can
be fellowship as well as punishment.'' Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.,
urged Congress to ``move on'' and examine issues that ``have a real
effect on the lives of average Americans.'' The committee's ranking
Democrat, Rep. Henry Waxman of California, said reluctantly that he
``probably'' would not have granted the clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, the president disclosed some of the arguments
that former President Carter had used in persuading Clinton to
grant clemency in this case. He said that Carter wrote to him in
1997 that releasing the prisoners would be ``a significant
humanitarian gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also said that any concern that clemency might be viewed
as leniency was mitigated by the length of time that they had
already served, Clinton wrote. Most of them had been in prison at
least 16 years, a period that Clinton said was not commensurate
with the crimes of which they were convicted, which included
sedition, conspiracy and armed robbery but not bodily harm to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since he made the offer, Clinton said the
decision was difficult and that he had not minimized the concerns
of law-enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I believe equity and fairness dictated,'' the
president wrote. ``I certainly understand, however, that other
people could review the same facts I did and arrive at a different
decision.''

PROSPECTS RISE FOR CURBS ON CASH-BALANCE PENSION PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fight over cash-balance pensions has moved to Congress,
where lobbyists and congressional aides say the dispute over IBM's
pension switch will probably help spur legislation to rein in the
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Any legislative action may not occur until next year, they said,
but even business lobbying groups and other opponents of new
cash-balance regulations say the controversy has heightened
lawmakers' awareness of the issue and appears to have improved
chances for legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under cash-balance plans, which have been adopted by hundreds of
large companies in recent years, employees earn retirement benefits
evenly throughout their careers. With traditional plans, benefits
are figured using an employee's length of service and final pay, so
most benefits are earned late in the person's career.
</P>
<P>
   What has caught the attention of the Internal Revenue Service
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission _ both are
reviewing the new plans to see if they violate age-discrimination
laws _ are conversions that in some cases have reduced benefits for
middle-aged employees by one-fifth to one-half.
</P>
<P>
   After protests by thousands of its workers, IBM on Friday backed
down from a full-scale switch to a cash-balance plan, allowing any
employee at least 40 years old and with a decade of service to keep
their old pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the move, many IBM workers are still upset, and a Senate
committee Tuesday held a four-hour hearing to examine whether
pension switches there and at other companies have harmed workers.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Brown, chief counsel of the Internal Revenue Service,
testified that the agency had never said that the plans result in
violations, per se, of age-discrimination laws. But he said
existing regulations, which generally state that pensions do not
run afoul of age-discrimination rules solely because of lower
future benefit accruals for older workers, are being re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``These regulations were proposed before significant numbers of
cash-balance plan conversions had occurred, and the special issues
posed by cash-balance plans were not considered or addressed at the
time they were developed,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers making cash-balance plan conversions must promise
each employee the greater of the protected benefits under the
original defined-benefit formula or the benefits calculated under
the new cash-balance formula,'' he said. ``In practice, some may
not.''
</P>
<P>
   And for companies that have already received notification of
tax-favored status for their new cash-balance plans, the IRS ``will
generally not seek retroactive disqualification of a plan.'' But he
added that IRS approval does not mean that employees whose rights
are violated by the new plan cannot sue to recover benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative proposals now circulating in Congress include
forcing companies that convert to a cash-balance plan to give all
employees a choice of sticking with the old plan; prohibiting
``wear-away,'' or conversions that leave some employees working
years before they start accruing benefits again, and forcing
companies to explain clearly to employees how much a switch will
reduce future benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-balance opponents note that two months ago, well before the
IBM reversal and federal investigations, a proposal by Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, to eliminate ``wear-away'' failed by only a 48-52
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most members of Congress have sympathy with this,'' said Karen
Friedman, director of the Pension Fairness Project at the Pension
Rights Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Employer groups also concede the uproar has increased chances
for legislation. There is ``a greater possibility that something
beyond'' a law simply tightening disclosure of benefit changes will
pass, said James Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy at
the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that too many new regulations could end up
hurting workers. He noted, as did Brown of the IRS, that nothing
prohibits companies from terminating pension plans, as long as they
pay all benefits already earned.
</P>
<P>
   Companies might otherwise scrap their plans if they have to lock
in a certain amount of future benefit accruals, regardless of ``how
tough the competition is or no matter if your company is in
trouble,'' Delaplane said. ``It's better to have these plans in
place for folks than to terminate them.''

GOLDMAN EARNINGS STRONG FOR ITS FIRST PUBLIC QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported surprisingly strong
earnings Tuesday in its first full quarter as a public company, a
striking reversal from a year ago when fallout from Russia's
economic woes forced the investment banking firm to postpone plans
for its initial public offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, which went public with an offering of $3.7 billion on
May 4, said it earned $638 million, or $1.32 a diluted share, in
its fiscal third quarter, which ended Aug. 27. The results were
essentially even with those Goldman reported for its fiscal second
quarter and nearly double the $329 million, or 69 cents a share,
that Goldman said it would have reported for the period a year ago
if it had been public then.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's results exceeded the expectations of Wall Street
analysts, whose average forecast was $1.09 a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial. Still, Goldman's stock fell along
with those of other financial-services companies, dropping $1.625,
to $59.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. That left the shares
above their offering price of $53 a share but well below their high
of $77.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very strong quarter across the board in investment
banking,'' said David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer.
Viniar added that he was ``cautiously optimistic'' about whether
the markets would stay strong enough to accept all of the stock and
bond offerings companies hope to complete in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   The fees Goldman earned for advising companies on mergers and
for underwriting stock and bond offerings surged enough to offset a
late-summer decline in Goldman's revenue from trading stocks, bonds
and commodities. But what surprised analysts was a jump in the
value of investments Goldman has made in other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those merchant-banking gains amounted to $328 million in the
quarter, compared with $189 million in the second quarter and just
$30 million in the period a year earlier. Some of those gains
occurred only on paper as Goldman marked up stakes it has in
companies that have gone public, such as Wit Capital, an online
investment bank that first sold stock in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something that reflects solid company
fundamentals,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Citigroup's
Salomon Smith Barney unit. ``So it's not something that the market
is going to stand up and applaud.''
</P>
<P>
   Those markups increased Goldman's net revenue _ revenue after
interest expense _ for the quarter to $3.41 billion, down from
$3.47 billion in the second quarter but up from $2.14 billion in
the third quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for advising on mergers and acquisitions rose 10 percent,
to $616 million from $561 million in the quarter a year ago.
Underwriting revenue increased 34 percent, to $534 million from
$399 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's total revenue for the quarter was $6.44 billion, up
from $6.36 billion in the previous quarter and $5.74 billion a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Goldman's results portend strong performances
from two other big securities firms slated to report earnings this
week, analysts said. The fiscal third quarters for Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ran through
August, while the reporting periods for some other big Wall Street
firms, including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., end Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies that are reporting now have a leg up because
June was clearly a stronger month than September will be,'' said
Joan Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. But,
she warned investors against extrapolating from Goldman's results
because Goldman has been gaining market share in its most
profitable business ``both domestically and, more importantly, in
overseas markets, which are growing.''
</P>
<P>
   A major facilitator of the merger mania that is sweeping through
Europe, Goldman now derives about 35 percent to 40 percent of its
revenue from outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All securities firms should report significantly higher earnings
for this period than they did a year ago, Ms. Solotar said, because
``last year was just a total washout for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   When financial turmoil spread across Asia to Russia and Latin
America, the firms' trading desks suffered huge losses on bonds
they were holding. Sales of stocks and bonds slammed to a halt as
investors scrambled for the relative safety of United States
Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   By early this year, the U.S. financial markets had recovered and
the boom in merger activity and first-time stock sales by
technology companies had resumed. In recent weeks, though, concerns
about a third interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board have
dragged on the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is certainly softer'' so far in September, Viniar
said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Maurice Taylor, another one who figures to get
away, might have to spend a third season as the killer whale in the
Los Angeles Clippers' catch-and-release program.
</P>
<P>
   Now he must prove he's the reel deal.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, David Falk, has asked for the NBA maximum extension,
$70.9 million over six seasons. Clippers owner Donald Sterling, it
is believed, won't pay it, leaving Falk to peddle Taylor elsewhere
when his contract expires next year _ or conjure up a trade in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
   But the team hasn't seen an acceptable trade offer and Taylor
will probably be a Clipper when the team opens training camp at
Southwest College on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   __ Little man, big man: Candidates to fill the conspicuous
vacancies of point guard (an expected co-op arrangement with
semi-incumbent Troy Hudson) and backup center are Eric Murdock and
Zan Tabak.
</P>
<P>
   __ Also:The Clippers' new trainer is Jason Powell, who is
leaving his assistant trainer's gig with the San Francisco 49ers to
replace Ray Melchiorre, whose contract was not renewed. Powell
previously worked for the Clips as an assistant to former trainer
Keith Jones. . . . Rex Kalamian will be promoted from video
coordinator and part-time assistant coach to full-time assistant
coach, replacing Jim Brewer, whose contract also was not renewed.

TROJANS CLEAR THE AIR

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ On the heels of a precarious victory over San
Diego State, some USC players held an impromptu meeting to address
complaints that arose following the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about people's attitudes toward coaches, about
whether they were getting the ball, or not playing enough,''
linebacker Markus Steele said. ``You don't want that leading into
the next game. Because player attitudes can cost you. Certain
players just called out other players.''
</P>
<P>
   One topic that has become more important to the team and a
source of discussion is penalties. USC has 26 in two games and is
on pace to surpass last year's total of 119.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was talk about penalties and focusing on long-term
goals,'' strong safety David Gibson said. ``There was arguing on
the field (against San Diego State).''
</P>
<P>
   Steele said the meeting was meant to calm players down and avoid
any lingering dissension.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your opportunity comes, it comes, you can't dwell on
it,'' Steele said. ``We talked about what's wrong and said not to
worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Welch out: Offensive tackle Matt Welch missed Tuesday's
practice with abdominal pains and possible gallstones. Welch's
status for the game is questionable, but he was scheduled to play
tight end in goal-line situations this week. The Trojans faltered
in their goal-line offense against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Garner is back: Wide receiver Troy Garner, a Notre Dame High
alumnus, who was suspended for two weeks after arguing with
strength coach Matt Schiotz, has been reinstated to the team.
</P>
<P>
   __ Case over: USC settled the sexual-harassment lawsuit filed by
former administrative assistant Norma Navarro against the
university and ex-coach John Robinson, according to general counsel
Todd Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed in December, 1997, and also included claims
of discrimination, unequal pay, failure to pay wages and wrongful
termination.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro, who eventually filed for bankruptcy, did not personally
receive any of the financial settlement.
</P>
<P>
   __ Soward shines: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward might have been
upset over not getting the ball enough against San Diego State, but
he had one of his best practices of the season Tuesday, making
several one-handed catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sensational,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``He
practiced just like he did all last week when he was on a whole
other level of practice for him. He was really focused and I think
it will show on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Who's healthy?: Tailbacks Frank Strong (bruised knee) and
Malaefou MacKenzie (hamstring) practiced, but Hackett said both
were ``ginger and tentative.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Matt Nickels has pneumonia and might miss the
Oregon game. Nickels' role would probably increase if he were
healthy and starter Windrell Hayes (sprained ankle) was unable to
play.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hayes, he walked on his injured ankle and believes he has
a chance to play. ``Stranger things have happened,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Without Hayes or Nickels, the Trojans have three healthy
receivers, plus a returning Steve Stevenson (sprained arch) and
Stanley Guyness, who is returning from knee surgery but saw the
first action of his career against San Diego State.

U.S. TO SUE TOBACCO FIRMS IN BID TO RECOVER HEALTH COSTS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department is about to file a civil
suit against the tobacco industry, seeking to recover billions of
dollars in health-related expenses that cigarette smoking has cost
over the decades, a government official said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department believes smoking-related illnesses have
cost the American taxpayers billions of dollars, and it is seeking
ways to get the taxpayers' money back,'' said the government
official, who is familiar with the unfolding case and spoke Tuesday
night on condition he not be quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawsuit had been expected since President Clinton
first proposed it in his State of the Union address last January,
it is still a blow to the industry, which had thought it had put
most of its legal problems behind it by settling hundreds of
millions of dollars in lawsuits by the states and beating back
congressional efforts to strongly regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the tobacco industry reached Tuesday night said he
was unaware of an imminent legal action by the government. But in
recent months officials from tobacco companies and a public
relations firm hired by the industry have conducted an aggressive
campaign depicting any federal lawsuit as ungrounded and legally
unviable. An effort was made in Congress this year to curtail
financing the Justice Department would need to pay for the
litigation against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Following the State of the Union, the cigarette industry said
the president's remarks were ``blatantly political'' and meant to
demonize the tobacco companies. People who had long followed
tobacco litigation said the cigarette makers were rattled by the
prospect of facing an adversary _ the federal government _ with
pockets as deep as their own.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which has been planned for nearly a year, may allege
that cigarette smoking has cost as much as $25 billion a year from
the effects of lung cancer and other diseases linked to the smoking
habit. The $25 billion is calculated from the numbers of health
claims paid to veterans and the elderly through Medicare, according
to The Washington Post, which reported on the impending suit in its
Wednesday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The official would not discuss the exact timing of the suit _
The Post said it may be filed as soon as Wednesday _ but he made it
clear that it is about to be lodged.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 46 states settled with tobacco companies for a total
of $206 billion for health costs the states had been saddled with
over the years because of smoking. Four other states had settled
similar claims earlier in a separate action.
</P>
<P>
   So at the start of 1999, the tobacco industry thought it had
insured its survival and perhaps even its prosperity, albeit at a
huge cost. The $206 billion is to be paid over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement that his administration would seek
recompense separate from the money to be paid to the states
surprised many Justice Department lawyers, as well as attorneys for
tobacco interests.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear signal of its seriousness, the Justice Department in
April hired a Minnesota law firm that had represented that state in
its action against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported that as part of its suit, to be filed in U.S.
District Court, the Justice Department will contend that the
tobacco companies engaged in civil racketeering. The suit will
allege industrywide collusion in consumer fraud to conceal the
risks of smoking, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state lawsuits were intended to recover health care
costs spent through the Medicaid program on low-income patients,
the federal government is seeking to recover similar expenses spent
treating the elderly through the Medicare program. The action is
also seeking reimbursement of costs spent treating smoking-related
ills among both active and retired military personnel and
government employees.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of the Minnesota firm, Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP;
Ciresi of Minneapolis, brought a scathing response from the tobacco
industry. ``The administration has handed the keys to the Justice
Department over to the trial lawyers,'' an industry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department said there was no arrangement for the
firm to get contingency fees if the government prevailed in a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the soon-to-be filed federal suit are unclear,
but lawyers involved in it have long said it would aim to win
concessions not included in the settlements between the big tobacco
companies and the states. These might include federal power to
regulate nicotine under the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   It also became widely known soon after the president's
announcement that some lawyers in the Justice Department were
unhappy that Clinton had, in effect, tipped off the tobacco
companies well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the tobacco industry enjoyed near-invincibility in
the courtroom. Able to spend as much as necessary on legal counsel,
it was able to defeat virtually every lawsuit filed against
cigarette makers by longtime smokers who had become ill.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past several years, the tide has turned. The sight of
several tobacco executives swearing under oath in a congressional
hearing room that they did not believe nicotine was addictive was
offensive even to those who had not seriously pondered the danger
of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies have been more vulnerable in courthouses
recently, and more vulnerable too in the court of public opinion,
as the dangers of smoking and the hazards of ``second-hand smoke''
have been widely publicized.

VENEZUELAN LEADER PLEDGES PAYMENT OF ALL DEBTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to reassure foreign investors,
Venezuela's president said Tuesday that his government would make
all its debt payments while at the same time work on a
market-friendly proposal that would allow it to pay off its current
debt over a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to service our foreign debt, but we want to
reduce the profile,'' President Hugo Chavez said through a
translator at a New York news conference, held in part to give him
a chance to clear up misconceptions about his economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as investors keep a close watch on emerging
markets in Latin America. Ecuador is struggling to avoid a default
on its foreign debt and Brazil is still working to come back from
the devaluation of its currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's news conference was organized by J.P. Morgan
Securities, which is offering the government ideas on ways to
rework its debt. As the session began, Susana de la Puente,
managing director for Latin American investment banking at J.P.
Morgan Securities, noted that there had been ``a lot of bad press
about Venezuela lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chavez nor his finance minister, Jose Rojas, would give
any details of what kind of debt reworking they were thinking of.
But Ms. de la Puente said that if any proposal was made to revamp
Venezuela's $21.1 billion in foreign debt, it would be ``market
driven,'' adding that there would be no ``involuntary
restructuring.'' She said it was possible to approach investors
with a deal allowing Venezuela to swap current debt for new bonds.
``We are waiting for the right opportunity, a good opportunity to
do it,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Investor concern about the political and economic future of
Venezuela has left its debt prices at levels just above those for
Ecuador and Russia. The Russians have effectively defaulted, and
Ecuador is scrambling to work out a debt-restructuring plan that
would avoid a Brady bond default. Brady bonds, which are named for
Nicholas F. Brady, a former treasury secretary, were designed as a
way to repackage the billions of dollars in unpaid bank loans to
many Latin American countries that they effectively defaulted on in
the early 1980s. The repackaging into bonds made the old loans more
attractive to investors because they could be traded easily and
came with guarantees on the principal and interest of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-day grace period for Ecuador to pay $96 million in interest
and principal it owes on its Brady bonds ends next Tuesday, right
in the middle of the International Monetary Fund's semiannual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador has not yet proposed how it will rework its current
Brady bonds, although there have been reports that future oil
revenue may be used as collateral. Emerging-market analysts do not
think debt restructuring will be easy for Ecuador. And some say it
will not be able to meet the requirements of an IMF economic
program, which is a prerequisite for more international aid.
