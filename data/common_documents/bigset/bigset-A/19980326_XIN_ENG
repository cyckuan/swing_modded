<HEADLINE> NYSE Chairman Expresses Confidence in Chinese Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Richard Grasso, chairman and CEO
of the New York Stock Exchange, toured the Shanghai Stock Exchange
(SSE) today and commented on the leading role of Shanghai in
China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Grasso, who is visiting China as guest of the Bank of China,
told reporters that he was deeply impressed by the SSE and amazed
at its great success over the past seven years. He noted the short
period required for the SSE to achieve a trading volume which
the NYSE reached after 70-odd years in operation.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese stock market is a developing one and
expressed his confidence in its bright future.
</P>
<P>
The eventual success of the Chinese stock market will play an
important role in China's economic development, said Grasso.
</P>
<P>
He added that rapid economic development in China will not only
benefit Chinese and overseas investors, but also be an important
factor in the overall success of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the NYSE will sponsor a consultants conference in
Beijing over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
SSE General Manager Tu Guangshao said the SSE now has 480
listed companies, including 379 A shares, 50 B shares and 34
securities. The total value for listed companies stands at 965.8
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nine domestic companies and nine Chinese-funded companies
registered in Hong Kong and Singapore are listed on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders to Factories Decline in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade in U.S. aviation
products declined in February due to a slump in demand for
aircraft, the third time in the last five months, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods, items from appliances to airplanes
expected to last over three years, dipped 1.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted 184 billion U.S. dollars, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The monthly performance followed a 1.5 percent increase in
January, a partial recovery from a 5.3 percent plunge in December,
the worst showing in six years.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the drop reflects the fallout from
recessionary conditions in Asia, a big market for the U.S.
commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
In February, civilian aircraft orders plunged 34.2 percent,
more than offsetting a gain in automobile demand. Transportation
orders overall fell 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But manufacturing prospects look more positive. Orders rose 0.5
percent in February, the seventh increase in nine months.
</P>
<P>
Orders increased 3.2 percent for industrial machinery and 2.1
percent for primary metals such as steel. But orders for
electrical equipment fell 2.7 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipments of durable goods, a measure of current
production, rose 2.2 percent last month. The combination of
falling orders and rising shipments reduced the backlog of
unfilled orders by 0.6 percent, the second decline in three
months.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stocks Up Amidst Thin Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi shares index
appreciated Wednesday amidst thin trading as the city's main
commercial areas remained closed to observe a strike protesting
the deaths of 20 people in the city a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between members of the Mutahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)
and its splinter group, the MQM (Haqiqi), has left 20 dead Tuesday
and both parties called for a strike Wednesday to protest the
killings.
</P>
<P>
The main shopping and commercial areas of the city remained
closed Wednesday in response to the strike call. This is the fifth
day of closure in the commercial district as Monday was a national
holiday following the weekend and Tuesday saw violence causing
businesses to remain shut.
</P>
<P>
Stocks market analysts say that trading volumes were low as the
city was not fully functional and the main commercial areas were
shut.
</P>
<P>
The 100-Index of Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) went up 20.83
points to close at 1533.08 with a trading volume of 16 million
shares as compared to Tuesday's close of 1512.25 on 43 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts were hopeful that the market would pick up in the
week as reaction to the city's violence was not as drastic as
market expectations.

<HEADLINE> Russian Acting Premier Against Cuts in Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) - Russian Acting Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko said Wednesday that Russia will not follow OPEC's
suggestion to cut daily oil production by 13,700 tons in effort to
boost prices.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Sevodnya newspaper, the former energy
minister stressed that production cutbacks would be dangerous for
Russia's oil infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Most oil wells in Russia are aged, and if they are temporarily
closed, 30 percent of them will never operate again," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will be unable to compensate for
losses resulting from restrictions on oil production, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which is the world's third largest oil producer, after
Saudi Arabia and the United States, suffered greatly from the
decrease in oil prices since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
OPEC will hold a special ministerial meeting on Monday in
Vienna to discuss the plan to cut output.

<HEADLINE> Official: Russian Economic Policy Will Not Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian economic policy will not
change because of the latest government reshuffle, a high-ranking
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Grigoriyevich Yasin, acting minister without portfolio,
said that during the Soviet Union era and the initial stage of
Russian reform, it was true that the economic policy tended to
change with the governmental reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
But now every government is considering the economic and
financial issues and exercising caution in changing policy.
</P>
<P>
Yasin said, however, that he was more concerned with the
decling price of oil in the world market, possible floods in the
spring and the dramatic increase of delayed wages.
</P>
<P>
The Russian economic situation was not optimistic this year, he
said. Because of the price decline of oil in the world market,
Russia would lose nine billion U.S. dollars in the oil and oil
products markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the presidential decree, which dismissed the whole
government on Monday, previous government officials will continue
work until a new government is in place.

<HEADLINE> EU Accused for Cutting Humanitarian Aid in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 25 (Xinhua)-- The Joint Health Authority
(JHA) Wednesday accused the European Union (EU) for cutting
humanitarian assistance to the non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) in Somalia's Middle Shabelle region.
</P>
<P>
JHA said at a press conference here that EU, prompted by the
worsening security situation in Middle Shabelle Region, has
decided to cut humanitarian assistance to the NGOs operating in
the region effective on March 31.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Osman Mohamud Dufle, the JHA
coordinator, characterized the EU decision as "an inhumane act"
which is punishing the people of Middle Shabelle region
collectively.
</P>
<P>
"Insecurity is a general issue caused by the lack of a central
government for Somalia," said Dufle.
</P>
<P>
The health authority was especially troubled by the fading
hope for thousands of tuberculosis patients who now are only
undergoing the first stages of their treatment.
</P>
<P>
Once treatment is interrupted for a period, the doctors said,
the disease will resist any further treatments.
</P>
<P>
Dufle also said that the EU decision coincided with an
alarming epidemic measles disease which mainly affects children
under five.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics distributed to reporters, more than
180 cases of measles were recorded in the Capital alone in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The health authority has appealed to the United Nations
agencies and the Somali aid coordination body to take measures to
help stop the spread of the measles disease and rescue those
already affected in Galdudud, Middle Shabelle, Benadir and Lower
Shablle.

LHASA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Twelve trucks loaded with relief
goods arrived at Shiquanhe Town in Ngari Prefecture on Tuesday
after a week-long driving in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth batch of relief goods organized by the Red
Cross Society of the Tibet Autonomous Region for 11 townships hit
seriously by snowstorms since late last year. It was valued at
660,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Deepening Understanding with Realistic Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Two noted Harvard Sinologists
today attributed recent improvements in ties between China and the
United States to the "realistic" attitude adopted by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Professors Erza Vogel and William Kirby, China specialists who
frequently visit China, accompanied Harvard University President
Neil Rudenstine on the most recent trip to attend centennial
celebrations at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
The two scholars used today's briefing as a forum to call for
expanded contacts in wide-ranging areas to resolve common
problems arising in the increasingly interdependent world.
</P>
<P>
Vogel, director of both the Harvard University Asia Center and
prestigious Fairbank Center for East Asia Research, teaches a core
curriculum on "Industrial East Asia" and recently edited the book
"Living with China." Vogel has previously expounded his views
concerning the so-called "China Threat" in an article carrying the
headline "Must We Make China an Enemy?".
</P>
<P>
Vogel, the second director of the Fairbank Center, said the
American media has neglected ongoing profound changes taking place
in China, including the "growth of rural elections, the spread of
rule by law and the adaptation of international institutions."
</P>
<P>
"The voice of extreme is not always the mainstream," said
Vogel, adding that "distinguishing mainstream from sidestream
demands high level of knowledge of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Kirby, who currently chairs Harvard's Department of History and
Council on East Asian Studies, said the "greatest 20th century
threat to world peace is to weak China and divide China, turning
it play thing under the global powers."
</P>
<P>
The historian noted that "natural development" enabled China to
become stronger in the 20th century and follow its historic role
as one of the great civilizations. "A stronger, ever more
prosperous China is critically in interest of the world," said
Kirby. He pointed to the divergence between the two countries and
called for China and the United States "to look at things we have
in common and how we can solve those problems with the realization
that not all problems can be solved right away."
</P>
<P>
Kirby said he is currently working on three books related to
China -- "The International Development of China," "China and the
World in 20th Century," and "A World Transformed: A Global History
of the 20th Century."

WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. existing home sales
soared 8.7 percent to a new record in February, the National
Association of Realtors said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The low mortgage rates helped boost sales of existing homes to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.75 million units in
February, the highest since the association began tracking sales
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The strong resales posed a sharp contrast with some economists'
earlier prediction of a relatively modest increase of 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
By region, sales went up 10.7 percent in the South to an annual
rate of 1.86 million units, 8.3 percent in the Midwest to 1.18
million, 7.4 percent in the West to 1.02 million, and 4.6 percent
in the Northeast to 680,000.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide median price of an existing home was 124,300
U.S. dollars, up 5.8 percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Clinton to Face Opposition in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The state visit by U.S.
President Bill Clinton to South Africa has come under fire from
groups which plan to hold protests during the four-day tour.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will touch down in Cape Town early on Thursday on the
only state visit of his six-nation African tour, the longest of
his presidency to date.
</P>
<P>
The Friends of Cuba Society of South Africa condemned the U.S.
for its "hypocrisy" in supporting Africa's economic recovery
while it continued its immoral and inhumane blockade of food and
medication to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The South African public should be aware of the incredible
hardships that Clinton continues to impose on the people of Cuba,
the society said in a statement issued here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The society described the U.S. economic blockade of Cuba as
illegal and called on the Clinton administration to lift it.
</P>
<P>
"As Africans, we reconfirm that the economic upliftment of
Cuba and Africa is integrally linked. One cannot therefore extend
a hand of friendship to Africa while not at the same time
extending it to Cuba," the society said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the South African National Protection Service,
Andre Kruse, said Wednesday that a few groups planning to disrupt
Clinton's visit were being monitored.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape provincial head for national security service,
Flip Nel, said that a Muslim organisation in Cape Town had
applied for permission to hold a poster-placard demonstration
during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
The group wants to demonstrate "global oppression" during
Clinton's address to the national parliament on Friday, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Campaign Against Landmines Wednesday called
on the U.S. government to sign a treaty banning landmines.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the organisation said it is ironic
that the American leader is visiting Africa to discuss economic
recovery support.
</P>
<P>
It said that one of the most critical impending recovery on
the continent is the millions of hectares of land that cannot be
developed as a result of millions of explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
Africa is a continent solidly behind a treaty prohibiting
production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel
mines, said the group.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight African countries, including the 14 members of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC), have signed
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government refused to approve it, the group noted
in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The South African lobby group said that while Clinton travels
through Africa, it is collecting signatures protesting against
U.S. policy on the explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also likely to be criticized by the public and
citizens who will find travel difficult while the 1000-strong
entourage is in Cape Town and Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
But Ministry for Foreign Affairs Director for the Americans,
Dumisani Khumalo, called for calm.

<P>
HAIKOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Haikou, capital of south China's
Hainan Province, ranked first in air quality among more than 30
major Chinese cities, according to the latest test conducted by
China's Environment Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
Since June of 1997, the center has been conducting weekly tests
in the country's municipalities, provincial capitals, special
economic zones and coastal scenic cities. The results have been
disclosed by announcing air pollution indexes.
</P>
<P>
The latest test shows that Haikou's index averages 28 with a
maximum of 30. The state-set index for a first-class city is below
50.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute the result to the fact that the city never
seeks interim economic profit at the expense of the environment and
refuses to allow projects that would be heavy polluters.
</P>
<P>
To reduce tail-pipe emissions, the city has banned diesel
vehicles from the city proper and, beginning April 1, will promote
the use of lead-free gasoline.

</P>
<P>
Cao said the provincial government is taking measures to check

According to Cao, Fujian Province will have contracted overseas
funds of 6 billion U.S. dollars this year, a projected increase of
1.5 billion U.S. dollars over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has adopted measures to help overseas-funded enterprises
with difficulties resulting from the recent Southeast Asian
financial turmoil to open up markets both at home and abroad.

The province will also offer favorable policies to
overseas-funded enterprises on water and electricity supplies,
credit and taxes.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) has approved a 16 trillion yen (123.1 billion
U.S. dollar) package to stimulate the sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest-ever economic stimulus package was
endorsed at an extraordinary meeting of the LDP General Council,
the ruling party's highest decision-making panel.
</P>
<P>
The party will submit the policy proposals to the government
after seeking endorsement from its two non-cabinet parliamentary
allies -- the Social Democratic Party and the New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The package includes bringing forward deadlines to finish
public works contracts, collectively worth 80.1 percent of the
public works appropriation in the 1998 fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
Public works projects account for the majority of the package,
which also features tax breaks relating to education and welfare
fields, council members said.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to information and telecommunications
infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes using part of Japan's pool of postal savings
and postal insurance premiums to buoy the stock market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A new measure governing inland
residents' travel to Hong Kong for non-official purposes will be
implemented on March 30, an official with the Ministry of Public
Security announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Passports will no longer be issued by exit and entry
administration departments under the public security organs in the
country for inland residents to visit Hong Kong, the official
said. Instead, the departments will issue passes for travel to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
These departments will approve applications according to
related regulations and then issue the passes for those allowed to
go to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A quota will be introduced for inland residents traveling to
Hong Kong for commercial purposes, said the official, and priority
will be given to business people and technicians participating in
large-scale and profitable enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The official said the new measure will apply to Chinese
employees of representative offices of international organizations
in China; Chinese working for foreign consulates, embassies and
press organizations stationed in China; and inland residents
engaged in foreign-funded, collective-owned and private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Permits which were issued by the Hong Kong Immigration
Department and visas which were issued by the British Hong Kong
authorities will continue to be valid. Inland residents can go to
Hong Kong with passports and certificates until the documents'
expiration, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Passes which were issued by exit and entry administration
departments in inland areas for travel to Hong Kong and Macao can
also be used until they expire, the official said.

<P>
Guy Georges was arrested without the use of force on Thursday

</P>
<P>
To advance this effort, he added, "we held two days of very

<HEADLINE> Long March Rocket's Success Rate Reaches World Advanced Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Long March 2C rocket
smoothly sent two U.S.-made satellites into orbit at the Taiyuan
Satellite Launch Center early this morning.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese space expert said here today that the success rate of
China's rocket launches is approaching advanced international
levels.
</P>
<P>
Since 1970 when it began to use the Long March Carrier Rocket
to propel satellites into the skies, China has launched 50 rockets
with 44 successes and six failures, an 88 percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
The Long March rockets have put 50 satellites in preset space
orbits, including 17 commercial satellites for the United States,
Sweden, Australia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The space expert said that the success rate of the Long March
Rockets' 50 flights has approached or exceeded that of the first
50 rocket launches by advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the continual growth of China's comprehensive
national strength, the number of Long March Rocket yearly launches
will increase.
</P>
<P>
China will also continue to increase its investment in the
development of space technology, he said.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 Khmer Rouge
gerrillas and civilians living in Anlong Veng defected to the
government on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,545 soldiers led by commander Ke Pok and 4,109
civilians declared their defections from the rule of Khmer Rouge
hardliners, Chief of General Staff Ke Kim Yan said.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to publicly declare that we have fought and split from
the control of Khmer Rouge leaders Pol Pot, Tamok, Khieu Samphan
and Nuon Chea," the defectors said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We have returned to live with the Royal Cambodian Government
from today onwards," said the statement allegedly signed Thursday
in Anlong Veng.
</P>
<P>
The defectors came from Divisions 980, 801, 802, 912, 417 in
northern Cambodia of Anlong Veng, which are under the control of
Tamok.
</P>
<P>
The government had not attacked troops in Anlong Veng, but Ke
Pok contacted the government on Tuesday and declared the defection
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Pol Pot, Tamok, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were reported to
have escaped to a nearby village with around 400 soldiers," Ke Kim
Yan said.
</P>

"It is a good sign of national reconciliation and they are
warmly welcomed to live with their families and even have a
political life and to take part in the forthcoming national
election," Ke Kim Yan said.

<HEADLINE> Workers' Representatives Congress Has a Say in Lay-offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises must make
explanations to the Worker's Representative Congress before they
announce a list of laid-off workers, said Beijing Mayor Jia
Qinglin here today.
</P>
<P>
"While strictly adhering to the state's policies on lay-offs,
enterprises have to work out settlement plans for the laid-off
workers," said Jia Qinglin, also member of the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the
first plenary meeting of the new municipal government.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal government will give priority to the
re-employment of laid-off workers this year," said Jia.
</P>
<P>
The city must provide job opportunities for over 400,000 people
in 1998, according to him. Among them are 32,900 jobless, 190,000
laid-off workers and a new work force of 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Although the phenomenon of lay-offs is beneficial to economic
growth by raising efficiency, Jia said, governments at all levels
should make an effort to ensure the basic living standard of the
laid-offs and to create more job opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
The mayor urged government departments concerned to offer
assistance to laid-off workers willing to be self-employed or run
collective enterprises. He also urged the departments to organize
training programs for them.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that by 2,000 the municipal government should ensure
that more than 90 percent of the laid-off workers who are willing
to be re-employed will be registered at the re-employment service
center. More than 80 percent of them should be provided with jobs,
he said.

provide liquidity for Thai exporters whose operations have been
severely hampered by lack of credit and help Thailand recover from
the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The facility consists of two loans to the Export-Import Bank of
Thailand -- a 50-million-dollar loan from the ADB and a
950-million-dollar syndicated loan fully underwritten by ten
leading international banks.
</P>
<P>
Each loan has a maturity of five years. For the syndicated
loan, the ADB has agreed to guarantee principal repayments and
interest payments due in the first three years.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major term financing for Thailand since it
was hit by the financial crisis last year and is the ADB's first
export-financing loan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant milestone as it signals the return of
Thailand to the international bank loan market and recognition
that the recovery of Thailand is well under way," ADB president
Mitsuo Sato was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Given the sharp depreciation of the Thai baht since last year,
Thai exports are projected to grow sharply, provided there are no
financing constraints, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
However, at present, commercial banks in Thailand are facing
extreme liquidity problems. Export-related funding requirements in
Thailand from 1998 to 2000 are estimated at 160 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are some major
news items in leading U. S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton, speaking in Rwanda, called for
sharper vigilance against genocide and swifter prosecution of its
perpetrators in a new permanent international criminal court.
Clinton acknowledged that the world could have protected the
victims of Rwanda's 1994 genocide, but did not. After listening
to several victims' accounts, Clinton said that "we cannot change
the past," but that nations should learn from it.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a
speech to the Israel Council on Foreign Relations that he was
delivering "the most difficult message" of his visit to Israel:
his accusation that Israel had committed a chain of "provocative
acts" that had contributed to a crisis in Israeli-Arab relations.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Convinced that flagging Israeli-Palestinian talks are near
collapse and already doing substantial harm to U.S. rgional
interests, President Clinton has decided in principle to unveil an
American peacemaking package that the Israeli government
categorically rejects, according to senior policymakers.
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesian officials say they expect to be able to unveil as
early as next week a new and improved economic reform package --
the third in the country in less than five months. They hope the
plan will not only stabilize the volatile currency but also revive
the ailing banking sector and tackle massive private-sector debt.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The IMF-funding debate became more contentious as U.S.
Senate Republican leaders warned colleagues not to play games with
the issue amid the Asian financial crisis. An angry address by
Appropriations Chairman Stevens appeared aimed at conservatives
who have delayed the 18 billion U.S. dollars measure. A vote is
due Thursday.
</P>
<P>
-- New sanctions on Serbia were rejected by U.S. allies for
now, despite Washington's warnings that Belgrade continues to
repress ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. Russia agreed to
allow a U.N. vote on an arms embargo this month, but a decision on
freezing overseas assets was postponed for at least four weeks.

<HEADLINE> China's Defense Minister Meets Japanese Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission and defense minister, met here
today with Fujinawa Yuji, chief of staff of the Japanese Ground
Self-Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also a state councillor, extended a welcome to
Fujinawa and said the current generations should not forget the
painstaking efforts that the older generations of Chinese and
Japanese had made to promote friendly relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the 20th anniversary of the signing of the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, he said he hopes the
two nations will use the opportunity to further bilateral
relations in political, economic, cultural, military and other
areas.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between defense departments of the two
countries and the Chinese People's Liberations Army (PLA) and the
Japanese Self-Defense Forces have developed and exchanges of
high-level visits have taken place, both of which demonstrate
Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
"Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future,"
China's defense minister said, adding that Chinese leaders have
always emphasized that the Japanese should draw lessons from
history to avoid repeating past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"We are duty-bound to advance friendly relations between our
two neighbors," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Fujinawa said the Japanese will have a correct understanding
of and conduct deep self-examination on the questions rooted in
history and contribute to building friendly Japan-China relations
geared to the future.
</P>
<P>
Fujinawa said he feels glad to visit China as the first officer
of his post, and that increases in bilateral military exchanges
will help further friendly relations between the two countries and
their defense departments.

<HEADLINE> 4 SLA Members Seek Political Asylum in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Four members of the South
Lebanese Army (SLA) have entered into Israel and sought political
asylum in the country, the Israel army said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four, one officer and three soldiers, are from one family
and they have asked Israel to allow them to stay and grant
citizenship to them and all their family members.
</P>
<P>
The SLA has been assisting Israeli occupation forces in
fighting resistance Muslim guerrillas and is regarded as traitors
by Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
The four, whose names were not disclosed, said their future
remains uncertain after Israel pulls out its troops from South
Lebanon and nobody could guarantee their safety and that of their
family members.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said it is willing to comply with U.S. Security
Council resolution 425 and withdraw from Lebanon provided that
arrangements are made to ensure the security of northern Israel
and the safety of the SLA forces.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been rejected by Lebanon, which demanded an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, as stipulated
by the resolution 425 adopted by the Security Council in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and set up a
1,100-square-kilometer security zone in the south in 1985, where
it is engaged in an attrition war with resistance guerrillas,
especially the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government has promised to make its final decision on
this issue very soon and also asked the U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan, who just ended a three-day visit here, to help solve
this problem.
</P>
<P>
SLA Commander Gen. Antoine Lahad, who has been condemned by a
Lebanese court to death for treason in absentia, visited Israel
last week to discuss the Israeli pullout and future of his SLA
forces.
</P>
<P>
He asked Israel not to exit unilaterally as proposed by
National infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, the very former
general who then masterminded the establishment of security zone,
before security arrangements are made with parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Lahad also worried his SLA's future and some reports said that
Lahad and other senior SLA officers would be granted political
asylum in France after Israeli withdrawal.

Countries and 25.6 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
According to Saleh El-Alehaidan, vice chairman of the Eastern

the aim of facilitate communications among them.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> One Quarter Jordanians Live in Poverty: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- One million Jordanians, or 26
percent of the whole population, are living in absolute poverty,
semi-official Jordan Times Thursday quoted Minister of Social
Development Mohammed Mamsir as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not specify what the absolute poverty is, but
he further said that by the end of 1997, about 45 percent of the
families in the kingdom are leading a hard life with less than 150
Jordanian dinars (about 212 U.S. dollars) monthly income, an
amount that could barely support the family members with enough
daily bread.
</P>
<P>
Most alarming, illiteracy and malnutrition, by-products of
poverty, are increasing too, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Independent agencies have estimated that over 20 percent of
Jordanian children under 12 suffer from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The roots of poverty in Jordan, a country with few natural
resources, are diverse, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is burdened with huge foreign debts which was
estimated at 4.7 billion dinars (6.6 billion dollars) in 1997
while suffering from an awesome annual population growth rate of
3.4 percent, which is among the world's highest.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country, with up to 25 percent of its
labor force unemployed, according to independent estimates, had an
influx of about 300,000 returning Jordanians during the 1990-91
Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
These Jordanian workers were expelled by some Arab Gulf countries
during the crisis, triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, because
Jordan sided with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to combat poverty, the government and the private
sector spent 140 million dinars (about 198 million dollars) last
year to help the poor in various ways, Mamsir said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state-run National Aid Fund, said it is looking
into plans to raise the ceiling of monthly handouts for every
family to over 60 dinars (85 dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, local observers say that the government appears to
lack a comprehensive strategy to help ease the growing poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has started building 67 giant
projects with an investment of 116 billion yuan (14 billion
U.S. dollars) to mark the 50th birthday of the People's Republic
of China, Vice-Mayor Wang Guangtao said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 67 projects, scheduled to be completed before
October of 1999, will showcase the features of Beijing as well as
the country's highest modern design and building standards for
architecture, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The completion of all the projects -- including 16
infrastructure buildings, 37 public utilities and 14 housing
structures -- will give the municipality a new appearance and help
stimulate the growth of the local economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Workers are expediting the subway expansion project from
downtown Fuxingmen to eastern Bawangfen.
</P>
<P>
Other projects on the local government's priority list, Wang
aid, are the second phase of the Badaling Expressway;
the building of Ping'an Street, a new thoroughfare parallel to the
well-known Chang'an Street; and sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's construction companies are focusing on the expansion
of the terminal building at the international airport, the
international finance building, the Xidan Culture Square and the
renovation of the Beijing Railway Station.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents also will see cultural and entertainment
sites mushrooming in the city. They include the Capital Books
Building, the Capital Library, a couple of theaters and some new
urban parks.
</P>
<P>
The city's housing management authorities have decided to
finish residential buildings with a combined floor space of 16
sq. m. in the next two years, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Presenting Redeployment Plan to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said here Thursday that he has not presented a plan to
the United States on the Israeli army's redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that no
exact percentage of redeployment has been decided and nothing
will be decided until he consults with the Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said in a message he sent last week to the
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Netanyahu proposed that the scale of
the second withdrawal would probably be "about midway" between
the original Israeli proposal of 9 percent and the 13 percent
urged by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said that he is not trying to prevent the
U.S. from introducing new ideas to advance the peace process. But
he stressed that the question was whether " correct ideas" would
be raised.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that he did not believe Clinton will
try to impose his security views on Israel, adding that he is
certain the current Israeli government is doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made his remarks just before the U.S. Middle East
Peace Envoy Dennis Ross arrives here later Thursday for talks
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in a bid to break the
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As a good gesture to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
ahead of Ross's tour, Israeli officials said Thursday that the
government is considering to release 250 Palestinian prisoners in
the framework of redeployment deal.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said that releasing Palestinian prisoners would be a
confidence building measure in advance of the further withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio quoted Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai as saying that he stands by his statement three months
ago that he will not remain in the government if the peace
process does not move forward.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai, who is currently visiting the U.S., said
that he believed the Israeli government was on the right track in
advancing the peace process. He noted that if the Palestinians
fulfill their obligations, the process could progress in a short
period.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Building Its First Refuse-Fueled Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has recently started
building its first refuse-fueled power plant.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Environmental Protection Bureau of
Chaoyang District, where the power station is located, said the
plant will cost 750 million yuan, 70 percent of which are loans
from the Spanish government.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, with two stoves, will have a generating
capacity of 24,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the eight districts in the Chinese capital
produce 4.3 million tons of refuse annually. Only 22 percent is
disposed of by safe methods.
</P>
<P>
When the power plant is built, it is expected to dispose of
1,200 tons of refuse daily, which means that 50 percent of the
refuse in Chaoyang District will be disposed of.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Selected Works of Late Mathematician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China has published the
selected works of the late mathematician Chen Jingrun, who made a
major breakthrough in proving "Goldbach's Conjecture."
</P>
<P>
The book include his thesis on the proof for "Goldbach's
conjecture 1 + 2" and another 24 theses, which represent the major
achievements of Chen, who died of Parkinson's disease in March
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chen was born in east China's Fujian Province in 1933, and
graduated from Xiamen University in 1949.
</P>
<P>
A renowned Chinese mathematician, Hua Luogeng, discovered
Chen's gift in mathematics and offered him a job in the Institute
of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where Chen in
1966 wrote the thesis about "each large even number can be
expressed as the sum of a prime and an integer that is the product
of at most two primes," or the proof for "Goldbach's Conjecture 1
+ 2".
</P>
<P>
He published a much simplified version of the proof in 1973,
which was recognized as Chen Jingrun's Theorem by mathematicians
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Springer-Verlag, the world famous science publishing house, has
decided to publish an English edition of Chen's selected works.

eight percent respectively in the fourth quarter of 1997 over the
same period of the previous year, official figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those of outgoing vessels increased by three percent

</P>
<P>
Over the same period, there were 11,177 outgoing ocean vessels
with a total capacity of 51.0 million net registered tons, the CSD
said. Net registered ton (NRT) is a unit measure in volume terms
of the space of a vessel available for carrying passengers or
goods. One NRT is equivalent to 100 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1997, the number and capacity of incoming
ocean vessels were 43,294 and 199.0 million NRT, increasing by
five percent and nine percent respectively over those in 1996.

also increased by five and nine percent respectively to 43,297 and
198.3 million NPT, according to the CSD.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of 1997, the total tonnage of seaborne
inward cargo, comprising seaborne imports and seaborne inward
transshipment, was estimated to be 24.2 million tones,
representing an increase of four percent over the same quarter in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The respective increases in the total tonnage of suborn imports

percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the total tonnage of seaborne outward
cargo, comprising seaborne exports (domestic exports and
re-exports) and seaborne outward transshipment, was estimated to
be 10.6 million tones, representing an increase of one percent
over the same quarter in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Within this total, there was an increase of three percent in
the tonnage of seaborne exports but a decrease of one percent in
that of seaborne outward transshipment.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1997, the total tonnage of seaborne
imports was 75.8 million tones, seaborne inward transshipment 16.1
million tones, seaborne exports 23.8 million tones, and seaborne
outward transshipment 17.6 million tones.
</P>
<P>
Comparing 1997 with 1996, increases were recorded in all these
four types of shipment, with seaborne imports increasing by six
percent, seaborne inward transshipment by seven percent, seaborne
exports by five percent and seaborne outward transshipment by six

<HEADLINE> Financial Storm Affects Macao's Export Less Than Expected: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Macao economic official
said the financial storms may affect Macao's exports less than
expected, the Macao Daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Maria Cesar, directress of the Economic Department of Macao,
said that local manufacturers have received far more orders than
expected, demonstrating that the currency devaluation in southeast
Asian nations has not severely hit Macao, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
She said the slight drop of imports and exports in January in
Macao was only caused by seasonal factors because most factories
were on vacation for the Chinese Lunar New holidays.
</P>
<P>
She said that the competitiveness coming along with the
devaluation in those nations was weakened by a budget crisis,
which followed the outbreak of the financial storms, and a tight
money policy of financial institutions in those region.
</P>
<P>
Many factories did not have sufficient capital to buy raw
materials, whose price was rising, or even maintain normal
operation, she said.
</P>
<P>
The directress did not elaborate how well orders have been
placed in Macao manufacturers. Local analysts predicted earlier
that Macao's exports may suffer a severe blow this year due to the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Macao's foreign trade volume reached a record high in 1997,
with an unprecedented trade surplus of 526 million patacas (65.75

BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia will hold its

Culture Ministry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Cultural Festival, scheduled for April 14-25, is

<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted an active
attitude toward developing relations with Japan on defense affairs
and hopes to increase exchanges and cooperation in various areas,
according to Fu Quanyou, chief of the General Staff of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Fu made his remarks today in a meeting with Fujinawa Yuji,
chief of staff of Japanese Ground Self-Defense Forces. He said the
successful Japan visit by Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian
last month shows that the development of Sino-Japanese defense
relations has entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
One of China's consistent policies is to develop long-term and
stable good-neighbor relations with Japan, which should be based
on the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty
of Peace and Friendship, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu said he hopes Japan will take a correct attitude toward
history and draw lessons from it, and continue to follow the path
of peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
Fujinawa said he is glad to visit China as friendly relations
between the two countries are being furthered.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China share a long history of friendship, however,
they also suffered misfortune in modern times, he said, adding
that his country will adopt a serious attitude toward history,
learn from it and make an effort to develop bilateral friendly
ties.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that high-level exchanges and visits between
defense departments of the two nations will help increase mutual
understanding and trust.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tension Mounts Over Clinton's Safety in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Tension is rising between
South African and American security personnel over U.S. President
Bill Clinton's first state visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his 1000-strong entourage arrived in Cape Town on
Thursday morning to start a four-day visit on the fourth leg of
his six-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, there is simmering
resentment in the way that the Americans have swooped down on
Cape Town and imposed their authority on their South African
counterparts even to the point of screening those who will roll
out the red carpet.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, while the parliamentary complex was abuzz with
last minute preparations for the address by Clinton later on
Thursday afternoon, problems between the two sides started
emerging.
</P>
<P>
Local officials revealed that they were upset with the manner
in which members of the American secret services had taken over
all the security responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"Who is in charge?" a source noted, adding that "the current
situation is that the South African security personnel are told
by Americans what to do."
</P>
<P>
Security is so stringent for Clinton's visit that even trees
along the route have been trimmed and manholes on roads,
especially those leading toward a five star hotel where the
president will be staying, have been sealed.
</P>
<P>
As the city of Cape Town braced itself for the three-day
American invasion, Mayor Theresa Solomon stood by her warning to
the city council that she would not be pushed around by
overzealous U.S. security personnel when meeting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The mayor is not the only public figure taking a stand against
Clinton's security staff.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker of South African parliament, Frene Ginwala, has
apparently ordered that security in parliament for Clinton was to
be handled by South African instead of U.S. personnel.
</P>
<P>
Apparently because of the high-handed behavior of U.S.
security personnel during Vice-President Al Gore's visit last
year, Ginwala decreed that U.S. secret service men were not going
to run the show in her legislature.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, about 150 members of a group calling
itself Muslims Against Global Oppression demonstrated outside the
Cape Town airport to protest Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
Protest organizer Moaim Achmed told reporters that Clinton was
not welcomed on the soil of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Evil, as we call him, has no idea of peace. He makes war
against our people. We will wait here until he arrives, and give
him a strong message from Muslims around the world," Achmed said.
</P>
<P>
A heavy police contingent prevented the protesters from
entering the airport premises while many army vehicles lined the
route nearer to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media is criticizing U.S. policy on Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to editors of the Citizen and the Star, a
Pretorian reader, F.H Osman, said that the United States "poses
the greatest threat to human rights and dignity the world has
ever known."
</P>
<P>
"We must never forget that without the covert and overt
support of the U.S., the white racist regime would not have been
able to sustain for so long. Apartheid is one of the most
inhumane social system in human history," he said.
</P>
<P>
And yet, the reader said, America -- a purportedly passionate
defender of human rights, was prepared to tolerate apartheid in
its own country for many years.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Wednesday on the eve of Clinton's
visit, the South African Communist Party said that Clinton should
acknowledge the role that the U.S. administration played over
many decades in supporting the apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
The party questioned whether Clinton's trip and his newly
proffered partnership was less about an African renaissance and
more about U.S. business rivalry with former colonial powers.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the U.S. to use its influence to write off the
debt of the most impoverished African countries.
</P>
<P>
"This must be done immediately, for while President Clinton
speaks of an African renaissance, his own administration has been
using its powers to delay implementation of the debt reduction
program," the party said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a French magazine on Wednesday, South
African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki criticized a shift in the
U.S. Africa policy from aid to trade, which was embodied in a
bill brought by Clinton to the continent in his current visit.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said that Africa needs both aid and trade, adding that
international measures should do more than just open up African
markets to sophisticated goods from the developed world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Stop Manipulating IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- An on-going economic forum on
Thursday called on the united states to stop manipulating the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Asian academics and researchers attending the forum on the
forthcoming Asia-Europe Summit said the U.S. has been manipulating
the IMF to squeeze Asia's battered economics.
</P>
<P>
The forum was designed to draw the attention of the Asian and
European leaders to grassroots issues in Asia when they meet in
London early next month to address, among other topics, the
currency crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Walden Bello, co-director of Focus on the Global South which
organized the forum, urged Europe and Japan to stop the U.S.
manipulation, saying it was in the interests of Europe and Japan
to use their votes in the IMF to stop the U.S. from using the
multilateral organization to squeeze the Asian public sector.
</P>
<P>
The participants also criticized the IMF for making
prescriptions that were bringing recession in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Charles Santiago, a Malaysia-based economist at the Stanford
Center for Economic and Social Research, said: "While Asian
countries are fighting their economic woes, the IMF rescue
package, demanding further liberalization and privatization, has
allowed multinational corporations to take advantage of these
governments and force them to behave in benefit of their (the
corporations') interests."
</P>
<P>
He said Asian countries should adopt measures to monitor and
regulate international financial flows and control speculation
such as lock-in periods and currency transaction tax.
</P>
<P>
He cited a case in South Korea where the Korean consumer
movement campaign on buying Korean-made goods was recently forced
to stop as the Korean government was criticized by German and
British ambassadors who claimed the campaign was against the free
trade principle.
</P>
<P>
Gigi Francisco, a representative from the Philippines said the
forum viewed the IMF prescriptions of squeezing the Asian domestic
economy and expanding foreign investments as detrimental to Asian
women's well-being.
</P>
<P>
"We urge Asian states to implement strict monitoring and
regulation of industrial restructuring and exploitative work such
as prostitution and trafficking to protect women workers' rights,"
said Francisco.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Individual and corporate
investors can open Investor Accounts in the Central Clearing and
Settlement System (CCASS) which will start from Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by John Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong
Clearing, at a luncheon here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that in response to the demand from the market and
investors, Hong Kong Clearing decided the new service in the
middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
"Investor Participation in CCASS is an innovative service that
gives investors a new alternative to safekeep their shares, and
allows them to have legal and physical control over their shares,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that by opening an account in CCASS, investors can
use a touch-tone or screen phone to access CCASS and affirm stock
transfers, issue instructions on corporate activities and make
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
"Investors can also deposit and withdraw share certificates
from the CCASS Depository and enjoy the benefits of our book-entry
clearing and settlement system," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Hui, secretary for Financial Services, said in the long
term, Investor Participation in CCASS will enhance the
competitiveness of the Hong Kong stock market and strengthen its
role as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
It will also increase local and foreign investors' confidence
in Hong Kong, especially after the international financial
turmoil, he said.

long-term and stable relationship with the EU and its members, and
that under the circumstances of profound changes in international
relations the strengthening of cooperation and dialogue between
China and EU complies with the shared interests of both sides and
serves Asia-Europe cooperation and world peace, stability and
common development.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Announces Huge Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT)
announced Thursday that it suffered massive losses of about 360
billion baht (9.33 billion U.S. dollars) from its general account
in 1997, a BOT official said.
</P>
<P>
The losses were the result of the central bank's build-up of
U.S. dollar liabilities to defend the baht after international
speculators attacked the Thai currency last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the currency reserves account, which backs up the baht
issue in the market, would post huge profits from foreign exchange
gains.
</P>
<P>
BOT Governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi chaired a court of directors
meeting Thursday at which the annual report of the central bank
was approved.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in history that the central bank reported
losses from its general account for 1997, a year that saw the free
fall of the baht from 25 baht to the dollar to 47 by year-end.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Trade Growth Expands HK's Trading Hub Role: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Continuous growth in offshore
trade is strengthening Hong Kong's position as the premier trading
hub and regional headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region, a
spokesman for the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the findings of a TDC research report on the rise in
offshore trade and offshore investment, TDC's Chief Economist
Edward Leung said Hong Kong's total trading capability continues
to expand, even though export growth has slowed in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
"This is made possible because of vigorous expansion in
offshore trade and offshore manufacturing investment," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to the findings, the estimated total value of
offshore trade undertaken by Hong Kong companies, including direct
shipments and transhipments, amounted to 1,050 billion HK dollars
(134.62 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, or equivalent to 85 percent
of Hong Kong re-exports.
</P>
<P>
This is well above the 70 percent recorded in the same survey
conducted in 1994 and the 50 percent recorded in the 1991 and 1988
surveys.
</P>
<P>
The report, the fourth in a series of studies since 1988,
surveyed 6,266 Hong Kong companies in last November and December.
It studies the development of Hong Kong's trade, including trends,
estimates and forecasts of offshore trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Leung noted that the surge in offshore trade stems mainly from
the increase in offshore manufacturing investment and the shift in
shipment modes of cargoes.
</P>
<P>
"Capitalizing on the comparative advantages of low-cost
production in developing Asian economies and Hong Kong's own
business connections, management expertise and infrastructure,
local companies can expand their manufacturing and trading
business beyond domestic production constraints and geographical
boundaries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the competence of cross-border operations of local
small and medium-sized enterprises provides Hong Kong with an
unmatched advantage as a trading hub amid the worldwide trends of
globalization in production and sourcing.
</P>
<P>
With the gradual shift from re-exports and transhipments to
direct shipments, Hong Kong, however, remains China's most
important enterpot, Leung said. In terms of value, Hong Kong still
handles 40 percent of the Mainland's total exports in 1997, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The rapidly expanding offshore trade and offshore investment
also stimulate the demand for certain trade-supporting services,
further expanding Hong Kong's role as a trading hub," Leung said.

<HEADLINE> S'pore, Indonesia to Launch Trade Financing Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Indonesia will
launch a bilateral trade financing scheme to facilitate
Indonesia's imports of manufacturing materials and other essential
goods, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that this trade guarantee should be backed by at least
two billion U.S. dollars, which will come from Singapore's pledge
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) package for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Singapore pledged five billion U.S. dollars earlier to the IMF
package for Indonesia. And the Prime Minister said he might be
able to provide details of the bilateral trade financing scheme
next week.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore television said that Goh made the announcement in
Bangkok at the end of his two-day visit to Thailand, following his
trip to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also said that Singapore bankers would be
consulted to take part in the proposed scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said that the scheme, which came at Indonesia's request,
would also have some flexibility built in, so that other countries
could participate later.
</P>
<P>
Exports like those from Singapore manufacturers would be
covered under the scheme, the television report said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Goh told the Singapore media that his
original proposal for a multi-lateral trade financing scheme
depended on the support of the Group of Seven (G-7) countries who,
so far, had not shown strong interest.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 nations had reportedly said that they preferred their
own financing scheme.

HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Recent currency devaluations in
some Asian countries have not driven companies out of Hong Kong,
with 90 percent of the surveyed companies still intend to increase

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Land Fund Increases Steadily: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Land Fund of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has increased to eight billion patacas
(about one billion U.S. dollars), a senior Chinese official said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Runzhen, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese Land Group, said after a meeting of the land fund
investment committee that the outcome of last year's land fund
investment reached 6.4 percent, higher than the official inflation
rate in 1997.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the land fund reached 7.952 billion patacas
(about 994 million US dollars), and it is expected to reach 10
billion patacas (about 1.25 billion U.S. dollars) before the
handover of power in December 1999, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"The fund has been growing steadily," Yang told reporters. "It
has not only survived the severe test of the financial crisis in
Asia last year, but also gained growth higher than the inflation
rate."
</P>
<P>
Most of the income for the fund comes from the annual land
sale. The Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese Land Group is
entrusted to manage the fund on behalf of the Macao SAR
Government.
</P>
<P>
Yang stressed that the Chinese side has always abided by the
principle of stability and security in the management of the fund
as the money belongs to the Macao SAR Government.
</P>
<P>
The main form of investment is in bank deposits, said Edmundo
Hau-Wah Ho, who heads the investment committee of the fund. Ho
added that there are also some low-risk and high-credibility
bonds.
</P>
<P>
"We do not do any transactions of stocks or of foreign
currency, so we can avoid being hit by the negative side of the
crisis," Ho said. "In addition, most of our money is deposited in
Macao banks, which were not hit by the financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
"In particular, we gained profits by taking advantages brought
about following the crisis," Ho added. "The higher bank deposit
interests meant an opportunity."

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for Competitive Manufacturing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Thursday urged manufacturing and processing industry leaders to
pay attention to improving competitiveness amid the ongoing
financial turmoil sweeping East and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a processing and manufacturing symposium and
exhibition held here, Ramos underscored the need for the industry
to accelerate its efforts towards technological modernization in
this period.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the present financial crisis would result in
limited purchasing power, trigger unfair competition and lead to
deterioration of product quality.
</P>
<P>
Ramos stressed that during this time of turbulence, the
Philippine industry leaders should focus on improving
competitiveness, starting with increasing investments in human
resources development and enhancing training programs to include
re-orientation of existing science and engineering educational
programs.
</P>
<P>
To prop up the weakened financial capability, domestic savings
and foreign investments must be encouraged, he added. He urged the
leaders to go into joint venture projects and work together to
push research and development activities.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed confidence that despite the regional financial
crisis, the Philippines is able to weather the storm, saying that
"progress will come swiftest to those who have the soundest
science and technology foundations".

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Warns Against Flying over Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Air Force has warned
airline operators to stop flying over the Bakassi Peninsula as
the face-off between Nigeria and Cameroun over the ownership of
it thickens.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the force's station in Calabar
near the Nigeria-Cameroun border issued Wednesday, "all airline
operators are hereby warned to desist flying through Bakassi
airspace."
</P>
<P>
Any aircraft that flies through it "will be brought down", the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The warning, though it did not specify reasons for or the time
limit of the ban, was copied to two oil companies which fly their
workers by helicopters to their respective offshore oil rigs
close to that area.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian and Cameroun have been clashing since early 1994 on
Bakassi, a territory of about 1,000 square kilometers and
believed to be rich in fishery and oil resources.
</P>
<P>
Tension seems to be amounting since February when there have
been a series of reported attacks on Nigerians resident in the
peninsula by forces from Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Nigerian Defense Headquarters said that
Cameroun, using a helicopter mounted with general purpose machine
gun, attacked troops and civilians in several areas of Bakassi,
seriously injuring at least 43 of Nigerians, including 20 market
women and more than 18 school children.
</P>
<P>
The reported attacks may have led to the warning.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the ownership of Bakassi was filed to the
International Court of Justice by Cameroun in 1994 and is currently
being heard at the Hague, the Netherlands.

<P>
SHENYANG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- More private enterprises have

<HEADLINE> Inspection of First Iraqi Presidential Site Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.N. weapons experts,
accompanied by senior displomats, started inspections of one of
Iraq's eight presidential sites Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The group, led by deputy chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on scrapping Iraq's weapons of destruction,
Charles Duelfer, an American, set out for the suburb of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed diplomatic sources said they are going to inspect
a presidential compound in Radwaniyah, outside Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
 and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz last month, Iraq
agrees to open its eight presidential sites, previously declared
off-limits to inspections.
</P>
<P>
A special group of senior diplomats appointed by Annan and arms
experts from UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency,
headed by Sri Lankan Jayanatha Dhanapala, was to carry out the job.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala, who sent a written notice on the inspection the
night before to the Iraqi government, told reporters even he
himself does not know where they are going.
</P>
<P>
"Only Duelfer knows," said an inspector.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. mapmakers, all the eight Iraqi presidential
compounds cover an area of 31.5 square kilometers, including 10
square kilometers of water surface.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler, who ended his five-day visit
to Baghdad and left here Thursday morning, had said there are
1,058 buildings in the presidential compounds.
</P>
<P>
He said it would take about two weeks to finish the inspections
of the first Iraqi presidential compound.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms' Success Stories of Participating in SOE Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou-based Huangpu Copper
Tube Plant, a financially troubled state-owned enterprise (SOE),
generated a 6-million-yuan profit just eight months after it was
sold to a private firm.
</P>
<P>
After the change of ownership, workers' monthly pay also
climbed to 1,100 yuan (132.5 U.S. dollars), which represents a
good blue-color salary even in affluent Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The transformation of Huangpu Copper is considered a "miracle"
by many people. But to private entrepreneur Qin Dezhao, who bought
the ailing SOE at a cost of 95 million yuan (1.14 million
U.S. dollars), the secret to success is simple: "You have to
cutely play the `trump card' of the market," he said
metaphorically.
</P>
<P>
Like many SOEs, Huangpu Copper heavily relied on the
instructions of government departments instead of what Qin calls
the "trump card" of market demand.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the supplier of refrigerator and air-conditioner
parts suffered from stockpiles of unmarketable products while
infringing on its management initiative.
</P>
<P>
After Qin bought the insolvent firm and renamed it Jianlai
Copper Industry Co. Ltd. in April of 1996, he retained all staff
members but reduced management by assigning more than 100 managers
and technicians to the production line. A responsibility system
was also put in place.
</P>
<P>
A new product development scheme also was vigorously sought,
resulting in six new clients which included refrigerator and
air-conditioner giants Wanbao, Xinfei and Gree.
</P>
<P>
Jianlai made a profit of six million yuan at the end of 1996
and 5.5 million yuan in the first half of 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
Jianlai is only one example of private firms taking part in the
ongoing restructuring of SOEs in south China's Guangdong
Province.

<HEADLINE> WB Approves $155m for Uganda's Education Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has approved
155 million U.S. Dollars to support Universal Primary Education
(UPE) program in Uganda, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fund consisted of a 75 million-dollar grant and 80 million
dollars of credit from the WB through its lending arm, the
International Development Association (IDA).
</P>
<P>
The interest free IDA credit is on standard terms of 40 years
maturity (including 10 years grace period) and a 0.75 percent
service charge, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The money will support the educational budget of the country,
said Jim Adams, the WB country director in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The UPE support operation reflects a new flexible lending
policy recently adopted by the WB, the Monitor daily noted.
</P>
<P>
"This operation represents a new way of doing business for the
WB and has been made possible by the important strides Uganda has
made in the management of its economy, said Adams, adding, "the
government has put together a sound project (UPE) which we are
delighted to support."

<HEADLINE> Private Firms' Success Stories of Participating in SOE Restructuring (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An economic powerhouse in China, Guangdong Province excels in
private economy development with 123,000 firms in 1997, surpassing
all regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The private sector, which had been a political taboo for a long
time, is currently cited as part of the national economy by
Communist Party documents. Taking advantage of this, the Guangdong
government is encouraging private firms to compete with their
state-run counterparts for a share of restructuring SOEs through
acquisitions, mergers, shareholding and leases.
</P>
<P>
In an asset-injection arrangement, the private Minlian Industry
Co. bought a 42 percent stake in a container terminal, helping the
fund-hungry seaport raise its annual handling capacity to 40,000
containers from 7,000.
</P>
<P>
Haiyin Industry Company, another private player, beat all of
its rivals in bidding to purchase a state-owned factory workshop
in Guangzhou, the provincial capital. This was the first sale of
an SOE workshop to a private player in the province.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, private firms have already pledged to inject 500
million yuan into SOEs, according to the Guangzhou City Federation
of Industry and Commerce. "All government departments should
treasure and support the initiative of private firms," urged
deputy mayor of the city Liu Jinxiang.
</P>
<P>
This "marriage" of state and private sectors will benefit both
parties eventually, market analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
In the reform, more and more unprofitable medium- and
small-size SOEs will be forced to let the market determine their
fates.
</P>
<P>
Those private-sector companies in a position to offer help are
firms with economic strength and sound management, said Long
Guoyi, an official with the Guangdong Provincial Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
In rescuing SOEs, the private businesses themselves can also
improve their own management and technology quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, they can learn to overcome shortfalls caused by
family-type management and short-term investment behavior
characteristic of many private firms, Long said.
</P>
<P>
However, the process is still far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
One major concern is the absence of laws governing asset
evaluation, debt liquidation and employee resettlement of a state
enterprise taken over by a private firm.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the private firms in the restructuring of SOEs is
like a newborn baby, full of life but fragile," commented Huang
Shaoxiong, deputy president of the Guangdong Provincial Federation
of Industry and Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Plans to Introduce Secondary Money Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government plans to
introduce a secondary money market to enhance the existing base by
allowing free floatation of treasury bills among the commercial
banks, insurance companies and other non-banking financial
institutions, leading English newspaper The Financial Express
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This will increase liquidity and flexibility in the local money
market, the newspaper quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to introduce some new market
instruments phase by phase to strengthen the fund management
system in the call money market which is now based on call and
restricted to domestic users, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
A task force in this connection was formed earlier by the
government following a set of proposals submitted by the market
operators of different commercial banks, they noted.
</P>
<P>
In the planned secondary money market, the market players will
be able to operate the treasury bills smoothly with other money
market instruments.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh Bank, the central bank, operates
treasury bills through auctions giving the opportunity only to the
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The treasury bills are now becoming more lucrative to the banks
due to higher yields, and the banks have to sell treasury bills or
to discount them at reduced rates to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government also plans to rationalize the term
measurement of government's treasury bills by introducing
seven-day bills, 15-day bills and 360-day bills step by step.
Presently, the government only sells 30-day, 90-day and one-year
bills to the commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Proper measures will be taken in the planned market to conduct
the operation of treasury bills auction smoothly by reducing the
mismatch between treasury bills settlement and maturity dates,
according to the sources.

<HEADLINE> Another Foreign Bidder Pulls out of Zambia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- One more foreign company has
pulled out of Zambia's copper project due to lower copper price
on the world market, Times of Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Falconbridge has pulled out of the Konkola project consortium
in which it was a participant together with the Zambia Copper
Investment (ZCI), according to the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The pullout has forced ZCI to open fresh negotiations with the
Zambian government and Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) so
that the project could be developed as a joint venture with the
mining conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
ZCI Managing Director Anderson Mazoka said the decision by the
Canadian mining firm to pull out was based on lower copper price
forecasts on the world market and a review of its priorities and
commitments in other projects.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, another Canadian company pulled out of
the Chambishi mine citing the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Chambishi mine now has been offered to a Chinese company.
</P>
<P>
Currently the sale of Nchanga and Nkana divisions of the ZCCM
has hit a snag with the buyers, Kafue Consortium, demanding a
re-negotiation following the fall in the price of copper which
has reduced the cost of the two mines.
</P>
<P>
Due to copper price falls in the international market and
outdated equipment, lack of investment and mismanagement, annual
copper output of the country, one of the biggest copper-producing
countries in the world, has decreased gradually to about 300,000
tons in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investments, advanced technology and
management to revive the stagnating copper production, the
government has invited foreign tenders for the ZCCM mines and
assets.

HANOI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai will pay an official visit to Austria from March 30 to 31,
Vietnam News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Vietnam and Austria have been growing

Vietnam and Austria have signed several important economic
pacts such as the Investment Encouragement and Protection
Agreement and the Trade and Payment Agreement. As a result,
bilateral cooperation has been expanded.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade reached over 26 million U.S. dollars in 1997

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Attacks US Africa Policy Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki had criticized a shift in the United
States' Africa policy from aid to trade, which was embodied in a
bill brought by U.S. President Bill Clinton to Africa before his
current visit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a French magazine, Mbeki attacked
significant elements of the U.S.-Africa Growth and Opportunity
Bill, saying Clinton's "formula, trade not aid, is wrong",
Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
Africa, including South Africa, needed both, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to be high on the agenda of talks between
the United States and South African governments during Clinton's
three-day visit which starts in Cape Town Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It has been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives and
must now go to the senate.
</P>
<P>
The trade bill seeks to open African markets, replace aid with
trade, and grant better U.S. market access for African exports.
It also envisages debt relief, the creation of an African
infrastructure fund linked to political and market reforms, and a
high-level U.S.-African forum.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said international measures should do more than just
open up African markets to sophisticated goods from the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
The continent needed investment which would allow its
economies to increase their capacity to produce exportable goods
rather than just raw materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
The strategic objective of sustainable development meant that
aid could not be excluded from any framework, Mbeki said, adding
that an overwhelming majority of African countries still needed
development assistance, South Africa among them.
</P>
<P>
"This economy today cannot generate the resources that are
required to address all these urgent problems of poverty which
face us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Development assistance was very important and South Africa had
spoken out against "the reduction of aid to (Africa) which has
been happening."
</P>
<P>
It was important to open up markets of the developed world to
African products, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Within the context of World Trade Organization liberalization,
it was necessary to recognize that the United States and poor
African countries like Burkina Faso were not partners of equal
weight which could "enter into an equal bargaining posture," he
said.
</P>
<P>
An approach was needed which regulated world trading patterns in a
way that helped poor countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Rejects Attacks of Human Rights Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi Wednesday dismissed as "inaccurate"
an International Human Rights Watch report on South Africa's
treatment of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The report was supposed to be released Thursday, but was made
available to South African media earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the National Assembly's home affairs committee,
Buthelezi said the report did not reflect the department's main
activities and highlighted isolated incidents. It also contained
many inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
The report by the New York-based watchdog group accused the
South African government of serious human rights abuses against
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
It said the group was extremely concerned about the alarming
rise in xenophobia, or dislike of strangers, in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The organization said unpunished attacks on foreigners had
become disturbingly common, and foreigners were regularly
victimized by the police, the army and guards at detention
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The report said South African police often sought out
undocumented migrants in order to extract bribes, identifying
them through arbitrary means such as complexion.
</P>
<P>
It said the organization had interviewed numerous people who
claimed to have been physically abused by South African arresting
authorities and that at least one refugee, Jean-Pierre Kanyangwa
of Burundi, died after he was allegedly beaten in police
detention.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said such problems were not new, but the department
was in the process of transformation and they were receiving
attention.
</P>
<P>
He said in many cases, remedial action had already been taken
or was in the process of being taken.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it was preposterous to suggest the
department had to provide five-star treatment to illegal aliens
while more than 50 percent of South Africans lived below the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi's deputy, Lindiwe Sisulu, said the methodology used
by the group was doubtful, and there had been no attempt to be
objective.
</P>
<P>
The group had made no attempt to interview Buthelezi, herself,
other home affairs officials, members of the parliament
committee, or even top police officials, Sisulu said.
</P>
<P>
She also questioned the timing of the report's release -- the
day U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The group is using Clinton's visit to raise its own profile,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The human rights watchdog's Africa division director, Peter
Takirambudde, said it was "shameful" for South Africans to be
hostile to aliens.
</P>
<P>
"During the apartheid era, many African countries opened their
doors to South African migrants, exiles and refugees and paid a
heavy economic price for their opposition to apartheid," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the tables are turned, it is shameful to see how
hostile South Africans have become to today's migrants and
refugees who are in need."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are millions of illegal immigrants
in South Africa, which itself faces severe problems of
unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Sovereignty over Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 26 (Xinhua) - Iran Thursday reiterated its full
sovereignty over three islands in the Persian Gulf, which were
also claimed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Tehran radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi expressed
regret that the Arab League foreign ministers' meeting raised the
Iran-UAE dispute over the islands, saying that the Arab and
Islamic countries should be united to counter the common enemies,
particularly Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the final statement at the end of the two-day meeting in
Cairo Wednesday, the Arab ministers voiced support to the UAE's
claim of sovereignty over the three islands. The ministers also
called on Iran to end its occupation of the islands and to solve
the dispute with the UAE peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi voiced Iran's readiness to solve the
"misunderstanding" with the UAE through peaceful means, noting
that Tehran attaches great importance to its relations with
regional Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
One of the priorities of Iran's foreign policies is to
expand relations and cooperation with Arab and Muslims
countries, he said, so Iran welcomes measures to politically
solve disputes between Tehran and Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi stressed that the three islands of Abu Musa, the
Greater and the Less Tunbs belonged to Iran, saying that
exacerbating the "misunderstanding" between Iran and the UAE was
not in the interest of the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Islamic countries should be united to
counter the Israeli government which was continuing its
aggressive and expansionist policy in the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three disputed islands in 1972 after
the British colonist forces withdrew from the region. Both
Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the
islands, though they reached an agreement to co-rule the Abu
Musa island after the British pull-out.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the UAE called for an arbitrate by
the Hague International Court while Iran rejected involvement of
any third party in the issue, stressing that the
"misunderstanding" between the two countries should be solved
through bilateral talks.

<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
met here today with a Lao delegation led by Oudom Khatthiya, vice
president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) and
chairman of Lao Front for National Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
As friendly neighboring countries, Hu said the people of China
and Laos have a long history of friendly exchanges. Leaders of the
two nations in recent years have kept frequent contacts, through
which they frankly and sincerely exchanged views on issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions are beneficial to the smooth development of
bilateral ties and regional peace and stability, and further
consolidate and strengthen the China-Laos friendly and cooperative
relationship," He said, adding that such meetings are also in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples and meet common wishes of
the two states.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice president highly evaluated the achievements
made by Laos in the process of reform and opening to the outside
world, and believed that the Laos, under the leadership of Lao
People's Revolutionary Party and the newly elected Lao government,
can surmount any difficulty, reach proposed goals and score new
accomplishments in national construction.
</P>
<P>
Oudom said he completely agreed with Hu's comment on the
bilateral ties. LPDR and the Lao government would like to thank
for the long-term support and help given by the Chinese Communist
Party and the Chinese government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told Hu that in the visit he witnessed the great achievement
made by China in its reform and opening-up drive, adding that the
progress could encourage the Lao people in their own reform and
opening-up cause.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Lao government and people cherish the
friendly and cooperative relationship with China and want to
advance the existing Laos-China good-neighborly relationship with
the Chinese side.

<HEADLINE> Casino Magnate Says Macao Casino Business Satisfying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Macao casino magnate Stanley Ho
said that Macao casinos achieved a "quite satisfying business" in
1997, and that he is confident of the future of Macao casinos.
</P>
<P>
A report in Thursday's Macao Daily News quoted Stanley Ho,
general manager of the Macao Tourism and Amusement Company (STDM)
which runs franchise casino business in Macao, as saying on
Wednesday that casino business was better in 1997 than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ho refused to reveal detailed figures of his casino business
income last year, saying the income would not be announced until
the Macao Legislative Assembly finished discussing about it.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Macao Jockey Club made a net profit of 41
million patacas (about 5 million U.S. dollars) in 1997. Ho is also
the chairman of the board of directors of the club.
</P>
<P>
Ho, elected a member of the Standing Committee of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) earlier this month, said he has full confidence
in the future growth of Macao's casinos and Macao's overall
development.
</P>
<P>
He cited his proposal to build a huge sightseeing tower, which
will be higher than the Effeil in France, in the territory to
boost Macao's tourism, as a proof.
</P>
<P>
The tower is to cost some 800 million patacas (about 100
million dollars). It is now waiting for approval by the Macao
Government.

<HEADLINE> New Safety Systems Underway for Turkey's Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has started preparations
for setting up new systems to secure safe passage of ships through
its straits, one of the busiest waterways in the world, the Daily
News newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting on these projects was held in Istanbul, bi-sected by
the straits, on Wednesday under the chairmanship of Guven Erkay,
senior adviser of the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
"All of these projects will be handed over to the state and
ready to function on January 1, 2000," Erkay, former commander of
the Turkish Naval Forces, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that six groups composed of governmental officials and
experts have been formed to carry out these projects under the
instruction of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Establishing an electronic system to control the ship passage,
choosing highly qualified management staff as well as increasing
the efficiency of the maintenance and rescue operation will be the
key parts of the works, according to Erkay.
</P>
<P>
The straits - Bosphorus Strait, Marmara Sea and Dardanelles
Strait - link the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. According to
official statistics, 60,000 commercial ships sailed through the
straits last year, which means 150 ships each day.
</P>
<P>
The planned projects to exploit the abundant Caspian oil has
made the government more concerned about the possibility of
increased pollution in the straits, local observers said.
</P>
<P>
Some oil tanks and vessels shipping chemical, radiant and
other dangerous products also pose a serious threat to the health
of local people and the environment of Istanbul, Turkey's largest
city and the most popular tourist destination, as well.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide the finance and will soon invite
domestic and international tenderers to compete for the lucrative
projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police pounced on former
finance minister Ronald Penza's company here on Wednesday and got
away with property to recover more than 150 million Kwacha (about
100,000 U.S. dollars) it owes its former group financial
controller.
</P>
<P>
The company owes Moonjelly Joseph the 150 million Kwacha in
arrears of salary, inducement allowances, gratuity and other
terminal benefits, Zambia Daily Mail reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph was awarded the money following a high court judgement
in favour of the former financial controller early this month.
</P>
<P>
Penza was dismissed in a cabinet reshuffle last week.
</P>
<P>
The cause for his dismissal has not been given but president
Frederick Chiluba warned his ministers against being arrogant and
inaccessible to the public.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said no leader should personalize government programs
and misdirect themselves into believing that without them such
programs would fail.
</P>
<P>
It is unnecessary for leaders to publicise their possessions
and levels of their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba issued the warning four days after he sacked Penza,
who had been holding the portfolio from 1994.

years ago between the two countries had led to a significant

government's decision to scrap a joint aviation agreement only
days before it was due to come into force.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- News that Japan was going to
pump much more money than expected into its faltering economy
boosted the Japanese yen on Thursday, which took the Australian
dollar along with it for the ride.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed on its highs of the local session at
67.17 U.S. cents, up from 66.87 late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After spending most of the local session in a tight range
sub-67 U.S. cents, the unit jumped up in line with the yen when
Japanese wire services reported that Japan's economic stimulus
package would amount to 16 trillion yen, rather than the 10
trillion previously expected.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party later confirmed the
package would exceed the 16 trillion yen mark.
</P>
<P>
The official release of the package is due later Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia Treasury Manager Paul Macarounas said the
market is "still a little cautious of what will be in there and
whether Japan is taking the right measures."
</P>
<P>
It is not expected to contain the big income tax cuts urged by
businesses, politicians and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also finished the local session at 86.41
Japanese yen from 86.99 yen previously, and at 1.2266 Deutsche
marks from 1.2219 marks.

<HEADLINE> Poor Areas' Health Sectors to Get World Bank Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Some poor areas in China will
spend 85 million U.S. dollars of World Bank loans on improving
local health care levels, according to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The six-year loan project, covering 97 underdeveloped counties
in 10 central and western provinces, will benefit 32 million
people who need better health-care facilities and services, said
Liu Yunguo, an official with the ministry's Foreign Loan Office.
</P>
<P>
"The money will be partially spent on construction or
renovation of township clinics, as well as programs to improve
women's and children's health care, immunization work, control of
tuberculosis and iodine deficiency disease, and cataract
treatments," Liu told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has agreed to allocate 45.5 million
U.S. dollars in supporting funds when the project is kicked off
in June, he added.
</P>
<P>
This will be the eighth cooperative project between the Chinese
government and the World Bank to provide loans to improve the
country's health sector.
</P>
<P>
The loan project plans to support the establishment of a
cooperative medical insurance system in some rural areas. The
system, raising funds both from rural residents and governments,
will pay most medical expenses for individuals.
</P>
<P>
Part of the loans will also be used to pay fees for women and
children to receive health care and immunizations, as well as 60
percent of the medical expenses of some poor residents, who
account for 5 percent of 32 million people.
</P>
<P>
"Although health budgets were increased in recent years, poor
areas are still under the nation's average levels in terms of
health-care facilities, services and residents' health condition,"
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the World Bank loan project not only provided
monetary supports, but also introduced advanced technology and
good management models to China's health sector.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes over 2.5 Tons of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces seized
over 2.5 tons of narcotics in the northeastern province of
Khorasan over the past few days, the official news agency IRNA
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A provincial security forces official was quoted as saying that
1,157 kilograms opium and 40 kilograms of hashish were captured
following fighting between the security force and armed smugglers
in Torbat Heidariyeh on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of munitions were also found and confiscated
from the smugglers who fled away under the cover of darkness, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that another 1,430 kilograms of opium and other
illicit drugs were discovered in vehicles at various check-points
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Several people were arrested in connection with
drug-trafficking and handed over to judicial authorities, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Khorasan province has been the main transit route for drug
trafficking to Europe from one of the world drug-producing centers
"the Golden Crescent" overlapping Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian anti-drug authorities, the country seized
an average of 160 tons of various drugs, half of which caught in
Khorasan province due to its adjacency to "the Golden Crescent."

<HEADLINE> Financial Reform to Spur China's Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Speeding up the reform of China's
financial sector will enable its stock market to become more
standardized and healthier, said Richard Grasso, chairman and
chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
</P>
<P>
Grasso told Xinhua in an interview here today that the
deepening of China's financial reform will increase investors'
confidence in China's stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has reiterated that China will make
thorough reforms in the country's financial sector in three years
by stepping up its central bank's supervision and regulation
functions and by letting commercial banks operate independently.
</P>
<P>
Grasso spoke highly of the rapid development and encouraging
trends in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. He said the
trend indicated that China's stock market is becoming more mature
and will play a more important and positive role in consolidating
China's economic development and effective use of funds.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE will further its cooperation with China's two stock
markets by increasing personnel and exchanging technology, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Grasso said that it is too early to comment on the performance
of 17 Chinese businesses and Chinese-funded companies registered
in Hong Kong and Singapore which had stocks listed on the NYSE
because they have been listed for too short a period. However, he
said foreign investors are very interested in China and have
expressed confidence in listed Chinese businesses.
</P>
<P>
He said that several other Chinese companies will be listed on
the NYSE in the near future, and that more Chinese businesses are
welcome.
</P>
<P>
The sound political ties between the United States and China
will help promote the bilateral exchanges and cooperation in
financial sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Grasso also said that he planned to tell Chinese President Jiang
Zemin during their meeting today that since Jiang toured the NYSE
last year the index has continued to rise. "I will thank him from
the bottom of my heart, and I will thank him for our investors,"
Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE is the largest equities marketplace in the world. As
of this March, 3,056 companies had stock listed on the NYSE,
including 345 foreign companies. These companies had 206 billion
shares worth more than 12 trillion U.S. dollars.

SEOUL, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The body of a U.S. Air Force pilot
whose plane crashed off a South Korean coast was found in the sea,
60 miles west of Osan Air Base, the U.S. military command said

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The legislature in Shenzhen, a
special economic zone that borders Hong Kong, plans to increase
controls on administrative and judicial bodies this year,
according to Li Guangzhen, chairman of the municipal People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Li delivered a report at the on-going Fifth Session of the
Second Municipal People's Congress, where he said that the
municipal People's Congress last year had a series of motions on
the rights of suspects and the accused and on public security
bureaus' rights in handling economic disputes and court methods.
</P>
<P>
Judicial departments responded promptly and came up with ways
of dealing with those problems, which made the municipal police,
lawyers, and the public prosecutors more conscientious and helped
implement the Criminal Procedure Law, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal People's Congress was not satisfied with the
municipal government's management of projects and, therefore,
proposed that government departments further improve
government-funding decisions.
</P>
<P>
They also said departments should strictly ensure the quality
of projects and auditing and supervision, on which the municipal
government says it places great importance. Li said he believes
that improved supervision will play a positive role in building a
socialist legal system and democracy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China's two institutional
advertising entries won bronze medals in the first Asia-Pacific
Advertising Festival recently held in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that China's institutional advertising
won awards in international competitions.
</P>
<P>
The two ads emerged from China's large-scale institutional
advertising campaigns launched during the last two years, said Jia
Yubin, deputy secretary-general of the China Advertising
Association, in an exclusive interview here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,077 advertisements and commercials selected from
the countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific area were submitted
in the advertising festival, which was sponsored by major Asian
countries such as China and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lu Shengzhang, China's first judge of international
advertising competition, said that the result exactly reflects the
current creative level of China's advertisers.
</P>
<P>
Insiders said that the two precious bronze medals should
inspire and encourage China's advertising sector, which was
discouraged after failures in the Cannes Advertising Festival in
1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Heping, director of the Advertising Department of the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce, holds an
optimistic attitude toward the future of China's advertising
sector.
</P>
<P>
"The world is gradually understanding China, as we are
gradually understanding the world," Zheng said. "That foreigners
buy our products also means that they have come to accept our
culture. I believe that, more and more, China's ads will be
honored in international competition."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Eyes at Far East for Fish Fillets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is setting eyes
on the Far East market for fish fillets exports after the
European Union imposed a ban on the goods since last December.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned a meeting with owners of fish
processing factories in the Mwanza Region on the shore of the
Lake Victoria early next month to look for an alternative market,
Dar es Salaam newspaper The Guardian said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Zakia Meghji,
told the paper Wednesday in the city that the meeting will be a
follow-up to a similar one held in Kampala two weeks ago where
ranking officials from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda met to look for
alternative markets.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there is a potential market in the Far East
where the three Lake Victoria riparian states can export their
fish products.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the spread of cholera, a water-borne disease, the
EU banned fish imports from the three countries since it was
detected in the Lake Victoria region in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO), however, pointed out it
has not documented any outbreak of cholera resulting from
commercially imported food, despite the fact that a minimum of 50
countries in the world have been affected by the epidemic or
endemic cholera each year since 1961.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania used to export 13,000 tons of fish fillets to the
European Union market. Out of the total exports, 7,000 tons were
fresh fish fillets while the remaining is frozen fish.
</P>
<P>
The EU has banned the exports of fresh fish fillets while
exports of frozen fillets are not affected. The embargo will
cause Tanzania a loss of 4.4 billion shillings (about 6.7 million
US Dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
The fishing industry earns Tanzania 15 million US Dollars a
year, industry sources said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cuts Down Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's revenue projection this
year will fall by an estimated 584.4 million U.S. Dollars as a
result of the cut in crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Petroleum Resources announced Monday to cut
down its daily production of about two million barrels by 125,000
barrels, in a desperate bid to forestall the downward slide in
the oil price in the world market, along with similar concerted
actions by other oil producers.
</P>
<P>
Revenue estimates from the oil sector for the 1998 fiscal year
were based on production of 2.175 million barrels per day (BPD)
at an official selling price of 17 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the 125,000 BPD cut would be taken
from the 250,000 BPD set aside for domestic consumption or from
the 989,750 BPD set aside for export.
</P>
<P>
Economic watchers, however, have long predicted a review in
the government's revenue projection in this year's budget

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Kerp Oil Output Despite OPEC Cutback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Unimpressed by a move by several
oil producing countries to ease world oil glut, Egypt is to
maintain its current production level, an English weekly reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Al Ahram Weekly quoted an official as saying that Egypt,
which is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), will keep its oil output at 850,000 barrels a
day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
The official said Egypt's oil production had fallen from
900,000 bpd a few years ago, even though consumption is increasing
annually by about 4 percent. "Our production has been stable for
the past few years and we have no plans to reduce it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdi el-Banbi has expressed
appreciation of the coordination among oil producers to cut oil
supplies by between 1.6 million and 2 million bpd in a bid to
prevent a price collapse.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and non-OPEC Mexico
orchestrated a cutback pact last Sunday to shore up prices, a move
followed by a number of other OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
So far the pledges on slimming production have totaled 870,000
bpd and given an immediately boost to oil prices, which had
already been at their lowest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
The depressed oil prices were a direct result of an OPEC
decision last November to raise output ceiling from 25 million bpd
to 27.5 million bpd, a mild northern hemisphere winter and the
Southeast Asia financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister, however, blamed some OPEC members like
Qatar and Nigeria for exceeding their quotas. Egypt will be badly
affected by the sagging prices since oil represents 10 percent of
its gross domestic products, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we will try to reduce losses by increasing locally refined
products and reducing the export of crude oil," said Banbi.
</P>
<P>
He added that the responsibility to protect and stabilize the
market falls on all oil-producing countries, whether OPEC members
or not.

XI'AN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwestern
China is trying to turn 60,000 square kilometers of wasteland into
a grain production base in three to five years as part of its
sustainable development program.
</P>

The land improvement project will use seven billion yuan to
improve some 660,000 hectares of wasteland, and increase annual
grain output by over three billion kilograms, government sources
say.
</P>

The province produces 10 billion kilograms of grain annually,
and wants to increase its annual grain production to 14 billion kg
by 2000 and 16 billion by 2010.

The project mainly covers Yulin and Yan'an prefectures in the
northern part of the province, which have slightly over 28 percent
of the province's total farmland.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists say that the two areas have great potential for use
as a new granary, and that local farmers have been successful in
attempts to try new ways to get higher yields.

<HEADLINE> Ruins of Ancient Battlefield Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The ruins of a battlefield from
the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-402) was recently discovered in
north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Two historians in Shanxi did a lot field studies and say they
believe that the Battle of Luchuan took place in the modern city
of Lucheng along a 25-km stretch of the ZhuozZhang River.
</P>
<P>
The battle fought in 370 was part of a war between two minority
ethnic groups during the Eastern Jin and, along with the battles
of Guandu, Chibi, and Feishui, is famous for the fact that a
smaller force defeated a much larger enemy, in this case, 60,000
soldiers facing a force five times its size.

<HEADLINE> Cooperative Medical Services Helping Chinese Farmers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government has been trying to restore the service
in rural areas since the end of the '80s, and Anhui has spent tens
of thousands of yuan on it, and now covers about 30 percent of its
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
It plans to cover 80 percent, according to Hui Liangyu, who
explains that each village clinic has two to three professionals,
who can provide ordinary medical services.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the medical service come from the village and the
farmers. When costs go above 100 yuan, 30 percent of it can be
covered by the fund, Zhou Huozhao, a farmer in the city of Ningguo
in Anhui, says. Once, when he broke a bone that couldn't be
treated by the village clinic, he was transferred to the county
hospital, which charged him more than 1,100 yuan. Fortunately, 30
percent of the cost was paid by the village.
</P>
<P>
And, the number of people needing help at better-equipped
hospitals has declined thanks to improved medical facilities and
personnel at village clinics, Zhang Mingying, a village doctor of
the village of Tongshan in Anhui, says.
</P>
<P>
Setting up a cooperative medical care system is a major task of
the Chinese government to meet WHO criteria for "Health for All"
status.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health announced last July that it will re-open
the cooperative medical insurance system in rural areas by the
year 2010, when at least 80 percent of the country's 900 million
rural residents will benefit from the system.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces like Shandong, Hainan, Anhui, and Hubei have
already made some progress in this. And, for farmers like Zhou
Huozhao who have benefited from the program, participation is no
doubt good, relieving them of the worry of medical expenses.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Starts State Visit to S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton arrived at Cape Town international airport Thursday
Morning on the fourth leg of his six-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was accompanied by his wife Hillary, Secretary for
Labour Alexis Herman, Commerce Secretary William Daley,
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, and his special envoy for
democracy in Africa Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were welcomed by South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo and other government officials, the South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said the visit was significant because it was the first
trip by an American president to South Africa and would
strengthen relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 local reporters were at the airport for Clinton's
arrival. The 150-member strong White House press corps, which
chartered its own plane, was expected later.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be officially welcomed by South African President
Nelson Mandela Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President will address a joint sitting of parliament
later Thursday. On Friday Clinton will hold bilateral talks with
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will accompany Clinton on a visit to Robben island and
will host a state banquet in his honour Friday night.
</P>
<P>
About 150 members of a group calling itself Moslems against
global oppression demonstrated briefly outside the Cape Town
international airport to protest Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
Protest organizer Moaim Achmed told reporters Clinton was not
welcomed on the soil of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The placards included slogans saying: "Clinton go home",
"America go home", and "death to Mr. evil".
</P>
<P>
"Mister evil, as we call him, has no idea of peace. He makes
war against our people. We will wait here until he arrives, and
give him a strong message from Mosles around the world," Achmed
said.
</P>
<P>
A heavy police contingent prevented the protesters from
entering the airport premises. No violence was reported.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Reduce Railways Staff Levels by 20% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A National Railways of Zimbabwe
(NRZ) official Wednesday said the recent instruction by the board
to management to reduce staff by 20 percent was a continuation of
a process to restore viability of the loss-making parastatal, the
daily the Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NRZ public relations manager Herbert Mondlani said the target
had always been to operate with a staff complement of 8,000 which
was the sustainable figure vis-a-vis the traffic levels and
income generated.
</P>
<P>
"While the voluntary early retirement scheme was one of the
measures taken to reduce labour redundancy," he said, adding,
"management has also looked at other less painful ways of
reducing staff costs through encouraging employees to increase
productivity by raising total amount of our traffic levels."
</P>
<P>
He said costs would also be reduced through redeployment and
retraining of staff so that extra labor was re-located internally
to cover critical areas.
</P>
<P>
Recruitment had been frozen, he said, adding that the
rationalization exercise covered all grades including management.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary early retirement scheme was introduced in 1988
to reduce staff levels from 18,000 to an optimum figure of 8,000.
It now stands at 12,000.

NANNING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region wants to provide a more favorable environment by
halting unreasonable charges and improving efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenxue, vice-chairman of the region's People's
Government, says that the move is meant to help the autonomous
region open more to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Guangxi used 1.27 billion US dollars worth of
foreign capital, an increase of 23.5 percent over the previous
year. But, to attract more foreign investment, the autonomous
region has a number of regulations allowing joint ventures to cut
payments on 331 items.
</P>
<P>
The government has urged departments to perfect the charges,
and says that foreign-funded enterprises can refuse to pay the
fees if proper and uniform receipts are not provided. And
procedures for approving foreign-funded projects have been
simplified to improve the quality of service and the work
efficiency of government.

<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Air Transportation
Office (ATO) Thursday allowed Philippine Airlines to dismantle the
Airbus A320 aircraft which overshot the Bacolod airport runway
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 Philippine Airlines maintenance personnel are now
working in two shifts to clear the accident site of the wreckage.
The work is expected to be completed the soonest by March 29, the
ATO said.
</P>
<P>
It added that traffic along the avenue where the jet was
resting on its belly had been re-routed to allow cranes and other
heavy equipment to lift the aircraft in portions, beginning with
the tail section, the fuselage and then the wings.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory dismantling from the aircraft's interior was
completed Wednesday night. All recovered avionics, electronics and
other parts will be shipped to Manila.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft had been declared a total wreck by the French

<HEADLINE> Tibet Become One of Most Concentrated Area for Centenarians (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Ceji, a Tibetan woman who lives in
the suburbs of Lhasa, Tibet's capital, is so old that she cannot
say for certain how old she is.
</P>
<P>
She only remembers "being born in the Year of the Ram",
something that helped her relatives reach the conclusion that
she's 103. But, she's still five years younger than the eldest
resident of the Tibet Autonomous Region, on the Qinghai-Tibetan
Plateau, the "roof of the world".
</P>
<P>
Of its 2.4 million people, at least 60 are centenarians, making
the region one of the parts of China with the greatest
concentration of centenarians.
</P>
<P>
And, although Ceji is happy to answer reporters' questions, she
keeps on with the work at hand: licking a spoon clean after making
glutinous rice cakes, and whispers, "Life is excellent."
</P>
<P>
She was born a tenant peasant and now lives with her youngest
daughter and son-in-law. The six-member family has a hectare of
land and a small grocery store, giving them a better life. She
likes to look at the family's ten chickens and six cows, drink
butter tea, play with the kids, and watch TV while seated on the
sofa.
</P>
<P>
She usually goes to bed at eight pm and takes a nap at noon
time, her son-in-law, Qoijor, says, and her three daily meals are
always the same: a bowl of glutinous rice cake with sugar.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- As sales surge in China's
computer market after a winter-long stagnation, more and more
foreign information technology companies are jumping on the
bandwagon for a bigger share in the emerging market.
</P>
<P>
The Motorola Company of the United States this week launched a
Chinese handwriting input system, WisdomPen, to expand its
presence in China's computer market in addition to
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
With Motorola's WisdomPen software, computer users can input
Chinese characters by writing on a special pad. With a
millennium-long handwriting tradition, Chinese will no longer be
required to give up their habit to learn keyboard-based input
standards.
</P>
<P>
A Motorola representative said computers installed with Chinese
handwriting input systems is less than one percent of the
country's total. To promote the use of its advanced WisdomPen
software in China, Motorola will establish chain stores in most
medium- and large-size cities this year, and further reduce
production costs.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. information technology giant, Hewlett-Packard
(HP), initiated a technical forum in China on March 25 which runs
until April 22.
</P>
<P>
At the HP Megaforum, the company will offer exhibitions and
seminars in six Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Wuhan to enhance the cooperation with Chinese IT
enterprises and local governments in the electronics business
field.
</P>
<P>
HP has signed an agreement with the China Goods Order System,
an ordering network covering 25 Chinese cities, to forge a
strategic partnership which includes technical cooperation in
network-based marketing and networking projects.
</P>
<P>
Other big names such as Lucent Technologies, IBM and Intel have
joined the competition. Bell Laboratories, the
research-and-development arm of Lucent Technologies, has signed a
cooperation agreement with Beijing University on launching a joint
laboratory to develop applications software and data
communications solutions for China's information technology market.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.2 million personal computers were sold in China last
year. China now has nearly nine million personal computers in
use, which is far from meeting the market needs of a nation
with 1.2 billion people, according to industrial analysts
here.

<HEADLINE> Rift Valley Fever Kills 2,000 Sheep in N.Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The deadly Rift Valley has
killed some 2,000 goats and sheep in four villages since February
in north Tanzania's Monduli District.
</P>
<P>
Monduli veterinarian Adam Rwegasira has appealed to the
government to take urgent measures contain the spread of the
disease, Daily News said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Minister for Agriculture and Co-operatives, Paul
Kimiti, who visited the district assess the alarming situation
Wednesday, the veterinarian said the district needs at least 150
million shillings to buy vaccines for the remaining livestock.
</P>
<P>
The district, close to the Tanzania-Kenya border, has about
300,000 goats and sheep and each dose of vaccine cost 500
shillings, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
Rwegasira also said they have received 900 vaccines from a
non-governmental organization, Vetaid, but added it was
insufficient considering the magnitude of the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
He named the affected villages as Sinya, Tingatinga, Sinonik
and Matale.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which causes haemorrhagic fever-like illness, has
also killed seven people in the neighboring Ngorongoro District
last month.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Monduli district officials that the
government will devote all efforts to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
The government has requested the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) to provide assistance to contain the spread of
RVF, which has caused heavy death toll of people and livestock in
Kenya and Somalia since last November.
</P>
<P>
RVF virus is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes, but human
beings can also be infected by contact with blood or body fluids
from infected animals which may occur during slaughtering the
animals or handling aborted feteses, World Health Organization

GUANGZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade and overseas

</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's foreign trade was worth 11.6 billion US dollars

<HEADLINE> Ex-Congolese (K) Ambassador Denied Asylum in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official has
revealed that the Zambian government cannot grant political
asylum to former Congo-Kinshasa Ambassador Bongo Lega and others
seeking refuge in the country, state-owned Times of Zambia
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to reports that Bongo has refused to heed to a recall
order from his government fearing persecution and is instead
seeking asylum in Zambia, Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa
said in an interview Wednesday there is no basis for granting the
request.
</P>
<P>
Bongo has not formally requested the Zambian government for
asylum but merely intimated his anxieties on going back to
Kinshasa, said Machungwa.
</P>
<P>
The Home Affairs Minister further pointed out that even if he
had applied, Zambia is not in a position to grant his request
because it does not have solid information that former Zaire's
recalled ambassadors or embassy officials face persecution upon
return.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa added that such allegations will be inconsistent
with the current reconstruction process Congo (K) is undergoing
and as a result "there is no basis upon which we can grant the
request for political asylum to the ambassador."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Congolese ambassador did not
heed to recalls three times last year for fear of being
persecuted upon his return to Kinshasa amid speculations that he
is a nephew of Mobutu Sese Seko, late former President of the
then Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Bongo was removed from his post after he refused to heed to
the recalls. However, Bongo ignored the decision of the removal.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia also said that Banza Mukaleyi, Vice-President
of Mobutu's popular movement for the revolution, is also in
Zambia seeking political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Mukaleyi is said to have been in Zambia with his two wives and
13 children since last year and has applied for asylum for fear
of reprisals from the current government.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- An agriculture poverty-relief
project has helped two million people in northwest China's Gansu
province in two years' time by using plastic sheet-covered grain
growing.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, about 50 percent of the impoverished people in
Gansu have gotten out of poverty because of high grain yields,
especially in dry areas with low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Although Gansu had severe droughts in 1997, grain production in
plastic sheet-covered areas still increased, producing 4,179
kilograms of grain per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The technology has helped farmers change from conventional
crops to corn, wheat and potatoes. Last year, there were 667,000
hectares of plastic sheet-covered areas, 54,000 of them for grain.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has gotten thousands of cadres and
technicians to help peasants with the new techniques, and
discounted loans have been provided in poverty-stricken people in
the plastic sheet-covered area. Gansu put 260 million yuan into
loans in the two years to help peasants purchase fertilizer and
plastic sheet.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture supply departments have provided 20,000 tons of
plastic sheeting and over 200,000 tons of fertilizer.

<HEADLINE> Third World Women More Risky in Childbirth: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Women in developing countries
are 40 times more likely to die due to pregnancy and childbirth
complications compared with their counterparts in developed
states, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.
</P>
<P>
Only 27 maternal deaths occur for every 100,000 live births in
developed countries per year, compared with 480 in developing
countries, the Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted WHO as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
For every woman that dies, 30 others develop chronic
debilitating conditions, such as a destroyed birth canal,
resulting in incontinence and infertility, the U.N. health body
said in a bulletin for World Health Day, to be observed on April
7.
</P>
<P>
"Of all the health statistics monitored by the World Health
Organization, maternal mortality is the one with the largest
discrepancy between developed and developing countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
Eastern and western Africa have the highest maternal
mortalities among the developing countries, with as many as 1,000
women dying for every 100,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by WHO indicate that the lifetime risk of
a Kenyan woman to die due to pregnancy-related complications is
one in 20, compared with one in 8,700 in Switzerland or one in
9,200 in Spain, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to very limited access to basic medical
care during pregnancy, child delivery and the post-parturition
period, compounded by lack of political will to provide
accessible and affordable midwifery care.
</P>
<P>
"In developed countries...every pregnant woman has access to
special care during pregnancy and childbirth," said WHO.
</P>
<P>
"Such is not the case in many developing countries where each
pregnancy represents a journey into the unknown from which all
too many women never return," it noted.

<HEADLINE> NZ Exports Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's balance of
merchandise trade continued its downward trend in February,
recording the first February deficit since 1992, said Statistics
New Zealand in a media release received on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The office blamed the Asian financial crisis for the poor trade
results as exports to Asia slumped 25.2 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Figures for the provisional trade balance for February showed a
deficit of 18 million NZ dollars (10 million U.S. dollars),
contrary to financial market expectation of a surplus of 118
million NZ dollars (66 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has run a trade deficit in recent months.
Traditionally, the trade balance is in surplus from December to
June.
</P>
<P>
While exports are falling, imports are rising because of a
weaker NZ dollar.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Indonesia, New Zealand's fastest growing overseas
market, dropped sharply by 20 million NZ dollars (over 11 million
U.S. dollars) in February to only 6 million NZ dollars (3.4
million U.S. dollars). Sales to South Korea also fell in the
month.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit export sectors are hides and skins, down 28
percent in the past three months, followed by wood, down 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Starts Regular Flights to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda national airline,
Alliance Express, has launched its air services to Kenya, the
East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three-time-a-week service will originate from Kigali to
Nairobi and back on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Florence Nkera lauded the introduction of the
airline's services in Kenya, saying the move was bound to improve
trade between the two states.
</P>
<P>
"Relationship between Kenya and Rwanda had suffered immensely
due to lack of direct links and we hope with this launch our
people will cease seeing each other as total strangers but as a
people who could do business together," she said.
</P>
<P>
She make the remarks during the inauguration of the airline's
services at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jay Shanghavi, the local General Sales Agent for Alliance
Express, said the launch confirmed the carriers' dedication to
its goal of effectively connecting all countries in the Great
Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
It would allow businessmen easy and quick access to the
Rwandese fast growing economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alliance Express which evolved after the demise of the
state-owned Air Rwanda in October last year is a joint venture
between the Rwandan government and the South Africa Airways.
</P>
<P>
It's an associate of Alliance Air which was set up in 1995 as
a joint venture between South African Airways, Uganda Airlines
and Air Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Optical Fingerprinter to Replace Inked Fingerprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed an optical fingerprint-collecting device which is
expected to replace the traditional manual method.
</P>
<P>
With the touch of a finger on a match-box-size glass window,
the apparatus will message the main computer and compare
fingerprints within seconds.
</P>
<P>
The optical device not only collects a picture of a finger, but
it can also record a three-dimensional image to meet the needs of
public security departments.
</P>
<P>
The apparatus, developed by scientists from the Changchun
Institute of Optics and Precision Machines -- China's top optics
research center -- has been approved by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Zhou Wanzhi, associate research fellow at the Changchun
institute attached to the CAS, said part of the performance of the
apparatus is apparently better than that of foreign ones.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that, in comparison with the similar U.S. product,
the Chinese apparatus is much smaller and cheaper, and its images
have a smaller margin for error.
</P>
<P>
Deng Ruiyu, head of the Science and Technology Division of
Jilin Provincial Public Security Department, said police
departments have been using ink to put fingerprints on paper
which are kept with special cards.
</P>
<P>
He said it would take a lot of work to compare collected
fingerprints with the stored fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
As ink cannot be put evenly on the fingers, 70 percent of the
inked fingerprints are not qualified for detectives' work.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the optical fingerprint-collecting apparatus could be
widely used by police in identifying criminals, by banks for
withdrawals, and by companies to secure computer data and provide
fingerprint locking devices.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Attracts 1.5 Bln Dollars in Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign businessmen invested about
1.5 billion U.S. dollars in Bangladesh in the 18 months up to last
December, Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Farooq Sobhan said.
</P>
<P>
From July 1, 1996 to December 31, 1997, a total of 2,137
projects were registered with the BOI worth an estimated 3.4
billion dollars, Sobhan told a visiting Singaporean mission in
Dhaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The service sector attracted the most foreign investors during
the period, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three percent of the investment proposals came from Hong
Kong, 12 percent from Malaysia, 8 percent from South Korea and 7
percent from Singapore, he said.
</P>
<P>
The BOI chief also briefed the Singaporean mission on the
Bangladeshi government's policies and measures for attracting
foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean mission representing both public and private
sectors was jointly organized by Singapore's Trade Development
Board and Confederation of Industries. It came to this South Asian
country to seek opportunities for investment in infrastructure
projects.

<HEADLINE> Cooperative Medical Services Helping Chinese Farmers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in east China's Anhui
Province don't necessarily need to travel a long way to see a
doctor, thanks to a cooperative medical service.
</P>
<P>
One farmer, Fu Liang, had a problem with chronic stomach
trouble, but when he suffered a recent bout he got help right away
when the doctor in his village went to his home and it only cost
him a little over 100 yuan (12 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was only a few years ago when a sudden attack like that
would have forced him to travel several miles to see a doctor at
the county hospital and it would have cost him more than 500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fu doesn't have to worry about his illness anymore because of
the cooperative medical service, which allows farmers to pay only
part of their medical costs, with the collective they belong to
paying the rest.
</P>
<P>
The service started in rural areas in the 1950s, but wasn't
widely used. After 1979, the service went into a period of decline
because of wide-ranging reforms, according to Quan Yunzhen,
vice-director of the Anhui Health Department, and by 1985, it
covered fewer than ten percent of China's rural people, and only
1.2 percent of Anhui's rural people.
</P>
<P>
The decline in service caused some rural families to become
impoverished when a family member became seriously ill, Quan
explains. China's rural people often face unexpected medical
costs, and in poor areas, the expression "going to hospital",
became a metaphor for hard times.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health says that more than 30 percent of
poverty-stricken people in rural China were burdened with medical
expenses, which could easily cost a farmer a year's income if the
disease was bad enough.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Cotton Producer Getting Rid of Outmoded Spindles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- 10,000 outmoded spindles in Mill
No.2 of the Textile Group of China's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous
Region were recently destroyed.
</P>
<P>
This was the opening salvo in a campaign to get rid of 180,000
spindles within three years in China's largest cotton production
center and also a nationwide campaign to get rid of 10 million
spindles in the same period of time.
</P>
<P>
One 53-year-old Uygur employee, Abdurahim Kerim, was standing
there affectionately preparing to get an axe to stroke the
40-year-old spindles, with tears welling up in his eyes. But he
said philosophically, "Getting rid of the old spindles not only
benefits the mill and the state but also we workers, because the
machines, like retired workers, have done what they could."
</P>
<P>
The action left more than 800 workers without job. But, they
felt somewhat relieved when they got the news that the central and
local governments had given the mill three million yuan in
subsidies to help them find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
An 18-year-old girl, Sun Ming, didn't seem too worried about
her future and explained, "I guess I'll be given another post in
the mill." The mill's director seemed to confirm that when he said
that some new projects are being planned to re-employ most of
them.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports Up, Imports Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam had a mixed change in
foreign trade in the first quarter, with exports increasing by
12.2 percent and imports down by 2.6 percent compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show the country is expected to earn an
export revenue of 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Exports by foreign invested enterprises are estimated at 420
million dollars, up 33.8 percent over the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rice led all export items with 1.2 million tons shipped abroad,
2.5 times higher than the same period last year. The country plans
to export four million tons of rice this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the export growth rate in the first quarter was low
due to price reductions of several main export items, especially
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Other exports such as textiles, garments and footwear are
facing fierce competition with other countries in the region which
are severely affected by the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Import turnover in the first quarter is expected to reach 2.65
billion dollars, down by 2.6 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Imports of cars and car parts, cement, clinker and medicines
have dropped sharply. Imports by foreign-invested enterprises in
Vietnam are estimated at 651 million dollars.

And 1.97 percent of people working in agriculture are
specialists, 29.5 in industry are, and 68.5 in the service sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China's recent interest rate cut
will greatly help state industry reforms by alleviating burdens
and fund shortages, according to a senior banking official.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yingliang, president of the Shanghai branch of the People's
Bank of China, the central bank, said that, since 1995, China has
reduced interest rates on loans four times by an average of 4.05
percentage points, and the interest rate on one-year loans was cut
by more than 30 percent, which will be particularly helpful to
Shanghai's state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China announced Wednesday that interest
rates on deposits and loans will be reduced 0.16 and 0.6
percentage points respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bank announced that a reform of the deposit reserve fund
system will begin and that interest rates on loans and deposits of
financial institutions will be lowered.
</P>
<P>
The bank has lowered the interest rate on deposits of financial
institutions from 7.35 percent to 5.22 percent, and interest rates
on loans to financial institutions went down from 9.19 percent to
7.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mao praised the move, saying that it will increase the reserves
of financial institutions and enhance their ability to support
the development of local state-owned companies.

BOGOTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Colombia and Yugoslavia played to
a goalless draw in a friendly here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The hosts, who were one man down for 50 minutes, withstood a
strong attack from the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by midfielders Jorge Bolano and Freddy Rincon,
Colombia put together good plays in midfield, but as usual they
failed to finish, completing their fourth match without a goal.
</P>
<P>
Anthony de Avilo had a clear opportunity to score in the 38th
minute, but his weak shot failed to make it past Ivica Kralj.
</P>
<P>
Colombian keeper Oscar Cordoba was sent off in the 25th minute
for handling the ball outside the area.
</P>
<P>
Keeper Farid Mondragon was brought in as a substitute for Alex
Comas.
</P>
<P>
The entrance of Faustino Asprilla at the start of the second
half invigorated Colombia.
</P>
<P>
They sped up their attack, only to have Yugoslavia respond with
fierce counterattacks launched by Sinisa Mihajlovic and Predag
Mijatovic, who fired on Mondragon from every angle.
</P>
<P>
The one-man deficit was finally erased in the 75th minute, when
Yugoslavia's Goran Djorovic was sent off.

<HEADLINE> Romania Issues Treasury Bills to Stabilize Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Romania issued another 200
billion leus (around 244 million U.S. dollars) in treasury bills
on Thursday to help stabilize the state currency.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Affairs for the Finance Ministry Ionut
Costea said the annual interest rate for the three-month bonds
will drop from 75 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Costea said the reason for the cut in the interest rate for the
short term bill is because the inflation rate is expected to fall
in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft budget, Romania will try to rein in the
inflation rate at about 45 percent, far below last year's 151
percent.
</P>
<P>
Costea said the bills will be issued through the country's
savings banks (CEC).
</P>
<P>
Eliza Sirbu, spokesman of the CEC, said all of the 180 CECs
nationwide will extend their business time, given the great
passion people showed for the previous issue in the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
Romania issued 100 billion leus of treasury bills in January
and 200 billion in February.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe the move intends to draw cash from
working people so as to further achieve a stable currency by
constraining the circulation of money.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the devaluation of Romania's
state currency has been restrained. The exchange rate of leu to
the U.S. dollar has stabilized at 8,200 leu to one U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Take Stern Action Against Spurious Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
take stern actions against marketing and selling spurious drugs
which endanger lives of patients, national English newspaper The
New Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This warning was issued by Minister for Health and Family
Planning Salahuddin Yusuf while speaking at a meeting in Dhaka
recently.
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 pharmaceutical factories in Bangladesh
which produce 95 percent medicine for the country, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The government would submit a bill to the parliament to control
the activities of the "mushroom growth" diagnostic centers and
clinics as well as the drug business, banning all activities
designed to deceive the poor patients, the minister disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The health minister urged all the drug manufacturers not to
allow production and marketing of spurious drugs, and drew
attention of the drug administration to take action against
selling low grade medicines.
</P>
<P>
He requested the drug producers to get their medicines tested
at the drug testing laboratory before marketing.
</P>
<P>
"We must stop deception of innocent people," in this context,
he said, adding putting up deceptive ads in print media should be
stopped, and the country has introduced three-year jail term and a
fine of 0.3 million taka (about 6,521 U.S. dollars) for the
offenders.
</P>
<P>
Value addition in drugs is 70 percent while this sector is the
second highest contributor of revenue in the form of VAT after
cigarette, therefore some drug factories produce and market
spurious medicines for big profit, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Four South Korean School Girls Commit Suicide Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Four South Korean middle school
girls committed suicide by jumping off a high-rise building
together Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The four girls jumped from a corridor on the 20th floor of the
high-rise building, where police found their lined up shoes,
shirts and notes which carried their last words before death.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy which shocked the nation was the second such
collective suicide by middle school girls this year. It occurred
at Chongyangri, Seoul, at 6:30 p.m. (local time) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In January, three middle school girls killed themselves
together.
</P>
<P>
A teacher of the four girls said they were good students but
their home lives were unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
A note by one of the four read: "I really hated my father's
drunken frenzy. Problems at my home are always money, money and
money. My parents have just never been interested in my agony."
</P>
<P>
The media attributed increased suicides to mass layoffs and
mounting bankruptcies since the country entered "IMF period" last
December.
</P>
<P>
Since entering the "IMF period", every month has seen South
Koreans, predominantly businessmen, kill themselves because of
financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
South Korea signed an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund last December for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars
after suffering a serious financial crisis in the second half of
1997.

</P>
<P>
She danced leading roles in many classics such as "Swan Lake,"

COLOMBO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Government Medical
Officers Association (GMOA) was to launch a nationwide 24-hour
token strike excluding the north and east on Thursday, The Island
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>

The GMOA demands that the interview for the post be held again
with a member of the GMOA also included in the Selection Board.

<P>
Gunawardena said several candidates had complained that they
were not given a fair chance at the interview.
</P>

The GMOA said there should be no political interference and
that selection should be based on qualification and experience,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The GMOA had given ample time to the minister of health and
indigenous medicine to correct the alleged irregularities and he
will have to take responsibility for any inconvenience and
suffering done to patients, it said.
</P>
<P>
The minister had recommended that the GMOA take legal action to
resolve the issue which the GMOA views as not feasible.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minster Chuan Leekpai
ordered all-out retaliation to any intrusions on Thai soil by
armed groups from Myanmar as Rangoon has denied any responsibility
for a series of cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
In his strongest response so far to the western border problem,
Chuan said he will order the Thai army to be in the full operation
of retaliating.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok has denied that the
Myanmar government has any responsibility or involvement with the
cross border attacks and therefore cannot prevent them.
</P>
<P>
Camps for Myanmar refugees in Tak and Mae Hong Son provinces in
northern Thailand had been attacked by armed forces from
neighboring Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday named the intruders as the
Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), which is said to be
connected to the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
At a defense council meeting, Chuan, who is also defense
Minster, said he planned to merge the existing 19 Thai camps into
11 and move them deeper into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also approved the Foreign Ministry's
proposal that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) would be allowed to get involved, saying it will allow the
U.N. body to realize the existing problem.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNHCR will have a greater opportunity to inspect
the Thai authorities' administration of the camps.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan National Assembly
(parliament) Wednesday approved by majority vote a law to protect
children's rights.
</P>
<P>
"This code is like a small constitution because it guarantees
the rights of children, who will benefit from a specialized health
system and education undertaken by public policies," said Jurist
Sergio Cuaresma, one of the authors of the document.
</P>
<P>
The law, approved by 65 majority votes within the legislature,
consists of 234 articles.
</P>
<P>
"At least the first step has been taken, now the actual
enforcement will be the most difficult point," said Sergio
Cuaresma.
</P>
<P>
Dora Zeladon, president of the Children and Teenagers
Parliamentary Commission, said a committee will be set up to take
charge of enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
The law establishes that all children, girls and boys, have an
intrinsic right to life.
</P>
<P>
It also regulates that contracts involving hard manual labor
are prohibited for children under 14.
</P>
<P>
Zeladon said the first step to be accomplished is to provide
educations for more than 200,000 children who are not attending
school at present.

<P>
MADRID, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Spain, once viewed as one of the
countries having trouble in meeting the single currency criteria,
announced Wednesday it was pleased to be among the 11 countries
recommended by the European Union (EU) to join the monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, named
Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain as having met the
criteria to join the single currency, called the euro, on January
1.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said the decision was great for
Spain and for the European continent as a whole. What used to be
unthinkable comes true, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abel Matutes Y Juan said what Spain had done
to qualify for the single currency now seemed worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
Aznar's government, since coming power in 1996, has managed to
sustain rapid economic growth and bring down its inflation through
austerity policies and fiscal reforms.
</P>
<P>
Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1997 was 3.3
percent, compared to a government prediction of three percent and
an average of 2.8 percent among other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Spain's inflation was 1.9 percent, 0.8 percentage
points lower than the required 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the single currency, a country must lower its
budget deficit to three percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP), and its public debt to 60 percent of GDP. Its inflation has
to be no more than 1.5 percentage points higher than the average
figure of the three best performing countries.
</P>
<P>
The final decision on who's in and who's out will be made at a
summit of the 15-member EU on May 2 in Brussels. Britain, Denmark
and Sweden don't want go in with the first wave. The only member
left out of the proposed list was Greece which slipped past the
deficit figure.

Bertini said the DPRK's grain reserves dropped sharply due to
the devastating floods and drought in the past two consecutive
years. About 7.5 million people, especially children, were
expected to get not enough to eat this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 4.7 million people of the DPRK enjoyed food
assistance from the WFP, half of them being children below
six. More food assistance was sought in the international
community by the program at the beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
Bertini said, there are still other countries as well as the
DPRK in urgent need of food aid. They include Afghanistan, Sudan,
Somali, Ethiopia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During her stay, Bertini met Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, and exchanged views on further cooperation of the two
sides. Finland provided 70 million Finland markka (about 11
million U.S. dollars) to the WFP for aid programs last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the WFP, one seventh of the population around the
world was going hungry. About 45 million people in 84 countries
enjoyed aid from the program last year.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Says No to Foreign Mediators on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Since the Kosovo issue is an
internal affair of the Republic of Serbia, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia refuses to receive any foreign special envoys for
mediation of the issue, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivorad
Jovanovic said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the Tanjug news agency, Jovanovic
siad that, however, it is acceptable to have the former Spanish
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez visit Yugoslavia as a
representative from the European Union (EU) and the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that for Yugoslavia, Gonzalez was first of all a
distinguished statesman in Spain and Europe at large.
</P>
<P>
Such a figure, now as a representative of the EU and the OSCE,
would surely be able to enhance the relationship between
Yugoslavia and the two organizations, the Yugoslav foreign
minister believed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Kosovo issue earlier on Tuesday, Milorad Dodik,
prime minister of the Republic of Srpska, warned that constant
exertion of pressure by some countries on Yugoslavia would produce
a serious negative impact on his republic.
</P>
<P>
Dodik was quoted by the Yugoslav daily, Politika, as saying
that foreign pressure on Yugoslavia had greatly boosted the morale
of the ultra-nationalists in the Republic of Srpska.
</P>
<P>
He said if the situation persisted, the work of his government
would be plunged into confusion.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he cautioned, regional destabilization could
possibly result, and this might pose a threat to the
implementation of the Dayton peace accords.

<P>
ROME, March 25 (Xinhua) -- World and Olympic champion Alexander
Popov of Russia claimed his second consecutive World Cup
short-course victory in Imperia, Italy on Wednesday, beating
Australian Michael Kilm to win the 100m freestyle event.

weekend, swept home in 48.69 seconds ahead of Australia's Chris
Fydler, who was clocked at 48.93.
</P>
<P>
Klim, who took seven medals at last January's world
championships in Perth where he finished second to training
partner Popov in the 100m freestyle, had to settle for third in
49.15.
</P>
<P>
Klim suffered another reverse in the 50m butterfly in which he
was beaten into second place for the second time in five days by
Canada's Garret Pulle.

Sweden's Patrik Isaksson and Britain's James Hickman continued
their good form, winning the 200m breaststroke and the 200m

<P>
JAKARTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed people
in Indonesia had doubled from 4.4 million last year to 8.7 million
at the end of February, an official here said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of people working less than 35
hours per week had doubled from 9.1 million last year to 18.4
million, Sri Harto, Spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower said
here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
This pool of labor, including those who work for only several
hours per week, are often referred to as the partially unemployed,
or disguised unemployment, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Together, the number of the unemployed and the partially
unemployed of 27.1 million had doubled last year's total of 13.5
million, Sri said.
</P>
<P>
Sri said that with economic growth forecast to come to a
standstill this year, an estimated 2.7 million new entrants to the
labor market could not be absorbed into the country's workforce.
</P>
<P>
He also said the number of workers dismissed by companies
troubled by the monetary crisis had reached over 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Sri predicted that the unemployment rate will rise again this

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government, Rebels Sign Secret Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government and one of the country's major rebel groups signed a
secret agreement in February to hold preliminary peace talks, a
senior government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Spain-brokered agreement was signed in Madrid on February
9, when Colombian President Ernesto Samper stopped there following
a visit to the Vatican, said Jose Noe Munoz Rios, a presidential
counsel for peace.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the rebel National Army of Liberation
(ELN) is expected to hold talks with the government on May 31 and
again on June 21.
</P>
<P>
Munoz Rios said the talks would pave the way toward an eventual
national convention aimed at ending the country's 35-year-old
civil war.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC) would follow the example of the ELN and also
join the talks. The FARC and the ELN are the two guerrilla groups
attempting to overthrow the government of President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, a Cuban-inspired organization headed by former Spanish
priest Manuel Perez, is Colombia's second largest guerilla
army. FARC is Colombia's largest and oldest guerilla group.
</P>
<P>
The ELN claims Samper used Cali cartel drug money to bankroll
his 1994 election campaign
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the agreement was signed in Madrid, Munoz Rios
said the Spanish government has been working as a friend and
mediator for negotiations between the government and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Chinese Farmers Looking For Better Forms Of Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Yang Hulin, a farmer in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, can now grow
cabbage even during the winter months, and has enough power for
his lights and for cooking thanks to a solar-heated greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
The plastic-covered greenhouse uses the sunlight to ferment
manure and the methane it produces for lighting and cooking and
the residue is used for fertilizer for his vegetables.
</P>
<P>
This is actually an environmentally-friendly form of energy
produced by the methane-generating pits, the livestock and poultry
sheds, the lavatories, and the solar greenhouses, according to Li
Guangren, the director of the region's Energy Station for Rural
Areas, who is in charge of a project to develop these sources of
energy.
</P>
<P>
It was started by the Ministry of Agriculture to increase
farmers' income and to use the methane-generating pits to help
them get through the winter months.
</P>
<P>
One county was chosen as a pilot area last August, and five
methane-generating pits have been built, each producing 0.9 to 1.3
cubic meters of methane daily, enough for a six-member family to
cook three meals a day. One pit can also save more than two tons
of coal and 500 kwh of power from other sources annually.
</P>
<P>
The success of the new method has made it possible for pigs to
gain weight faster in winter, farmers to have new fuel, to use
less chemical fertilizer in greenhouses, and to improve the
environment and sanitation in rural areas, according to Cui
Yongqing, director of the region's Agriculture Department.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Lowers Oil Production By 70,000 BPD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has decided to lower
its oil output by 70,000 barrels per day (BPD) to 1.39 million
BPD, a senior official announced.
</P>
<P>
The decision would begin to take effect on April 1, Mines and
Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said here Wednesday at a
discussion on oil prices and output.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was part of an agreement reached by the members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to
stabilize oil prices which had dropped to a record low of 10 U.S.
dollars per barrel, Antara News Agency Thursday quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members had earlier agreed to lower their oil output to
25.033 million BPD from 27.5 million BPD as agreed upon at the
Jakarta meeting last November.
</P>
<P>
Some other OPEC members and non-OPEC member had also announced
their plan to lower oil production. Oil price soared to 15 U.S.
dollars per barrel after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Kuntoro asked all OPEC members and independent oil producers to
voluntarily cut their output to prop up the crude oil price.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil supplies now account for about 40 percent of the
world's total output of 75 million BPD.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the united Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Taxi-drivers in Nanning Win Awards For Fine Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Nanning, capital of
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, often see taxis
that have the Chinese character "jiang" inlaid on the top light.
</P>
<P>
There are 429 taxi cabs with this sign in Nanning, proof of
their excellent service. These cabs are also the most profitable,
for the token of "jiang" tells passengers of the drivers'
reliability, which is good for business.
</P>
<P>
The award is only one measure taken by the local authorities in
a campaign to improve the quality of taxi service.
</P>
<P>
Overcharges and inaccurate meters draw the concern of taxi
passengers everywhere. Three years ago when Zhang Shan, an Olympic
gold medal winner, came to Nanning for a training course, he was
charged 150 yuan (18 U.S. dollars) and dropped half-way. Zhang's
accident and people's complaints shocked the Nanning policymakers,
who soon worked out a series of measures to regulate the city's
taxi business.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new measures, fare charges and meters are
regularly checked by the local authorities and complaint
telephones are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
Those who are found refusing a fare or overcharging three times
will have their licenses revoked, according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Drivers are required to wear uniforms while on duty. And
serving passengers politely and wholeheartedly is coming into
vogue among Nanning taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
To offer more convenience for travelers the city map, timetable
of trains, buses and planes, and frequently used telephone numbers
are available in each taxi. Servicemen and their relatives also
receive a 20 percent discount on taxi fares.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, to serve passengers better, Nanning's taxi
drivers contributed to social security undertakings. They made
donations to flood victims and sent four color TVs to People's
Liberation Army soldiers stationed in frontier garrisons.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Zhang Shan's mistreatment, a letter of thanks
from Beijing on Aug. 17 told of a good deed by a Nanning taxi
driver.
</P>
<P>
One day in June a taxi driver named Liao Qi sent two Beijing
visitors to the airport. He later found a black bag with 230,000
yuan in his car. When he rushed the bag to the two people who were
boarding, they were moved to tears.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in recent years the city's taxi drivers
collected 2.16 million yuan.

Germany on Wednesday in a World Cup warm-up friendly played in
Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo proved his class as the world most expensive striker
when he beat defender Christian Woerns and goalkeeper Andreas
Koepke to score a 88-minute goal after a dazzling run.
</P>
<P>
Brazil opened the mark in the 27th minute thanks to midfielder
Cesar Sampaio's header from a corner kick by defender Roberto
Carlos.
</P>
<P>
The home side equalised as substitute Ulf Kirsten, who replaced
captain Juergen Klinsmann, broke the Brazilian defence and tapped
in from close range in the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
Germany almost levelled again after Ronaldo's goal as
midfielder Joerg Heinrich saw his spectacular diving header flew
away over the bar in the dying seconds.
</P>
<P>
Both sides ended the friendly with ten men on the pitch as
Juergen Kohler of Germany and Dunga of Brazil were sent off for
offence.
</P>
<P>
The world champions ended their hosts' unbeaten run of 22
matches and improved match record to 9-4-3 between the two most
favorite teams for the world most premier tournament, which is to
be kicked off in France on June 10.

BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Franky van der Elst scored his
first goal out of 79 caps to pace hosts Belgium to a 2-2 draw with
Norway in a World Cup warm-up game on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian captain fired a 25-meter shot into the top
right-hand corner of the Norwegian net seven minutes into play for
the opener.
</P>
<P>
But four minutes later the score was levelled when Vidah Riseth
beat an offside trap to face the lonely Belgian goalkeeper Dany
Verlinden who was offered his first cap on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A similar trick in the second half let off the hosts'
offense-oriented play that resulted in a second goal at the 66th
minute through a header by midfielder Marc Wilmots.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian substitute Soskjaer ran away from the pressing
Belgian defense line only to have Verlinden in between him and the
goalmouth. He duely chipped in the shot for the second equalizer
of the game at the 71st minute.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tim Henman reached
semifinal on Wednesday by beating Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil 6-2,
6-4 in a quarter-final at the Lipton Championships at Key
Biscayne, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Henman has yet to drop a set in four matches en route to the
semifinals, against Grant Stafford of South Africa, 16th-seeded
Carlos Moya of Spain, second-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic and 10th-seeded Gustavo Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
The 20th-ranked Henman prevented second-ranked Korda from
moving into the number one world ranking by defeating him in the
fourth round. Korda needed to reach the semifinals to topple Pete
Sampras from the top ranking.
</P>
<P>
Henman has now beaten three reigning Grand Slam champions this
year -- Australian Open champion Korda, French Open champion
Kuerten and U.S. Open champion Rafter.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, Russia's Anna Kournikova defeated
second-seeded Lindsay Davenport 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 in the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The 25th-ranked Kournikova has won her third consecutive
victory over a top 10 ranked opponent at the Lipton. She defeated
fourth-ranked Monica Seles of the U.S. in the third round and
ninth-ranked Conchita Martinez of Spain in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
In the windy conditions, Davenport took too many risks and was
unable to control her own game when she posted 41 unforced errors
to 28 for Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
The one remaining women's quarter-final between third-seeded
Jana Novotna of Czech Republic and eighth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario of Spain was to be played later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland and 12th-seeded Venus
Williams of the U.S. advanced to semi-finals on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> China Uses More Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- An increasing amount of overseas
investment flowed into China during this year's first two months,
according today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation show that during that period, the country brought in
4.84 billion US dollars in contractual overseas investment, up
10.17 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase for overseas investment for February was even more
pronounced, recording a 23.69 percent rise to reach 2.52 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result of last year's cancellation of preferential tariff
policies extended to overseas investors importing equipment,
resumed since this January, contractual overseas investment showed
a big drop last year.
</P>
<P>
In February, actually used overseas funds inched down 1.99
percent to 2.36 billion US dollars. Taking the first two
months as a whole, actually utilized capital was up 2.22 percent
to 4.65 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China approved 1,109 overseas-funded ventures in February, up
1.93 percent from the same month in 1997.

<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Investments registered at the
Philippine Board of Investments (BOI) reached 79.1 billion pesos
(2.1 billion U.S. dollars) in the first two months this year, up
by 65 percent compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star Thursday quoted BOI Managing Director
Melito Salazar as saying that the board approved 56 new or
expansion projects with the amount of investments.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said the number of projects actually went down but some
of them are big-ticket ventures mainly in power generation and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Out of the aggregate investment commitments, almost 24 percent
were invested into the country as equity, of which 61 percent were
foreign investments, he added.
</P>
<P>
The biggest source of foreign investments during the period was
China's Hong Kong, with 6.42 billion pesos (173 million dollars).
It was followed by Japan and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the BOI approved a total investment of 554.6 billion
pesos (15 billion dollars), up 40 percent from 1996. However, most
of the investments were from domestic investors as foreign
investments declined by 18 percent to 1.053 billion dollars only.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Lee Beachill made a winning return
to competition when he defeated Fabian Kelaitzis of Greece to move
into the third round of the British Open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Yorkshireman, who fractured his spine in two places in a
car accident in January, defeated the Greek rival 15-3, 15-6 and
15-11.
</P>
<P>
Beachill's confidence-boosting win was hardly a test of his
current standard, but the third game during which he briefly
trailed provided useful match practice without taxing him.
</P>
<P>
Beachill next plays Ronen Goldberg of Israel who had a hard
five-game contest with Jonathan Quail of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A famous name, Shahid Zaman, the nephew of the 1975 British
Open champion Qamar Zaman, also won his opening match. The
Pakistani teenager beat Segun Adeyi of Nigeria 15-8, 15-7, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
Zaman's compatriot Amjad Khan, the nephew of defending British
Open champion Jansher Khan, begins his British Open campaign at
the tournament's second stage, the qualifying competition, with a
match against one of the 16 preliminary stage qualifiers on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Gears Up Reform of Central Bank Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of a modern
payment, settlement and account management(PSAM) system designed
to improve central bank supervision has been under way in
Shanghai, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Part of the system, involving account management and bill
clarification, has already been put into operation.
</P>
<P>
"The new system is aimed at giving full play to the central
bank's ability to supervise payment settlements and monitor
payment clearance," the daily quoted Lu Zucheng, vice-president of
the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, as saying.
</P>
<P>
It will help standardize settlement and enhance the
enterprises' capacity to minimize and withstand payment risks.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai PSAM system consists of five sub-systems: account
management, bill clarification, public enquiry, electronic bank
accounting and electronic transfer systems.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch of the central bank decided in 1994 to
introduce the system to ensure the healthy development of
commercial and financial competition in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai needs this development, because of its multitude of
enterprises, frequent commodity transactions, huge capital flow
and bill usage," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Debt Increases by 12.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official
disclosed here Wednesday that Zambia's foreign debt increased by
12.5 percent to 7.2 billion Dollars in 1997 from 6.4 billion in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question at parliament as to where Zambia's
foreign debt stands, Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi attributed
the increase in the foreign debt to continued borrowing instead
of arrears, Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Zambia owes the Paris Club members 2.5 billion Dollars and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) 1.2 billion Dollars, she
explained.
</P>
<P>
The government paid 125 million Dollars last year toward the
serving of the country's foreign debt, the minister said, adding
that the debt servicing will continue so as to enhance national
development.
</P>
<P>
However, the newly-appointed finance minister who replaced
Renald Penza last week stressed that the Zambian government is
committed to the reduction of the country's debt burden and
called for support from all stake-holders.

<HEADLINE> UK Post Office Still on Sell-Off Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) - Post Office privatization has not
been ruled out by the British government despite earlier
statements that it was not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Neville Bain, new chairman, was quoted Wednesday as saying that
all options were being considered in the review into the future of
the business.
</P>
<P>
The chairman was speaking after announcing an extension of the
price freeze on first and second-class stamps for at least another
year and expressing concern about delays in completing the review.
</P>
<P>
Postage rates were last increased in 1996, when 1p was added to
both first and second-class stamps, making them 26p and 20p
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Bain said prices could be kept down because the organization
was now more efficient. He said the amount of business done by
Royal Mail was growing and the Post Office was on target to meet
this year's government demands for cash.
</P>
<P>
But the chairman gave warning that the Post Office faced a
critical time against international competitors and needed the
Government to finish a long-running review into giving the
organisation more commercial freedom quickly.
</P>
<P>
the commercial freedom means the Post Office could be
privatized, but Bain said: "I believe it more likely that some
other form of commercial freedom will go forward."
</P>
<P>
He said: "If we are to maintain our position as market leader
we need the freedom to behave commercially, to raise capital to
invest even more, develop new services and move into new markets."
</P>
<P>
However, the Treasury has asked the Post Office to provide
almost 1 billion pounds (1.63 billion US dollars) for the
Exchequer over the next three financial years.
</P>
<P>
Bain said profitability and cash generation would be damaged if
the contribution to the Treasury, currently 75p to 90p of post-tax
profits, stayed at these levels.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Two U.S.-Made Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Long March 2C rocket
lifted-off from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in north
China's Shanxi Province this morning at 01:01 (Beijing time)
successfully carrying two U.S.-made Iridium satellites into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
The launch, China's 50th flight of the Long March rocket, is
the first since 1998 and China's second launch of Iridium
satellites according to contracts between the China Great Wall
Industry Corp. and U.S-based Motorola Corporation that
manufactured the satellites.
</P>
<P>
The satellite payload was carried in the improved version of
China's Long March 2C which measures 40 meters in length, has a
diameter of 3.35 meters, and weighs 213 tons.
</P>
<P>
The rocket features an additional distributor stage capable of
simultaneously boosting the two satellites from the initial
holding pattern to the final elliptical orbit.
</P>
<P>
The second stage separated from the distributor stage some 11
minutes into the flight.
</P>
<P>
The distributor stage carried the two satellites to a
predetermined holding pattern for a period of slightly over 40
minutes and then successfully altered course to boost the two
satellites to their final orbit at a perigee of 626.7 km, apogee of
628.2 km, and bank angle of 86.4 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Iridium satellites are the state-of-the-art mobile
telecommunications system developed by Motorola Corp. for Iridium
LLC which is developing and commercializing a global wireless
communications network that will combine the worldwide reach of 66
low earth orbit satellites with land-based wireless systems.
</P>
<P>
The China Great Wall Industry Corp. plans to continue to use
multi-payload launch rockets to carry more Iridium satellites into
preset orbits.

<HEADLINE> French Rightwing Politician Plans to Set Up New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The President of the French
center-rightwing Democratic Force (FD) party, Francois Bayrou,
Wednesday announced that he will set up a new center-right party
to replace the Union for French Democracy (UDF), the twin party of
the Gaullist Rally for the Republic.
</P>
<P>
The FD is an affiliate party of the UDF, which is crumbling
apart after five of its regional leaders allied with the far-right
National Front (FN) in the regional elections.
</P>
<P>
"UDF lacks cohesion. It lacks authority. It appears to
hesitate over essential issues. This situation cannot continue,"
Bayrou told the press.
</P>
<P>
He said that the envisaged new party will rally all the
center-right forces while rejecting the far-right.
</P>
<P>
"The French democracy needs a strong, large, united and
responsible party, on the space of center and center-right," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came when Alain Madelin, the President of
another center-right party the Liberal Democratic Party, which is
also an affiliate party of the UDF, is facing the cracking up of
his party because of dispute within the party over whether to ally
with the FN.

Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC), a
Palestinian information center based in East Jerusalem, Wednesday
quoted a statement of PNA President Yasser Arafat's Advisor Nabil
Abu Rodaineh as saying that the PNA hoped that the U.S.-proposed
peace initiative calling for a 13 percent Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank could be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. withheld its announcement of the peace proposal after
it was rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nabil stressed that any initiative must be accompanied by
guarantees of a halt to settlement activities, redeployment and
implementation of the signed agreements between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The PNA issued the call before U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross's
return to the region on Thursday. Ross was scheduled to hold talks
with Arafat on Thursday in Ramallah, West Bank, shortly after his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reportedly said that it would announce its initiative
after President Bill Clinton's return from his current African
trip.
</P>
<P>
It has promised to allow Israel to have some more time to
make its decision on the percentage of troop redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross said earlier in Washington that his current trip to the
Middle East was "critical."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israel's rejection of the U.S. proposal, PNA
Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi told the JMCC on
Wednesday that this was an example of Israeli intransigence
toward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
She said that the PNA would deal favorably with any party
wishing to advance the peace process, referring to the European
Union's desire for a larger role in the process.
</P>
<P>
The EU's role was complimentary rather than in competition to
the U.S. role, she added.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Raises Pressure on Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Without imposing new sanctions,
foreign ministers of the six-nation Contact Group on Wednesday
issued a sort of ultimatum on Belgrade forcing it to agree to
begin a dialogue with Kosovo Albanians within four weeks, or
to face punitive measures.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting in Bonn, foreign
ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the
United States, which comprise the Contact Group, said they had
decided to maintain and implement the punitive measures agreed at
an earlier meeting in London on March 9 if Belgrade failed to
comply with the demands made then.
</P>
<P>
In London, the Contact Group demanded that President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia publicly agree to a number of step:
political negotiations with the Kosovo Albanians, removal of the
Serbian special police from Kosovo and full access to the area for
aid and human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
Although the Contact Group determined on Wednesday that some
progress had been made by Belgrade, it also noted what had been
done was not enough.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase the pressure on Belgrade, the group
members announced that they would seek adoption of an arms embargo
against Belgrade by the UN Security Council by March 31.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to meet again in four weeks to reassess the
situation.
</P>
<P>
"If President Milosevic takes the steps specified in London, we
will reconsider existing measures including action in the Security
Council to terminate the arms embargo. If Belgrade fails to meet
the London benchmarks,....we shall take steps to apply further
measures as announced in London," the Contact Group said in its
statement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after the meeting, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said: "We are moving gradually, but
unmistakably forward in the direction of greater pressure against
Belgrade. The only way out for President Milosevic is through
meaningful dialogue with the Kosovo Albanian community."
</P>
<P>
However, she also admitted the difference of opinions among the
Contact Group members. In the view of the United States, it would
be justified in imposing even tougher measures given the renewed
fightings in Kosovo recently, she said.
</P>
<P>
Sounding a different view, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov told reporters that progress should not depend
exclusively on Belgrade, it should also depend on the Kosovo
Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group on Wednesday also condemned terrorist actions
in Kosovo and urged all leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to declare
clear opposition to violence and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The group also made clear that it supported neither
independence of Kosovo nor the maintenance of the status quo. "We
support a substantially greater degree of autonomy for Kosovo
which must include meaningful self-administration," the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Hopes to Strengthen Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said Wednesday that the aim of his official visit to
Beijing starting March 30 is to build up closer relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
"We will reaffirm our hope that the economic relationship can
be as good as the political one between the two countries," said
President Chissano in an interview with Xinhua in his office
here.
</P>
<P>
The president added that the political ties between the two
nations have been good and stable and that there has never been
any setback in them.
</P>
<P>
There was once a downturn in the economic cooperation for
quite a long period, and both countries hope this cooperation
will be restored and improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano said during the visit he will brief Chinese
leaders on the political, economic and social situations in
Mozambique, and "we will do our best to strengthen cooperation
with China in various fields, such as science, technology, trade
and culture."
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in Chinese approaches of economic reforms
and its opening up to the outside world," said Chissano.
</P>
<P>
He said he will invite more Chinese businessmen to invest in
Mozambique, adding that recently, more and more Chinese
entrepreneurs came to investigate in Mozambique and became
interested in investing in this southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"The future is bright for our cooperation. And we will work to
restore the intergovernmental mixed committee and try to seal
some agreements, especially in the field of investment promotion
and protection," said Chissano.
</P>
<P>
He reminded that when he met Deng Xiaoping in Beijing on May
18, 1988, the late Chinese leader told him that "poverty is not
socialism."
</P>
<P>
He told this correspondent that he "fully agreed with Mr. Deng
on this saying."
</P>
<P>
President Chissano left Maputo on Wednesday afternoon for a
two-day visit to Singapore. He will pay an official visit to
China from March 30 to April 3, and afterwards he will go to
Macao for a two-day trip.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Mozambican president will be accompanied
by his wife Marrelina, Minister of Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation Leonardo Simao, Minister of Planning and Finance
Tomas Salomao, Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism Oldemiro
Baloi and Minister of Public Works and Housing Roberto White.

<HEADLINE> Angola Satisfied over Oil Reduction Move by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Petroleum
Albina Assis Wednesday expressed satisfaction over some
countries' decision to cut oil production so as to restore
petroleum price to the previous level on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement to the press here in the airport on
returning from a member and non member meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Monaco.
However, she did not reveal whether Angola would reduce oil
production or not.
</P>
<P>
Recently, crude oil prices on the international market had
plunged from 19 Dollars a barrel to 12 Dollars, thus striking
panic in some oil-producing and exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
At the Monaco meeting, Albina said, countries such as Saudi
Arabia, Guatemala and Mexico agreed to cut their oil output,
which is unprecedented in the history.
</P>
<P>
She referred to their decision as a "positive sign," which
might lead to the restoration of oil prices to the normal level
on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Angola, a country rich in oil reserves, has a daily oil
production of 750,000 barrels, which has made it the second
largest oil-producing country in sub-Saharan Africa, second only
to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuation of oil price on the international market would
surely affect the Angolan economy which relies heavily on oil
production and export.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Lend Billions of Rand for Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- South African banks
facilitated 8.2 billion Rand (1.64 million U.S. Dollars) worth of
black empowerment transactions in 1997, the Banking Council of
South Africa (COSAB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing its operations for the past year, COSAB said its
drive to facilitate the empowerment process was being hampered by
a lack of adequate information on the country's informal sector.
</P>
<P>
More would have to be done to finance the more than 30 percent
of the population that is without employment, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Informal businesses that do not have permanent addresses or
minimum capital bases are not bankable and the role of banks in
such circumstances is to develop ways in which they might assist
non-governmental organizations to supply funding and services to
such businesses satisfactorily," the review said.
</P>
<P>
The review expressed concern at a growing culture on
non-payment of loans to facilitate the transformation process.
</P>
<P>
The culture of defaulting was most evident in the housing
sector, where 250,000 loans worth 11 billion Rand (220 million
Dollars) were made in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Non payment has led to the repossession of 18,200 township
houses on which mortgage loans of 770 million Rand (154 million
Dollars) are owing," the review said.
</P>
<P>
The general economic slowdown for most of 1997 resulted in
high levels of unemployment and retrenchments in South Africa as
most companies embarked on cost cutting measures to retain
profitability. This, in turn, led to a surge in defaults, local
observers said.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Announces Further Power Rationing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Ghana, gripped by one of its worst
energy crisis since independence, announced further power
rationing measures Wednesday, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
An announcement by the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG)
said that henceforth, power would be supplied for 12 hours in
every 36 hours as against 12 hours in every 24 hours previously.
</P>
<P>
Accra, the capital, has been divided into three parts for the
exercise and power cuts and supplies will rotate among them.
</P>
<P>
As a result, at any one time, two-thirds of Accra's 1.7
million residents will be without electricity.
</P>
<P>
Drought, possibly linked to El Nino, has cut the flow of water
to Ghana's main 912 megawatt Akosombo hydro-power plant and an
explosion at the Takoradi thermal plant last week compounded the
problems by shutting down one of the two 100 megawatt generators
there.
</P>
<P>
Repairs are expected to take at least a month.
</P>
<P>
Power rationing in Ghana began on January 10. At first, supply
was cut by 30 percent, later by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Akosombo currently generates only 300 megawatts. To conserve
water, three of the station's six turbines have been closed down,
while the remaining three run at 70 percent of their capacity.
</P>
<P>
Akosombo plant manager, Francis Arkerst, said Monday that the
level of water at the dam is now 239.34 feet. The lowest level
ever recorded since the dam was built 32 years ago was 235.6 feet
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to be able to continue running three generators until
the end of June, when normally the lake level starts rising again
as a result of rains," said Arkerst.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians to Have More Fish at Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The consumption of fish
per capita in Tanzania is expected to rise to 20 kilograms
annually, up from the present level of 12 kilograms, according to
a seminar held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Philip Bwathondi, director general of the Tanzania
Fisheries Research Institute, told the seminar that the east
African country has a large potential to tap since it has vast
water areas.
</P>
<P>
As a coastal country, Tanzania has abundant marine resources
in the Indian Ocean, such as cuttlefishes, crabs, prawns and
oysters, among others, Bwathondi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzania boasts of large water space in Lake
Victoria, the second-largest freshwater lake in the world, as
well as the Tanganyika Lake, the Nyasa Lake, and several rivers.
</P>
<P>
However, little attempt has been made to fish due to lack of
strategies, technology and financial support, said W. Haule,
fisheries officer in Fisheries Department.
</P>
<P>
"The country's fishing remains at an extensive level," Haule
told some 20 participants at the seminar, organized by the
Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania to discuss the
country's aquiculture prospect.
</P>
<P>
To increase production, Professor Bwathondi has appealed to
the government to work out scientific strategies and intensify
researches on fish farming.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the training of farmers and development of
small-scale ponds in the rural areas to breed freshwater fish.

LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The office of the attorney
general of Zambia and that of Norway signed here Wednesday an
agreement on auditorial coopera involving 1.7 million
U.S. Dollars, the Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the Norwegian side shall assist Zambia in
the development of office auditing standards, development and
training of staff in performance auditing, organizing and

general's office.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Zambian Auditor General Fred
Siame said the occasion is a special one as it is the first such
agreement between the two institutions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his office takes the responsibility of
accountability very seriously and wants communities to benefit
from taxes which they pay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Norwegian Attorney General Bjarne Mork-Eidem
who signed the pact said he hoped the deal will be of mutual
benefit and that the two countries will learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
Also on the occasion, Jon Lomoy, Norwegian ambassador to
Zambia, said his government has been working with the Zambian
side to improve Zambian institutions which are considered crucial
for the development.

<HEADLINE> AL Calls for Resuming Talks on All Peace Tracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Council has urged
all parties concerned to intensify efforts to get Israel to abide
by all relevant international resolutions and resume talks on all
peace tracks, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Council, at its 109th session Wednesday, stressed the
necessity of spurning all attempts meant to prematurely jump to
the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The session, held at the foreign ministerial level calls for
continuing Arab contacts with world countries and the U.N. to
forge a unified stance enabling Palestine to be a U.N. member.
</P>
<P>
The conferees voiced appreciation of Europe's peace role,
calling for further vitaminizing this role so that it can thrust
the peace process out of its blind alley.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued at the Council's 109th session, spelled out
Arab concern over the serious crisis in the peace drive as a
result of the policies and stances adopted by the incumbent
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
It also issued a warning that the destruction of the peace
process would only spawn a fresh cycle of tension in the Mideast,
for which Israel alone would bear full responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"No comprehensive and just peace could be established unless
Israel withdraw from Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese
territories," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers condemned Israel's misleading media
campaigns on a possible pullout from south Lebanon on Israeli
security terms, which the statement said, were a breach of the
clearly-worded U.N. Resolution 425 calling for the unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stressed the inseparability of the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks and made clear that the realization of just and
comprehensive peace in the Mideast was the only guarantee for
providing security to the region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which focused on the Arab-Israeli
conflicts and the Mideast peace process, began Tuesday and was
attended by foreign ministers of 16 Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Tanzania in Acute Shortage of Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Official from the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said Wednesday that
refugees in west Tanzania's Kigoma Region are facing acute
shortage of food.
</P>
<P>
"Although the impact varies from one camp to another, food
shortages are generally at alarmingly low levels," UNHCR Senior
External Relations Officer Vincent Parker told reporters here in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Destruction of roads and other infrastructure by floods blamed
on the El Nino weather phenomenon has severely affected the
delivery of food to refugee camps, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the use of trains for the movement of
Congolese refugees from the Lugufu Camp has been temporarily
suspended due to damages of rail tracks.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR, however, has resorted to the use of trucks despite
difficulties, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
By March 23, a total of 29,622 refugees had been assisted to
be repatriated in an organized manner from Tanzania to Uvira and
Baraka in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
About 74,000 Congolese refugees, who fled a civil war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo that brought Laurent Kabila to power
in the former Zaire last May, lived in western Tanzanian camps
before a voluntary repatriation program began last September.
</P>
<P>
Three boats, each carrying 2,000 Congolese refugees, have been
arranged since March 16 so as to speed up the repatriation
process. The repatriation exercise is expected to be completed by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) Country Director, Irene M. Lacy,
elaborated after the press conference that food warehouses in
refugee camps have a very low capacity for cereals and pulses and
there is little hope of building new warehouses until the
rehabilitation of the railway from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Despite transportation problems, she said, the WFP continues
to deliver food supplies on a daily basis and food distribution
situation has improved slightly this week.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that minimum rations to all refugees can be
maintained during the coming weeks," Lacy noted.

<HEADLINE> Britain Bans Corporal Punishment to Pupils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's parliament voted on
Wednesday 211 to 15 to ban corporal punishment in all schools.
</P>
<P>
The previous Conservative government outlawed corporal
punishment in state schools in 1986, but teachers in the estimated
200 fee-paying schools can still beat misbehaving pupils as
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrat legislator Don Foster, who proposed the
amendment to the government education bill, said the ban was
"unfinished business" and pointed out that no other country in
Europe allowed corporal punishment of children.
</P>
<P>
Corporal punishment has for centuries been an integral part of
the upbringing of many children, particularly boys.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Schools Council (ISC) -- which represents 1,300
schools and covers 80 percent of children attending private
schools in Britain -- said its members had already stopped caning
pupils.
</P>
<P>
"Many schools concluded, long before any form of legal ban was
contemplated, that corporal punishment impeded good education,"
ISC chairman Ian Beer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Britain abolished whipping as a form of judicial punishment in
1948 and flogging in the navy in 1957. Corporal punishment in
prison and reformatory institutions ended in 1967.

ADDIS ABABA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian police
Wednesday caught red handed 11 university students who sat for
the Ethiopian National School Leaving Certificate examinations
impersonating eligible examinees.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Raids on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday condemned
Israeli raids on south Lebanon and called on the world community
and Mideast countries to counter Israeli threat to the regional
security, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel's attacks on defenseless civilians and continued
occupation of Lebanon's territory have once again exposed the
"warmongering profile" of the Zionist regime, Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
Israel often raids and bombards Lebanese villages from its
self-styled security zone in south Lebanon, causing serious

Israel has said that it would pull out its troops from south

Iran urged the international community and regional nations to
"adopt a collective orchestrated policy" to stop the Israeli
aggression which endangers the security and stability of the
region and the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Mission Visits Ethiopia to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Parliament
delegation Wednesday held talks here with their Ethiopian
colleagues led by Speaker of the House of People's
Representatives Dawit Yohannes on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Glenys Kinnock, head
of the European Parliament delegation, said she was impressed
with Ethiopia's effort to exploit the country's potential to
alter the very poorest social and economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed the Parliament's concern over maintaining
the Lome IV Convention which has been the basis for partnership
among the African, Caribbean and Pacific group-European Union
(ACP-EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock refuted the argument which says the Lome IV Convention
is out of date and has no relevance, stressing that it has a role
not only in terms of aid but also in facilitating the trade
partnership among the private sectors of member nations of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Dawit said on his part that the Lome IV Convention has
been quite significant in the relationship between African
countries and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the renegotiation of the Lome
Convention," he added.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament delegation arrived here Tuesday for a
five-day working visit to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Lome IV Convention, which currently governs ACP-EU
relations, is due to expire at the beginning of the year 2000.
ACP and EU countries are expected to reach a new cooperative
agreement between them in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Increases Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A broad range of tax
increases were announced by Namibian Finance Minister Nangolo
Mbumba when he delivered his budget statement for the 1998/99
financial year on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa Press Association (SAPA) Wednesday quoted Mbumba
as saying that general sales tax (GST), additional sales levy
(ASL), company tax and individual income tax for higher-earning
Namibians would all increase.
</P>
<P>
From May 1, GST on goods would increase from eight to 10
percent, while GST on services would be lowered from 11 percent
to 10 percent. This should deliver an extra 132 million Namibian
Dollars (26 million U.S. Dollars) to the state's coffers in the
coming financial year.
</P>
<P>
Adjustments in the ASL rate would be mainly in the form of
"sin taxes." Consumers of hard liquor and tobacco products, on
which a 15 percent ASL is currently charged, would be taxed with
a 25 percent ASL. The current 10 percent ASL on beer would also
be hiked to 15 percent from May 1.
</P>
<P>
The existing GST and ASL would be phased out and replaced by a
value added tax (VAT), which should be in place by April, 1998,
Mbumba said.
</P>
<P>
The company tax rate, excluding mining companies, would be
increased from 35 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Namibians who earn more money would see more of their money
going to the state, with the highest income tax increased from 35
to 40 percent as from March 1.
</P>
<P>
Mbumba said not only would existing taxes increase, but the
cabinet had also instructed the Ministry of Finance to
investigate new sources of income for government and to consider
introducing a land tax, capital gains tax, estate duty and stamp
duties on stock market transactions.
</P>
<P>
The tax increases announced on Tuesday were temporary but
unavoidable because of the pressures on the government to make
provision for a possible drought, adjust salaries of lower level
government officials and keep the budget deficit under control
among other things, Mbumba said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Foreign Minister Sees no Greek-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos said here on Wednesday fears expressed
by some U.S. officials that the Kosovo crisis could lead to war
between Greece and Turkey are just "rubbish."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos made the remarks when speaking to reporters at the end
of a five-day visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Greece and Turkey have common interests in this region,"
Pangalos said. "I think on the contrary that this is an
opportunity for Greek-Turkish cooperation, including military
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials feared that Serbia's crackdown on Albanian
separatists in its Kosovo province could cause a conflict between
Greece and Turkey, who both are the members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The fear is based on assumptions that Greece might side with
its fellow Orthodox Serbians, while Turkey could support the
Muslim Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister said that could only happen "if
Turkey rediscovers the dream of becoming the new Ottoman empire"
in which Turkey ruled much of the Balkans and the Middle East
before World War I.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody in Ankara is crazy enough to say that,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Pangalos did not rule out that the Kosovo crisis might
spill across borders, saying it could affect Macedonia, which
also has many Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Yemen to Cut Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Yemen has decided to cut its oil
production of 380,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2 to 3 percent as
from April 1, the Yemeni Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in response to the current efforts made
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
non-OPEC oil producers to stabilize oil prices in the world
markets, a ministry official told the Yemeni news agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said Yemen believed that the increase in oil
production was the prime cause of the drop in oil prices.
He expressed the hope that the oil producing countries would not
engage in a race of raising production.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, OPEC members, as well as non-OPEC
Mexico announced on Sunday a total reduction of 1.1 million
barrels per day of their oil production starting in April
to save the sagging prices, which has plunged to 10 dollars a
barrel, the lowest in nine years.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iran, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates also
announced to cut their oil productions.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members decided last December to raise their oil production
ceiling from 25.03 million barrels a day to 27.05 million, causing
a drop in prices due to decreasing demand, a mild winter in
northern hemisphere and the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan's Tourist Season Spoiled by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's tourism industry, a
leading hard currency earner, has fallen prey to the recent
unstable situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Semi-official Jordan Times daily Wednesday reported that
tourist industrialists have complained of a late and sluggish start
of the current tourist season which usually starts in mid-February
and runs through May.
</P>
<P>
No official figures to indicate the current awkward tourist
situation are available, but a poor performance appears to be all
too clear.
</P>
<P>
Dakkak Tours and Travel, one of the leading travel agencies in
Jordan, has reported a cancellation of 15 to 20 percent of groups
booked for February.
</P>
<P>
Many tourist managers and agents were quoted in the newspaper
as saying that their business has been withering since the
beginning of this year. But they declined to disclose details like
the number of tourists they are losing.
</P>
<P>
With no customers coming, few of the 240 tourist buses running
between Amman and the country's leading attraction, the Petra, or
the ancient Nabataean Kingdom's capital some 2,500 years ago, are
now maintaining their daily service.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading Jordan Express Tourist Transport (JETT)
was the last to stop its Amman-Petra operation nearly two weeks
ago, saying the service became "financially unfeasible." Another
Alpha Company has stopped daily tours from Amman to all the
locations in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Tourism agencies attributed the tension in the region as the
key reason for the inactive performance, pointing out to facts
like the terrorist massacre of 67 tourists in Luxor, Egypt, last
November and the instable security situation in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between the United Nations and Iraq over weapons
inspection coupled with the U.S. military threat is another key
factor used to explain the sagging market.
</P>
<P>
"If this (the standoff) had not happened, this would have been
our best season," Grace Qassis, Sales and Marketing Manager at the
International Traders Company, told Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
Tourism agencies are losing their conventional major part of
clients -- people from the Middle East countries, who would rather
like to stay home in fear of the regional tension, agents said.
</P>
<P>
The second major part of tourists coming to Jordan were those
from Europe and the United States for regional package tour that
includes Jordan, Israel and Egypt. Agents reported that the
U.S. market has been the hardest-hit, saying it proved to be the
most sensitive to regional instability.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the third largest industry for the kingdom, earning
the country some 600 million U.S. dollars a year, or 10 percent of
the gross domestic products.
</P>
<P>
The industry has experienced ups and downs during the past few
years on the impact of the regional security situation.
</P>
<P>
The 1990-1991 Gulf crisis almost ravaged the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
But the sector benefited most from the peace treaty reached
with Israel in 1994. A following bilateral tourism agreement
played a big role in bringing a boom to the industry.
</P>
<P>
However, after the hard-line Likud group took over the Israeli
government in mid-1996, the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts were
accelerated and upgraded. The tension had a negative effect on
Jordan's tourism industry, triggering a downward trend which lasts
till now.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM: Peace Agreement Possible After Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said Wednesday that Lebanon and Syria will be able to sign
peace agreements with Israel in three months if it withdraws from
occupied south Lebanon and Syria's Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks during a lunch with a visiting German
delegation head by Gerhard Schroeder, the president of German's
Federal Council.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Lebanon's rejection of Israel's conditioned
withdrawal proposal, saying that Beirut cannon provide Israel
with any security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Israel is promoting an international campaign to sell its
proposal to withdraw from south Lebanon on condition that the
Lebanese government agrees to guarantee the security of Israeli
northern border.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that the Lebanese government will be accountable
only to its people and parliament and cannot be accountable to
Israel. "This is the difference between what we say and what
Israel says," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I have announced for several times that Lebanon and Syria are
ready to sign a peace agreement with Israel in three months if
Israel shows interest in withdrawing from Golan Heights to the
border on June 4, 1967 and from all Lebanese territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But, if Israel doesn't want to make peace, we will continue
asking everybody to push Israel toward the peace process," the
prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri stressed that as long as the peace agreement is not
reached between the two countries, Israel cannot ask Lebanon to
give it security guarantees, adding that only under a peace
agreement will Lebanon cooperate with Israel in many fields,
including security.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer area in
south Lebanon since it declared the area as a "security zone" in
1985 to allegedly protect its northern villages and towns from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has been occupying Syria's Golan Heights captured
during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have vowed to put their negotiations with
Israel on the same track, and therefore considered the current
Israeli conditional withdrawal proposal from Lebanon as a "plot" to
drive a wedge between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy, Israeli Minister to Meet in Miami, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross
is going to hold a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai on Wednesday in U.S. southern city of Miami on the
possible revitalization of the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the two men are to discuss U.S. ideas on the scale
of pull-out of the Israeli troops from the West Bank and Israeli
proposals on a withdrawal from its occupied zone in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ross said it was a chance for the United States and Israel to
talk about their views on the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The minister will obviously have his views. We'll see what
happens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross will fly to the Middle East after his meeting with
Mordechai in Miami in a hope to revive the peace process which has
been blocked for over a year.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a point at which we can draw to a
conclusion. The president and secretary (of state) have sent me
out there to vitalize our ideas. At some point, we'll make a
judgment on whether we've done all that we can or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has suggested Israel withdraw from 13.1
percent of land from the West Bank with three months in three
phases while the Palestinians meet the security requirement from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has rejected the U.S. proposal, saying it could
only afford to cede 9 percent of the land on the West Bank on
consideration of its security.
</P>
<P>
Asked if this was a last chance for the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, Mordechai said: "Never say last chance. All the
time, we'll have another chance. We'll go chance by chance."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he and Ross would also discuss Israeli
proposals on South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed withdrawal of its troops from its
occupied zone in South Lebanon if the Beirut government
guarantees security from cross-border guerrilla raids.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri on Wednesday
threw cold water on the proposal, saying Lebanon could not be
accountable to Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Inspector Lauds Iraq's Spirit of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms inspector Richard
Butler said here on Wednesday that he is satisfied with the spirit
of cooperation shown by Iraqi officials during their talks in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
There was "a new spirit, a level of cooperation not only
outdoors (during weapons inspections), but also indoors where we
settle the policy of technical matters," Butler told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Butler is the chairman of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has destroyed the lethal
weapons before the U.N. can lift the economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq continues to show the degree of cooperation that now
seems to be evident, then I am optimistic during this calendar
year, we will make significant advance toward the end of the
disarmament phase in missile and chemical fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant U.N. resolutions, there will be a transition to
on-going monitoring phase following the present disarmament phase,
Butler said.
</P>
<P>
But so far, none of Iraq's file is qualified to enter into the
monitoring phase, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The missile file is going to be looking very close, relatively
soon; chemical file not far behind it; and as I said before, the
biological file is not in a good shape, hopefully, the meeting
which is under way in Vienna will give it a leap forward," Butler
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official, who arrived here on Sunday for a five-day
visit, said he and Iraqi officials have achieved "concrete and
practical things."
</P>
<P>
Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz held three
rounds of talks on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the results of
the technical evaluation meetings held in early February on
missile warheads and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed that further technical meetings would be held
to iron out differences between Iraq and the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that Aziz has expressed the confidence that they
would be able to continue their work with Iraq's cooperation in
the future.
</P>
<P>
He said he will submit a report to the U.N. Security Council on
April 11 and that it will be as "technical and scientific" as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The report will not only show some of the difficulties in the
weapons inspection process, but "the progress we have experienced
in the past two days" as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the chief weapons inspector, Butler has the responsibility
to submit to the Security Council a report every six months about
the progress of Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the inspections of Iraq's eight presidential sites,
Butler said that will start "very, very soon."
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we will be able to do our work in a normal way,
consistent with those special procedures with both sides'
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Iraq and the U.N., Iraq will
open its presidential sites, originally declared off-limits, to a
special group which comprises senior diplomats and UNSCOM experts.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed diplomatic sources, the inspections
of the presidential compounds will take place on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denounces Greece's Support for PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Wednesday accused Greece of
continuing its support for Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), saying that Ankara will bring this issue to
international attention.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a regular news briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that an article published in
the latest issue of Time magazine has provided detailed proof on
the relationship between Athens and the PKK.
</P>
<P>
"Due to this relationship, Greece has violated international
agreements within the framework of the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),"
Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that these agreements have made it very clear that no
member country should be allowed to render support to any
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government always terms the PKK, which has been
fighting for the autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey since
1984, as a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
The article published by Time magazine depicted a vivid picture
of the PKK activities in Greece, which has historically shared a
bitter relationship with neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
This led to harsh reactions from Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos who was on a visit to Washington at that time.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the article named "A Hellenic Have", Utkan said that
"the terrorist fire of the PKK spreads virtually unchecked in
Greece."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Turkish government would bring
this issue to some international bodies, such as the U.N. or the
OSCE, in order to prevent Athens' "unjust" action.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has always accused Greece of supporting the PKK,
saying that Greeks provide financial and military assistance to
the Kurdish militants. Athens, however, categorically denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
More than 28,000 people have been killed since the PKK started
fighting for the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey 14 years ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Debates Bill for Financing IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
debated legislation providing nearly 18 billion U.S. dollars for
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), U.S. troops abroad and El
Nino damage at home.
</P>
<P>
But the House version of the legislation is prompting sharp
objections from Democrats, with Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle Wednesday calling a veto likely.
</P>
<P>
The Senate debated briefly an amendment by Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, to set up conditions for a U.S. withdrawal of
troops from Bosnia, but she withdrew the amendment before a vote,
suggesting she just wanted to make a point.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee approved two
separate bills. It used a voice vote to pass one with the IMF
money plus 505 million U.S. dollars to pay back dues owed the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The panel, by a party-line 29-21 roll call vote, passed another
measure with 2.9 billion U.S. dollars for the disasters and troops
in Bosnia and the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
To pay for the disaster measure, the committee approved 2.9
billion U.S. dollars in cuts to low-income housing, airport
projects, bilingual education and President Clinton's pet
Ameri-corps national service program. The Republican-proposed
reductions were approved in a 33-26 party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich defended the decision to cut
domestic programs, and responded to White House opposition by
questioning whether the Clinton administration wants a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
Daschle told reporters today that efforts in the House to try
to pay for the disaster aid and for military operations with
reductions in domestic programs was a "non starter."
</P>
<P>
He added that the president will be forced to veto the
legislation if it reaches his desk in such a form.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter
bomber crashed over the Yellow Sea near South Korea and the pilot
was missing, the Air Force said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred Wednesday night about 100 kilometers west of
Osan Air Base in South Korea, the Air Force said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The plane was on a training mission when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
A search and rescue operation was mounted by personnel of the
Air Force and the Navy, as well as members of the South Korean air
force.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash is not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
It was the second U.S. F-16 to have crashed in three days. On
Monday, an F-16 fighter crashed onto a runway during an attempted
landing at the Hill Air Force Base in Utah, but the pilot ejected
safely.
</P>
<P>
Since F-16s arrived at Hill nearly two decades ago, 40 have
crashed, including two in January.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Considers Emergency Meeting to Materialize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) was considering to hold an emergency
meeting to carry out a pact reached in Saudi Arabia to cut oil
supply to glutted markets, the group's chief said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
United Arab Emirates' (UAE) Minister of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir, who was also President of OPEC,
said in a statement that "there are consultations among member
states to hold an emergency OPEC meeting to materialize Riyadh
pact."
</P>
<P>
The Riyadh pact was clinched by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
non-OPEC Mexico on Sunday with the aim of lowering world oil
production by 1.6 million to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) to
rescue oil prices which were depressed by oversupply and declining
demand.
</P>
<P>
The agreement had been able to increase oil prices by nearly 14
percent to over 15 U.S. dollars a barrel on Monday. But prices
fell back Tuesday by nearly 26 cents when traders paused for
breath to wait for the implementation of the pact.
</P>
<P>
The UAE minister did not specify the date of the possible
extraodinary OPEC meeting on carrying out the Riyadh accord, but
he said the issue would be discussed during a four-man market
monitoring committee of OPEC, which was expected to take place in
Vienna next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC market monitoring committee meeting scheduled to hold
last week was postponed to March 30 when OPEC said it needed "more
time to have a more in-depth view of the market situation, so as
to make appropriate recommendations to the conference."
</P>
<P>
Obeid said that OPEC members were also consulting to invite
some non-OPEC oil producers to next week's Vienna meeting. But he
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The UAE oil minister Monday called on all world oil producing
countries -- both inside and outside OPEC -- to follow the sample
of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico to reduce output to save
sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen oil producing countries have been involved in the
current campaign to claw back oil supply and they have so far
agreed to cut output by 1.1 million bpds.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices began to collapse after OPEC decided in
November to raise its combined output ceiling by 10 percent to
27.5 million bpds from 25 million bpds.
</P>
<P>
The price crisis was compounded by Iraq's return to oil
markets and a decline in crude demand due to a mild winter in the
northern hemisphere and Asia's economic turmoil.

<HEADLINE> New Battery Recharge System A Boost for Electric Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A rapid battery recharge system,
developed by an international consortium of companies, will
greatly increase the efficiency of electric cars, the BBC radio
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Consortium, meeting in London
this week, claims that the new system could cut the time needed to
recharge conventional lead-acid batteries from hours to minutes.
</P>
<P>
One of the big technical obstacles to the success of electric
cars is that a run-down lead-acid battery can take up to twelve
hours to recharge.
</P>
<P>
It was impossible to recharge lead-acid batteries rapidly
because acid build-up near the plates could cause a rapid increase
in electrical resistance, which in turn caused overheating and the
risk of explosion.
</P>
<P>
The new system uses electronic control to prevent that.
Computers send charging currents up to 3,000 amps in pulses of a
tenth of a second, with an eight-millisecond gap to reduce
overheating.
</P>
<P>
Research by the consortium showed that traditional lead-acid
batteries can be recharged in only three minutes in this way.
</P>
<P>
The rapid recharge system also increases the battery life by 40
percent, the BBC said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Passes Flag Desecration Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate's constitution
subcommittee on Wednesday approved a proposed constitutional
amendment that would ban flag burning.
</P>
<P>
Today's vote is the latest in a series of congressional
attempts to reverse the Supreme Court's 1989 ruling that
destroying the U.S. flag in protest is a form of constitutionally
protected speech.
</P>
<P>
A new constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote of
both houses of Congress, and of the legislatures in two-thirds of
the states. Previous flag amendments have passed the House of
Representatives, but fallen short of the necessary Senate
majority.
</P>
<P>
This year's resolution, which states that "Congress shall have
power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag," has 61
co-sponsors -- six short of the two-thirds majority needed for
passage.

<HEADLINE> Qatari FM: Dispute With Egypt "Completely" Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Foreign Minister Hamad
bin Jassim bin Jaber al Thani said on Wednesday that Doha and
Cairo have solved their disputes after a two-day visit by Qatar's
Emir.
</P>
<P>
"The chapter of disputes between Qatar and Egypt has been
turned off and the two countries opened up a new chapter now," he
said in an interview with Qatar's Star TV "Pennisula Channel."
</P>
<P>
"I believed that the disputes were settled through friendly
meetings between the two sides held during the visit (by Qatar's
Emir)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani wrapped up his
visit to Cairo on Tuesday after discussing with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak ways of improving the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have reportedly said the "relations between
Egypt and Qatar have rusumed their normal course" and "the row
(between them) was only a summer cloud which has already drifted
away."
</P>
<P>
The Qatari-Egyptian ties soured in 1996 when Doha alleged an
Egyptian involvement in a failed coup in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The relations worsened last November after Cairo boycotted the
Doha-hosted Middle East and North Africa economic conference and
Qatar's expulsion of Egyptian laborers.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Discuss Peace, Prosperity with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Six African leaders Wednesday
discussed ways for building a peaceful and prosperous Africa
with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton at a summit in
Enteb, a lakeside city in central Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The summit, co-hosted by Clinton and Uganda President Yoweri
Museveni, was attended by presidents from Kenya, Tanzania,
Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopian prime
minister and secretary general of the Organization of Africa
Unity.
</P>
<P>
It dwelt on speeding up the development of Africa's economy,
its integration into the global economy, and expanding Africa's
trade and investment opportunities, according to a declaration
issued after summit.
</P>
<P>
With reference to the creative and flexible examples from
post-war Europe and Asia, the summit pledged to form Africa's
strategies to facilitate Africa's global integration.
</P>
<P>
Based on the fact that regional intergration will create
greater market for African economies, the regional leaders
committed themselves to identifying the ways and means to
accelerate regional integration, which include international
dialogue aimed at economic reform, expansion of external resource
flows, increased investment in the infrastructure and building
African capacity, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Africa trade bill, according to the regional leaders, is a
major step forward for Africa's access to the U.S. market.
However, they added that African capacity to diversify economies
must be increased first, with the help of western technologies.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders welcome the decision of the U.S. Overseas
Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) which targets 500 million
Dollars for infrastructure investment in sub-Saharan Africa. They
pledged to take concrete measures aimed at promoting African
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the African desire for increased
self-sufficiency and the dangers of aid dependency, the regional
leaders agree that an accelarated effort should be made to use
foreign assistance as a tool for the enhancement of trade,
investment and capital formation, as well as for sustainable
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government also recognize the
continuing obstacle of debt burden to Africa's economic
transformation, and reaffirm their collective determination to
fully implement innovative approaches to the management and
lessening of the debt burden.
</P>
<P>
On the Great Lakes issue, the African leaders pledged to work
together to prohibit future atrocities to ensure peace and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States, in its turn, offered its commitment to
work with its African partners to stop atrocities and form long
term mechanism to prevent genocide in the future.
</P>
<P>
The destiny and security of Africa rest primarily in the hands
of Africans themselves, the statement noted. The leaders pledged
to seek a regional and African peace keeping capacity to settle
conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agree that stability in the region relies on the
sustainability of Africa democratization, and there is no fixed
model for democratic institutions or transformation.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Clinton left here tonight for South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Launch Major Offensive in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia launched a major infantry and jet assault on a strategic
town in northern Afghanistan and made some gains there, reports
reaching here Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters have launched three attacks on Pul-i-Khumri, a
major town in central Baghlan province, since late Tuesday, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Pul-i-Khumri lies midway along a key highway linking the north
of the country to the capital Kabul. It was defended by
anti-Taliban alliance forces of the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat faction
and northern warlord Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no details of casualties or damage from the
attacks, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban attack came after nearly two weeks of sporadic but
intense clashes between forces loyal to Dostum and the
Hezb-e-Wadhat in their northern city stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif,
about 300 km north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, who control around two-thirds of
Afghanistan including Kabul, have vowed to impose a strict Islamic
rule on a country gripped by 20 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The northern-based anti-Taliban alliance, which controls the
remaining one third, is dominated by ethnic-Tajik, Uzbek and
Hazara minorities.

<HEADLINE> Plan for London Mayor Election Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott unveiled a plan on Wednesday for a directly elected mayor
of London as part of the plans to overhaul the way the British
capital is run.
</P>
<P>
Prescott told the parliament that the city would have
"radically new" type of government for London and have a
streamlined strategic authority.
</P>
<P>
"London needs leadership with a clear mandate from the people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor will form a "cabinet" and its work will be
scrutinized by an elected assembly of councillors.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said the proposals, to be put to a referendum on May
7, were an important part of the government's plans to
decentralize power. Up to five million Londoners will be able to
vote in the May ballot.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abolished the former
Greater London Council 11 years ago, dividing its work between
local authorities and other public bodies.
</P>
<P>
Many Londoners complain that the city lacks direction and needs
somebody powerful to coordinate its transport, environment and
development.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Million Chinese Suffer from Hypertension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- One in every 13 Chinese suffers
from hypertension, or high blood pressure, the Chinese Ministry of
Health said in a report here today.
</P>
<P>
China now has some 110 million hypertension patients, as
against 90 million in 1991. Every year, about 3.2 million people
became hypertension patients in China, the report says.
</P>
<P>
"Due to ignorance and some unhealthy life styles, the disease
is imposing greater risks to the Chinese than ever," said
Wang Zhao, director of the ministry's Department of Disease
Control.
</P>
<P>
A national survey found that half of the Chinese people had
had their blood pressures measured. However, only 17 percent of
hypertension patients in cities and five percent in rural areas
took drugs regularly.
</P>
<P>
"We must let people know that healthy life styles and timely
treatment help control 75 percent of hypertension
cases," Wang said at a meeting that called upon supports from the
mass media in disease-control campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has designated October 8 as the National
Hypertension Day so as to awaken the public's awareness of health
protection.

<HEADLINE> SEATINI to Hold Economic Workshop in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Southern and Eastern African
Trade, Information and Negotiations Initiative (SEATINI), in its
press statement, said that it will organize an economic workshop
from March 30 to April 4 here to analyze the phenomenon of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The press statement said that the workshop would also analyze
the new trading regime under the World Trade Organization (WTO)
and consider a common framework of action at the WTO meeting in
Geneva in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Chief trade negotiators of 21 southern and eastern African
countries, and representatives from some non-governmental
organizations will participate in the workshop.
</P>
<P>
The press statement said that the world situation has changed
since end of the Cold War and African countries are facing with
special difficulties. They are ill-equipped to manage the new
process of globalization, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, 33 of the 48 least development countries are in
Africa, and their growth rates have lagged far behind those other
developing countries. Their share in the world trade has fallen
sharply from 1.7 percent in 1970 to 0.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The press statement said that there has been little structural
change in these countries and they continue to rely on a few
primary commodities for export earnings, adding that faced with
intensified competition, they are likely to face further erosion
of their share in the world market.
</P>
<P>
However, the press statement noted,
certain aspects of globalization are indeed very
positive even for the third world, such as the development and
spread of information technology.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the workshop will feed into the process of the
ministerial conference of the Organisation of African Unity on
trade and development to be held from April 6 to April 9 in
Harare.

<HEADLINE> Somali Peace Conference Feared Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Somali ambassador to the Arab
League expressed fear Wednesday that the planned National
Reconciliation Conference of his country might not be held, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Wednesday, Abdullah Hassan
attributed the prospect to the lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the conference originally scheduled to
open in the Somali southwestern town of Baidoa on February 15 and
later postponed to March 31 needs 4 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Somali diplomat stopped short of blaming foreign parties
for the faltering of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"The Somalis, themselves, are shouldering the responsibility
for such failure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan expressed hope that Arab League Secretary General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid may visit Mogadishu, the Somali capital, to
get acquainted with the conditions.
</P>
<P>
His statement came two days after the leaders of the two most
powerful factions in Somalia assured that they were pursuing
arrangements for the conference in their separate letters to the
Arab League and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to have aided the worry that the conference
might be canceled and clan conflicts renewed after Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and Hussein Fareh Aideed announced their decision on
February 14 to put off the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi is the leader of the Somali United Congress and Aideed
heads the Somali National Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement they signed last December, a federal
government will be formed at the National Reconciliation
Conference which will be attended by all factions in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been hit heavily by factional wars since the ouster
of the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. More than 300,000
people have died in the war and ensuing famine.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa had imported
armaments from 39 countries in the past four years, Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki told parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Between April 1, 1994 and February 9, 1998, South Africa
bought more than 104 million Rand (about 21 million U.S. dollars)
worth of arms from Spain and 81 million Rand (16 million dollars)
worth of arms from Israel, Mbeki said in a written reply to a
parliamentary question.
</P>
<P>
The country also bought, among others, 60 million Rand (12
million dollars) worth of armaments from Britain and 37 million
Rand (7.4 million dollars) worth of arms from France, South
African Press Association quoted Mbeki as saying.
</P>
<P>
The figures represented not only acquisitions for the national
defence force, but those by local industry for their own
products, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had exported weapons to 90 countries over this
period, including selling 637 million Rand (128 million dollars)
worth of weapons to India, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country also sold armaments worth 387 million Rand (78
million dollars) to Oman and weapons worth 339 million Rand (68
million dollars) to the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> New Technology Will Change Business Face: Analysis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- advances in electronic commerce,
networks and telecommunications will make businesses more
efficient and profitable as they head into the next century, a
leading U.S. consulting firm said.
</P>
<P>
In its Technology Forecast 1998 released on Wednesday, Price
Waterhouse highlights several technology trends:
</P>
<P>
- A rising number of "smart products" such as cars, phones and
home appliances that are accessed through networks and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Microprocessors may be installed in automobiles allowing repair
shops to diagnose problems via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
- Significant expansion of voice recognition capabilities in
devices such as phones that will reduce the need for
keyboards/touchpads.
</P>
<P>
Users will simply tell a computer to turn itself on, or use
their voice to have phones dial automatically.
</P>
<P>
- Increased use of satellite and wireless technologies by
companies reaching businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The California-based Price Waterhouse said technology advances
may mean a large scale change for the cultural dynamics and
organizational processes of a "global corporation", and creation
of the potential for major improvements in productivity.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Strengthen Quality Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (xinhua) -- A senior Mozambican official in
charge of quality control said on Wednesday that Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries will strengthen control on
quality of products made in the region.
</P>
<P>
Gabriela Da Silva, Director for national standardization and
quality control of Mozambique, told reporters on Wednesday that
representatives from SADC member states admitted that the quality
of the products made in Southern Africa is poor.
</P>
<P>
At a six-day Expert Conference on Standardization and Quality
Control in Southern Africa ended on Tuesday, the participants
discussed cooperation between the SADC countries in this field.
</P>
<P>
The representatives to the conference noted that the quality
of imports from other countries is bad. And they stressed that
efforts should be made to monitor and control the quality of both
the products manufactured in Southern African states and the
imported goods.
</P>
<P>
The best in quality control in the region is South Africa
where there are 1,500 enterprises registered passing quality
tests, they said.
</P>
<P>
Silver said that participants of the conference agreed that
each member states of SADC should urge industrialists to
strengthen testing of their products and made them realized that
quality is essential to the very existence of businesses. They
also agreed that monitoring and control authorities should work
together with companies to improve quality of local products.
</P>
<P>
SADC started implementing its plan on standardization and
quality control in 1985 and it holds annual meeting on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls on Parties Concerned to Break Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Concluding his first Middle
East tour on Wednesday, the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called on all the parties concerned to take hard decisions
to break the deadlock in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his trip at a news conference held here, Annan said
he was encouraged by the fact that Israeli and Arab leaders he has
met have all expressed "a deep desire for peace" despite the
impasse in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"There is disagreement as to the reason for the current
impasse. The Arab leaders I have met in the region have been
deeply skeptical about the good faith of the current Israeli
government ..., at the same time, they reiterated their support
for a just and comprehensive peace with Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he noted that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government have complained the
Palestinians for "not fully committed to the fight against
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Before his visit here, Annan has traveled to Jordan, Egypt,
Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian self-rule area to hold
discussions on exploring ways of breaking the stalemate in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
But he has played down any expectation for a breakthrough
through the efforts made in his mission, saying he only came to
the region to "learn, to see and to encourage" the parties to keep
faith toward peace.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me very important that the current impasse in the
peace process should be broken. I call on all concerned to show
the courage, wisdom and vision to take the hard decisions that
will be necessary," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that progress should be made on all tracks of the
Middle East peace process, especially the resumption of the
stalled Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I am of the opinion that without peace with Syria, there can
be no comprehensive peace in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and Syria came to a halt nearly
two years ago over the future of the Golan Heights, a piece of
Syrian land captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed deep concern about the deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process due to Israel's expansion of
settlements, and continuing closure of Palestinian self-rule areas
that aggravates the economic hardship of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Oslo accords must be implemented and the
relevant U.N. resolutions, based on the land-for-peace principle,
be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
"We are engaged in a process that will either move forward or
backwards, but that cannot for long remain stalled," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said he particularly discussed with Israeli
leaders the implementation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution
425 that calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to withdraw from south Lebanon if the
Lebanese government agrees to an arrangement concerning the
security of the bordering areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the proposal, maintaining that Israel's
offer is not in compliance with the U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Israeli-U.N. relations that are always at
odds due to Israel's refusal to implement the relevant U.N.
resolutions, Annan said he would try to improve the ties and
normalize Israel's status in the world organization.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the only member state excluded from the U.N. regional
groups. This means it has no chance of being elected to serve on
main organs, such as the Security Council or the Economic and
Social Council.

<HEADLINE> China Implements New Interest Rate Reductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC), the nation's central bank, lowered interest rates on bank
loans and deposits on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central bank initiated reform of the deposit
reserve fund system on March 21, and plans to reduce interest
rates on loans and deposits granted to financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The new steps represent important and effective measures the
new government has adopted for economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Economists contend that the fourth round of interest rate
reductions since 1996 will provide a sound macroeconomic
environment for the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Several years of economic reform and development have enabled
China to realize a "soft landing" and have in turn promoted high
economic growth with low inflation. China has been highly
successful in related efforts in spite of the financial crisis
which hit many countries in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The main 1998 macro-control objectives for the national economy
include realizing an economic growth rate of eight percent and
keeping retail price increases below three percent. Said
objectives were listed in the government work report presented
during the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhiyuan, an economics professor at Qinghua University,
pointed to the feasibility of the main objectives and noted that
the central government should adopt effective measures to achieve
same in accordance with the policy of promoting development while
maintaining stability. He cited the new round of interest rate
reductions as an important and necessary step.
</P>
<P>
Li said that interest rates are playing an increasingly
important role in the process of transforming economic mechanisms
from a planned to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Interest rate reduction will expand gross domestic demand by
increasing both consumption and investment, said Li, adding that
China will reduce costs in various major infrastructure
construction projects due to lower interest rate on bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The new round of interest rate reductions indicates that China
will continue to skillfully use related rates to control the
national economy, according to Zhang Zhuoyuan, an economist with
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
He also noted that interest rate reductions will reduce
financial burden on state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The fact that average annual interest rates have dropped 4.05
percentage points over the past two years has helped relieve
enterprises of interest payments totalling 200 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts contend that the nation's rapid and steady economic
development will create conditions to ensure the smooth
application of the new round of interest rate reduction. They
stress that China is fully confident of its ability to achieve
even greater economic progress.
