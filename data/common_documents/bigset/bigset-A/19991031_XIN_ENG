<HEADLINE> New Measures Announced in Greece to Develop Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Saturday announced a series of new measures to further
develop the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Early retirement incentives for farmers would from January 1
rise by 25 percent to encourage the older generation to make way
for youth, and loan rates for young farmers would fall to 7.5
percent from 12.0 percent in the rest of the agricultural sector,
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted Simitis as
saying.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, interest on loans for cultivation would also
drop from 12.0 percent to a single digit.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' pensions would rise by 10 percent with the minimum
monthly payment at 43,000 drachmas (about 141 U.S. dollars), and
the Greek government would for the first time pay interest on
allowances or compensation payments to farmers that were delayed
by state services.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government would order the immediate disbursement of
a down payment for compensation in natural disasters with the
balance to follow as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the creation of integrated sector groups focusing on
a single product, such as olive oil or tobacco, Simitis said that
his government wanted to reduce the current 7,000 agricultural
cooperatives to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Currently, agriculture accounts for 22 percent of Greece's
total employment and its gross added value is about 14.2 percent
of the value of end products.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, along with forestry and fishing, makes up about
11.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).

<HEADLINE> Sergeyev: Russia Seeks Constitutional Order in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Saturday that restoring "constitutional order"
throughout Chechnya was the ultimate goal of the current military
operation in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"Bandit formations and international terrorism must be
liquidated" and "conditions must be created for a political
process," Sergeyev said in an interview with the ORT television.
</P>
<P>
He said federal forces "are carrying out positively" plans
approved by President Boris Yeltsin and the military leadership.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sergeyev said, there were no deadlines for the
operation, launched in the wake of armed incursions into Daghestan
and a spate of terrorist bombings that killed about 300 people in
Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
The armed incursions were led by Chechen warlords Shamil
Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian known only by his last name. The
two have also been accused of masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said all military and security services involved in
the campaign were acting "as a single team,"
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry echoed Sergeyev's denial of any
deadline for the military campaign against Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
There is no link between the conclusion of the anti-terrorist
operation in the North Caucasus and the signing of an amended
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty on November 19, the
Interfax news agency quoted a ministry source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after some media reports that federal troops in
Chechnya plan to bring the operation to a close by the end of
November due to the pending signing of the amended treaty in
Istanbul, Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, OAU to Talk Over Ethio-Eritrean Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia pledged on
Saturday to continue dialog with the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) over the Technical Arrangement designed to solve 16-month
Ethio-Eritrean border conflict peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi held two meetings with
Algerian President special envoy Ahmed Ouyahia on October 26 and
28, and the two sides agreed that the dialog between Ethiopia and
the OAU will continue "in the very near future".
</P>
<P>
Ouyahia, whose country holds rotating presidency of the OAU,
shuttled between Eritrean capital Asmara and Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa to push forward the OAU-brokered peace process on the
Ethio-Eritrean crisis, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
At the two meetings, Meles and Ouyahia had extensive and
comprehensive discussions and exchanged views which were described
as useful and constructive.
</P>
<P>
Zenawi told Ouyahia that the OAU proposed Technical Arrangement
contain numerous points which were inconsistent with the OAU
framework agreement and the modalities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ethiopia had in principle agreed to accept
the OAU framework agreement and the modalities.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Zenawi as sayinante is an issue of
fundamental principle to Ethiopia which the Technical
Arrangements, in their present form, fail to guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Ouyahia took note of these concerns raised by Zenawi. "A number
of measures, both substantive and procedural, were discussed to
address Ethiopia's concern," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Receives Letter of Thanks From Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
received on Saturday a letter of thanks from his Turkish
counterpart Suleyman Demirel for the humanitarian aid offered by
Iraq to Turkish families of victims of the recent earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Demirel expressed the gratitude of the Turkish people "for the
generous aid offered by the Iraqi people and government after the
devastating earthquake that hit Turkey in last September," the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president said in his letter that the Iraqi aid
came on time.
</P>
<P>
"The material and moral support offered by Iraq has left a
strong effect on consolidating our steadfastness and efforts to
save the souls and to restore hope," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq pumped 10 million U.S. dollars worth of oil as
humanitarian aid to victims of the 7.4-magnitude earthquake that
hit western Turkey on August 17, which left some 14,000 people
dead and 43,000 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that the dimensions of the tragedy caused by the
earthquake has created a new challenge for the world people to
reiterate their humanitarian solidarity with the Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that our solidarity after the earthquake represents
a new hope in the new millennium," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi-Turkish relations have remained cold after the 1991 Gulf
War during which Turkey sided with the allied forces to drive
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long criticized Turkey for allowing the U.S. and
British warplanes to use its air base to patrol the no-fly zone
over northern Iraq and attack its civilian and military targets
there.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad often condemned Turkey for its armed troops'
cross-border attacks against the outlawed Turkish Workers' Party
rebels, which have sought shelters in northern Iraq after the Gulf
War.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Algerian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGER, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Saturday afternoon that it is not a wise choice to
undertake construction with doors closed under the current
tendency of economic globlization.
</P>
<P>
"That is why Deng Xiaoping put forward the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic policy of
reforms and opening to the outside world," Jiang said while
meeting with Algerian Prime Minister Ismail Hamdani.
</P>
<P>
"According to this theory, China has decided to build socialist
market economy," he added. "However, this market economy is built
under the conditions of socialism, which is different from the
economic model of the West."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed especially the importance of dealing correctly
with the relationship between reforms, development and stability,
saying that "A country must have a stable situation, only thus can
it concentrate fully on economic construction."
</P>
<P>
Hamdani spoke highly of the economic and social development
China has achieved so far and said that China's development is
very important to Algeria because it needs to learn from the
China's experience of construction and development.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that Jiang's current state visit to Algeria will
further strengthen the friendly cooperation in all fields between
the two countries.
This is the first visit to Algeria by the head of China.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Opposition Groups Meet in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 members of
different Iraqi opposition groups, brought together by the United
States, began a four-day conference in New York Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the Iraqi National Congress, aims to
form a united front against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Speeches from David Scheffer, U.S. Ambassador-at-large for War
Crimes issues and Sens. Bob Kerry and Sam Brownback marked the
first say.
</P>
<P>
"We are spending nearly 2 billion U.S. dollars a year in the
containment policy. We have a military strategy in place and it
simply isn't working and it is unsatisfying to the American
people," said Kerry, who sponsored the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act
providing for arming Iraqi groups.
</P>
<P>
Scheffer showed the audience a box of CD-ROMs which he said
contained more than 5 million pages of captured Iraqi documents
that could be used to indict the Iraqi leadership for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The gathering in New York coincided with the announcement
earlier this week that the United States will begin providing
military support for Iraq's opposition groups.

<HEADLINE> France to Shift to Winter Time Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- France and most other European
countries will shift time system to winter time from Sunday by
turning back one hour.
</P>
<P>
Until March next year, the French time will be one hour ahead
of the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
</P>
<P>
European countries (Britain not included) established three
years after the 1973 oil crisis the winter and summer time system
in order to save hundreds of thousands of tons of oil each year.
</P>
<P>
But the system is sharply criticized by some people who said
that it has broken the biological rhythm of people and has brought
harm to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
European countries are expected to keep the system at least
until 2001, although some countries, including France, have called
for its abandoning.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- One Iraqi civilian was injured
on Friday night in U.S. and British air attacks on residential
areas and economic installations in southern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 23:45 Friday night (2045 GMT) 19
formations of U.S and British warplanes coming from Saudi and
Kuwaiti basebed some residential areas and economic
installations in the region, injuring one civilian, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the enemy
planes and repulsed them to their bases in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, the U.S. and
British warplanes have made 14,615 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq and have targetted regularly Iraqi civilian and
military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, regarding
them as unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain since
they are not covered directly by any U.N. resolution.

HARARE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy
Minister Enos Chikowore on Saturday urged the country to explore
other alternative sources of energy and make use of the abundant
sunshine so as to provide rural people with cheap electricity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commissioning of the wind-powered mini-grid in
Rusape of eastern Zimbabwe, the minister said Zimbabwe needed to
find other alternative sources of renewable energy that are
ozone-friendly to save the ozone layer from further depletion.
</P>
<P>
He said electricity generated from sources like wind and solar
were more cheaper than hydro and thermal power and hence best
suited for rural people.
</P>
<P>
The winollars (26, 300 U.S. dollars). Business centers,
schools, clinics and villagers are set to benefit from this
wind-powered system and their standards of living are also set to
improve, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed the availability of modest quantities of energy
particularly electricity from wind can substantially contribute to
meeting health needs and improving the quality of life by
providing light, television for educational and entertainment
purposes," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Keeps N.Irish Parties Talking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Talks between pro-agreement
parties and former U.S. Senator George Mitchell resumed Saturday
in Belfast in a bid to break the deadlocked Northern Ireland peace
process.
</P>
<P>
However, there is speculation that the discussions in the
review of the workings of the Good Friday Agreement may continue
into next week.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein negotiator Gerry Kelly said it was imperative
that the talks succeed soon.
</P>
<P>
"It's down to the knife edge now and if there's to be success,
then that success needs to come in the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
Both the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Fein are locked in
discussions until late on Friday to try to overcome the impasse
over paramilitary arms decommissioning and devolution, which have
dogged the peace process.
</P>
<P>
There is still no sign of progress as the review nears its end,
and there are fears that George Mitchell may leave Belfast without
a deal being struck.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, both parties had narrowed their talks teams
down to their leaders and another negotiator: Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams with Martin McGuinness and UUP leader David Trimble
with Sir Reg Empey.
</P>
<P>
The peace process stalled when the Ulster Unionists refused to
form a devolved government with Sinn Fein in July because the IRA
would not start decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says decommissioning is not a prior requirement to
the formation of an executive under the peace agreement signed in
April 10 last year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges France to Lift Ban on UK Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain urged France Saturday to
lift its ban on British beef rather than force the matter to go to
court.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for a quick and positive response," Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said. "There is no reasonable case for
maintaining a ban against British beef," he told BBC Radio 4.
</P>
<P>
Cook warned that "France will lose", if legal action is taken,
as European Commission scientists have unanimously ruled British
beef is safe recently.
</P>
<P>
The European Union lifted its 3-1/2 year ban on British beef -
imposed in the wake of the crisis over BSE, or mad cow disease -
in August.
</P>
<P>
But France, citing consumer concerns and what it said was new
evidence, has defied it.
</P>
<P>
The UK Agriculture spokesman Tim Yeo said: "Any further delay
by the French must be met with an immediate prosecution on the
part of the European Commission or unilateral legal action by the
British government if the Commission prevaricates."
</P>
<P>
However, as French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin are both now away from the country on official
visits, Cook said; "I'm not sure we will get a decision tomorrow
but we will continue to keep up the pressure."

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday announced stricter regulations for toxic chemicals,
saying companies that use even the smallest amounts of highly
toxic chemicals will be required to report the use to the public.
</P>
<P>
Current federal regulations require only companies that use
large amounts of extremely toxic chemicals, like mercury and
dioxin, to disclose their use.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said the new rules would
force companies that use much smaller amounts to follow the same
disclosure guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"We'll require companies to inform the public even if they're
using smaller quantities," Clinton said, "in some cases just 10
pounds a year."
</P>
<P>
Lowering the amount for disclosure will help communities force
polluting companies to act more responsibly, Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Named as U.N. Special Envoy to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Alvaro de Soto has
been appointed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy
for Cyprus and Chief of Mission of the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
De Soto will take up the posts next spring, local press
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, de Soto will be Annan's New York-based special
advisor on Cyprus as of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council was officially informed of de Soto's
appointment on Friday in a letter from Annan to council President
Serei Lavrov.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to give its written approval
within a few days.
</P>
<P>
Reports said de Soto, 56, has already been given the seal of
approval by the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
De Soto has been U.N. assistant secretary-general for political
affairs since January 1995 and has been involved in the Cyprus
issue in the capacity.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, Annan named Chilean diplomat James Holger as his
special representative for Cyprus for a three-month term.
</P>
<P>
Reports suggested that since Annan has planned to send de Soto
to Cyprus in the spring, Holger's appointment will be extended
naturally.

<P>
BAGHDAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- One Iraqi civilian was injured
on Friday night in U.S. and British air attacks on residential
areas and economic installations in southern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman aning from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace over Basra,
Thi-Qar, Qadissiya, Kerbela, Misan, Muthana and Najaf.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed some residential areas and economic
installations in the region, injuring one civilian, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the enemy
planes and repulsed them to their bases in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, the U.S. and
British warplanes have made 14,615 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq and have targetted regularly Iraqi civilian and
military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, regarding
them as unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain since
they are not covered directly by any U.N. resolution.

KUWAIT CITY -- A senior Saudi official has said that Saudi
Arabia is keen on putting an end to its border dispute with Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Saana have been locked in a border dispute in
recent years, as the two countries are at odds over whether to
renew the 1934 Saudi-Yemeni Taif border accord, which assigned the
provinces of Najran, Jizan and Asir to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Yemen was previously opposed to renewing the treaty which
expired in September 1992 since it also claimed the disputed
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, armed clashes even took place between the two
Arab neighbors on a disputed Red Sea Island in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, more than one year of talks of the joint Saudi-Yemeni
border demarcation committee have made headway over the
outstanding issue. (BC-Saudi-Yemen-Border)

<HEADLINE> Sino-Algerian Friendship Bear Satisfactory Fruits, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGER, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said Saturday that friendly cooperation between China and Algeria
have born satisfactory fruits, thanks to efforts undertaken by the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with leaders of the Algerian parliament,
Jiang said that although China and Algeria are geographically far
apart, their traditional friendship is long-standing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as early as in the 1950s when the Algerian people
were waging the national liberation war, China and Algeria forged
deep friendship in struggle against imperialism and colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is one of the earliest African countries to establish
diplomatic ties with China and made important contribution to
restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the more than 40 years since the establishment of diplomatic
ties, the bilateral friendly cooperation in all fields of endeavor
has born satisfactory fruits, thanks to the concerted efforts by
the two sides, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that although the international situation has
undergone many changes, China will adhere to the path of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Although China has scored
great achievements, it is still a developing country and will
always side firmly with vast numbers of developing countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to establish a just and rational
international political and economic order, the primary task is to
oppose hegemonism and power politics. Developing countries should
uphold their rights of existence and development and steadily take
the road of development suited to their national conditions,
oppose interference in internal affairs of the developing
countries by the West under the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
China opposes the claims of human rights being superior to
sovereignty and believes that without independent sovereignty,
there is no protection of human rights in the developing
countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Mohamed Bachir Boumaga, president of
Algeria's Council of the Nation, said that Jiang's visit is
historical since it is the first state visit by China's head of
state.
</P>
<P>
Algerian-Sino relations and friendship are unique and Algeria
can learn many useful experience from China in the future national
construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Qudir Bin Saleh, president of National People's Assembly
of Algeria, said that the cooperation between the two countries is
very successful and examplary.
</P>
<P>
He believes that Jiang's visit will be a milestone in bilateral
relationship as it will chart the direction of future development
of the relations between the two countries.

Pan's younger brother Pan Tingfu came from Shanghai to the
courtyard to play the organ after his retirement several years ago.
Pan Tinggui graduated from a seminary in Shanghai over 50 years
ago. His wife helped him in house meeting activities. When she
died a few years ago, the local government sent their condolences
to Pan and gave him 300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred black and white and colored photos displayed
on a picture frame on the wall outside of the room chronicle a 16
year history of their worship activities.
</P>
<P>
"The local officials never interfere with our worship
activities and they only come to ask what help they can offer and
make regular fire prevention checks," said Pan Tinggui.
</P>
<P>
Around 70 Christian believers gather regularly at the courtyard
room and over 100 believers congregate on Christmas Day. Pan's
courtyard often becomes one of the most crowded places in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The oldest believer in Pan's courtyard is over 80 years old and
the youngest is 18 years old. In the past 16 years, more than 300
people including some Pan's neighbors have become Christians.
</P>
<P>
Han Wenzao, President of the China Christian Council, said
China has over 10 million Christians and published over 20 million
copies of the Bible. Beijing has some 35,000 Christians.

"Local officials have never check my sermon and my courtyard is
experiencing a record number of believers," said Pan Tinggui.

<HEADLINE> Exposing Falungong Activists In China And Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- An article in "The People's
Daily" on Saturday called for the illegal activities of the
Falonggong sect to be exposed at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Falonggong's founder, Li Hongzhi, and sect leaders have
repeatedly stated that Falungong has no overseas organizations and
have never advocated theories concerning the end of the world or
that they could cure diseases without medicine.
</P>
<P>
The article said that Li Hongzhi and his followers are afraid
of being labeled as an illegal organization and cult. The article
also stated that Li Hongzhi and his followers thought that they
could deceive people overseas and that the international community
were unaware of there unlawful activities in China.
</P>
<P>
An important task in fighting against the Falungong sect is to
publicize the activities of Li Hongzhi and his followers at home
and abroad. "This will be the most convenient and effective way to
expose the duplicity of Li Hongzhi".

KUNMING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The '99 World Horticulture Expo
has brought huge economic benefits to China, especially to Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the organizing committee said the Chinese

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Adopts Three Laws, One Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) adopted a meteorological law,
amendments to Highway Law and Accounting Law, and a resolution on
handling existing Macao laws here today.
</P>
<P>
With presidential decrees signed by President Jiang Zemin, the
law on meteorological work and revised Accounting Law will take
effect as of January 1, 2000, and July 1, 2000, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Revised Highway Law will become effective on the day when
it is published.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
the law on meteorological work is to regulate meteorological
forecasting work in order to provide better service to the country
's economic construction, national defense and social development.
</P>
<P>
The law on accountancy is amended in a bid to prevent frauds
and increase supervision on accountants, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also approved was a resolution which stipulated that 30
existing Macao laws would not be adopted as laws of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) in the future because they
completely or partially contradict the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng described the resolution as "not only embodying the
sovereignty principle, but also ensuring continuity of Macao's
existing laws".
</P>
<P>
The national legislature also voted to approve one amendment on
an international convention on controlling of hazardous wastes,
and to join two international conventions, one of these being the
Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of
Armed Conflict.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details, Quotes Added Chinese Legislature Passes Fuel Tax Bill (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Amendments to the Highway
Law, rejected by China's national legislature at a ballot on May
29 this year because of one vote short, were approved today after
legislators were shown an revised and improved plan.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited massive taxation reform in China has been
given green light to go ahead with a landslide majority vote
result.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were made to replace highway tolls with fuel
taxes. The fuel tax reform has been viewed by the government as a
breakthrough point of a wholesale tax reform package.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress have shown consistent support for the taxation reform,
but many of them worried about a detailed fuel tax plan attached
with the amendments proposed by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the revisions would help reduce the random
and sometime exorbitant fees collected along highways. But they
also contend that the State Council plan may also result in
unjustifiable burdens upon farmers and others who use fuel, but do
not necessarily take highways.
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, the State Council has conducted
several surveys and discussions with local governments to further
improve its new taxation plans.

<P>
Xiang Huaicheng, the Minister of Finance, told legislators
just days before today's voting that the State Council has worked
out several measures finally to address the "excellent points of
concern" raised by lawmakers, which include reimbursing farmers
according to the acreage of their farm land and overhauling the
taxation system in the countryside to replace various fee
collections.
</P>
<P>
"I can never guarantee absolute equity for each farmer, but
this is one of the best ways available. I hope all farmers will be
basically satisfied," Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
"China's taxation reform has been aimed to reduce burden on
the people, including the overwhelming farming population. If this
cannot be achieved, reform will be of no value at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee also reinforced its opinion that
the State Council should "earnestly" consider suggestions put
forward by lawmakers in formulating its fuel tax reform plans and
take "effective measures" to avoid more burdens on farmers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the lawmakers are in favor of the new plans put
forward by the State Council. "During the course of cross-
examinations and discussions on the draft law, we have reached the
best way to protect the interests of people", said Wang Jiafu, a
celebrated jurist and a member of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
With a presidential decree signed by President Jiang Zemin,
the revised Highway Law was published and took effect today.

<HEADLINE> Al Shuhada Street in Hebron Further Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel opened one more sector of
the "Al Shuhada" street in Hebron this morning to traffic for
Palestinian vehicles in line with the Sharm Al Sheikh memorandum
signed between Israel and the Palestinians in September.
</P>
<P>
One sector of the street was opened to Palestinians several
months ago, and the Sharm Al Sheikh memorandum stipulated that the
street would be wholly opened to traffic in a second stage not
exceeding October 30.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian civilian liaison officer in Hebron Colonel Salamat
Jawadi welcomed the Israeli decision, expressing fears that there
might not be the full opening of the street, in contradiction with
the Sharm Al Sheikh memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Radio Israel broadcast that about 100 Israeli
residents in Hebron have staged demonstrations in the street
protesting against its opening on the grounds that it will
constitute a threat to their security.
</P>
<P>
The Shuhada street was closed in the wake of the massacre
perpetrated by a diehard Jew in March 1994 which resulted in the
killing and injury of 180 people while saying their prayers inside
Ibrahimi mosque.

BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- During his recent inspection
tour to northwest China's Gansu and Qinghai provinces as well as
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, premier Zhu Rongji called for an
immediate implementation of the government's plan to develop the
economy in its western areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's inspection tour, from October 21 to 30, followed his
similar tours in Shaanxi, Yunnan and Sichuan earlier in the year.
He told provincial officials that Deng Xiaoping considered the
development of China's western areas an essential part of the
modernization process.

Zhu elaborated on Deng Xiaoping's blueprint for economic reform
which first saw several of China's coastal cities become Special
Economic Zones. Deng also called for the development of China's
central and western areas to follow the economic prosperity of
Special Economic Zones such as Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Zhu added that President Jiang Zemin was also firmly committed
to the development of China's western areas, stressing repeatedly
that "high priority" must be given to their development.

<TEXT>
<P>
The development of China's western areas is by no means an easy
project and one that needs to proceed step by step, the premier
said. He added that while developing the infrastructure of these
areas is a priority, protecting the environment is also very
important.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also emphasized that an accelerated development of these
regions requires increased investment into basic facilities such
as highways, railways, airports, natural gas pipelines, power
grids and telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
A transportation network should be set up linking the western
areas with the central, eastern, southwest and northwest areas,
utilizing local water resources and building water control
projects.
</P>
<P>
Protecting the environment is also a priority. Zhu said that
soil erosion in the western part of China could result in
accumulating sediments in Yangtze River and Yellow River causing
severe flooding along the middle and lower reaches of these two
rivers.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- An EgyptAir Boeing 767
passenger plane disappeared off the coast of Massachusetts after
leaving from New York's Kennedy International Airport on the way
to Cairo, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Flight 990 plane, which had 197 passengers on board,
disappeared about 100 kilometers south of the island of Nantucket,
the U.S. Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, originating in Los Angeles, took off from Kennedy at
1:19 a.m. (0519 GMT) and disappeared from radar at 2 a.m. (0600
GMT) while flying at 9,900 meters, according to sources of the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
After the flight left Los Angeles it made a landing at Edwards
Air Force Base in California before continuing on to Kennedy.
However, there was no immediate confirmation from Edwards. The
plane's takeoff from Kennedy was delayed by two hours because it
arrived late from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard officers said they had sent every available
cutter and aircraft in the Northeast to join the search, plus
airplanes from far away as Elizabeth City, North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Macao People Celebrate 50-day Countdown to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Amid joyful lion-dance and
deafening sound of gongs and drums, thousands of Macao residents
flocked to a downtown square Sunday morning to celebrate the 50-
day countdown to Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen stands were set up in the square selling various
souvenirs related to the return, such as badges, coins and cards
bearing the miniature flag and emblem of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Flapping its wings, a human-sized downy figure named "returning
swallow" was carried into the square by a tricycle. The lovely
figure drew the attention of the crowd and people rushed to have
photos taken beside the figure.
</P>
<P>
Chosen from scores of designs, a cartoon swallow was decided in
early July this year to be a mascot used in various celebration
activities of ordinary residents in the course of Macao's return
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the square, a winding queue of people were waiting
to have post marks stamped onto a commemorative envelope
specifically designed for the 50-day countdown to return.
</P>
<P>
The celebration was a major part of activities showing local
people's eager expectation for December 20 when Macao will break
away from Portuguese rule and become a region of China enjoying a
high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, a four-day picture exhibition was unveiled
at the Landmark Conference and Exhibition Center to show Macao's
returning process.
</P>
<P>
On display are 194 pictures demonstrating the negotiations on
the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and its signing moments, the
drafting of the Macao Basic Law and ensuing publicity activities,
and the selection of the chief executive and principal officials
of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pictures have been shown in about a dozen cities in
the interior areas of China and proved to be rather appealing
among viewers.
</P>
<P>
As night fell, a song and dance troupe coming from China's
Inner Mongolia presented performances in a theater to add gleeful
atmosphere to the special occasion.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several days, local residents have had seminars,
performances, park gatherings and dining parties to show their
enthusiasm for being reunited with their compatriots in the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK's District Councils Election draws Enthusiastic Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Election of the first
District Councils of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
has won enthusiastic participation of local residents who intend
to run in the race.
</P>
<P>
Publicity campaigns have come to full swing since the
government gazetted the official list of the 798 validly nominated
candidates on Friday. The candidates are all active to promote
their political platforms by various forms to win supports from
electors.
</P>
<P>
Chan Waiming, a candidate from the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), delivered his leaflets recently in
his constituency and listened to the views of electors.
</P>
<P>
He said his advantages in his familiarity and experience in
neighborhood service would help him win in the competition and
pledged to go all out for the campaign to serve the residents
better.
</P>
<P>
Chan Kam Lam, who automatically became a District Council
member, has also gone through his publicity procedures, including
delivering leaflets and putting up posters on his platforms.
</P>
<P>
As a District Council member, he must work hard to handle real
concerns of local residents, he said, adding that his automatic
election reflects the recognition of the electors.
</P>
<P>
The bill on the development of the District Council was
approved last March at the Legislative Council, which decided to
establish 18 District Councils to replace the incumbent
Provisional District Boards.
</P>
<P>
The main function of the District Council is to advise the
government on matters affecting the well-being of the people in
the District, including matters relating to food and environmental
hygiene services.
</P>
<P>
The first term of District Councils will be composed of elected
members, ex officio members and appointed members. A total of 390
seats will be returned to November 28 election.
</P>
<P>
Since then, preparations for the election started soon in an
all-round way. The Hong Kong Electoral Affairs Commission have
worked out procedures, which included publication of a voter
register, the nomination of candidates, polling arrangements and
the counting of ballots.
</P>
<P>
The election received warm response from the local community. A
record 799 candidates had signed up when nominations closed on
October 20. Up to 295 of the 469 incumbent District Board members
have signed up for re-election, including seven who are
legislators.
</P>
<P>
A total of 76 seats are to be returned uncontested subject to
government confirmation. As a result, 722 candidates will compete
for 314 seats in 18 districts.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Home Affairs David Lan Hong-tsung described the
increase in the number of candidates as good.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the number of women candidates also increase
significantly to a record 128 persons, he said, and pledged that
the authorities will give full support to all publicity's.
</P>
<P>
The Registration and Electoral Office have produced leaflets
containing photos, personal particulars and platforms of the
candidates. A 24-hour hotline will come into service next week for
the public to listen to the platforms of the candidates.

<HEADLINE> Passengers, Freights at Mozambican Airports on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 19 airports in
Mozambique saw a big increase both in passenger transportation and
the volume of freights in the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Jose Salomone Cossa, chairman of the Administration Council of
Mozambican Airports, said this at a recent workshop on the
management of the airports in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
During the period, there were 28,642 take-offs or landings at
the various airports, which represented 10 percent more than
expected and eight percent more than that of the same period in
1998.
</P>
<P>
A total number of 497,547 passengers went through these
airports in the nine mo(Sunday) weekly quoted Cossa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The volume of freights amounted to 1,392 tons, 10 percent more
than that of the same period in 1998, the airport official added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase in passengers and freights to the
booming Mozambican economy and the recovering tourism both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In response to the rising passengers and freights, the
Mozambican Airlines and their foreign counterparts have provided
passengers with more flights and services and improved
infrastructures as well.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique will continue to increase its investment in the
improvement of infrastructures and services, Cossa said, adding
that the passenger transportation and the volume of freights are
expected to increase by 13 percent and 10 percent respectively at
Mozambican airports.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Cooperate in Searching for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
security establishments are working closely to search for the
assailants who shot at a bus and wound five Israelis in the West
Bank Saturday night, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks while reporting the shooting incident
to a weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Five Israeli passengers were injured Saturday night when
unidentified gunmen opened fire at their bus near the West Bank
village of Tarkumiya, near the town of Hebron and only about one
kilometer away from the terminal of a newly-opened safe passage
for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This is the first terrorist act since the 43-kilometer-long safe
passage linking the Palestinian-ruled Gaza and the West Bank was
opened last Monday. Israeli security concerns over the road,
which goes through Israeli territory, had delayed the opening for
several times.
</P>
<P>
Unlike his hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, who often
took what the Palestinians called "collective punishment" measures
against them for minor incidents, Barak shrugged off the ambush.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office issued a short statement after the incident,
saying that he had ordered the security forces to intensify
efforts to locate the gunmen. The safe passage opened as usual on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In another sign that the incident had not affected the current
peace process, Barak ordered the further opening of a main road
called Shuhada Street for the Palestinians in Hebron on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After being blocked from access for five years, Palestinians
are now allowed to drive buses or taxis along the road, which
links the Palestinian part of Hebron to the Cave of the
Patriarchs, a site holy both to Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Part of the street were opened in August.
</P>
<P>
Barak will leave for Oslo, Norway Sunday night to take part in
a ceremony marking the four years since the assassination of late
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, who signed the first interim peace
agreement with the Palestinians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet U.S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in a trilateral summit
on Tuesday. The main topic will be the final-status talks between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have set an ambitious goal of
reaching a framework for a permanent peace by February. The
two sides will begin the final-status talks, which deal with
thorny issues including the status of the Palestinian entity and
the fate of Jerusalem, on November 7.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raps Mauritania for Setting up Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday slammed
Mauritania for establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel
and termed the move as "detrimental to the world of Islam."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that under the
current sensitive circumstances of the region, such an act went
against the aspirations of the Palestinian people and those of the
Muslim states, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that undoubtedly the Israeli regime, by taking
advantage of such moves, will be emboldened to further advance its
expansionist objectives and trample on the rights of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Mauritania signed an agreement on the establishment
of full diplomatic relations in Washington on Thursday at a
ceremony attended by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>

CANBERRA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Sunday that it was too early for him to make personal
contact with new Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid.

"At an appropriate time, I'll initiate a personal contact,"
Howard told the Australian TV Nine Network.

and there's a degree of sensitivity, but the repair process has
begun and it is moving well," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the relationship with Indonesia had to be handled
in a way that looked towards a long term partnership but also
respected that the two had their differences.

<HEADLINE> $3Bln Burnt in Gas Flaring in Nigeria Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- An estimated three billion U.S.
dollars is being burnt yearly in gas flaring by all the oil
producing companies in Nigeria, the Guardian newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
About 400 barrels of crude oil equivalent is flared in gas form
in the country everyday, Chief Executive Officer of Dubri Oil
Nigeria Ltd. Imo Itsuehi said at an oil and gas seminar here last
week.
</P>
<P>
This amounts to eight million dollars everyday, making Nigeria
to top the list of gas flares in the world with about 80 to 90 per
cent of the country's gas being flared, said Itsuehi.
</P>
<P>
In order to tackle the problem, the Nigerian government,
jointly with nine major international oil companies, invested
about 3.8 billion dollars in a liquefied gas plant, which started
exporting gas to Europe last month.

<P>
MACAO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A four-day picture exhibition was
launched here Sunday afternoon to mark the 50-day countdown to
Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
On display are 194 pictures which feature the historical course
of Macao's, such as the negotiations on the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration and its signing moments, drafting the Macao Basic Law
and ensuing publicity activities, and selecting the chief
executive and officials of the Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR).
</P>
<P>
Many of the pictures have been shown in about a dozen cities in
the interior areas of China and proved to be rather appealing
among viewers.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal began talks about the question of Macao in
1985 and signed the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration in 1987. And
the signing started the 12-year transition period toward December
20 of 1999, when China will resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Macao.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Fail to Resolve Differences on WTO Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
the United States have failed at the recent summit to resolve
their differences on the agenda for the next round of global trade
talks scheduled for late November in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
A latest EU report said Sunday that EU Executive President
Romano Prodi "managed to edge closer to" U.S. President Bill
Clinton when they met in Washington on October 27 on the WTO
agenda, "but the much-hoped-for breakthrough did not emerge".
</P>
<P>
Although the EU-U.S. talks, first since Prodi was confirmed as
head of the European Commission, the EU's executive body, were
described as positive and constructive, and officials said the U.S.
and EU shared "the same views on most trade issues going into
Seattle", the EU's plans for a comprehensive set of negotiations
did not get the U.S. approval, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are now fears that the comprehensive approach the EU
argued for over the past three years could be jeopardized, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, a joint declaration issued at the end of the meeting
said there was a "desire to collaborate closely to bridge
remaining differences".
</P>
<P>
The two sides "agreed to strive to secure agreement in Seattle
to launch a new Round," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Many EU member states warned this week that the European
Commission's attempts to reach a common agenda with the U.S. could
undermine the whole process of the Millennium Round, the EU dubbed
name for the new round of WTO multilateral trade talks, according
to the report.

<HEADLINE> Samsonov Wins Table Tennis World Cup (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHONGSHAN, Guangdong Province, China, October 31 (Xinhua) --
World top-ranked Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus took a sweet revenge
for his loss to Werner Schlager three days ago, beating his rival
3-0 to snatch the men's World Cup table tennis final here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, who suffered his first-ever loss to the Austrian in a
group match on Thursday, played a consistent attacking game to
crush the world No. 10 player 23-21, 21-15, 21-10.
</P>
<P>
At 21-all in the first set, Schlager returned into net and then
failed to reach a block from Samsonov who was lucky enough to hit
the ball with the edge of his bat.
</P>
<P>
After winning the first set, Samsonov dominated the game with a
high-toss serves and consistent forehand and backhand attacking.
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky today," said Samsonov. "The game could have been
very difficult if I had lost the first set."
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky the other day, but not today. Anyway, I was beaten
convincingly," said Schlager, who pocketed 21,000 U.S. dollars
with Samsonov taking away 40,000.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua was shocked at Europeans'
improvement on their top spin backhands.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important discovery for the Chinese," said Cai. "
Europeans had long been using backhands to create chances for
forehand attacks, but now it has become a lethal weapon."
</P>
<P>
The best Chinese finisher in the World Cup was reigning world
and Olympic champion Liu Guoliang, who finished a joint fifth.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S., Britain for Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry on Sunday
slammed U.S. and British representatives at the U.N. Sanctions
Committee for blocking its four newly-signed contracts under the
U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry said that U.S. and
British envoys at the Sanctions Committee suspended four
contracts which Iraq signed under the fifth and sixth phases of
the oil-for-food deal during the committee's sessions held on
October 25-26.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. and British delegates
"premeditatedly" blocked the four new contracts for purchasing
oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
necessities for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys in
the Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
accomplish its humanitarian goals.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed harsh sanctions on Iraq to punish the Iraqi
government for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the sanctions have
crippled the country's economy, hitting the ordinary Iraqis
hardest.

<HEADLINE> China, Algeria Issue Joint Communique (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China and Algeria issued a
joint press communique calling for further strengthening of
bilateral relations, following a two-day state visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
During cordial and friendly talks between President Jiang and
his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the two sides
reached broad consensus after wide-ranging and in-depth
discussions on bilateral relations as well as international and
regional issues of common concern, and signed accords on economic,
technological and trade cooperation, the document noted.
</P>
<P>
Both sides held that President Jiang's visit to Algeria is of
historic significance to the bilateral relations at the turn of
millennium and that the successful visit will vigorously push
forward existing friendly cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the two sides are satisfied with the
healthy and steady growth of friendly bilateral cooperation based
on the five principles of peaceful co-existence over the past 40
years and more since the establishment of diplomatic relations,
and are ready to work together for stronger and broader
cooperation in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Given the huge potentials and bright prospects of economic and
trade cooperation between the two countries, the two sides will
draw upon on each other's experiences to make up for their
deficiencies and constantly explore new areas of mutually-
beneficial cooperation, while their governments will create
conditions and facilitate two-way trade and investment, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
In the document, Algeria reiterated that the government of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) is the sole legitimate
representative of the entire China and that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of the PRC. Algeria supports, as always, China's
cause of reunification and opposes any attempt by Taiwan to "re-
enter the United Nations" and the so-called "two-state theory"
aimed at splitting China.
</P>
<P>
China appreciated Algeria's stance and stressed that although
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits are yet to be reunified, the
status of Taiwan as part of China remains unchanged, as does the
status of China's sovereignty over Taiwan. This is an
indisputable fact recognized by the overwhelming majority of
countries in the world, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Western Sahara, the two sides stressed their
support for the U.N.- proposed solutions and the Houston agreement
as well as the efforts by the U.N. Secretary General in arranging
a free and just referendum for the Western Saharan people, seeking
peaceful solution to the conflicts and safeguarding regional
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that President Bouteflika has made efforts
for national reconciliation and restoration of domestic security
and stability, which are broadly endorsed by the Algerian people,
as clearly demonstrated by the referendum on September 16 this
year. China speaks highly of and fully supports the efforts by
President Bouteflika in consolidating security and stability of
Algeria and laying the foundation for national revival.
</P>
<P>
The two sides made positive comments on the coordination and
cooperation between the two countries in the international arena
of human rights, the communique said. They maintain that the
protection and development of human rights are a lofty cause of
mankind and that the international cause of human rights will
truly progress only if the universal principles of human rights
are integrated with the specific realities of each of the
countries.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that both sovereignty and human rights are sacred
and inviolable and the latter needs protection by the former. As a
matter of fact, it is not that human rights transcend sovereignty.
Rather, without sovereignty, there would be no human rights. Any
infringement upon the sovereignty of other countries under the
excuse of humanity and human rights are drastic retrogression of
human society. Countries should cooperate in the field of human
rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on increasing understanding and narrowing
differences through dialogue and opposing confrontation in the
area of human rights or interference in other countries' internal
affairs under the pretext of human rights. They are determined to
continue with the efforts to protect the rights of a vast number
of developing countries and to promote the healthy growth of the
international cause of human rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 27 (Xinhua) --A 18-year-old Australian
yachtsman Jesse Martin arrived home in Melbourne Sunday afternoon
after a 50,000 km world solo journey.
</P>
<P>
AAP said he was the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe
non-stop and unassisted.
</P>
<P>
He started off on 6 December last year.
</P>

He was greeted by thousands of cheering spectators at the

<TEXT>
<P>
In the communique, the two sides welcomed the latest
development in the Middle East peace process and maintained that a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace serves not only the
fundamental interests of the people of all countries in the region,
but is also conducive to the peace and development of the world.
</P>
<P>
The international community has obligation and duty to help
relevant parties in the Middle East overcome difficulties and
remove obstacles so as to advance the peace process. China and
Algeria will, as always, support the Middle East peace process and
contribute to the realization of peace in the region, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries noted that although Africa made enormous
contribution to mankind's civilization, colonialism in history not
only enslaved African people, but also destroyed the ancient and
brilliant civilization in the continent. The rapid development in
the world's political and economic situation has posed serious
challenge to the African people as well, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Africa, though hindered by unfavorable factors of history and
reality, is rich in natural resources and possesses huge potential
of development. Africa is entering a historical, new phase of
seeking peace, stability and development as African countries are
working hard looking for a political model and development path
suited to their national conditions, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Vast numbers of African countries constitute an important force
on the international political stage. World peace cannot be
achieved without the stability in Africa, nor can a global
prosperity be realized without the development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The two countries believed that African people, who have made
the historic stride by winning political liberation and realizing
social progress after long and arduous struggle, can rely on their
own efforts and the help of international society to gradually
achieve economic emancipation and take another stride of social
progress in Africa, thus making new and enormous contribution to
human peace, development, civilization and progress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side highly praised and strongly supported
President Bouteflika for his important efforts in defending Africa
's peace, stability as well as the rights and benefits of
development, which China believes will yield positive results in
the future, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides maintained that the world is undergoing a profound
change, with continued development of political multi-polarization
and economic globalization. While the international situation is
moving towards detente in general, unstable factors still exist.
Peace and development will still be the main themes in the next
century, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed that countries, big or small, rich or
poor, strong or weak, are equal members of the international
community and are entitled to choosing political system and
developing path according to their own national realities.
</P>
<P>
They point out that the five principles of peaceful co-
existence, namely mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial
integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful
coexistence, should be norms of behavior governing new
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides appealed to the international community to pay
attention to the challenges economic globalization poses to
developing countries and listen to their voice. Developed
countries should take more action to earnestly help developing
countries, the African countries in particular, to strengthen
their economic security and enhance their ability to develop.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the international community should strive
for the establishment of a just and rational international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang invited President Bouteflika to visit China
next year and Bouteflika accepted the invitation with pleasure,
the communique said.

<P>
MACAO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Local Chinese-language newspapers

Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News noted in a commentary that Macao is
returning to the motherland in 50 days.
</P>
<P>
It said that during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent
visit to Portugal, the leaders of the two countries reached
consensus on some remaining questions related to Macao's
transition.
</P>
<P>
"News that leaders of both countries will take part in the
handover ceremony in Macao adds joy to the 50-day countdown and
boosts people's confidence in the future," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the overall framework of executive authorities,
legislature and judiciary of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) has been completed, and preparations for the
establishment of the SAR is well under way, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also pointed out that a lot of work has to be done in
the run-up to Macao's return. The officials of the SAR government
must get familiar with the affairs of the SAR as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In addition, certain quantities of necessary laws have to be
discussed and passed at the First Legislative Council of the SAR.
The laws shall go into effect right after the founding of the
Macao SAR in the early morning of December 20.
</P>
<P>
The Va Kio newspaper said in a commentary that on the occasion
of the 50-day countdown to Macao's return, Macao people are
relieved to see that transition matters are making progress in an
orderly way and the residents have greater confidence in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled celebrations organized by local mass
organizations on Sunday reveal people's eager expectation for the
return, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Si Man Pou newspaper said that after Macao's return to the
motherland, the principles of "one country, two systems" and "
Macao people governing Macao" will be carried out in the SAR. "
Following Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Macao's return
will be another step in the reunification process of the country,"
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"After its return, Macao's prosperity will surely be achieved
with the strong backing of the motherland," the commentary said.

<P>
CAIRO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian security forces have
arrested six members of a secret radical Islamic group, the
national daily Al-Akhbar reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The arrested, who were not identified, belong to the Takfir

</P>
<P>
The detainees have been referred to the Supreme State Security
Prosecution, and Prosecutor General Hesham Saraya has ordered that
they be taken into custody for 15 days pending interrogation, the
Arabic-language newspaper said.
</P>

They were accused of joining the secret illegal organization,
hindering government agencies from performing their duties,
violating personal freedom and social peace, and assuming
terrorist acts to achieve their objectives.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has been cracking down on Islamic
extremists since 1992 when the radicals launched an insurgency in
an attempt to topple the secular government and install a strict
Islamic rule. The authorities have arrested and jailed hundreds of
Islamic militants.

<HEADLINE> Annual Apparel/Textile Show Opens in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The annual apparel show of the
Bangladesh Garment Manufactures and Exporters Association (BGMEA)
opened here on Sunday to promote export of the country's apparel
and textiles products.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Bangladesh Apparel and Textile Exposition
(BATEXPO), the biggest yearly exposition in the textile and
apparel sector in the country which has been held annually since
1989, is aimed at attracting overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven companies, including eight foreign participants
from Pakistan, India and China, are taking part in the exhibition,
which was opened by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the Sonargaon
Hotel in downtown Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the BATEXPO, Hasina said her
country's ready-made garment sector, which "earns valuable foreign
exchange for us and contributes to poverty alleviation through
employment generation," "plays an important role towards economic
development of Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, BGMEA President Anisur Rahman
Sinha pledged to increase the export from the ready-made garment
sector to 10 billion dollars in the next three years, which he
said "will bring significant changes to our country."
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to take steps to keep country's two sea
ports operational seven days a week along with banks and customs
branch inside the ports, so as to carry out export and import
activities of the sector uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
A leaflet distributed by the BGMEA said the textile sector as
the largest manufacturing sector "occupies a very important
position in Bangladesh," contributing about 5 percent to the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) and around 50 percent of
the industrial employment.
</P>
<P>
The garment sector earned some 4 billion dollars in the 1998-99
fiscal year by exporting products to 90 countries and regions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The sector accounts for 40 percent of the manufacturing value
addition and contributes about 70 percent of Bangladesh's total
exports, according to the BGMEA.
</P>
<P>
During the show, there would be three seminars on different
issues concerning the garment industry, and a fashion show will be
held on November 1, followed by a BGMEA night of cultural
programs.
</P>
<P>
A four-day exhibition last year attracted a significant number
of buyers from the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy,
India, Japan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia and other countries and
regions, and helped generate business worth 43.52 million U.S.
dollars from spot orders and 3.12 million dollars from stock lots,
the BGMEA said.
</P>
<P>
Ready-made garments, growing at an annual rate of more than 20
percent over the past few years, have become the country's largest
foreign exchange earner, which along with the textile industry
contribute about 70 percent of the country's foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 3,000 garment manufacturers and exporters
in Bangladesh, employing nearly 1.5 million workers.

COLOMBO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Sunday expressed her sadness over the sudden death of
Minister of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure and
veteran trade union leader S. Thondaman.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply saddened to hear of the sudden demise of Hon. S.
Thondaman, a senior member of my cabinet and a great leader of the
plantation workers of Sri Lanka," she said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Thondaman "worked closely with me in the past five years,
always actively with immense maturity and loyalty to our
government," she said.
</P>
<P>
Thondaman, 86, died Saturday night after he suffered a heart
attack earlier in the day.
</P>

Thondaman's death is a blow to the ruling People's Alliance

Kumaratunga in the presidential polls slated for December 21 this
year.
</P>
<P>
On the directive of the president, Thondaman will be accorded a
state funeral on November 3.

Sunday for a trilateral summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, which
he hopes will give a new impetus to peace talks.
</P>

efforts to convince the U.S. to put greater pressure on Russia to

</P>
<P>

President Hosni Mubarak and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad
discussed the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process. And the coming days will witness a series of
Egyptian-Syrian contacts and meetings in both Cairo and Damascus
at all levels.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mandela Denies Reports on Derailing Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela has denied reports that he had bought a
home in Cape Town for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and that he
had received a large amount of money from Libya to pay for the
trial of his former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"These stories are totally without foundation and false and
appear to have a single-minded objective, and that is to derail
the peace process in the Middle East," Mandela said in a statement
issued Saturday by his attorney Ismail Ayob.
</P>
<P>
Mandela suggested in the statement that the claims, which
followed his five-nation Middle East trip last week, were an
attempt by extremist elements to discredit him in his efforts to
help move forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We know who they are but we don't want to mention them," the
Sunday Independent newspaper quoted the former president as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told the paper Saturday that he knew the groups
responsible for spreading rumors about him but he did not want to
disclose who they were for fear of jeopardizing the plan, which he
said had won the support of Arab and world leaders.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the reports are part of a global
disinformation campaign to discredit him as he is poised for a
breakthrough in the Middle East peace process, the Sunday
Independent said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had won the backing of President Hafez al Assad
of Syria, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and other Arab leaders for a three-point plan to
achieve a comprehensive Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the plan, Israel would withdraw from all the Arab
lands it had conquered in the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Arab states, notably Syria which does not
recognize Israel, would issue a declaration recognizing the
sovereignty of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The third component would be the creation of an international
commission made up of Arab, Israeli and other members which would
oversee "final status" issues, such as the final boundaries of a
Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Pirates Seized In South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Police in south China's
coastal city of Shantou, Guangdong Province, have arrested 10
Indonesian pirates who hijacked a Thai oil tanker off Teiman
Island near Singapore.
</P>
<P>
On the night of June 17, marine police patrolling the Nan'ao
Island near Shantou of Guangdong spotted the tanker.
</P>
<P>
The suspicious foreign vessel "Zhengyang No. 1" had no logbook
or documents for the 2,000 tons diesel on board, it was found.
</P>
<P>
"The hull was covered with fresh paint erasing the name of the
vessel," patrol police said, adding that "It looked like a foreign
pirate ship."
</P>
<P>
During police interrogation, the gang leader Atan Naim
confessed that his crew were Indonesian. Atan said that his crew
attacked the Thai oil tanker "SIAM XANXAI" in the early morning of
June 9. The oil tanker carried diesel oil loaded in Singapore the
day before and was on its way back to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The pirates replete with knives and sabres approached the Thai
oil tanker in two motorboats. They took a Thai crewman hostage who
could speak English and drove the other 15 crew members off the
tanker.
</P>
<P>
The gang leader said they destroyed all documents, repainted
the tanker and then tried to navigate the tanker along the
Malaysian-Indonesian-Taiwan route. But they were caught on June 17
when they arrived near Nan'ao of Shantou, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The International Criminal Police Organization notified police
in Shantou that the 15 Thai crewmen were released safely near the
coast of Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Macao Newspapers Hail 50-day Countdown to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Local Chinese-language newspapers
carried commentaries on Sunday marking the 50-day countdown to
Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News noted in a commentary that Macao is
returning to the motherland in 50 days.
</P>
<P>
It said that during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent
visit to Portugal, the leaders of the two countries reached
consensus on some remaining questions related to Macao's
transition.
</P>
<P>
"News that leaders of both countries will take part in the
handover ceremony in Macao adds joy to the 50-day countdown and
boosts people's confidence in the future," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the overall framework of executive authorities,
legislature and judiciary of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) has been completed, and preparations for the
establishment of the SAR is well under way, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also pointed out that a lot of work has to be done in
the run-up to Macao's return. The officials of the SAR government
must get familiar with the affairs of the SAR as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In addition, certain quantities of necessary laws have to be
discussed and passed at the First Legislative Council of the SAR.
The laws shall go into effect right after the founding of the
Macao SAR in the early morning of December 20.
</P>
<P>
The Va Kio newspaper said in a commentary that on the occasion
of the 50-day countdown to Macao's return, Macao people are
relieved to see that transition matters are making progress in an
orderly way and the residents have greater confidence in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled celebration actiivities organized by local mass
organizations on Sunday reveal people's eager expectation for the
return, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Si Man Pou newspaper said that after Macao's return to the
motherland, the principles of "one country, two systems" and "
Macao people governing Macao" will be carried out in the SAR. "
Following Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Macao's return
will be another step in the reunification process of the country,"
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"After its return, Macao's prosperity will surely be achieved
with the strong backing of the motherland," the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> China to Have First Group of Licensed Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China will get its first group
of licensed doctors after scores are posted from a national
medical exam to be taken by 300,000 Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The examination, which includes a written test in late November
and practical skills demonstrations which are currently underway,
is expected to lay the foundation for a medical licensing and
registration system in China.
</P>
<P>
For five decades, China has run a healthcare system that doesn'
t issue any national unified license to medical professionals.
Medical school graduates usually acquire the permission to treat
patients after one-year internship and then the evaluation of the
qualifications, which are conducted by local health
administrations.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said China's existing set-up, even though it
has proved successful in improving the overall health of the
Chinese, has made it easy for quack doctors to profit from giving
unauthorized medical care.
</P>
<P>
"Many who practice medicine are not qualified, especially in
rural and remote areas which have less access to medical services,
" said Wu Mingjiang, director of the department of medical
administration under the Ministry of Health. He acknowledged that
the downslide in medical services in recent years has given rise
to numerous complaints.
</P>
<P>
The written test will be divided into four categories: clinical
skills, Chinese medicine, stomatology and public health. Both
medical practitioners and assistant medical practitioners will be
tested, according to the National Medical Test Center.
</P>
<P>
Testing for practical skills include presentations of surgical
techniques and patient diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
Until now, China has followed the Law on Medical Practitioners,
which stipulates that those who pass a qualification test and are
registered have the right to practice medicine.
</P>
<P>
The examination "is an important measure to clean up the
medical services market. The crackdown on illegal and fake doctors
has to be stepped up," said Wu Mingjiang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has more than 1.5 million doctors
and some 460,000 medical assistants. However, the number of new
physicians in recent years has far exceeded the number of
graduates from medical colleges, which suggests that many
unqualified people are practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
A senior legislator also admitted that cases of unauthorized
medical services have been on the rise in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"These illegal activities seriously endanger the people's
health must be stamped out," said Zhang Xuwu, vice-chairman of the
Ninth National People's Congress Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
Even after acquiring the necessary qualifications, all doctors
will be urged to improve their professional skills and strictly
adhere to medical ethics. Violators may have their licenses
suspended, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"The people's health should always be the top priority, so we
won't allow unqualified persons to infiltrate the ranks of medical
practitioners," stressed Health Minister Zhang Wenkang.

TAIYUAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Overseas business people are
pouring increasing amounts of funds into the inland province of
Shanxi in north China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province has, to date, actually
utilized 2.76 billion US dollars, and the figure for the 1992-1998
period was a dozen times that of the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 overseas businesses from 42 countries and regions
including Hong Kong, the United States, Taiwan and Japan have
invested in the province, a local source said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities note that Shanxi, at the junction of central,
eastern and western China, boasts abundant coal and electricity
resources, low-price labor force and land, a solid industrial base
and a large market, all very attractive to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The province will have even greater opportunities, as the
central government is now emphasizing the development of central
and western areas, they say.
</P>
<P>
At present, large overseas-funded projects in Shanxi are mainly
in the areas of manufacturing, power supply, services, real estate,
building materials, transport and posts and telecommunications.

<P>
The office added that in Oslo, a two-hour trilateral meeting
has been scheduled and Clinton has also planned to meet
separately with Barak and Arafat for one hour each.
</P>
<P>
All parties concerned are lowering the expectations for the
summit, but Barak told Israel television Channel 2 Saturday night
that he hopes the summit will give new impetus to peace talks
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said he is going to Norway "in expectation and hope that
together with Arafat and Clinton we can agree on the direction
and mode in which to progress further."
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed by Barak and
Arafat in Egypt earlier September, the two sides have to reach the
outlines of a final-status agreement by next February and a final
peace treaty in September the same year.
</P>
<P>
With the deadlines approaching, the two sides have to speed up
their peace talks to solve such thorny issues as the status of
Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements, the Palestinian refugees,
borders and water resources under the new peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo summit, political observers here believe, will hammer
out the aggressive timetable for the final-status talks, which is
considered as vital to moving the process forward.
</P>
<P>
There have been some unconfirmed reports that Clinton plans to
host another summit in Washington before the February deadline to
ensure progress.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the Palestinians reportedly intend to request
Clinton to maintain a direct presence throughout the final-status
talks, since there is not much time left till the February
deadline for a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Another issue to be addressed immediately at the request of the
Palestinian side is Jewish settlements and Arafat is reportedly to
call at the summit for a complete halt to all settlement
activities as a prerequisite to the upcoming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Settlements are destructive to peace. All types of
settlements must be stopped, as well as the confiscation of land
so we can launch successful talks," Arafat told the International
Socialist Committee Conference in Ramallah on Saturday.

<P>
YINCHUAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Xihaigu Prefecture,
a drought-stricken area in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, have grown 66,700 hectares of grass and nearly
200,000 hectares of trees.
</P>
<P>
This effort has not only improved the region's ecological
environment, but also has increased profits for local farmers,
according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Grass-growing can also make me rich. I raised more than 60
head of cattle on two hectares of grass annually in the past few
years, and now I don't need to worry about food and spending,"
said the wife of Bai Wengui, a well-known grass-grower in Wangtang
village in the county of Haiyuan.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 households in the village have grown grass, and
their average annual income now surpasses 300,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
People in other counties in Xihaigu have also shown great zeal
in planting trees and growing grass. A total of 50,000 hectares of
cash forests, including walnut and apricot trees, have brought
huge economic returns to farmers and herdsmen in Pengyang County.
</P>
<P>
Another example is in Jingyuan County, where the tree-covered
acreage has reached 1,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Wushu Athletes Hampered by Financial Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- A financial shortage is likely
to stop 12 Indonesian Wushu athletes from competing in this year's
world championship scheduled to begin in Hong Kong on Monday,
Indonesian newspaper Jakarta Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wushu coach from Jakarta Amos Panjaitan said that six athletes
from Jakarta could withdraw from the championship because the
Indonesian Wushu Association (WI) could not afford to pay for
their transportation and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the National Sports Council (KONI) would
give them some financial support. "We won't get support from WI
because we already know its financial status. We are hoping
support will come from KONI. But as of Friday, we have not
received any response from KONI," said Amos, who is also in charge
of athlete development at WI.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Wushu training center Rahmad Setiadi also
complained of the fund shortage, which could prevent him from
sending his daughter Susiana to the world championship. He said
he would probably use his own money.
</P>
<P>
WI's chairman Mediteransjah told KONI chairman Wismoyo
Arismunandar that the 12 wushu athletes comprised two from North
Sumatera, three from East Java, one from West Java and six from
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
This year's world championship is expected to be attended by
athletes from 77 countries and regions. It is Indonesia's third
appearance at the world championship.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Zainab won a silver medal in an earlier world
championships.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo said that the Wushu athletes should prepare for their
targets in the international championship.
</P>
<P>
"I need to know their preparation, including their target. I
don't want you to merely report your schedule and wait for my
instructions," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Wismoyo failed to mention whether KONI would give financial
support to the athletes.

<HEADLINE> Millions Face Famine Threat in Kenya: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's national strategic
grain reserves are so depleted that the government can provide
relief food for only 10 percent out of the five million Kenyans
threatened by famine, the Sunday Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Office of the President and the Relief and
Rehabilitation Department reveal that at least seven out of 10
residents are in dire need of relief food in Moyale and Marsabit
districts in Eastern Province and Garissa District in North
Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that 31 districts in the east African country,
as against the previously said 21 districts, are in dire need of
food. The hardest hit districts are in the arid and semi-arid
north and east of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The strategic grain reserve had only 35,000 tons in August
which is to be distributed as relief food and the National Cereals
and Produces Board held an additional 27,000 tons of commercial
stock, the Sunday Nation said.
</P>
<P>
It added that an inter-ministerial committee on famine had
already been formed and had held talks with donors and
non-governmental organizations over the looming famine.
</P>
<P>
Zachariah Cheruiyot, permanent secretary in the Office of the
President, estimates that half a million tons of maize will have
to be imported from next March to meet the shortfall, almost 25
percent of the national average yearly production.

 International Development said that the Kenyan government may be

SEOUL, October 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korean challenger Paek Jong-

Lakva contested the judges' 2-1 decision against him with a sit-

It was Paek's 21st victory including 18 knockouts, against no

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Opposition Calls Strike Over City Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP)-led opposition has called a dawn-to-dusk hartal (general
strike) across the country for November 1 to protest what it
called the Election Commission's unilateral declaration of the
poll schedule for three city corporations.
</P>
<P>
The BNP and its allies Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islam and Islamic
Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity Front) demanded the resignation of
the government and parliamentary polls before other elections.
</P>
<P>
The hartal decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the
liaison committee of the opposition alliance here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the government of destroying democracy, parliament and
election rules, the committee said no elections under the present
government and the Election Commission could be fair and impartial
as the incumbent Chief Election Commissioner has become
"subservient" to the government.
</P>
<P>
The liaison committee called for canceling the election
schedule and warned that otherwise the government would be
responsible for any eventualities.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia on Saturday called upon the
people to make Monday's countrywide hartal an all-out success to
thwart the government's "conspiracy" to hold the city elections
unilaterally keeping the opposition off the race.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Khaleda Zia said that "the government wants to
push the country into a state of conflict and chaos."
</P>
<P>
Reacting sharply to the opposition's anti-election stance,
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday urged the people to protect
their voting rights by joining the forthcoming city-corporation
elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections to Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna city
corporations have been scheduled for December 6. The ruling Awami
League strategists believe the city elections would be a "test
case" for the party in facing the opposition agitation. Results of
the city polls without the major opposition parties in the race
would strengthen the Awami League's base in the big cities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Stars Hold Farewell Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian badminton Olympic
champions Susi Susanti and Alan Budikusuma officially said goodbye
to fans in a farewell match at Senayan Indoor Stadium here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Susi wan an Olympic gold medal and a bronze medal in her
illustrious career. Her husband Alan also won an Olympic gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
Susi and Alan, who were married in February this year, tied 1-1
with Hermawan Susanto and Sarwendah Kusumawardhani, who are also
married, in the farewell match.
</P>
<P>
The match was jointly organized by the Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI), private television station RCTI and the print
media the Jakarta Post, Kompas, Bola and Go.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Susi and Alan managed to beat Hermawan and
Sarwendah 15-5.
</P>
<P>
But in the second game, the Olympic couple started to lose
stamina in face of the hard work by Hermawan and Sarwendah, who
finally won 15-12. The deciding game was not featured.
</P>
<P>
Both Susi and Alan said they have stopped playing badminton for
good.
</P>
<P>
"I will concentrate on my family, although I may help my
successors by giving advice or criticism as needed," Susi was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Susi and Alan each received a gold medallion and ring from PBSI,
which were handed over by chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo. They also
received cellular phones from sponsor Samsung.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 badminton lovers were in the 4,000-seat stadium.
Nearly 500 fans crowded both Susi and Alan for autographs and
photographs.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Jose Carreras and Sarah Brightman's song Amigos
Para Siempre (You'll always be my friends) -- Susi and Alan's
wedding theme song -- performed by Ruth Sahanaya, they both left
the stadium cheered by fans.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo, State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Mahadi
Sinambela, National Sports Council vice-chairman Arie Sudewo and
PBSI executive director Karsono saw the hero and heroine off.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Subagyo said: "It is difficult to find women
shuttlers as good as Susi because they have yet to equal her
international performances. But PBSI is happy with the match and
we'll try to make it a tradition to appreciate our athletes."
</P>
<P>
The match was followed by an auction of Susi and Alan rackets.
Masters of ceremony Dono and Indro announced the organizers
collected 21.1 million rupiah (3,103 U.S. dollars), which will be
distributed to refugees throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Algerian, Chinese Presidents Vow to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President Jiang Zemin
and his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika Saturday pledged
to strengthen bilateral cooperation with an eye to building a
friendly Sino-Algerian relationship oriented toward the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a grand banquet held at the People's Palace in
honor of Jiang, Bouteflika said both countries should develop
bilateral and multilateral exchanges and cooperation in an all-
round manner and conduct frequent dialogues in a bid to
consolidate their traditional friendship and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
He said Algeria has been greatly honored with Jiang's visit,
the first ever by a Chinese head of state to the country, which
will surely boost bilateral ties, cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China occupies a very special position
in the hearts of Algerian citizens, as neither the geographical
distance nor the historical or cultural differences could bar the
flowers of Algerian-Chinese solidarity and friendship from
blossoming.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese revolution and Algerian revolution
had accelerated the historical process under their respective
special conditions. Soon after Algeria consolidated its
independence, China extended its firm support and aid, nurturing
the Sino-Algerian solidarity and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Algeria and the first generation of leaders of the People's
Republic of China laid a solid foundation for the long-term
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Jiang said it is a set policy of the Chinese
government to consolidate and develop its friendly and cooperative
ties with Algeria continuously.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries should proceed from the long-term
interests of their peoples and unswervingly push bilateral bonds
for a steady and comprehensive growth from the strategic vantage
point.
</P>
<P>
He also called on both countries to tap fully their immense
potentials in the cooperation and development of the economy,
trade and science and technology, raise their cooperation to a new
high and promote the common growth of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that both sides should strengthen consultations and
coordination on international issues and make new contributions to
the defense of the rights of developing countries and to the
safeguard of world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also called for strengthening mutual
exchanges at various levels between the two countries so as to
foster a more solid foundation for the development of Sino-
Algerian bonds in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
He said that Algeria, as a major country in the Maghreb, the
Arab world, Africa and the non-alignment movement, particularly as
president of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), has made
unremitting efforts to defend the rights of the developing
countries, strengthen south-south cooperation and build a just and
rational new world order.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has also made positive contributions to pushing for a
fair settlement of the issues of the Middle East and to
safeguarding regional and world peace and stability, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president reiterated that China advocates building
a just and rational new international order on the basis of the
five principles of peaceful coexistence and other widely
acknowledged norms of international relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that international conflicts should be settled through
dialogues, negotiations and other peaceful efforts, instead of
resorting to force or threatening to use force.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community, particularly the developed
countries, are obliged to listen to the voice of the developing
nations, pay attention to the problems facing them and take
practical and effective measures to raise the levels of economic
and social development in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Saturday on the fifth leg of his six-nation
tour of Europe, Africa and Asia. The last stop of the visit is
Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> American Goebel Upstages Favorites at Skate America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- American Tim Goebel made
history by becoming the first skater to nail three quadruple jumps
in competition on Saturday at Skate America figure skating
championships.
</P>
<P>
Goebel, the first American to complete a quadruple in
competition last year, hit a quad salchow-triple toe loop
combination, a quad toe loop and a solo quad salchow.
</P>
<P>
But flaws in the rest of Goebel's routine and a start from
third place after Friday's short program allowed two-time world
champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia to hold onto first place and
take the men's title.
</P>
<P>
Three-time world champion Elvis Stojko from Canada, who was the
first skater ever to land a quad in competition, took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
American Michelle Kwan outclassed the women's field and cruised
to her fourth Skate America title in six tries.
</P>
<P>
Kwan so impressed the judges with her all new routine that the
two-time world champion drew a perfect 6.0 from the Austrian judge
despite a fall.
</P>
<P>
It was the 42nd career 6.0 for the 19-year-old Olympic silver
medalist but the first one given for a performance in which she
fell. Kwan landed six perfect triple jumps but fell on the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
Skate America '99 is the first of six stops on the Grand Prix
series, which culminates with the top performers competing in the
final in Lyon, France in January.
</P>
<P>
Canadian newcomers Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, competing
internationally for only the third time, turned in a magnificent
performance to capture the pairs title.
</P>
<P>
Twice world champions and Olympic silver-medalists Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia made multiple mistakes
and had to settle for the third place behind France's Sarah
Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy also upset
the Russians to take their first Grand Prix win in the ice dance
competition.
</P>
<P>
Russians Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh failed to keep the
lead after the first two rounds and had to settle for the silver
medal. American champions Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev were
third.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Govt Speeds Up Housing Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 31 (Xinhua) -- In the Philippines, there is
still a housing backlog for 3.8 million households nationwide,
which contributes much to the dropping popularity rate of
Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
That's the reason why Estrada cited recently once and again the
urgent need to put a roof over the heads of the poor Filipinos,
about 30 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
The measures which are being taken by the government include
strengthening the leadership, facilitating the purchasing of
housing units by the poor, and encouraging the private sector to
invest in the housing program.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the leadership, Estrada has designated himself
"housing czar" and created the Presidential Commission on Mass
Housing which he chairs, to personally oversee the speedy
implementation of the housing program.
</P>
<P>
He also declared the housing program as a centerpiece program
of his "pro-poor and pro-business" administration. According to
the government's plan, about 350,000 units will be built every
year for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The five-year program, the president said, would be the
foundation for a "sustainable and viable housing system for the
country."
</P>
<P>
To encourage more poor Filipinos to purchase housing units, the
government lowered the interest rates for socialized housing from
16 percent to nine percent and extend the payment period from 25
to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
These will cover units worth 180,000 pesos (4,500 dollars) and
below, which are being offered to the very poor.
</P>
<P>
The government has also approved the launching of socialized
housing bonds and the opening of a multi-window lending scheme for
low-cost housing to help finance the construction of thousands of
homes in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, socialized housing refers to units costing
below 180,000 pesos; economic or low-cost housing, from 180,000
pesos to 225,000 pesos (5,625 dollars); and medium-cost, between
225,000 pesos and 500,000 pesos (12,500 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Units costing between 500,000 pesos and 4 million pesos
(100,000 dollars) are upscale housing, which cater for the middle
and upper classes.
</P>
<P>
Another major measure taken by the government is to undertake
innovations in the financial system to attract the private sector
to assume a prominent role in housing finance and delivery.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the need for a strong guarantee system to attract
the private housing developers, the government is pushing Congress
to approve additional capitalization for the Home Insurance
Guarantee Corporation (HIGC) from 2 billion pesos (50 million
dollars) to 50 billion pesos (1.25 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
With an increased guarantee capacity of up to 20 times the
capital, the proposed capital hike will give the HIGC a guarantee
window of as much as 1 trillion pesos (25 billion dollars) in five
years.
</P>
<P>
The increased guarantee capacity of the HIGC will mean a larger
guarantee fund for banks and other financial institutions who
provide housing loans, including low-cost housing, to the public.
</P>
<P>
However, as some analysts pointed out, the efforts of the
government to solve the country's housing problem still face some
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
For example, with the country's population growth rate of 2.8
percent, some 1.5 million Filipinos are added to the population
every year, thus exacerbating the housing backlog.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is lack of both public and private funds that
are channeled exclusively for housing. A total of 941,600
households are in need of socialized housing, which means they can
only afford houses worth 180,000 pesos and below.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most serious challenge faced by the government is
how to prevent housing developers from committing anomaly in the
government's housing program.
</P>
<P>
That's why President Estrada warned recently that his
administration "will not let any anomaly in the housing program go
unpunished, especially if it will inflict harm on the poor."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 31 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
continued its upward movement and rose to 2.84 percent for the
week that ended on October 16, mainly due to the indirect impact
of the recent 35 percent hike in diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, the annual rate of
inflation, based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI), recorded an
increase of a 0.33 percentage points during the week to 2.84
percent from 2.51 percent in the previous week and 8.10 percent
during the corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
The rising trend in inflation is likely to persist in the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Put Forward Parliamentary Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga is planning a snap parliamentary election soon after
the December 21 presidential poll, official radio said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that she made this disclosure while talking to
villagers at Hewaheta in central Sri Lanka over a video
conferencing facility.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no word on exactly when the parliamentary
election will be held.
</P>
<P>
The sitting parliament can continue till August 16 next year
when it would stand automatically dissolved. But the president can
dissolve parliament earlier if she deems fit.
</P>
<P>
On October 20, Kumaratunga decided to hold the presidential
election in two to three months, about 10 months ahead of the
scheduled November 2000.
</P>
<P>
Political sources here believed Kumaratunga will call an early
parliamentary poll if she wins the presidential election to take
maximum advantage of the victory.
</P>
<P>
But if she loses, the successor will have to decide how long
the incumbent parliament should continue, they said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the president's pronouncement could well be a
strategy to ensure that all her parliamentarians work hard to
secure her reelection.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tapioca Growers' Protest Drags on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The protest by tapioca growers
in front of Thailand's Government House is dragging on, as the
government and the farmers failed to reach an agreement on the
price issue, state television reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the government had offered to buy 1.5
million tons of tapioca pellet to shore up the price at a price of
0.85 baht (2.18 U.S. cents) a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
However, the farmers asked for a price guarantee of 1.2 baht
(3.08 cents) per kilogram, saying the production cost was at 0.95
baht (2.4 cents) a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between the government and the leaders of the
protesting farmers on the prices hit a snag Saturday as both sides
refused to listen to each other.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the farmers said the government lacked
sincerity in addressing the protesters' demand, while government
officials voiced regret that their sincerity had gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
The farmers, camping in front of the Government House, have
urged the government to give a clear answer to the issue before
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Many of the protesters have returned to their hometowns in the
northeast of the country to summon more farmers to join the
protest.
</P>
<P>
The protest has been one of the issues coalition partner Chart
Pattana Party has used to put pressure on coalition leader, the
Democrat Party, pending a likely early general election.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who is also leader of the
Democrat Party, said he was confident his government would resolve
the tapioca issue and mend relations with Chart Pattana.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian Inflation Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Prices peaked in October in
Ecuador, which meant a 4.2 percent inflation for that month,
against 1.8 percent in September, according to data from the
National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated inflation in this country reached 43.1 percent
and the annual index stood at 47.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The group that contributed the most to the soaring inflation in
October was foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco (0.98 percent),
followed by transports (0.84 percent), clothing and footwear (0.69)
percent and entertainment and culture (0.45 percent).
</P>
<P>
INEC Director German Rojas said that the inflation rise was
basically caused by the rise of the U.S. dollar in the exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
The official warned that if the devaluation of the country's
currency, the sucre, continues, Ecuador could step into a process
of hyper-inflation.

<HEADLINE> Good Results In Knowledge Innovation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Good results have been reported
in the pilot work of the State Knowledge Innovation Project Since
it was implemented in June of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the goals
of the project cover reforming management and distribution systems
and introducing more people with ability.
</P>
<P>
According to the pilot work of the project, the CAS will try to
reach the world's advanced level in some frontier research fields
and strategic scientific directions within five to ten years, said
Lu Yongxiang, president of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural technology is high on the list of the innovation
agenda the CAS has set for the 21st Century, and the other goals
include population and health, energy, new materials, information
and automation, space science and technology, ecology and
environment, earth science, and major cross-field subjects.
</P>
<P>
The academy has selected brain science, nanometer science and
technology, quantum physics and information, biological
information and other 100 frontier scientific fields.
</P>
<P>
It will also launch a group of major projects which have the
possibility to produce impressive social and economic results.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the smooth implementation of the project's pilot
work, the CAS has decided to readjust the organization structure
and change the management system to solving long-existing problems
that hold the scientific and technological progress.
</P>
<P>
The CAS has combined mathematics, life sciences and other basic
science institutes into larger organizations to reduce
administrative work and strengthen cooperation. It has organized
institutes and enterprises to form innovation centers for
promoting the industrialization of scientific findings.
</P>
<P>
In the field of resources and the environment, the CAS has
created three innovation centers in Beijing, southwest China and
northwest China, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The academy encourages researchers to establish companies with
their scientific inventions or appoints them as leaders of high-
tech enterprises. It also helped some of the institutes become
enterprises or intermediaries between research organizations and
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The CAS will take some important measures to attract good
leading scientists in some fields, and select and reorganize the
original scientific staff at the academy.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 6,000 scientific workers have been chosen to
enter the knowledge innovation project. The CAS is going to
introduce 300 to 600 outstanding scientists and scholars through a
special project and 100 young scientists have already come back
from overseas to work at the CAS.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Minister Dies of Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Minister of
Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure and veteran trade
union leader Saumyamoorthy Thondaman died Saturday night after he
suffered a heart attack earlier in the day, press reports said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Thondaman, 86, who was also the leader of the Ceylon Workers
Congress (CWC), was due to address a party conference at Nuwara
Eliya in central Sri Lanka Saturday morning to decide its stand on
the presidential election on December 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But he suffered a sudden heart attack on Saturday morning and
was admitted to a local hospital before being airlifted to a
hospital in suburban Colombo, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The doctors and and other medical staff in the hospital battled
unsuccessfully to save Thondaman's life, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The CWC, a close ally of the ruling People's Alliance (PA)
headed by the incumbent President Chandrika Kumaratunga, has
already decided to support the candidature of Kumaratunga at the
forthcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Thondaman, who joined the former Indian Workers Congress, had
worked hard to win citizenship for nearly 500,000 plantation
workers of Indian origin.
</P>
<P>
Thondaman's death is a blow to the PA government as he was
expected to play a key role in the crucial polls in mustering the
support of the Indian Tamil voters in favor of President
Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
On the directive of the president, Thondaman will be accorded a
state funeral on November 3.

<HEADLINE> KFOR Commander Condemns Attack on Serb Convoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) Klaus Rajnhard on Saturday
strongly condemned ethnic Albanians for attacking the U.N.-
escorted Serb convoy and promised that this kind of incident will
not happen again.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Pristina, the provincial
capital of Kosovo, Rajnhard said that about 1,500 ethnic Albanians
on Wednesday besieged a 25-vehicle convoy carrying more than 150
Serb refugees and beat them up. The KFOR officers escorting the
convoy have been punished for failing to provide protection.
</P>
<P>
The commander urged Serb residents in Kosovo not to leave the
province, saying that the KFOR troops "will do their best to
ensure their safety."
</P>
<P>
On October 27, the convoy, organized by the Office of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, traveled from the southwestern
Kosovo town of Orahovac to neighboring Montenegro. It was
attacked by ethnic Albanians when passing through the western city
of Pec.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 Serbs were injured and four abducted, with 15 of
the vehicles burnt. The Serb refugees arrived in Podgorica, the
capital of Montenegro, on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) reform commission, IOC 2000, reached
consensus on a final report recommending the adoption of new
reforms and enhancement of current IOC policies during its meeting
Saturday in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
The 50 reform recommendations, to be submitted to the IOC
membership for vote at the December 11-12 Extraordinary Session,
would bring about changes in policy and structure that will lead
to a more contemporary and transparent IOC.
</P>
<P>
"Since the impact of the crisis was first felt, I was
determined that positive changes would result from it," said IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, who presided over the day's
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"After months of study, IOC 2000 has done a great service to
the Olympic Movement by laying out the path toward reform. Now
the membership must end this Century by taking these
recommendations and building an IOC better suited for the next,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
As it went very well, the originally-scheduled two-day meeting
was brought to an end after one day's debate on Saturday,
Samaranch told reporters.
</P>
<P>
IOC 2000, an 82-member reform commission, was set up last March

LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) reform commission, IOC 2000, made
recommendations here Saturday on the responsibilities and
obligations of all parties involved in the process.

cities on the basis of having the benefit of knowledge gained from
a strengthened Evaluation Commission or the  allowance of
visits only under certain conditions;
</P>
<P>
-- It should be noted the IOC membership also would be able to
rely on a bid acceptance process that would bring forward only the
candidates most qualified to host the Games;
</P>
<P>
-- The strengthening of the obligations of the National Olympic
Committees (NOCs) to oversee and counsel the bidding committees in
their countries;
</P>
<P>
-- The signing of a contract between the IOC, the bid cities,
and their NOCs outlining the obligations of each party, the
applicable code of conduct, and the sanctions for breach of the
terms.

promote foreign trade and social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
A notice jointly issued today by the State Development Planning
Commission and the Ministry of Finance detailed the reduction of
the fee-charging rates of the second group, or 468 items,
involving some three billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The items mainly cover the fees charged for entry-exit
quarantine of animals, plants, health, and commodities;
administrative charges for ports, enterprise registration, urban
and rural fairs, and those imposed on individual business people.
</P>
<P>
Of the 468 items, 450 are related to the State Administration
for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine, with the average
charging rate going down by one-third, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
Nine items involve the General Administration of Customs,
including fees charged for import rebate procedures and
intellectual property-rights protection registration, with the
charging rate cut by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Administrative charges on fairs and individual business people
have been cut by 20 percent, the notice says, noting that any
other charges in this regard must be canceled.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the two ministries announced the reduction of the fee-
charging rates of the first group, or 22 kinds of items, involving
four billion yuan a year.

<HEADLINE> Lineker: Leicester City Battle "Ridiculous" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Gary Lineker has branded the
boar Martin O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
Former England striker Lineker, who made his name as a player
at Leicester, is backing club chairman John Elsom in calling an
extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to solve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Lineker was one of the seven signatories on the document which
will lead to an EGM in early December.
</P>
<P>
Lineker has become increasingly frustrated at the in-fighting
between the so-called "Gang of four" led by chief executive Barrie
Pierpoint and the other faction - chiefly Elsom and plc chief Sir
Rodney Walker - the two main allies of O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
"The best directors at any football club are the unobtrusive
ones," said Lineker.
</P>
<P>
"Everything needs to be done to keep the supporters, the
players and the manager of Leicester City Football Club happy.
</P>
<P>
"It is a ridiculous state of affairs at the moment and the EGM
is the only way I can see for the club's difficulties to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
"Martin O'Neill has done a fantastic job since he arrived at
the club nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The last thing anyone wants is for the continued playing
success of the club to be put in jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
The EGM could take six weeks to organize but is likely to go
ahead before the plc annual general meeting which is scheduled to
take place in early December.

Fiorina said the company is currently negotiating with the

<HEADLINE> Expert Predicts 4 Percent Growth in China's Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China may witness a four
percent growth rate in export by the end of this year, China Daily
's Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a trade expert's prediction, the Daily said that China'
s trade surplus will stand at 25 billion U.S. dollar this year.
Customs' statistics showed that China's exports grew by 2.1
percent during the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
The expert, according to the paper, attributed the export
growth to recent economic recovery of southeast Asian countries,
South Korea and Japan. The strengthening of the Japanese yen
against the U.S. dollar has also lessened the exchange rate's
negative influence on China's exports.
</P>
<P>
China has raised export tax rebates for several times since
last year. The tax rebates for machinery and electronic products,
textiles and garments have approached zero, which has strongly
boosted China's export, according to the expert.

inscriptions on the subject.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Boeing Delays Fuel Tank Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal safety
investigators said they were dismayed that the Boeing Company
would study fuel tank problems on its jumbo jets but then fail for
years to disclose their findings.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's editions, the Washington Post quoted National
Safety Transportation Board (NTSB) officials as saying that the
Boeing report could have helped them focus on the problem -- fuel
tank overheating -- which was an apparent factor in the explosion
of TWA Flight 800 over Long Island in New York in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Boeing produced the report in 1980 but did not give it to the
NTSB until this June, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The report focused on a key issue that preoccupied TWA Flight
800 investigators -- excess heat from the air conditioning bay of
its E-4B jet, the military version of its 747, possibly creating
highly flammable fuel vapors in the plane's central fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
The NTSB expressed "displeasure" and "dismay" about Boeing's
delay in a written statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Boeing spokesman said today that the differences
between the two versions of the airframe make the report largely
irrelevant to the TWA investigation.
</P>
<P>
Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the subcommittee that
oversees airline disaster investigations, told the Post the TWA
800 tragedy could have been prevented if Boeing had volunteered
its report after a 1990 fuel tank explosion on different model
Boeing jet, a Philippines Airline 737, at the Manila airport,
killed eight people.
</P>
<P>
The NTSB said it did not learn of the 1980 report until last
March, when it was listed on the agenda for a meeting of an Air
Force task force studying the safety implications of the TWA
Flight 800 explosion for the E-4B.
</P>
<P>
The NTSB plans to complete by next spring its report on the TWA
Flight 800 explosion, which killed all 230 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> 8,000 Police to Join Uruguay Elections Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 8,000 Uruguayan
policemen will join the "Shield Operation" on Sunday for the
presidential election, Commander Enrique Navas, in charge of
coordination said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The operation has been divided into three stages. In the first
the police will be in charge of the protection and the
transportation of part of the ballot boxes to the 6,628 ballot
receiving circunscriptions to be distributed in the 10 departments
or provinces of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
There will be special patrols during the voting hours, from
08:00 in the morning to 19:30 local time (11:00 to 22:30 GMT) and
guards to guarantee public order, said Navas.
</P>
<P>
After the official results are known in the early hours of
Monday, according to official estimations, the security operation
will concentrate on the zones of feasting provided for each party.
</P>
<P>
The official figures will be confirmed Monday at midday by the
Electoral Court at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Also 4,237 military personnel, from the Army, the Navy and the
Air Force, and 2,391 more policemen are qualified to vote in the
Sunday elections to elect a president, a vicepresident, 30
senators, and 99 deputies.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.4 million Uruguyans are registered to vote Sunday, with
a November 28 runoff expected if no candidate gets more than 50
percent of the ballot.
</P>
<P>
Tabare Vazquez, leftist Ample Front-Progressive Encounter
coalition candidate, is the favorite to win the first round on
Sunday. He has called for an "emergency plan" to ease Uruguay out
of an economic slump.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said whoever takes power in the cattle-and-wool
producing nation of 3.2 million will inherit an economy expected
to contract 2 percent this year, with rising unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorans Evacuated from Volcano Zone Desperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people evacuated
from towns close to the Ecuadoran Tungurahua volcano are
desperate, because the lack of money and job puts them in a
precarious situation that worsens day by day.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people ask the authorities to let them return to
their lands, despite the risk of being caught if the volcano
erupts at any time now, as reported by the volcanologists who
monitor the seismic activity of the mountain, which spews ashes
and incandescent rocks every day.
</P>
<P>
Tungurahua, or "Throat of Fire" in the Quechua Indian language,
began to rumble in September and last erupted in 1918. The 5,106
-meter high volcano is threatening to engulf the popular tourist
destination in a major eruption.
</P>
<P>
At least 25,000 persons were evacuated last week from the 59
towns close to the Tungurahua volcano and taken to the refuges
erected in the cities of Ambato, Puyo, and Penipe, although 80
percent of the evacuees went to relatives who live out of the
volcano range.
</P>
<P>
Army and police forces have increased their surveillance of the
zones of danger around the volcano, since many persons have
announced their intention to go to their houses and lands,
abandoned when the evacuation "orange alert" was declared two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and authorities have reaffirmed that danger is
imminent in the zones of high risk, especially the Banos touristic
city, because it is estimated that the volcano can erupt in such a
way that there will be no way to escape.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Ecuadoran and international media journalists have
installed their equipment near the volcano so they will not miss
the big eruption the volcanologists expect in a few days or weeks.

<P>
Jiang also voiced important views on the sound development of
the cause of international human rights. He said that China
advocates to undertake dialogue and cooperation with all countries
on the basis of equality and mutual respect, opposes to politicize
the issue of human rights, especially to make use of the issue of
human rights and interfere in the international affairs of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Jiang said some people in the world put forward the
new interferism of "human rights superior to sovereignty" and
"limited national sovereignty", which is worth high vigilance of
the developing countries which love peace.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Jiang added, human rights should be protected by
sovereignty. It is not true that human rights are superior to
sovereignty. What is the fact is that without sovereignty, people
will not enjoy human rights.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President reaffirmed that China supports Algeria to
follow the policy of human rights that comply with its national
realities and oppose other countries to interfere in its domestic
affairs with the excuse of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Buteflika said that his country has unanimous views with China
on the issue of human rights. He expressed special agreement with
the important view that without sovereignty there will be no human
rights.

On China-African relationship, Jiang said, the relations
between China and Africa are models for the friendly relations of
cooperation among developing countries, which have endured the
test of time and the change of international situation and have
also been further consolidated and strengthened under the new
situation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that political relationship between China and Africa
has been close, high-level contacts have been frequent. China and
Africa have strengthened consultation and supported each other
over international affairs, to safeguard the common interest of
the developing countries and to exert their efforts in pushing
forward the establishment of just and reasonable new order of
international politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President reiterated that China has pushed forward
actively the international community to show more concern for
African issues, and has valued the opinions and wills of African
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, exchange and cooperation between China and
Africa have also continued development in in the economic and
trade sectors, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening and developing friendly relationship of
cooperation with developing countries including Africa have always
been an important part of China's foreign policy of self
independence and peace," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will always insist on the five
principles of peaceful co-existence and will never interfere in
the internal affairs of African countries. China supports African
countries to choose independently political systems and roads of
development that suit with their own national realities, to defend
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the just
fightings against interference from outside, to safeguard and
promote mutual solidarity and solve contradictions and conflicts
through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China advocates all countries are equal and
supports African countries to participate in international affairs
on equal basis. China will continue to provide as much economic
assistance to African countries as it is capable of without any
political conditions attached, and to undertake economic and trade
cooperation of multi-forms on the basis of equality and and mutual
benefit so as to achieve common development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said at last that China will follow the fundamental
principle of "being sincere and friendly, treating each other
equally, being solidaritary and cooperative, seeking common
development and facing toward future", and build up a new type of
partnership between China and Africa which oriented toward the
21st century.
