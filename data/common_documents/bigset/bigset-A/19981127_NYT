HOLIDAY SHOPPERS GOBBLE UP GOODS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For most L.A.-area Valley residents, Thanksgiving
is a day to spend around the dinner table with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   For Sylvia Dean, it was a day to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come today,'' Dean said Thursday morning, while
walking down the sporting goods aisle of the Kmart store in
Northridge, a Los Angeles suburb. ``If I come (Friday), it will be
a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the national holiday, many people left their
turkeys and football games Thursday, and headed for the few stores
open Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to come tomorrow at 6 o'clock in the morning,''
said Kelley Rivera as she pushed a cart full of toys at Kmart.
``I'd rather be in bed knowing I have my presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Kmart, one of the few stores in the L.A.-area that was open
Thanksgiving Day, drew large crowds to its Northridge store.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, shoppers set out in search of that perfect gift or
necessity. Outside, drivers fought for parking spaces, jamming the
parking lot for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   For Dave Larsen, a resident of the Los Angeles suburb Tarzana,
shopping on Thanksgiving is an annual family tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little-known secret, but Thanksgiving is the best day
to go shopping,'' Larsen said. ``After today, I don't even want to
imagine what it's going to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Gross said he went shopping just to ``get away from the
hustle and bustle of my house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have over 50 people there right now,'' said Gross, a
resident of Northridge. ``I needed some time to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   One Kmart employee didn't know why people chose to shop rather
than stay home with their family. But would he shop if he had the
day off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not _ but it depends on the sale,'' the employee
said.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Canoga Park, a shopper at the Ninety Nine Cents
Only Store was picking up a few Christmas items in addition to
last-minute Thanksgiving goodies she had come to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Elisa Schwartz said she enjoys shopping when there are fewer
people and didn't want to miss out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a few extra things, and I figured I might as well buy
some Christmas stuff while I'm here,'' Schwartz said as she picked
through mountains of red and green tinsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buying our Christmas tree next week and we need to be
ready.'' &QL;

WHAT'S THE FUEL FIRING THIS FEUD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Arizona State and Arizona began butting heads on
the gridiron in 18-and-99, when McKinley was president.
</P>
<P>
   Like every year, today's big game is billed as a grudge match, a
war.
</P>
<P>
   But why?
</P>
<P>
   No one has provided a satisfactory explanation why the Sun
Devils can't abide the Wildcats and vice versa, which is the way it
is with feuds.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Hatfields and McCoys, this thing is generational. Our
state's largest schools have been sniping at one another for so
long that today the mutual animosity is accepted as a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seems to know, or care, who started it and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody,'' Bruce Snyder theorizes, ``must have said
``something''.''
</P>
<P>
   I assumed that the first game must have gone badly.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. On Thanksgiving Day in 1899 ASU (then called Normal)
traveled by train to Tucson and beat UA (then called the
University) 11-2, which hardly qualifies as running up the score.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Tempe ``News,''``the game throughout was
characterized by gentlemanly conduct, clean and snappy playing and
total absence of slugging, `jawing,' or other objectionable
features. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, atypical of the annual spleen-vents today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much cannot be said in praise of the treatment our boys
received at the hands of students, faculty and citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper, ASU players even shared turkey
dinner with the lads they had beaten.
</P>
<P>
   No food fights were reported.
</P>
<P>
   One pictures the teams seated side by side around a large table
decorated with a pilgrim centerpiece, eating mounds of cornbread
dressing and speaking to one another in a civil tongue. ``Excuse
me, could you please pass the gravy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're quite welcome. Fine game, wasn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It surely was. Congratulations. Care for a roll?''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper account concluded by saying, ``It is to be hoped
that this friendly meeting of the two institutions on the field of
manly sports is the forerunner of a lasting friendship between
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Time passed, which is what time does. The first seeds of ill
feelings may have been planted when Arizona won the next nine games
by the combined score of 231-3.
</P>
<P>
   You can look it up.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's losing streak had to be particularly painful since it
spanned 31 seasons (the teams didn't play each other every year).
In 1919, UA beat the stuffing out of ASU, 59-0.
</P>
<P>
   The joint Thanksgiving feasts ceased.
</P>
<P>
   ASU finally won in 1931, but then things returned to Normal. The
Tempe school lost 11 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is that some player in a flash of anger finally
``said something'' either during or after the 1946 game. According
to ``The'' ``Arizona Republic,'' the Arizona State Bulldogs planned
to celebrate the postwar return to college football by revealing
the full force of their ``Atomic Z'' formation.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the Atomic Z offense was. Apparently not
much. Arizona won, 67-0.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the visiting Wildcats ran ``roughshod.'' That
they ``poured out an endless parade of fleet-footed backfield stars
who ran an inept Bulldog defense dizzy.'' That they hit the Tempe
team with ``almost everything in the football book.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ASU later returned the favor, beating UA 61-14 and 47-0 and
55-19. Two years ago the Devils won in Tucson 56-14. That night the
enmity boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   Who started it all?
</P>
<P>
   Opinions are divided. But if the Sun Devils need any extra
incentive, and they shouldn't, Snyder should go to the microfilm
and copy ``The'' ``Republic'' story of the 1946 game and read the
last paragraph aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final touchdown came when Arizona recovered a Tempe fumble
at Tempe's 18. And in one play Enke ``passed'' to Chalmers for the
touchdown and Goff's kick was good.'' &QL;

<P>
   There was something of the Soviet era about this week's
television film from Boris Yeltsin's hospital suite. Russia's
president, stricken with fever, pneumonia and perhaps other
ailments, gesticulated mechanically at his Chinese visitor, Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the two men were ``reaffirming the principle of a
multipolar world,'' which is code for grumbling about America's
far-reaching influence. But no soundtrack accompanied the footage.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's handlers presumably do not want the world to hear the
incoherence into which Russia's first elected leader has lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin courtiers down the centuries have realized that czars in
their dotage and decrepit party bosses have their uses. They can be
starved of information and cajoled into scrawling their signatures
on documents they hardly understand _ even declarations of war.
</P>
<P>
   The longer a ruler can be kept alive, the longer his cronies can
hang on. And at times when all the alternatives seem worse, people
outside Russia have often concluded that indecision and drift in
the Kremlin, under a moribund monarch, is a state of affairs they
can live with.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Yeltsin this calculation no longer holds. The
murder of Galina Starovoitova, one of the liberal politicians who
taught Yeltsin what democracy meant, suggests that Russia cannot
drift much longer.
</P>
<P>
   So does the refusal of the Communists who dominate Russia's
parliament to censure one of their number for an anti-Semitic
tirade.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became totally enfeebled a few months ago, Yeltsin
himself gave warning that the forces of authoritarian chauvinism
were growing in Russia. Russia urgently needs a steadier hand than
his to keep those forces at bay and lead it through the economic
dangers ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of power need not be as scary as some outsiders
fear. If Yeltsin steps down, the presidency will go automatically
for three months to Yevgeny Primakov, the prime minister, before a
new presidential election is held.
</P>
<P>
   He is already in practice Russia's most important politician,
although he would acquire huge powers over foreign and defense
policy as president.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, westerners would have been horrified by the
prospect of this former cold warrior and spymaster taking charge of
Russia. But, since becoming prime minister in September, Primakov
has won cautious international approval.
</P>
<P>
   He has calmed the febrile atmosphere of Russian politics, and
temporarily eased _ though certainly not resolved _ the economic
crisis. He has resisted pressure to throw nonexistent public funds
at industry or the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   After some hard bargaining with provincial governors, the
prospect of regions declaring total economic independence has
receded, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy too, things could be worse. Primakov is a
friend of Saddam Hussein and has opposed the use of force against
Iraq, but he has not created insuperable obstacles to western
policy in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The realism he has shown in recent dealings with the West is in
line with his record as foreign minister after 1996: loud
complaints about NATO's enlargement plans eventually gave way to
grudging acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, a Russia under President Primakov would be less
dangerous than a Russia with no real president at all.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that, if he were then to run for election,
Primakov stands a good chance of being confirmed as president. But
his own appetite to stay on is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The other front-runners _ Yuri Luzhkov and Alexander Lebed _
have more obvious defects.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has a deep grasp of market economics (although they both
claim to support the idea) and perhaps neither can be trusted to
resist the temptations of populism or assertive nationalism.
However, these men are at least partly known quantities, with their
own records of pragmatism and success.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Moscow, Luzhkov has presided over a frothy expansion
of the city's economy, albeit flawed by crime and cronyism. Lebed
can, and often does, claim to have stopped two wars _ by
engineering a cease-fire in Moldova and by negotiating a dignified
exit for Russia's troops from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   He is running his province badly. In the past, his professions
of admiration for Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and
his occasional outbursts of religious and ethnic prejudice, have
caused alarm. But many westerners consider him clumsy rather than
sinister, and a quick learner of the facts of international life.
</P>
<P>
   This assessment may understate the risks of a Lebed presidency.
But these have to be weighed against the risks of Russia limping on
with a president in name only.
</P>
<P>
   What matters more than the identity of Russia's leader is the
principle that the next head of state should be chosen by due
constitutional process. A democratic transfer of power would be a
remarkable landmark.
</P>
<P>
   In a country as unpredictable as Russia, it is mildly reassuring
that most people seem at present to assume that Yeltsin's successor
will be freely elected. The sooner this process begins, the
better. &QL;

ASU EMBRACES ROLE OF SPOILER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Although its season has gone south, Arizona
State intends to slam on the brakes in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In a game often filled with subplots, today's 4:30 p.m. meeting
between the Sun Devils and Wildcats at Arizona Stadium should be
loaded. None is as significant as this: For the first time in the
71-game series, ASU has a chance to knock Arizona out of a Rose
Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   Losing, said Wildcats defensive tackle Daniel Greer, ``Would be
a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (10-1, 6-1 Pac-10) leads the series, 41-29-1, and has
dominated since 1982 with a 12-2-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Snyder is 2-4 against the Wildcats since taking over
at ASU (5-5, 4-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-game season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This series has had a bit of everything: brawls, blowouts,
upsets and last-second victories. It has produced a mutual dislike
for one another, sometimes civil, sometimes downright nasty.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, former ASU quarterback Danny White says he can't
spend a night in Tucson. He'll travel several miles out of town to
seek lodging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to use the word `hate,' '' ASU free safety
Mitchell Freedman said. ``I might use the words `dislike with a
passion.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions are particularly high this season because the Sun
Devils came in with all the hype and the Wildcats with all the
question marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into this year,'' Arizona receiver Dennis Northcutt
said, ``they were supposed to be all of this and all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's other top story lines include:
</P>
<P>
   Postseason aspirations for both.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wildcats win and other things fall in place _ including a
ULCA berth in the national championship game _ Arizona could land
in the Rose Bowl for the first time. The Sun Devils have never
spoiled that opportunity for the Wildcats, although Arizona has
done it to ASU twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too complicated to talk about,'' Arizona Coach Dick Tomey
said. ``I only know we're going somewhere, and we're probably going
somewhere good. But, otherwise, the (Bowl Championship Series) is
fraught with too much contingency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have a winning season on the line and a potential
bowl invitation. Although a victory wouldn't completely salvage the
season, ``I'll tell you what, it makes my winter a lot better,''
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Battle of the tailbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's J.R. Redmond and Arizona's Trung Canidate come into the
game with similar numbers: 151 carries vs 149, 90.2 yards per game
vs. 93.2. Both are juniors. Redmond entered the season as a Heisman
Trophy candidate, but injuries and the Sun Devils' season negated
that. He hasn't been fully healthy since midseason but is expected
to play today.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate, a product of Central High School, has 438 yards in his
past three games. He was asked whether he should be compared
favorably to Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I only know that you get the
attention you deserve. (Arizona running back) Kelvin Eafon always
sits down with me to talk about stuff like that. Kelvin only talks
about winning. He's right. That's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey admits Redmond makes him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the most explosive threat in the league,'' he
said. ``You just have to hold your breath when he gets hold of the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback quandaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are the ones who successfully rotate quarterbacks
Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins but will the Sun Devils have to do
the same?
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Kealy suffered a right knee sprain against California and
sat out ASU's last game against Oregon. He was back to full
practice this week and looked strong, although he did experience
some knee tenderness midweek. Backups Chad Elliott and Steve
Campbell had a limited number of snaps as Kealy tried to make up
for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play out of our heads,'' said Kealy, who tore an
anterior cruciate ligament last season against the Wildcats.
``We've got to play better than our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Weapons assault.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona ranks third in the Pac-10 in scoring offense (and first
in rushing) and ASU eighth in scoring defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Northcutt-Jeremy McDaniel wide receiver combination has
helped make a success of the Wildcats' quarterback duo. One
receiver always seems to be open.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great receivers, but in the Pac-10 it's a challenge
every week,'' ASU's Freedman said. ``We just have to come out and
be consistent and take care of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's cornerback Chris McAlister, who has four
interceptions this season and has returned an interception, kick
and punt for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister will square off primarily with ASU wide receiver
Lenzie Jackson, who is facing the prospect of playing his last
collegiate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ``won't'' be my last game,'' Jackson said. &QL;

grudging acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, a Russia under President Primakov would be less
dangerous than a Russia with no real president at all.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that, if he were then to run for election,
Primakov stands a good chance of being confirmed as president. But
his own appetite to stay on is uncertain.

</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Moscow, Luzhkov has presided over a frothy expansion
of the city's economy, albeit flawed by crime and cronyism. Lebed
can, and often does, claim to have stopped two wars _ by
engineering a cease-fire in Moldova and by negotiating a dignified
exit for Russia's troops from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   He is running his province badly. In the past, his professions
of admiration for Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and
his occasional outbursts of religious and ethnic prejudice, have
caused alarm. But many westerners consider him clumsy rather than
sinister, and a quick learner of the facts of international life.

<P>
   This assessment may understate the risks of a Lebed presidency.
But these have to be weighed against the risks of Russia limping on
with a president in name only.
</P>
<P>
   What matters more than the identity of Russia's leader is the
principle that the next head of state should be chosen by due
constitutional process. A democratic transfer of power would be a
remarkable landmark.
</P>
<P>
   In a country as unpredictable as Russia, it is mildly reassuring
that most people seem at present to assume that Yeltsin's successor
will be freely elected. The sooner this process begins, the
better. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was something of the Soviet era about this week's
television film from Boris Yeltsin's hospital suite. Russia's
president, stricken with fever, pneumonia and perhaps other
ailments, gesticulated mechanically at his Chinese visitor, Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the two men were ``reaffirming the principle of a
multipolar world,'' which is code for grumbling about America's
far-reaching influence. But no soundtrack accompanied the footage.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's handlers presumably do not want the world to hear the
incoherence into which Russia's first elected leader has lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin courtiers down the centuries have realized that czars in
their dotage and decrepit party bosses have their uses. They can be
starved of information and cajoled into scrawling their signatures
on documents they hardly understand _ even declarations of war.
</P>
<P>
   The longer a ruler can be kept alive, the longer his cronies can
hang on. And at times when all the alternatives seem worse, people
outside Russia have often concluded that indecision and drift in
the Kremlin, under a moribund monarch, is a state of affairs they
can live with.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Yeltsin this calculation no longer holds. The
murder of Galina Starovoitova, one of the liberal politicians who
taught Yeltsin what democracy meant, suggests that Russia cannot
drift much longer.
</P>
<P>
   So does the refusal of the Communists who dominate Russia's
parliament to censure one of their number for an anti-Semitic
tirade.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became totally enfeebled a few months ago, Yeltsin
himself gave warning that the forces of authoritarian chauvinism
were growing in Russia. Russia urgently needs a steadier hand than
his to keep those forces at bay and lead it through the economic
dangers ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of power need not be as scary as some outsiders
fear. If Yeltsin steps down, the presidency will go automatically
for three months to Yevgeny Primakov, the prime minister, before a
new presidential election is held.
</P>
<P>
   He is already in practice Russia's most important politician,
although he would acquire huge powers over foreign and defense
policy as president.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, westerners would have been horrified by the
prospect of this former cold warrior and spymaster taking charge of
Russia. But, since becoming prime minister in September, Primakov
has won cautious international approval.
</P>
<P>
   He has calmed the febrile atmosphere of Russian politics, and
temporarily eased _ though certainly not resolved _ the economic
crisis. He has resisted pressure to throw nonexistent public funds
at industry or the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   After some hard bargaining with provincial governors, the
prospect of regions declaring total economic independence has
receded, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy too, things could be worse. Primakov is a
friend of Saddam Hussein and has opposed the use of force against
Iraq, but he has not created insuperable obstacles to western
policy in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The realism he has shown in recent dealings with the West is in
line with his record as foreign minister after 1996: loud
complaints about NATO's enlargement plans eventually gave way to
grudging acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, a Russia under President Primakov would be less
dangerous than a Russia with no real president at all.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that, if he were then to run for election,
Primakov stands a good chance of being confirmed as president. But
his own appetite to stay on is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The other front-runners _ Yuri Luzhkov and Alexander Lebed _
have more obvious defects.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has a deep grasp of market economics (although they both
claim to support the idea) and perhaps neither can be trusted to
resist the temptations of populism or assertive nationalism.
However, these men are at least partly known quantities, with their
own records of pragmatism and success.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Moscow, Luzhkov has presided over a frothy expansion
of the city's economy, albeit flawed by crime and cronyism. Lebed
can, and often does, claim to have stopped two wars _ by
engineering a cease-fire in Moldova and by negotiating a dignified
exit for Russia's troops from Chechnya.

SWANN CONSIDERS SURGERY  
 KNEE PROCEDURE COULD END SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mystery surrounding Eric Swann's arthritic right knee took
another twist on Thursday when the Cardinals' Pro Bowl defensive
tackle informed Coach Vince Tobin that he is considering having a
potentially season-ending knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, 28, who has had six arthroscopic knee procedures _ four
on the right knee, two on the left _ could have the elective
procedure as early as Monday, according to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Swann had what was described as an ``arthroscopic flush'' on the
right knee Oct. 28. He has been rehabilitating at the team's
training facility. By all accounts Swann was on pace to return in
the next week or two as the Cardinals (6-5) enter the stretch drive
in their quest to secure their first NFL playoff berth since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, however, has continued to complain of knee pain. He
solicited a second opinion from a surgeon not affiliated with the
club, Dr. Richard Steadman, a Vail, Colo., orthopedist who consults
with the U.S. Olympic ski team. Steadman recommended that Swann
have another procedure.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cardinals, that could be performed as early as
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I told Eric is I'd make sure it is the correct
thing to do before I did it,'' Tobin said after Thursday's
practice. ``It is a serious step for Eric, as a football player and
as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   It is well-documented that Swann has arthritis in both knees.
But the severity of Swann's condition and what exactly was found in
last month's procedure remain mysteries. Neither Swann nor Dr.
Russell Chick, the Cardinals' orthopedist, has commented to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even the circumstances surrounding who made the decision to
proceed and when have been the subject of speculation. Surgery
reportedly was first considered the week of the Oct. 11 game
against Chicago. It remains unclear who talked whom into waiting
until the bye week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we expected Eric to be back in the next couple of
weeks,'' Tobin said. ``It would have been a good push for us down
the stretch. That's not going to happen if he does this, so more
players are going to have to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann's teammates were stunned to hear the news.
</P>
<P>
   Jamir Miller, a defensive co-captain, winced as he read the
Cardinals' press release. Then, Miller refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother told me if you don't have anything nice to say not
to say anything,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Lomas Brown, an offensive co-captain, said he wanted to try to
reach Swann to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurts,'' Brown said. ``That hurts because we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Swann has been out the past four games, the Cardinals have
plummeted from the upper third of the NFL to the lower third in
total defense. In the most telling statistic, scoring defense, the
club has dropped to next-to-last in the NFC. With his push, Swann
(6 feet 5, 313 pounds) can disrupt an entire blocking scheme. He
commands double-team attention. In seven games, Swann had 33
tackles, four sacks, seven quarterback hurries, five tackles for
lost yards, four pass deflections and two forced fumbles _ a banner
year.
</P>
<P>
   During this past off-season, Swann, an unrestricted free agent,
was re-signed for five years at $25 million, including a $7.5
million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he hopes Swann gets yet another opinion before he
proceeds, but Tobin believes Swann is convinced that because he has
lingering pain he needs another procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly thinking about it,'' Tobin said. ``Whether he
looks anyplace else is Eric's call. Eric is coming off a surgery,
and he wants to make sure he is where he needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said that Rashod Swinger (6-2, 286), who has started the
past six games, will remain the starter at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rashod has played very, very well,'' Tobin said. ``The thing
this might affect if we don't get Eric back is depth. Depth is a
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals already have defensive linemen Brad Ottis and
Jerry Drake on injured reserve. There are three other backups on
the active roster _ Bernard Wilson, Carl Simpson and Jomo Cousins _
and practice-squad member Mike Moten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we have to go get another lineman remains to be
seen,'' Tobin said. &QL;

<P>
   Everything has changed, and nothing has changed. On Nov. 3,
America's voters made it clear that, whatever Bill Clinton might
have done to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky, they did not
want him removed from office for it.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19 the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, admitted to
the House Judiciary Committee that his inquiry had come up dry on
Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, and all the other vaguely
malodorous dealings that seemed to suggest a ``pattern and
practice'' of criminal behavior by the president.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the impeachment inquiry, never hale, is dying. And
yet, as Starr laid out in compelling detail, the crimes he has
judged impeachable remain just as felonious as before.
</P>
<P>
   Should a man _ especially a man charged by his office
``faithfully to execute the laws'' _ be allowed to lie to a grand
jury, obstruct justice and tamper with witnesses?
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has taken the view that, once caught out in such
blatant lying, Clinton should have shown some shame and respect for
his office by resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was clear that he felt no such shame, we settled for
impeachment as the constitutionally acceptable way for Congress to
investigate, and if necessary remove, an erring chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed possible that the House Judiciary Committee, under the
eminently decent Henry Hyde, would carry out a careful inquiry that
would tie up some of Starr's loose ends and even uncover new
evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened has been very different, though not, alas,
unforeseeable. Impeachment is always a political process as much as
a judicial one: it is a dangerous course when public opinion is not
behind it, and more so when only one political party supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that they may be digging their own political graves,
Republican committee members are scrambling to finish the inquiry
in the two and a bit weeks that are left in the legislative year.
</P>
<P>
   This is absurd. Starr took four years and $40 million to uncover
what he did; and, though this was vastly too long and vastly too
expensive, serious inquiry requires much more effort from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the committee called Starr as first witness in a clear
attempt to cut the process short; and, by failing to question him
with any incisiveness, showed that its chief interest was to score
what political points it could, and then shut up shop.
</P>
<P>
   A shambles like this brings the process of impeachment into
disrepute. That the affair is ending this way is deplorable, but
there it is: shutting up shop now looks the best option.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways to bring to book a president who has broken
the law. But all of them become harder, if not impossible, once an
impeachment has been tried and rejected, as this one would be. In
that sense, an impeachment inquiry of this tepid sort simply plays
into the president's hands. Its failure will look like a victory
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Democrats agree that there should be punishment of some
sort for the contempt for his office that Clinton has displayed.
Censure is often mentioned, and would be easy to get through
Congress, requiring only a simple majority in both houses. But it
is probably unconstitutional: Congress can censure its own members,
but not members of another branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   When it was last used against a president (Andrew Jackson in
1834), the censure was quickly overturned. Besides, censure is an
empty gesture. It exacts no further penalty, and would also
probably immunize the president from subsequent prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that the White House seems to be angling for a
compromise involving censure makes the point plain: it wouldn't
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But a trial would. Presidents, once out of office, are liable to
prosecution in the courts like any other citizen. Such a trial
would be unprecedented, but far from impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence has been gathered; the special prosecutor (who has
the power to bring charges in an ordinary criminal trial) is more
than ready; and, as early as January 2001, ex-President Clinton
could be called to answer for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The chief crime with which he would be charged, perjury before a
grand jury, is not one that courts take lightly _ still less when
the perpetrator was, at the time, the guardian of the country's
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a court appearance in 2001 _ in the Paula Jones case
_ was exactly what Clinton was expecting before the Supreme Court
ruled, unwisely in retrospect, that the suit should be brought
forward.
</P>
<P>
   This reckless and mendacious man knew he would have to be held
to account eventually. There seems no reason why he and the country
should not wait a little longer for the punishment to come. The
only intolerable outcome would be if he were allowed to get away. &QL;

HELMER RECALLED FROM LAS VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>

 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coyotes fired up the Yo-Yo Express again for defenseman
 &UR; Bryan
 &UR; Helmer, recalling him from the Las Vegas Thunder of the
International Hockey League for Thursday's game against his former
team, the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Helmer, acquired as a free agent, was recalled to fill the void
left by defensman  &UR; Gerald Diduck's bruised shoulder. Diduck, who
has been bothered by the shoulder for some time and aggravated it
more against Chicago Tuesday night, missed the New Jersey game and
is listed day-to-day. He might play Saturday night in Los Angeles
against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have reassigned and recalled Helmer to and from Las
Vegas three times this season, and it could have been four times.
He was reassigned to Las Vegas early in the season, but was
recalled before he reached the Phoenix airport to leave. &QL; 
Two signings &QL; 
General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith, who was recently given a three-year
contract extension, isn't the only Coyotes executive to be
re-signed by owner  &UR; Richard Burke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Taylor Burke, Smith's assistant, was given a two-year extension
and  &UR; Laurence Gilman, vice president of hockey operations, was
presented with a three-year extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've shown that we all work well together, and this
will give us the continuity we need for the future,'' Taylor Burke
said. &QL; 
Tide turning &QL; 
The crowd at Tuesday's Chicago-Phoenix game at America West Arena
was noticeably short on Blackhawks fans, who have in the past
almost turned the building into neutral ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man, that was beautiful,'' Coyotes center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick,
a former Blackhawks star, said. &QL; 
DesRochers moved &QL; 
Goalie  &UR; Patrick DesRochers, the Coyotes No. 1 choice in last
summer's Amateur Entry Draft, has been traded from Sarnia in the
Ontario Hockey League to Kingston in the OHL in exchange for
forward  &UR; Matt Price and goalie  &UR; Curtis Cruickshank.
</P>
<P>
   The move is merely a trade between junior teams and DesRochers
still remains property of the Coyotes. DesRochers took advantage of
a recent break in his junior league schedule to fly to Phoenix and
work with goaltending coach  &UR; Benoit Allaire, because he has been
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   In eight games with Sarnia, he had a 3-5 record with a 3.67
goals-against average and a 87.8 save percentage. &QL; 
Johnson honored &QL; 
Former Coyotes defenseman  &UR; Jim Johnson, who retired during the
summer after suffering a severe concussion last season, was
formally honored before Thursday's game with New Jersey. &QL;

   On Nov. 19 the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, admitted to
the House Judiciary Committee that his inquiry had come up dry on
Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, and all the other vaguely
malodorous dealings that seemed to suggest a ``pattern and
practice'' of criminal behavior by the president.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the impeachment inquiry, never hale, is dying. And
yet, as Starr laid out in compelling detail, the crimes he has
judged impeachable remain just as felonious as before.
</P>
<P>
   Should a man _ especially a man charged by his office
``faithfully to execute the laws'' _ be allowed to lie to a grand
jury, obstruct justice and tamper with witnesses?
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has taken the view that, once caught out in such
blatant lying, Clinton should have shown some shame and respect for
his office by resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was clear that he felt no such shame, we settled for
impeachment as the constitutionally acceptable way for Congress to
investigate, and if necessary remove, an erring chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed possible that the House Judiciary Committee, under the
eminently decent Henry Hyde, would carry out a careful inquiry that
would tie up some of Starr's loose ends and even uncover new
evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened has been very different, though not, alas,
unforeseeable. Impeachment is always a political process as much as
a judicial one: it is a dangerous course when public opinion is not
behind it, and more so when only one political party supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that they may be digging their own political graves,
Republican committee members are scrambling to finish the inquiry
in the two and a bit weeks that are left in the legislative year.
</P>
<P>
   This is absurd. Starr took four years and $40 million to uncover
what he did; and, though this was vastly too long and vastly too
expensive, serious inquiry requires much more effort from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the committee called Starr as first witness in a clear
attempt to cut the process short; and, by failing to question him
with any incisiveness, showed that its chief interest was to score
what political points it could, and then shut up shop.
</P>
<P>
   A shambles like this brings the process of impeachment into
disrepute. That the affair is ending this way is deplorable, but
there it is: shutting up shop now looks the best option.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways to bring to book a president who has broken
the law. But all of them become harder, if not impossible, once an
impeachment has been tried and rejected, as this one would be. In
that sense, an impeachment inquiry of this tepid sort simply plays
into the president's hands. Its failure will look like a victory
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Democrats agree that there should be punishment of some
sort for the contempt for his office that Clinton has displayed.
Censure is often mentioned, and would be easy to get through
Congress, requiring only a simple majority in both houses. But it
is probably unconstitutional: Congress can censure its own members,
but not members of another branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   When it was last used against a president (Andrew Jackson in
1834), the censure was quickly overturned. Besides, censure is an
empty gesture. It exacts no further penalty, and would also
probably immunize the president from subsequent prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that the White House seems to be angling for a
compromise involving censure makes the point plain: it wouldn't
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But a trial would. Presidents, once out of office, are liable to
prosecution in the courts like any other citizen. Such a trial
would be unprecedented, but far from impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence has been gathered; the special prosecutor (who has
the power to bring charges in an ordinary criminal trial) is more
than ready; and, as early as January 2001, ex-President Clinton
could be called to answer for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The chief crime with which he would be charged, perjury before a
grand jury, is not one that courts take lightly _ still less when
the perpetrator was, at the time, the guardian of the country's
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a court appearance in 2001 _ in the Paula Jones case
_ was exactly what Clinton was expecting before the Supreme Court
ruled, unwisely in retrospect, that the suit should be brought
forward.
</P>
<P>
   This reckless and mendacious man knew he would have to be held
to account eventually. There seems no reason why he and the country
should not wait a little longer for the punishment to come. The
only intolerable outcome would be if he were allowed to get away. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Some time between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the
United States will execute its 500th prison inmate since the death
penalty was reinstated in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, the convict who draws that landmark noose, switch,
injection or gas pellet will actually be guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A conference this November at Northwestern University Law School
in Chicago highlighted a striking fact related to capital
punishment: since 1976, 75 American men and women have been
convicted of capital crimes, sentenced to death, and later found
innocent _ roughly one for every seven prisoners who have been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day conference brought together 30 of those released
from death row, some of whom came within hours of their appointment
with the executioner.
</P>
<P>
   How do innocent men and women end up on death row? Most of the
75 were accused of heinous crimes for which prosecutors, who are
elected officials, were under pressure to find someone to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors were more than overzealous in the case of
Rolando Cruz, who spent ten years on death row in Illinois for the
rape and murder of a 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was put on trial and convicted despite the fact that a
repeat sex offender and murderer had already confessed to the
crime; and he was freed only after a police officer admitted that
he had lied under oath about a key piece of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities fare particularly poorly in capital cases. Studies
have consistently found that blacks are more likely than whites to
draw death sentences for similar crimes; blacks who harm whites
fare worst of all. Clarence Brandley, one of the men on stage in
Chicago, is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Brandley was one of five caretakers who were considered suspects
when a 16-year-old white girl was raped and murdered in a Texas
high school. But he was the only black.
</P>
<P>
   When a Texas police officer interviewed Brandley and another
caretaker on the day of the murder, he supposedly said, ``One of
you two is going to hang for this.'' He then turned to Brandley and
said, ``Since you're the nigger, you're elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that hairs found on the body suggested a white killer
was withheld from the defense, and Brandley spent ten years on
death row before his sentence was overturned; the evidence and
testimony at his trial were proved unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Being poor does not help. At best, public defenders are
underpaid and overloaded with cases; at worst, they are
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers dealing with tax and patent issues need special
qualifications; lawyers defending death-penalty cases do not. Most
states, although they put massive resources into prosecuting
capital cases, put virtually none into guaranteeing an adequate
defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the highest reimbursement a public defender can
receive in a capital case, including all the time spent on
preparation and the trial, is $2,000. When the Alabama legislature
passed a bill this year raising the cap, Governor Fob James vetoed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the process of selecting a jury in death-penalty cases has
a bias against the innocent. Potential jurors who oppose the death
penalty are excused, creating ``death-qualified'' juries.
</P>
<P>
   Discharging such people skews the jury pool towards those who
are more rule-bound, trusting of authority, and likely to convict.
And once an individual is convicted, the appeals process focuses on
questions of procedure rather than guilt, often making it difficult
to introduce new evidence that points to innocence.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Americans seem unbothered by all this. The Death
Penalty Information Center has found that 77 percent of Americans
favor capital punishment. But death-penalty opponents see subtle
changes in public opinion lurking beneath such data.
</P>
<P>
   When the same people are asked whether they think murderers
should be given the death penalty or life in prison without parole,
slightly more Americans choose prison (44 percent) than death (41
percent).
</P>
<P>
   And the Death Penalty Information Survey records that nearly 60
percent of respondents felt at least some doubts about capital
punishment when _ as at the conference in Chicago _ they were made
to consider that men and women sentenced to death might be found
innocent later.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the death penalty, accepting that it is most
unlikely to disappear, would at least like to increase the
resources available to defendants in capital cases, and require
some minimum level of competence from lawyers and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   They would also require confessions to be audiotaped or
videotaped; at least ten death-row inmates in Illinois say they
were tortured into confessing.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers want the appeals process to be more open to bona fide
claims of innocence. Illinois took a step in this direction last
year when it passed a law guaranteeing death-row inmates access to
technology, such as DNA analysis, that was not available at the
time of their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, death-penalty critics would exclude or limit evidence
provided by prison informers, many of whom have learned to milk the
system for privileges by relaying ``confessions'' overheard in
prison. &QL;

CHAVOUS COULD START AT CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Rookie  &UR; Corey Chavous worked at right cornerback
with the first-team defense on Thursday and could get his first pro
start Sunday at Kansas City, Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous, a second-round draft pick from Vanderbilt, played
corner in college but has worked mostly at safety with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous was moved to corner this week after the Cardinals'
secondary was bombed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Right cornerback  &UR; J.B. Brown, the man the Redskins picked on,
and who kept several drives alive with illegal contact penalties,
has a sore calf and did not practice.  &UR; Tom Knight, the projected
started this season, aggravated his strained hamstring attachment
again and is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey has practiced well,'' Tobin said. ``He works at his
position. This is a great opportunity for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Return specialist  &UR; Eric Metcalf had magnetic resonance imaging
performed on his sore knee but no damage was found, Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is on medication and hopefully will be fine in a couple of
days,'' Tobin said. &QL; 
Sticking around &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Receiver  &UR; Ronnie Anderson stands a reasonable chance of being
activated for his second straight game this season because he
played well on special teams, Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was inactive the first 10 games after being signed
after his release by Green Bay. He played as the fourth receiver
ahead of
 &UR; Fred Brock last week, making two big special teams plays _
recovering Metcalf's fumbled punt to set up a touchdown drive and
making a tackle on a kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleasantly surprised,'' Tobin said. ``Ronnie was
excellent on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of keeping him inactive until last week was making sure
he knows the offense. We only carry four wide receivers so they
need to learn all four spots, not just one. The other thing was
punt returns. With Tommy Knight hurt, Fred Brock had been our
backup punt returner. Ronnie needed to show that he could catch
it.'' &QL; 
Dangerous foe &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the six-game skid by Kansas City, Sunday's foe when
the Cardinals (6-5) try to get two games above .500, is deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're getting ready to play, they all scare you,'' Tobin
said. ``But the Chiefs have a lot of talent. They were 13-3 a year
ago. They were embarrassed at home on ``Monday Night Football'' two
weeks ago. They're 4-7, but they're a very dangerous opponent.'' &QL;

DISHMAN A SPARK PLUG FOR CARDS  
 OFFENSE RIDING HIGH SINCE LINE MAN'S RETURN FROM INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - After experiencing an injury that was at first
terrifying and later frustrating, Cardinals guard Chris Dishman is
finally living the NFL life high on the Hog.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a Harley Tuesday,'' Dishman said, grinning. ``It's a
Fat Boy. I figured I'll be a Hog on a Hog. I think we should all
get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if the Cardinals' offense continues to improve as it has
since Dishman returned from a neck injury that sidelined him four
games, quarterback Jake Plummer will pick up the tab for those
bikes when he gets a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense has been producing more yardage, more points, it's
a straight reflection of how well they're playing together,''
Plummer said. ``Getting Dishman back is a big plus because he's a
real physical guy, a great run blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learning to pass block, and do it well. And our line is
jelling. They're giving me time to throw the ball. The last three
weeks, I don't know if the number of sacks has even been in double
digits, and I can say three or four of them were my own fault.
They've done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   After producing 246 yards and 15.6 points per game over the
first eight weeks of the season, the Cardinals' offense has put up
an average of 422 yards and 34 points over the last three games _
all since Dishman returned to the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   He was hurt in a game at St. Louis when the 6-foot-3, 320-pound
Dishman rammed head-on into former Cardinals linebacker Eric Hill
as Arizona running back Adrian Murrell scooted into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole right side went numb,'' Dishman said. ``My arm, my
leg. It was a little scary. You start thinking about what you're
going to be doing after football. It really stiffened up, but I
knew I would be all right. I was walking.''
</P>
<P>
   He attempted to practice a week later, and aggravated the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``All good players lie,'' explained George Warhop, the
Cardinals' offensive line coach. ``First they lie to themselves,
and then they lie to us and say, `I'm OK. I can go. I can go.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us he was ready to go, and he reinjured his neck the
next week. The next time, I wouldn't let him go. He said he was
ready, and I said, `Fine, we'll give it another week.' We would
rather have him for the last half of the season than lose him
because he came back too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time All-American at Nebraska, Dishman is quickly
beginning to fulfill the promise the Cardinals saw when they picked
him in the fourth round of the 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Nebraska linemen, including Cardinals teammate Aaron
Graham, Dishman had to make the adjustment from being primarily a
power run blocker at Nebraska to the pro game, in which a premium
is placed on pass-blocking skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come 10,000 miles since the start of training camp in
terms of technique and understanding,'' Warhop said. ``He was on
his way when he got hurt in the St. Louis game. He was playing his
best football. I thought he was really ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bonus is, he came back after missing four weeks and is
playing at almost the same level. That speaks highly of him for
staying in it and knowing what he needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dishman said he studied film, and tried to prepare as if he
still was going to play. But he admits the pass-blocking adjustment
is an ongoing project.

   ``It is definitely huge,'' he said. ``At Nebraska we ran the
ball 80 percent of the time, and when we did pass it was like an
option pass, the quarterback was moving. It was never a straight
drop back. It's night and day here. It's all about hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Nebraska it was just smash-mouth football. You find the guy
in front of you and hit him harder than you get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Warhop said Dishman is vastly improved and will get even better
in the passing game. And having him back in the lineup has lifted
the entire unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is a starter,'' Warhop said. ``When you're missing a
starter, it's not a reflection on the other guys, but they're not
the starter. You develop a chemistry with the guys who play beside
you. And when you're rolling guys in there out of position, it gets
kind of disjointed at times. That's the reality of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was a young, unproven offensive line to begin with. Not
surprisingly, the offensive line took the blame when the Cardinals'
offense struggled for the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line is five of the 11 guys out there, so we're
going to take the brunt of the criticism,'' Dishman said. ``We took
a lot of heat. You live with it. Going into the year, every paper
and magazine said we suck, we're not worth a damn. You read it, and
you let it go in one ear and out the other. I think that just makes
you want to prove yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   That was something more for Dishman to churn over during the
four games he missed. He said the club's 4-12 record last season
accounted for more losses than he had experienced in a lifetime.
And, of course, there were those thoughts about life after
football.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman wants to join World Championship Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be the Mexican Bandit or something,'' cracked Dishman,
who is of Hispanic descent. ``I'll be in the Latino World Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. And, like in the NFL, he can make his grand entrance
riding a Hog. &QL;

   TEXARKANA, ARK. _ Two cities with one name _ one in Arkansas,
the other in Texas _ meet invisibly in the middle of State Line
Avenue. Texarkana, Arkansas, and Texarkana, Texas, share an
airport, chamber of commerce and a library; the federal courthouse
and post office is in the center of the avenue, displaying both
state flags.
</P>
<P>
   But the two cities have different mayors, different sheriffs and
two sets of city government. Streets are numbered differently, so
that drivers, crossing State Line Avenue at 14th Street on the
Texas side, wind up on 12th Street in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In the bi-state Justice Building on the same avenue, the Bowie
County, Texas, sheriff's department has its headquarters on the
Arkansas side; the Arkansas-side city police department is in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   These Siamese-twin cities, 143 miles from Little Rock and 181
miles from Dallas, are also divided into a world of haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor stores, pawn shops and fast-food restaurants clutter the
Arkansas side; the Texas one booms with banks, restaurants,
department stores, car-dealers and the city's only shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   The two worlds of Texarkana sadly sum up an unintended lesson:
Arkansas's century-old usury law is not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas is a state with a populist tradition of limiting the
powerful, and especially of regulating the size and clout of
financial institutions. The state banned multibank holding
companies until 1983; and, since 1874, it has restricted interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Although most other states have some limits on interest rates
and fees, none is as restrictive as the Arkansas usury law, and no
other state has such a law as part of its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest incarnation, the interest-rate ceiling on consumer
loans is restricted to 5 percent above the Federal Reserve's
discount rate _ the amount the Fed charges banks for overnight
loans. At present, with the discount rate at 4 percent; 9 percent
is the most an Arkansas bank can charge.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law consider it a cornerstone of consumer
protection in Arkansas. Bankers argue, on the contrary, that the
law strangles economic growth by limiting credit and forcing money
to leave Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   It also hurts those who cannot put down the total price of a car
or a stove, since banks _ if they cannot adjust their rates
according to the credit risk _ simply will not take on loan-seekers
who may have a bad credit history.
</P>
<P>
   The poor must then turn to local loan sharks who illegally
charge interest rates of as much as 300 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   In order to compete a bit with Texarkana, Texas, a 1977 Arkansas
law exempts Texarkana, Ark., from the Arkansas state income tax.
Texas does not have such a tax at all. As a tradeoff for the
exemption, the Arkansas side collects a 1 percent higher state
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the income-tax exemption is obvious: if
Texarkana, Ark., had to pay the state income tax, residents and
business would have even more reason swiftly to move to Texas. Yet
even with the tax break, Texarkana, Ark., still cannot compete with
Texas because of the usury law.
</P>
<P>
   And that is unlikely to change any time soon. Since the usury
cap was an amendment to the state's constitution, only a statewide
referendum or federal legislation, which would override the state's
constitution, can abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   But Arkansans soundly rejected usury referendums in 1988 and
1990. On that last occasion, more than 65 percent of voters turned
down an amendment that would have raised the interest-rate ceiling
to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Arkansans continue to think they are being wise in the
short-term, the end result could be the demise of many of the
state's locally owned banks.
</P>
<P>
   It could also spell still worse times for Texarkana, Ark. As
out-of-state banks, like the ones in Texarkana, Texas, offer more
flexible credit packages, businesses and owners of expensive homes
will continue to decamp to the Texas side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Already, big business stays away from Texarkana, Ark., because
consumers prefer shopping on the Texas side. As a result, it is
getting easier every day to tell these Siamese-twin cities apart. &QL;

PLAYING CATCH HAS GOTTEN TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sunday against the Denver Broncos, Oakland wide
receiver
 &UR; Tim Brown made his best play of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was a tackle on an interception.
</P>
<P>
   This season, many of the league's top wide receivers have turned
from game breakers into excuse makers. A combination of injuries,
bad quarterbacking and lunkhead game plans have left owners
searching for somebody _ anybody _ who can catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the receivers ranked in the top 10 before the season
can't even crack a fantasy lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Take Lions wide receiver  &UR; Herman Moore. Please. Before the
Thanksgiving Day game, when he finally showed signs of life, he had
amassed a paltry 484 yards and developed a pathological fear of the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Moore has determined the reason for his lack of
production. It's everybody else's fault. He sulked with a leg
injury while  &UR; Johnnie Morton and some no-names picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy who was probably the second receiver taken in
some drafts. Makes you want to do yard work.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Other top receivers who couldn't catch a ``Seinfeld'' rerun:
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis receiver  &UR; Isaac Bruce has been hurt much of the year,
as has Patriots receiver  &UR; Terry Glenn and Cardinals wideout  &UR; Rob
Moore. Green Bay wide receiver  &UR; Robert Brooks has not fully
recovered from off-season back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, of the Raiders, has been lost in  &UR; Jon Gruden's offense
since
 &UR; Jeff George went down because of a groin pull. The most popular
target on the team seems to be tight-end  &UR; Rickey Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals wide receiver  &UR; Carl Pickens leads the AFC in yardage,
but has only found the end zone three times. This may have
something to do with  &UR; Neil O'Donnell, who doesn't have  &UR; Larry Brown
to throw to in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Bruce Coslet is down to third-string  &UR; Paul Justin at
quarterback. Who knows? One of the cheerleaders may be starting
before long.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a whole new crop of younger receivers is taking over.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC, Jets wide receiver  &UR; Keyshawn Johnson is finally
backing up his trash talk, grabbing eight touchdowns and ringing up
755 yards. The Colts'  &UR; Marvin Harrison is also shredding opposing
secondaries, with 741 yards and seven touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, all the talk is about Minnesota rookie sensation
 &UR; Randy
 &UR; Moss, the return of the human highlight film. Sunday against the
Packers, Moss looked like he was playing against his 12-year-old
nephews in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Comparing the Packers' secondary to 12-year-olds
is an insult.
</P>
<P>
   To 12-year-olds everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So who to go with down the stretch? I wouldn't give up on
Arizona's Moore, who looks like he's finally healthy. The fact that
 &UR; Jake Plummer woke up doesn't hurt Moore or teammate,  &UR; Frank
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   I think Denver wide receiver  &UR; Rod Smith will heat it up in the
last five games, with  &UR; Ed McCaffrey slowed because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   And if your league counts defensive statistics, you might stick
with Tim Brown. He's a heck of a tackler. &QL; 
Tip of the Week &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When basting your turkey, be sure to use natural . . . Wait a
minute, wrong tip. You've already eaten the turkey, and some of
your fantasy football turkeys already have been roasted. I'd start
every 49ers player I could get my hands on. I sense a Monday night
blowout against the Giants. &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City running back  &UR; Bam Morris is apparently determined to
stay out of the big house long enough to score some more
touchdowns. I'd start him this week against the Cardinals
defenders, who did a wonderful impression of turnstiles against
Washington. &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week it's Redskins quarterback  &UR; Trent Green, &UR; who threw for
382 yards and four touchdowns and ran for another. This time next
year, he'll be working at Wendy's. &QL; 
Bill Muller's Fantasy Football notebook appears every Friday. He

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD AND IRBIL _ An alleged assassination attempt on his
deputy, a powwow in London for 15 opposition groups hoping to
topple his regime, a call for him and his lieutenants to be tried
for war crimes, and yet another row with U.N. weapons inspectors:
on the face of it, the past week has brought nothing but bad news
for Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Is he losing sleep?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the place where Hussein sleeps each night, let alone
the quality of the sleep he gets, is a tightly guarded secret. But,
on closer examination, the events of the past week showed not how
tenuous his grip on power has become, but rather how far
international efforts to loosen it have yet to go.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money in Baghdad says Hussein is sleeping like a baby.
</P>
<P>
   That is not how the various Iraqi opposition groups assembled in
London on Nov. 23 saw things. The Iraqi regime is not as entrenched
as it seems, insisted Shia Islamists and secular nationalists
alike, doubtless salivating at the prospect of the $97 million that
America has said it will spend on groups trying to bring down
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans looked for likely candidates for their largesse
and the British mused about setting up a war-crimes tribunal on
Iraq, akin to the Bosnian model. But the opposition wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella group
claiming to represent all the opposition, told both American and
British officials that it would need some sort of territorial base
within Iraq, protected by foreign air power, from which to work for
the government's demise.
</P>
<P>
   America has tried this method once before, when it set up the
INC in Irbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish enclave in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the CIA, and with American and British aircraft
keeping the Iraqi air force at bay, the INC was supposed to swoop
down from the hills at the head of an army of baggy-trousered
peshmerga and sweep the Iraqi authorities away. Instead, the INC
found itself the victim of factional fighting between the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), one of the two main Kurdish
militias, asked Hussein for help against its rival, the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK). He gladly provided it, overrunning Irbil
in the process and forcing INC activists and the CIA to flee the
country or face his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kurdish factions now scoff at the thought of any
non-Kurdish opposition returning to the area. In the cool air of
their hilltop fastnesses, the toings and froings on the
Mesopotamian plain are distractions from the serious business of
building a viable Kurdish entity.
</P>
<P>
   Having signed a peace deal under American auspices in September,
the two sides are now bickering over its implementation. With the
maple leaves already fluttering to the ground, and the snow
spreading down the mountainsides, there will be no more fighting
before April.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the mustachioed warriors of Iraqi Kurdistan will pay
more attention to the battle unfolding on and across their northern
borders between the Turkish army and Turkey's own Kurdish rebels
than to any new adventures in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish factions depend on Hussein, both for cheap fuel and
for the smuggling business he encourages across northern Iraq.
Should any attempt at insurrection misfire, they point out, it
would be the people of Irbil, not the conference-goers in London,
who pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, they feel more secure with Hussein's weakened
regime at the center, and the American protection they enjoy so
long as it endures, than with the unpredictable outcome of an
internal coup. So the two main Kurdish parties sent only junior
representatives to the London meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Kurds, the Iraqi opposition looks flimsy. The
presence of so many groups in London illustrates how fractured and
ill-coordinated Hussein's enemies are.
</P>
<P>
   A senior KDP man says that inside Iraq, Ahmad Chalabi, the INC's
head, ``represents nothing.'' Although ordinary Iraqis do not dare
speak about the opposition to a foreigner, Chalabi's checkered
career both as a banker and a revolutionary is unlikely to impress
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds apart, few of the groups have any organization on the
ground. Even if the Shia Muslim rebels have retained their network
in southern Iraq after the brutal suppression of their insurrection
against Hussein in 1991, they have nothing to rival the Iraqi
army's tanks and artillery. Moreover, their Iranian backers are
refusing to work with America for Hussein's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Shias demonstrated their continued rebelliousness _ but also
their incompetence _ on Nov. 22, when someone in Kerbala, a
southern Shia city, tried to assassinate Izzat Ibrahim, Hussein's
deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).
</P>
<P>
   The assailant threw two grenades at Ibrahim's entourage, driving
through the dusty plaza that the Iraqi regime created when in 1991
it bulldozed the rebels' hideouts in the old souk.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim was not hurt, but bystanders were, allowing the regime
to denounce the ``cowardly crime that targeted the lives of
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the botched assassinations of Uday, Hussein's son, in 1996,
and Tariq Aziz, his mouthpiece, in 1980, the attack will probably
result in a police crackdown on the supposed perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Iraqi leadership has responded calmly. Aziz,
himself a member of the RCC, made a public appearance the next day
at a poetry festival where honey-tongued bards concocted unctuous
rhymes in praise of the regime. Neither in Baghdad, nor in Kerbala,
was there any sign of extra security on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers made brief mention of the attack before gliding
on to their daily tirade against Richard Butler, the head of
UNSCOM, whose job it is to disarm Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This ``enraged bull,'' as the local press puts it, has caused
Hussein far more bother than any opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   After the Iraqis bowed to the imminence of American bombs and
agreed to resume cooperation with UNSCOM, Butler demanded that they
produce a slew of documents deemed vital to UNSCOM's work.
</P>
<P>
   Risking renewed threat of American attack, the Iraqis wheeled
out official after official, looking fairly enraged themselves, to
argue that the papers had either already been handed over, or had
been destroyed, or never existed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis promised to show only one new document to UNSCOM, and
that in the presence of monitors from the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A badly split council issued a noncommittal statement that
reiterated its support for Butler without demanding that Iraq hand
over the disputed papers. But it also renewed the oil-for-food
deal, whereby Iraq sells oil to buy humanitarian goods, for six
months instead of the two the Iraqis think it should take to
complete the arms-control work.
</P>
<P>
   These differences will come to the fore during the
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's obligations promised by the
Security Council as soon as UNSCOM was up and running again.
</P>
<P>
   With Iraq demanding an end to sanctions, and America, its
bombers at the ready, refusing to countenance any such thing, there
could indeed be sleepless nights to come. &QL;

   BAGHDAD AND IRBIL _ An alleged assassination attempt on his
deputy, a powwow in London for 15 opposition groups hoping to
topple his regime, a call for him and his lieutenants to be tried
for war crimes, and yet another row with U.N. weapons inspectors:
on the face of it, the past week has brought nothing but bad news
for Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Is he losing sleep?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the place where Hussein sleeps each night, let alone
the quality of the sleep he gets, is a tightly guarded secret. But,
on closer examination, the events of the past week showed not how
tenuous his grip on power has become, but rather how far
international efforts to loosen it have yet to go.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money in Baghdad says Hussein is sleeping like a baby.
</P>
<P>
   That is not how the various Iraqi opposition groups assembled in
London on Nov. 23 saw things. The Iraqi regime is not as entrenched
as it seems, insisted Shia Islamists and secular nationalists
alike, doubtless salivating at the prospect of the $97 million that
America has said it will spend on groups trying to bring down
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans looked for likely candidates for their largesse
and the British mused about setting up a war-crimes tribunal on
Iraq, akin to the Bosnian model. But the opposition wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella group
claiming to represent all the opposition, told both American and
British officials that it would need some sort of territorial base
within Iraq, protected by foreign air power, from which to work for
the government's demise.
</P>
<P>
   America has tried this method once before, when it set up the
INC in Irbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish enclave in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the CIA, and with American and British aircraft
keeping the Iraqi air force at bay, the INC was supposed to swoop
down from the hills at the head of an army of baggy-trousered
peshmerga and sweep the Iraqi authorities away. Instead, the INC
found itself the victim of factional fighting between the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), one of the two main Kurdish
militias, asked Hussein for help against its rival, the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK). He gladly provided it, overrunning Irbil
in the process and forcing INC activists and the CIA to flee the
country or face his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kurdish factions now scoff at the thought of any
non-Kurdish opposition returning to the area. In the cool air of
their hilltop fastnesses, the toings and froings on the
Mesopotamian plain are distractions from the serious business of
building a viable Kurdish entity.
</P>
<P>
   Having signed a peace deal under American auspices in September,
the two sides are now bickering over its implementation. With the
maple leaves already fluttering to the ground, and the snow
spreading down the mountainsides, there will be no more fighting
before April.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the mustachioed warriors of Iraqi Kurdistan will pay
more attention to the battle unfolding on and across their northern
borders between the Turkish army and Turkey's own Kurdish rebels
than to any new adventures in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish factions depend on Hussein, both for cheap fuel and
for the smuggling business he encourages across northern Iraq.
Should any attempt at insurrection misfire, they point out, it
would be the people of Irbil, not the conference-goers in London,
who pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, they feel more secure with Hussein's weakened
regime at the center, and the American protection they enjoy so
long as it endures, than with the unpredictable outcome of an
internal coup. So the two main Kurdish parties sent only junior
representatives to the London meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Kurds, the Iraqi opposition looks flimsy. The
presence of so many groups in London illustrates how fractured and
ill-coordinated Hussein's enemies are.
</P>
<P>
   A senior KDP man says that inside Iraq, Ahmad Chalabi, the INC's
head, ``represents nothing.'' Although ordinary Iraqis do not dare
speak about the opposition to a foreigner, Chalabi's checkered
career both as a banker and a revolutionary is unlikely to impress
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds apart, few of the groups have any organization on the
ground. Even if the Shia Muslim rebels have retained their network
in southern Iraq after the brutal suppression of their insurrection
against Hussein in 1991, they have nothing to rival the Iraqi
army's tanks and artillery. Moreover, their Iranian backers are
refusing to work with America for Hussein's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Shias demonstrated their continued rebelliousness _ but also
their incompetence _ on Nov. 22, when someone in Kerbala, a
southern Shia city, tried to assassinate Izzat Ibrahim, Hussein's
deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).
</P>
<P>
   The assailant threw two grenades at Ibrahim's entourage, driving
through the dusty plaza that the Iraqi regime created when in 1991
it bulldozed the rebels' hideouts in the old souk.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim was not hurt, but bystanders were, allowing the regime
to denounce the ``cowardly crime that targeted the lives of
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the botched assassinations of Uday, Hussein's son, in 1996,
and Tariq Aziz, his mouthpiece, in 1980, the attack will probably
result in a police crackdown on the supposed perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Iraqi leadership has responded calmly. Aziz,

COYOTES TOP DEVILS 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Devils viewed back-to-back games against Dallas
and Phoenix as tests. How did they stack up with other elite teams?
They erupted for five goals against the Stars, but it wasn't as
easy Thursday night against the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes jumped on the Devils early and skated to a 3-2
triumph that extended their winning streak to seven and their
undefeated streak to 13 (11-0-2). Their last loss came against
Dallas on Oct. 22, and their record of 13-2-2 is the best in the
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has not allowed more than two goals a game since their
opening-game loss to Ottawa. The Coyotes' superior defensive play
has been the main reason they are atop the Western Conference and
the team with the league's best winning percentage (.867).
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot for the Devils (12-7-1) was Petr Sykora,
who scored two goals in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bounced back and scored a couple of goals,'' Devils Coach
Robbie Ftorek said. ``We just came a goal short. The effort was
there, and I liked the way the guys played.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix applied pressure on the Devils and opened the scoring
just 74 seconds into the game. Rick Tocchet stepped into the slot
and deflected a shot by Greg Adams from the left circle for his
eighth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Adams scored the second goal, 8 minutes 43 seconds into the
period, when he skated down the left wing and beat Martin Brodeur
to the glove side with a blistering shot from the top of the left
circle for his second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who made his sixth consecutive start, had a clear view
of the shot, but the Devils goaltender reacted late. He also
reacted too slowly on the second goal of the night by Adams, at 57
seconds into the last period. Brodeur's loss was the first in his
last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   With a day off before the game at Colorado on Saturday night,
then two more days off before the conclusion of the trip in
Washington on Tuesday, it is feasible that Brodeur will also start
the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey defense played without Kevin Dean for the first
time this season. He sustained a groin injury in the victory in
Dallas, and Ftorek was forced to look elsewhere to find a partner
for Scott Stevens for the first time this season. The Devils' coach
used Lyle Odelein in Dean's spot with Stevens, Ken Daneyko with
Sheldon Souray, and Scott Niedermayer with Brad Bombardir.

FLUTIE DRAMA UNBEATABLE IN FOXBOROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Doug Flutie knows for certain he has never
lost in Foxboro Stadium, but he isn't sure if it is 10 games, as
the media said to him, or as Flutie put it, ``I've heard 9-0. I
don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one football fact of which Flutie is certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never lost a home start in the NFL,'' said the Bills'
quarterback. ``And it's a big advantage to be playing at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie is coming ``home'' to New England Sunday, repeating what
he's done the last four or five years when he's come home in late
November or early December and gone to a Patriots game in Foxboro
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to a handful of Patriot games the last couple of
years, toward the end of the year, when it was December and I was
home,'' said Flutie. ``And it was fun to be in that atmosphere
there, fun to just go there.''
</P>
<P>
   That was after the end, usually the glorious end, of his
Canadian Football League season. On Thanksgiving, of course, he'd
never miss the Natick-Framingham game, and usually there'd be a
game of touch football ``with some guys I went to high school with
on the Saturday after Thanksgiving.'' Having fun, loving football.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday Flutie will be returning to play and, as Patriot
linebacker Chris Slade said, ``I'm sure -there'll be people
cheering for him. He's still a hero here. He's an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   And Boston never really lets go of its icons, even if Boston's
teams are all too ready all too often to send their icons
elsewhere. But when they come back to Boston to play or coach,
Larry Bird, Bobby Orr, Carlton Fisk, Robert Parish, Roger Clemens,
and so many other icons learn that New Englanders still clasp them
to their breasts. And Flutie is as much an icon _ still _ as most
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I'll be playing there as the visiting
quarterback,'' said Flutie. ``I've done well there because I've
played in front of my friends and my family and people who've been
behind you. And no matter what the situation was, everybody in the
stands always believed in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just always had that confidence that people were behind
you and the fans were behind you and the crowd noise and
everything. And you, you know, found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last five words from Flutie's mouth, words that he seemed
almost reluctant to say _ ``found a way to win'' _ encapsulate
exactly why Flutie became the icon he did.
</P>
<P>
   In familiar words used by many a Flutie opponent in the past,
Patriot defensive lineman Chad Eaton said the strategy for stopping
him should be simple: ``Keep him in the pocket, make him throw out
of a barrel, because he can't see. As long as we're disciplined and
keep him inside, it shouldn't be any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmmm. New England fans have heard those words, or words like
them, many a time. As have fans in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary,
and all across Canada. And, many a time, those words have had to be
eaten after Flutie has forced them down the throats of their
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd be upset if there are many people in Foxborough
cheering for Flutie instead of the Patriots, Eaton said cheerily,
``I'm sick of Flutie Flakes. I'm sure Doug is sick of them, too.
But I know he's going to have the fans here. And I know (Patriot
defensive linemate and Boston College graduate) Chris Sullivan will
be cheering for him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Buffalo coach Wade Phillips recently said, ``He does
things that you don't know he can do. I mean, he runs down the
field and laterals the ball _ an overhand lateral 20 yards
downfield _ and does things you don't expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie would say only that it'll be fun for him to be back in
Foxboro Stadium, but if Buffalo wins, Flutie will be sure to open
more of his feelings. The Bills should have beaten the Patriots
easily two Sundays ago in Orchard Park, N.Y., but Flutie played
poorly as the Bills got closer to the end zone, and the Patriots
nearly pulled out a game that shouldn't have been as close as the
13-10 final score.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the drama of Flutie's return is charged even more by Drew
Bledsoe's defining drive last Monday night, when it was Bledsoe who
did anything it took to win, even playing the final two minutes
with a broken finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's changed the way you guys (in the media) view
Drew,'' said Flutie. ``I've been a big supporter of his all along,
and I think he's been a fantastic quarterback. That was a great
game to watch. It was a signature game for Drew and it may change
the way people view Drew.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Flutie added words so typical of him, because he loves
football almost as much as a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to watch them as they spread the field against
Miami,'' said Flutie. ``I see Drew spreading the field and throwing
the ball and that scares the living daylights out of me and I hope
our defense is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday he'll be back home, playing in a stadium where he's
never lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``One interesting note,'' Flutie added. ``This'll be the first
time I'll be playing in Foxboro Stadium on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie will be at home playing against the home team.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will cheer both teams. The script for Doug Flutie's
football career gets ever more creative.

</P>
<P>
   A senior KDP man says that inside Iraq, Ahmad Chalabi, the INC's
head, ``represents nothing.'' Although ordinary Iraqis do not dare
speak about the opposition to a foreigner, Chalabi's checkered
career both as a banker and a revolutionary is unlikely to impress
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds apart, few of the groups have any organization on the
ground. Even if the Shia Muslim rebels have retained their network
in southern Iraq after the brutal suppression of their insurrection
against Hussein in 1991, they have nothing to rival the Iraqi
army's tanks and artillery. Moreover, their Iranian backers are
refusing to work with America for Hussein's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Shias demonstrated their continued rebelliousness _ but also
their incompetence _ on Nov. 22, when someone in Kerbala, a
southern Shia city, tried to assassinate Izzat Ibrahim, Hussein's
deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).
</P>
<P>
   The assailant threw two grenades at Ibrahim's entourage, driving
through the dusty plaza that the Iraqi regime created when in 1991
it bulldozed the rebels' hideouts in the old souk.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim was not hurt, but bystanders were, allowing the regime
to denounce the ``cowardly crime that targeted the lives of
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the botched assassinations of Uday, Hussein's son, in 1996,
and Tariq Aziz, his mouthpiece, in 1980, the attack will probably
result in a police crackdown on the supposed perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Iraqi leadership has responded calmly. Aziz,
himself a member of the RCC, made a public appearance the next day
at a poetry festival where honey-tongued bards concocted unctuous
rhymes in praise of the regime. Neither in Baghdad, nor in Kerbala,
was there any sign of extra security on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers made brief mention of the attack before gliding
on to their daily tirade against Richard Butler, the head of
UNSCOM, whose job it is to disarm Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This ``enraged bull,'' as the local press puts it, has caused
Hussein far more bother than any opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   After the Iraqis bowed to the imminence of American bombs and
agreed to resume cooperation with UNSCOM, Butler demanded that they
produce a slew of documents deemed vital to UNSCOM's work.
</P>
<P>
   Risking renewed threat of American attack, the Iraqis wheeled
out official after official, looking fairly enraged themselves, to
argue that the papers had either already been handed over, or had
been destroyed, or never existed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis promised to show only one new document to UNSCOM, and
that in the presence of monitors from the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A badly split council issued a noncommittal statement that
reiterated its support for Butler without demanding that Iraq hand
over the disputed papers. But it also renewed the oil-for-food
deal, whereby Iraq sells oil to buy humanitarian goods, for six
months instead of the two the Iraqis think it should take to
complete the arms-control work.
</P>
<P>
   These differences will come to the fore during the
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's obligations promised by the
Security Council as soon as UNSCOM was up and running again.
</P>
<P>
   With Iraq demanding an end to sanctions, and America, its
bombers at the ready, refusing to countenance any such thing, there
could indeed be sleepless nights to come. &QL;

DUQUETTE SHOPS; RED SOX DROP 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Friday's the biggest shopping day of the year, so don't
be surprised if Dan Duquette elbows you in the ribs reaching for a
shiny new toy in the aisles of Toys 'R' Us. Dan's got a lot of
shopping to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox in this holiday season have become Fools 'R' Us. Mo
Vaughn Thursday went for a Thanksgiving feast of Angel Food Cake,
Bernie Williams feasted on Yankee Pot Roast, while Duquette sat
down to a big bowl of gruel with a side order of crow.
</P>
<P>
   No Mo. No Bernie. No Respect. Not Much Hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Thanksgiving Eve Mo/Bernie Massacre already is part of Red
Sox folklore. In the pantheon of Boston's offseason buffooneries,
it goes right in there alongside the sale of Babe Ruth, Haywood
Sullivan forgetting to mail Carlton Fisk a contract on time, and
Roger Clemens's defection to a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it, baseball fans. In this century, the Red Sox have
said goodbye to Ruth, Fisk, Clemens, and Vaughn without getting a
single major league player in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaughn departure came two years after Clemens bolted, one
year after Duquette said the club could not allow it to happen
again. Ugh. Only the Red Sox could lose two franchise players in
three years this way. Nice maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, you see, think they are smarter than every other team
in baseball. Only the Sox are smart enough to reward Troy O'Leary,
Reggie Jefferson, and Jeff Frye _ then drag their heels on Vaughn
because they know a little secret something about him.
</P>
<P>
   John Harrington and Duquette are so smart they were the only
ones who knew that Mo was a bad guy. And they were also the only
ones who didn't know they were being used by Williams and his
agent.
</P>
<P>
   There's a connection. Believe it. Williams is a smart man. Why
would he want to come to the team that would not have Vaughn? Don't
underestimate this dynamic. Ballplayers today are fraternity
brothers, more loyal to each other than to their ball clubs. If you
play for the Orioles, you care more about Don Fehr than Peter
Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is one of the most respected players in baseball. Stars
of other teams are drawn to him. In clubhouses of both leagues,
ballplayers will seek out a Boston sportswriter, and ask, ``What's
up with Mo? Why aren't they taking care of Mo? Why do they treat Mo
like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams could not help but be influenced. But he and agent
Scott Boras were happy to use the Red Sox to jack up the price for
the Yankees (``The Red Sox drove the price up,'' confirmed Yankee
GM Brian Cashman). It's the same trick Kirby Puckett and his people
pulled when they came to Boston and went out to dinner with Lou
Gorman and Harrington a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this hurts more because it's the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   As it was early in the century, it is today. When was the last
time Boston got the better of New York in one of these deals? We
thought we tricked 'em when we unloaded Sparky Lyle for Danny
Cater, but then Lyle went out and won the Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clemens has won back-to-back Cys after the Duke announced
that Roger was in the ``twilight'' of his career. Now Mo is the
highest-paid player in baseball after the Sox spent two years
pretending to try to sign him. Now Bernie is back in center with
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Now we've got astronomical ticket prices and an overpaid Jose
Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette sounded unusually vulnerable and wounded in his
interview with the Globe's Gordon Edes Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go?'' asked the Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously bitter at being used by Williams, Duquette said, ``We
impressed him? That's nice to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duke is not the only scapegoat for Sox fans. Invisible Man
Harrington _ the Cowardly Lion of Boston sports _ should come out
and face the fandom after this debacle. Maybe he can tell us again
that players not wanting to come here is pure ``blather.''
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you there wasn't much joy in the Shaughnessy kitchen
on Thanksgiving morning. Thirteen-year-old Kate, ever a soldier in
Mo's army of kids, didn't want to hear about any Offermans. Looking
at the front page of Thursday's Globe sports section (``Sox losers,
Yankees keepers''), Kate spoke for many Red Sox fans when she
sighed and said, ``We're gonna suck again.''

<P>
   HONG KONG _ As a morning rush-hour crowd passes, a lone worker
changes the signs at one of Hong Kong's subway stops: the Victoria
Park/Daimaru exit is becoming just Victoria Park.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, four Chinese day tourists at Ocean Park, a
Hong Kong amusement park, chat happily over the lunch they have
brought with them, a rice and fish-ball meal wrapped in dried
banana leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Together these two small scenes tell a terrifying story about
the city's _ and the region's _ tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong used to be a favorite destination for Japan's
free-spending tourists, who came for cheap shopping, a glimpse of
colonial Britain and the city's fabled nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the 2.3 million Japanese visitors to Hong Kong accounted
for more than a fifth of the city's tourists, more than any other
country; and they spent more per visit (nearly $1,000 on average)
than anyone but the few rich Arabs. Five Japanese-owned retail
chains opened huge department stores to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hong Kong returned to China in July 1997, it lost its
colonial appeal. The region's simultaneous decline into economic
crisis left the Japanese poorer and Hong Kong, one of the few Asian
economies not to devalue its currency, one of the most expensive
spots in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese visitors dropped by a half over the next year, and the
consequences have been felt across the city. Next month Daimaru,
one of the Japanese department-store chains, will become the third
to close its doors in Hong Kong since the handover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the picture had appeared to brighten. Since
July, Hong Kong's tourist figures have been growing again, after
more than a year of decline.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Hong Kong's shops, most of these new tourists
are not returning Japanese but mainland Chinese, bused in on budget
day-excursions, lunch in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Average per-capita tourist spending in the first nine months of
the year was down 28 percent; even with the slight increase in
arrivals, total tourism income has fallen by more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is visible all over Southeast Asia. In recent years
tourism has accounted for more than 10 percent of the region's GDP
and an even bigger share of foreign-exchange earnings and jobs.
Nowhere has been hit as hard as Hong Kong, but over the past year
most destinations have seen tourist arrivals fall by 15-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The World Tourism Organization reckons that Asia will get 5
million fewer tourists this year than last, and send 7 million-8
million fewer tourists to Europe and North America, cutting at
least a percentage point off global tourism growth rates (to as
little as 1.5 percent this year, compared with 2.8 percent in 1997
and 5.6 percent in 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Most countries have not released tourism earnings numbers for
this year, but the crisis-hit second half of last year is a hint of
the carnage to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's arrivals were down 1.3 percent last year, but
tourism earnings fell by 14 percent. Thailand and Indonesia both
saw visitor numbers rise slightly, but revenues fell by 20 percent
and 16 percent, respectively. To a lesser extent, the same trend
blights Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   These figures all relate to dollar income from tourism. Currency
devaluations muddy the waters, but Hong Kong, with the statistical
clarity of an unchanged currency, is a good yardstick: Malaysians
are spending half what they did a year ago, Indonesians and Thais
two-thirds, Singaporeans and Filipinos three-quarters. This is a
bigger change than poor tipping.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the rest of the region, visitors will probably start
to relax their grip on their wallets as the economy improves. But
Hong Kong's tourism industry may never fully recover. The colonial
mystique is gone for good, as are many of the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland visitors were by far the fastest-growing group in
October, up by nearly a fifth, as Hong Kong relaxed a visa quota
instituted in a panic about illegal immigration after the handover.
Most stay in cheap hotels, or return before nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate Hong Kong, once Asia's tourist capital, will soon
be known as a cut-price theme park for Guangdong day-trippers. &QL;

two-thirds, Singaporeans and Filipinos three-quarters. This is a
bigger change than poor tipping.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the rest of the region, visitors will probably start
to relax their grip on their wallets as the economy improves. But
Hong Kong's tourism industry may never fully recover. The colonial
mystique is gone for good, as are many of the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland visitors were by far the fastest-growing group in
October, up by nearly a fifth, as Hong Kong relaxed a visa quota
instituted in a panic about illegal immigration after the handover.
Most stay in cheap hotels, or return before nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate Hong Kong, once Asia's tourist capital, will soon
be known as a cut-price theme park for Guangdong day-trippers. &QL;

KANSAS STATE'S TOUGHEST FOE: COACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Check out the ESPN-USA Today coaches poll today and
then take a look on Sunday. Don't be surprised if you find a change
at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Why? No reason, really. But the odds are it's going to change.
Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Tennessee plays Vanderbilt in its final regular-season
game Saturday. Kansas State is done until the Big 12 championship
game Dec. 5 against Texas A&AMP;M in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which is 5 points behind the Wildcats in the coaches
poll but 30 points ahead of them in the writers' poll, should beat
up on Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   That's going to impress some coaches, enough to enable Tennessee
to pick up those 5 points to get into the No. 1 slot.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is wrong. Kansas State can do nothing worse
than have a bad week of practice, which shouldn't cost a team
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But some coaches will switch if Tennessee does what is expected
and runs up a big victory.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of such a move is tough to follow. If a voter was
going to be impressed with Tennessee, why not reward the Vols after
last week's pounding of a decent Kentucky team?
</P>
<P>
   If a voter didn't move the Vols past Kansas State last week, why
would he do it this week for pounding a bad Vanderbilt team?
</P>
<P>
   For those Oliver Stone fans out there, there may be a reason.
The coaches have said that the winner of the Fiesta Bowl will be
their national champion.
</P>
<P>
   No debate. No argument. Done.
</P>
<P>
   The writers, always mindful of controversy, said they will wait
until all the bowls are finished and then vote. No guarantees for
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Right now we have this possibility: No. 2 Tennessee beats No. 3
UCLA in a lackluster Fiesta Bowl. The coaches would have no choice.
Tennessee would be their national champion.
</P>
<P>
   While that is happening, No. 1 Kansas State beats up No. 4
Florida State in the Sugar Bowl. The writers decide that Kansas
State deserves the top ranking, while the coaches watch in dismay
as they relegate their No. 1 team during the regular season to No.
2.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this potential embarrassment, Tennessee needs to be No.
1 in the coaches poll, which is why it will be interesting to see
how the votes come out on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? First ``60 Minutes'' decides to show one
of Dr.  &UR; Jack Kevorkian's &LR;  assisted suicides, and now Oklahoma
television shows the firing of Sooners football coach  &UR; John Blake &LR; .
Obviously, real death and the death of a coaching tenure are not
the same, but both broadcasts are sick. When Blake was fired by the
board of regents earlier this week, the vote on whether to keep or
dismiss him was televised, with each voter announcing his vote.
Thankfully, Blake was told the outcome before the television
audience was. Blake was 12-22 in his first three seasons, but the
Sooners had won three of their last four games. It wasn't enough
... Don't be surprised if Florida defensive coordinator  &UR; Bobby
Stoops &LR;  winds up in Norman. That's unless he replaces  &UR; Hayden Fry &LR; 
at Iowa ... Word has it that Mississippi coach  &UR; Tom Tuberville &LR;  is
very close to making a deal to move over to Auburn. Hmm. Wasn't
this the same coach who said he was not a candidate for that job
and was surprised and angered to see his name mentioned? ... If
Temple coach  &UR; Bobby Wallace &LR;  is indeed out of the mix for the
Auburn job, Owls officials are prepared to give Wallace an
extension that will put him under contract for eight years and
include both a raise and a huge buyout clause. Eight years at
Temple?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fry ends his coaching career without a national championship but
with a legacy that produced some pretty good football in Iowa City
over two decades. During that time, the Hawkeyes made 14 bowl
appearances, which is 14 more than in the previous 20 years of Iowa
football. ``I would have rather gone out with a real good season,''
said Fry, who finished 3-8. ``I've always been an optimist. I never
dreamed that we would experience all the problems we had.'' ... The
horrible year in the state of South Carolina resulted in both
Clemson's  &UR; Tommy West &LR;  and South Carolina's  &UR; Brad Scott &LR;  getting
fired. It was so bad at the end that this joke was going around the
state last week: Before the annual regular-season finale between
South Carolina and Clemson, someone smashed the window of a
Gamecock fan's car. Ten tickets to the Clemson game were sitting on
the front seat. When the owner came back, he found 20 tickets on
the front seat ... Scott's fall from grace was particularly hard.
In 1994, the former Florida State assistant led the Gamecocks to
victory in the Carquest Bowl, the first bowl win in school history,
and was a leading candidate to replace  &UR; Dennis Erickson &LR;  at Miami.
Four years later, South Carolina was 1-10, the worst record in the
105-year history of the program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All you Notre Dame fans out there, here's what it looks like for
your team in terms of the postseason. A win over Southern Cal
Saturday puts the Irish in a Bowl Championship Series bowl. Which
one? Well, that depends on a few things, mainly the result of the
Arizona-Arizona State game. An Arizona win puts the Wildcats in the
Rose Bowl against Wisconsin. And that more than likely puts the
Irish in the Orange Bowl in Miami against the winner of Saturday's
Syracuse-Miami game, while Florida State and either Kansas State or
possibly Ohio State face off in the Sugar Bowl. A Notre Dame loss
sends the Irish to the Gator Bowl against Georgia Tech ... Two of
the hottest coaches in Division 1-AA are Massachusetts'  &UR; Mark
Whipple &LR;  and Connecticut's  &UR; Skip Holtz &LR; , both of whom are in
playoff games Saturday. Don't expect either coach to be in 1-AA
much longer. Whipple has done a marvelous rebuilding job, and
Minuteman athletic director  &UR; Bob Marcum &LR;  knows it and knows Whipple
will probably get calls as 1-A jobs open up. ``That to me is a sign
of Mark doing a good job,'' said Marcum, who says he will deal with
potential suitors when they arrive ... If Syracuse is going to
establish itself as a legitimate Top 15 program, it must beat Miami
this afternoon. The Orangemen have proven they can beat and play
with anyone (Michigan and Tennessee). They also have proven they
can lose to anyone (North Carolina State, West Virginia) ...  &UR; Lou
Holtz &LR;  to South Carolina? Stranger things have happened.

FOR SOME, HOLIDAY JUST ANOTHER DAY OF THE WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ West Hills Flower Shop owner Kimberlee Liebman
knew Thursday would be a busy day, and indeed it was. She sold all
70 of the ``harvest bouquet specials'' within four hours to
customers heading for holiday meals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she worked alone because her four employees were at home
with their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work long hours up until the day of Thanksgiving, so it's
nice to give them the day off with their families,'' said Liebman.
``It's kind of like a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebman was one of many whose holiday was a working day because
their stores, restaurants, gas stations and other businesses
provide goods and services needed every day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen shoppers were waiting for Jerri Goldberg to
open the Rite Aid drugstore in Winnetka. A storewide sale began
Thursday and Goldberg, the store manager, had the task of finding
toys, holiday decorations and other items for curious customers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg gave her two assistants the day off. ``They have
families, too, so I said I would open.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving also is a day for family gatherings in both the
Liebman and Goldberg homes _ but the customers come first.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling and going about their business, many holiday workers
returned home later Thanksgiving Day to families who appreciate
such hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My customers know I'm open every holiday. Fourth of July, New
Year's, Labor Day. Every holiday, I'm open,'' said Huy Lao, manager
of Donut Star, a popular spot in Sun Valley, an L.A.-area suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Lao knows he has a need to meet. ``All the neighbors come out
... even on a holiday. They still need coffee and a doughnut in the
morning. That's why we keep it open.''
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Thanksgiving has been just another day of work for
Jaspir Bajwa at his Canoga Park 7-Eleven store. He enjoys meeting
new faces and the holiday brings in business from beyond the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's comparatively a busy day and that's because other places
are closed,'' Bajwa said. ``They need last-minute stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bajwa sells beer and wine, milk and ice cream, and even
Christmas stuff, his family gathers at home with friends and
relatives to enjoy a meal. The native of India has adopted the
uniquely American holiday, mostly as a result of raising two
daughters and a son in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has different ideas. Some people get together with
families, some people say that's too much of a mess. But
Thanksgiving is thanks for God and everything he gives you,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Working on Thanksgiving doesn't necessarily mean missing out on
all the turkey and trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   When the workday was done for Liebman and Goldberg, they headed
home for bountiful meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 20 people coming for dinner at 7 p.m., so I'm going to
be a little bit late,'' Goldberg said. ``But I have daughters to
help and I did a lot of my cooking last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Being prepared is something Liebman appreciates. ``I did it this
morning. The turkey and the stuffing is in the oven. My husband is
the baster. The other stuff, people bring.'' &QL;

HINES LIGHTS FIRE UNDER GADZURIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYAMON, Puerto Rico _ UCLA sophomore guard Rico Hines was
credited with two assists in the Bruins' 69-62 victory Thursday
over San Francisco in the first round of the Puerto Rico Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   He should have had one more.
</P>
<P>
   Hines watched in frustration as Bruins freshman center Dan
Gadzuric made one basket and committed two fouls in the first half.
So when UCLA returned to the court for second-half warmups, Hines
pulled Gadzuric aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to play ball,'' he said. ``It's time to make your
presence felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprised but inspired, Gadzuric did just that _ scoring 10
points and grabbing two steals in the second half to help the
Bruins pull away in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first major contribution of the season for Gadzuric,
the heralded center from Holland by way of Gov. Dummer Academy in
Byfield, Mass. Slowed by tendinitis, he missed significant
preseason practice time and is gradually regaining his timing and
conditioning. Thursday, he joined fellow freshman Matt Barnes as
the primary reason for UCLA's survival.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:18 remaining, Gadzuric followed a Barnes miss to give the
Bruins a 60-57 lead. Two possessions later, he spun past his
defender in the low post for a layup that gave UCLA a 64-57
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down, so I had to do something,'' Gadzuric said.
``Rico really helped me out. That was real teammate stuff. I played
much better in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sweet shot: If it were up to Brandon Loyd, UCLA would play
all its games in the Carribean.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about it that helps me get a nice, easy
sweat going,'' Loyd said.
</P>
<P>
   And the more he sweats, the better he shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd perspired early and often against San Francisco, coming off
the bench to make three 3-pointers in the opening half _ 25 percent
of UCLA's first-half point total.
</P>
<P>
   He played just three minutes in the second half after tripping
over coach Steve Lavin on the right sideline and spraining his
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   __ Old friends: Hines attended St. John's at Prospect Hall, a
prep school stationed a few miles from Maryland's campus. He played
pickup games with many of the Terrapins and played against a few in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be real interesting,'' he said. ``The East Coast guys
all think UCLA is soft, but this is a different era.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Bruins ready? Lavin thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they guys are eager to play a Top 10 team,'' he said.
``They're eager to be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Deja vu-CLA: Unlike last season, when Toby Bailey, J.R.
Henderson and Kris Johnson led the Bruins in scoring in 31 of 33
games, this year could bring a different high scorer each week.
</P>
<P>
   For Loyd, that's a basket in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a senior in high school watching the 1995
team,'' he said. ``That year, Ed (O'Bannon) was consistent every
night, but you'd have Toby getting two against Oklahoma State and
then 26 against Arkansas. Or George (Zidek) would get 15 points one
night and seven the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes a good team. It's a positive thing when you have
different people stepping up each night.''

   HEALTH-PREMIUMS (Undated) _ Many working Americans will pay 8 to

   SINGAPORE-HONGKONG (Singapore) _ While Singapore has thrown off
old regulations and taken a knife to its high costs, Hong Kong has
moved in the opposite direction, intervening to prop up its stock
market, imposing a raft of new restrictions on trading, and
suspending government sales of land to stem the decline in real
estate prices. As a result, economists say, Singapore could emerge
from the Asian economic crisis in better shape than the normally
resilient Hong Kong. By Mark Landler.

   BANKS-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers Trust
are expected to complete what could become the largest

itself has been a ravenous acquirer of late, and its most

BOSTON, WITH VAUGHN GONE, NOW CAN'T WIN FOR SIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year or so ago, the Yankees offered Bernie Williams $37.5
million for five years and the Boston Red Sox offered Mo Vaughn
$20.2 million for two years. In the space of an hour or so
Wednesday, Williams accepted the Yankees' offer of $87.5 million
for seven years and Vaughn said I do to the Anaheim Angels'
proposal of $80 million for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals, who are for sale, have received only one
offer for $75 million, and the man making the offer needed 42
partners to get there.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner didn't need any partners to lure Williams
back, not even Cablevision. The Angels' acquisition of Vaughn is a
message from the team's controlling owner, Walt Disney Co., that it
is ready to compete seriously for post-season play.
</P>
<P>
   The signings were not unrelated. The common thread was the Red
Sox. And, as has become typical of Boston in recent years, it
emerged as the big loser.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox made it possible for Vaughn to join the Angels by
ending negotiations after he rejected their five-year, $63 million
offer. They then smoothed the path for Williams to return to the
Yankees by making him an offer that baseball officials have
estimated was between $81 million and $91 million.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees saw that Williams was seriously contemplating a
defection to Boston, they decided they could not allow a reprise of
sleeping with the enemy. That is, Steinbrenner decided.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning what had been the team's firm hold at $60 million for
five years, the principal owner quickly raised the offer by nearly
50 percent. If he had capitulated to Charles Dolan the way he did
to Williams, Cablevision would now own two-thirds of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees wound up keeping their own player, but because he
was so close to signing with the Red Sox, it had the effect of the
Red Sox' losing yet another player to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Vaughn and the decision of Williams have left
the Red Sox devoid of a big hitter in the middle of their lineup.
It didn't have to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   For an entire year the Red Sox took a weird approach in their
attempts to sign Vaughn, their first baseman, No. 1 offensive force
and team leader, one of the most popular athletes ever to play in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When they offered $20.2 million for two years, the terms were a
reduction from their previous offer of $30 million for three years.
They then exacerbated the situation by signing their new pitcher,
Pedro Martinez, to a record six-year, $75 million contract before
completing the Vaughn negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox officials maintained that the Martinez signing had no
bearing on a contract for Vaughn, who in the previous five seasons
had batted .310 and averaged 34.6 home runs and 109.6 runs batted
in per season. No one took their position seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was an every-fifth-day player and would have been
eligible to be a free agent this winter. He was going to be the
team's No. 1 starting pitcher, but Vaughn, who also was heading for
free agency, was an everyday player, a homegrown hero who was the
team's No. 1 player. No bearing?
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox had taken care of Vaughn before they made
Martinez the highest-paid player ever (to that point), they could
have had Vaughn for $44 million for four years, a friend of his
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox even bungled their recent negotiations. With their
final offer, $63 million for five years, they asked Vaughn to
accept less than the Angels' offer of $72 million for six years,
but they refused to give him the protection of a no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who are also trying to sign Randy Johnson, not only
raised their offer to $80 million but also gave Vaughn a veto over
any trade for the first two years and the right to name six, then
eight teams to which he can be traded in subsequent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost Vaughn, the Red Sox set out on a course that sent
Williams back to the Yankees and them down a dead end road. They
have to find the 40 home runs and 115 runs batted in that Vaughn
provided last season elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a change in their most recently stated position, the Red
Sox will not seek Albert Belle as a possible replacement and they
don't seem enthralled with the idea of Rafael Palmeiro despite his
consistently productive career.
</P>
<P>
   Belle had been engaged in a debate with himself, deciding
whether he wanted to play for the Yankees, a winning team with a
great history, or the Baltimore Orioles, who play in a park that
probably has been the most productive for him and a city that is
smaller than New York and would create less stress for him
personally than New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York option was blown away in the gust of wind that
brought Bernie back, leaving the Orioles as Belle's most likely
destination for five years at perhaps $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' return, though too expensive in the thinking of some
of the club's hierarchy, leaves the Yankees' World Series
championship clan intact. Their status will be in marked contrast
to the fate of their immediate predecessors, the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Marlins' championship team lamented that they
never got a chance to find out if they would be good enough to
repeat. They were torn asunder even before they had a chance to
savor their 1997 World Series success.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, however, will have virtually a full house in their
quest to repeat. Their major test will come when they are faced
with competing against the rest of the American League or against
their 1998 record.
</P>
<P>
   With rivals like the Red Sox self-destructing, they figure to
have a better chance against the former than the latter.

 By JIM JUBAK  
 c.1998 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is out of dough. Politicians
from Tokyo to Moscow lack the mandate or the will to fix their
economies. Intervention has failed the central banks and
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   All that now seems to stand between the world and a slide into
global recession are U.S. consumers, armed with wallets full of
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh at this unlikely superhero _ these notoriously
casual savers who already strain under a mountain of debt are
stronger than they look. But don't overestimate what they'll be
able to pull off, either.
</P>
<P>
   At best, U.S. consumers can buy the global economy some time and
prevent a worldwide panic. But they won't be able to stop the Asian
flu from infecting Latin America, and they can't, by themselves,
turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   How did the global economy get to this pass? More than a year
after the collapse of the Thai baht triggered an avalanche that
buried all of Asia, the International Monetary Fund's program of
huge loans, higher rates, and big cuts to government spending
hasn't stabilized the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   That medicine did indeed stop the feverish descent of Asia's
currencies (particularly the South Korean won, which is worth more
today than it was in January), but overall, the economies of the
region have become sicker, not healthier.
</P>
<P>
   High interest rates, for example, have helped choke off growth.
Indonesia's gross domestic product will fall an estimated 15
percent this year. (For context, Mexico's GDP sank 7 percent in
1995 after the peso crisis.)
</P>
<P>
   And Japan is, even its traditionally optimistic bureaucrats
admit, officially in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now the IMF is almost out of money. The bankers are so close to
the bottom of the vault that in mid-August they elected not to
throw more cash into Russia. A bailout, the IMF felt, would have
depleted reserves without offering the slightest chance that
Russia's problems would be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Latin American countries such as Venezuela and Brazil
aren't likely to get a warmer welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The standard remedy for recession is to generate spending,
either by running budget deficits to pay for public works or by
cutting taxes to stimulate private demand.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, that extra money soaks up the supply of unsold goods
and services, stimulates new capital investment, and creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But even when governments in Asia have been able to muster the
political will to take these steps, the program hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Asia isn't in the grip of your standard-issue, plain-vanilla
recession. Nope, this is the deluxe model that combines falling
economic activity, constantly shrinking asset values, and a
seemingly endless credit crunch. Efforts to stimulate growth
disappear into these devastated economies without a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, for example, has poured trillions of yen into
infrastructure projects and cut taxes _ albeit timidly _ without
noticeable effect. Consumers are too afraid to spend _ the Japanese
and Koreans are clearly saving more in response to the crisis _ and
who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The official unemployment rate in Japan, the land of lifetime
employment, is now at 4.3 percent, and the real rate is probably
closer to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are spending every dollar they have
and then some. Personal income rose 0.2 percent in June, according
to the Department of Commerce, after an increase of 0.4 percent in
May. Personal expenditures rose 0.6 percent in June, after a 0.9
percent climb in May.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers are doing exactly what their counterparts in Asia
aren't willing to do. In June, the U.S. trade deficit with the ten
major Asian nations totaled $15 billion _ that's up more than 40
percent from the deficit in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear where at least some of the dollars headed to
Asia are coming from. U.S. consumers are saving less and running up
more debt. In the first quarter of 1998, according to the
Department of Commerce, U.S. consumers saved just 0.6 percent. At
the same time, consumer debt grew at an annual rate of better than
6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are now paying a record 15 percent of after-tax income
in interest and principal, according to Economic Analysis
Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   If you judge from those trends, the U.S. consumer sounds pretty
tapped out and poorly cast as the hero who will save the world
economy. But these numbers ignore the ``wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve estimates that since 1994 the stock market
has added $12.5 trillion to the assets of U.S. households. Using
traditional estimates of the way this wealth effect flows from the
financial markets into consumer spending, that asset explosion will
add about $600 billion annually to consumer purchasing power in the
U.s.
</P>
<P>
   That number is both reassuring and scary. Reassuring because it
suggests the United States will be able to continue its role as
consumer of last resort into 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scary because it suggests that U.S. consumers will play this
role only as long as a buoyant stock market makes them feel
wealthy. No one has any real idea, unfortunately, of how far the
market would have to fall before consumers would stop feeling
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of buying by U.S. consumers can fix the structural
problems in the Korean, Japanese, or Brazilian economies. But it
can buy time for those economies to right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It can pump liquidity into cash-starved companies in these
countries. And it can give countries _ China most importantly _ an
incentive for working to help fix the global economy rather than
pursuing a ruinous policy of beggar thy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it offers the hope that hard-pressed countries have
a way out of this fix. That's pretty important in a world that, for
the moment, seems to be out of alternative ideas. &QL;

<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is out of dough. Politicians
from Tokyo to Moscow lack the mandate or the will to fix their
economies. Intervention has failed the central banks and
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   All that now seems to stand between the world and a slide into
global recession are U.S. consumers, armed with wallets full of
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh at this unlikely superhero _ these notoriously
casual savers who already strain under a mountain of debt are
stronger than they look. But don't overestimate what they'll be
able to pull off, either.
</P>
<P>
   At best, U.S. consumers can buy the global economy some time and
prevent a worldwide panic. But they won't be able to stop the Asian
flu from infecting Latin America, and they can't, by themselves,
turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   How did the global economy get to this pass? More than a year
after the collapse of the Thai baht triggered an avalanche that
buried all of Asia, the International Monetary Fund's program of
huge loans, higher rates, and big cuts to government spending
hasn't stabilized the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   That medicine did indeed stop the feverish descent of Asia's
currencies (particularly the South Korean won, which is worth more
today than it was in January), but overall, the economies of the
region have become sicker, not healthier.
</P>
<P>
   High interest rates, for example, have helped choke off growth.
Indonesia's gross domestic product will fall an estimated 15
percent this year. (For context, Mexico's GDP sank 7 percent in
1995 after the peso crisis.)
</P>
<P>
   And Japan is, even its traditionally optimistic bureaucrats
admit, officially in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now the IMF is almost out of money. The bankers are so close to
the bottom of the vault that in mid-August they elected not to
throw more cash into Russia. A bailout, the IMF felt, would have
depleted reserves without offering the slightest chance that
Russia's problems would be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Latin American countries such as Venezuela and Brazil
aren't likely to get a warmer welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The standard remedy for recession is to generate spending,
either by running budget deficits to pay for public works or by
cutting taxes to stimulate private demand.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, that extra money soaks up the supply of unsold goods
and services, stimulates new capital investment, and creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But even when governments in Asia have been able to muster the
political will to take these steps, the program hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Asia isn't in the grip of your standard-issue, plain-vanilla
recession. Nope, this is the deluxe model that combines falling
economic activity, constantly shrinking asset values, and a
seemingly endless credit crunch. Efforts to stimulate growth
disappear into these devastated economies without a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, for example, has poured trillions of yen into
infrastructure projects and cut taxes _ albeit timidly _ without
noticeable effect. Consumers are too afraid to spend _ the Japanese
and Koreans are clearly saving more in response to the crisis _ and
who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The official unemployment rate in Japan, the land of lifetime
employment, is now at 4.3 percent, and the real rate is probably
closer to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are spending every dollar they have
and then some. Personal income rose 0.2 percent in June, according
to the Department of Commerce, after an increase of 0.4 percent in
May. Personal expenditures rose 0.6 percent in June, after a 0.9
percent climb in May.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers are doing exactly what their counterparts in Asia
aren't willing to do. In June, the U.S. trade deficit with the ten
major Asian nations totaled $15 billion _ that's up more than 40
percent from the deficit in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear where at least some of the dollars headed to
Asia are coming from. U.S. consumers are saving less and running up
more debt. In the first quarter of 1998, according to the
Department of Commerce, U.S. consumers saved just 0.6 percent. At
the same time, consumer debt grew at an annual rate of better than
6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are now paying a record 15 percent of after-tax income
in interest and principal, according to Economic Analysis
Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   If you judge from those trends, the U.S. consumer sounds pretty
tapped out and poorly cast as the hero who will save the world
economy. But these numbers ignore the ``wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve estimates that since 1994 the stock market
has added $12.5 trillion to the assets of U.S. households. Using
traditional estimates of the way this wealth effect flows from the
financial markets into consumer spending, that asset explosion will
add about $600 billion annually to consumer purchasing power in the
U.s.
</P>
<P>
   That number is both reassuring and scary. Reassuring because it
suggests the United States will be able to continue its role as
consumer of last resort into 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scary because it suggests that U.S. consumers will play this
role only as long as a buoyant stock market makes them feel
wealthy. No one has any real idea, unfortunately, of how far the
market would have to fall before consumers would stop feeling
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of buying by U.S. consumers can fix the structural
problems in the Korean, Japanese, or Brazilian economies. But it
can buy time for those economies to right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It can pump liquidity into cash-starved companies in these
countries. And it can give countries _ China most importantly _ an
incentive for working to help fix the global economy rather than
pursuing a ruinous policy of beggar thy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it offers the hope that hard-pressed countries have
a way out of this fix. That's pretty important in a world that, for
the moment, seems to be out of alternative ideas. &QL;

BOLLER'S ARM BEST SINCE ELWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWHALL, Calif. _ They weren't prepared for this. Nobody really
is.
</P>
<P>
   One day Bob and Karen Boller's son was another high school kid
trying to find his way. The next day they awoke, and it was as if
the football gods had come to Kyle in the middle of the night and
anointed him the next great quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, people talked about their son in the same breath as
John Elway and Troy Aikman. Opposing coaches routinely said things
like ``the best I've ever seen.'' Schools such as Florida State,
Tennessee and California called to offer scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   And on the field, well, it's been nothing short of remarkable.
Kyle Boller _ Hart High's extraordinary senior quarterback _ has
piled up colossal numbers with his cannon arm and uncanny field
vision. He began the year with 422 yards and five touchdowns in a
tour de force opening night against Quartz Hill, and it's been one
magnificent performance after another since.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Friday's Southern Section Division III quarterfinal
game against St. Francis, Boller has 4,072 yards and 51 touchdowns.
He is on pace to break Chris Czernek's 1995 single-season state
record of 4,360 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Bollers, a typical low-key family in the Santa Clarita
Valley, are astonished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think anything like this
would happen,'' said Karen Boller, who is now accustomed to being
referred to as Kyle Boller's mom.
</P>
<P>
   She should have seen it coming. After all, ever since he was a
young boy, Boller has exuded the type of steely determination often
associated with greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd tell me he was going to do this or that and as a dad, you
never want to walk on somebody's dreams, so you just sort of say,
yeah, yeah, whatever,'' said Bob Boller. ``But sure enough, he's
backing it up.'' &QL; 
THE PLAYER &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The next great quarterback looks the part. He's 6-foot-3,
well-built and has the type of chiseled good looks that make
Hollywood producers notice and young girls blush.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor is more self-assured than pretentious. A good
leader always straddles the delicate line between confident and
cocky, and Boller walks it well.
</P>
<P>
   He was a linebacker in youth football, which accounts for his
physical toughness. Boller takes a pounding nearly every time he
drops back to pass, yet he hasn't missed a play all year due to
injury. His teammates are amazed every time he picks himself up
after a particularly vicious hit, but they've stopped waiting for
him to give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he didn't leave the Valencia game after this one really
big hit, we just decided that maybe nothing was going to get him
off the field,'' teammate Scott Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the poise.
</P>
<P>
   Even at this stage of his development, Boller can decipher an
opposing defense and consistently make the correct read. It's a
necessity in Hart's sophisticated offense, which relies on
check-offs at the line of scrimmage, timing and vision. Boller
picked up the Indians' scheme quickly. Now he has it mastered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always getting us in the formation we need to be in and
making the right calls,'' Hart offensive coordinator Dean
Herrington said. ``He's a really sharp kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller's most stunning stat is not his passing-efficiency
rating, an ungodly 200.09. It's the touchdown-to-interception
ratio, the figure given most attention by college, and especially
professional, scouts. In his career, Boller has thrown 54
touchdowns. And four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Boller's athletic ability is above average for a quarterback, a
plus in today's game of defensive size and quickness. He can sit in
the pocket and pick apart a defense, but he can also roll out and
throw on the run. And if the protection breaks down, Boller can
tuck the ball away and take off.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of those gifts, the presence, the self-confidence and
the intelligence, are overshadowed by The Arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's off the charts,'' Herrington said.
</P>
<P>
   It's what makes him the next great quarterback and it's the
reason some coaches have compared Boller to Elway, the former
Granada Hills High star. Ever since Elway left the San Fernando
Valley for Stanford and the NFL, he's been the standard by which
other area prep quarterbacks are measured. Until now, no one came
close.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes Boller, who astonishes by throwing balls 60 to 75
yards on the run and 30-yard frozen ropes off his back foot or with
somebody in his face. He completes post patterns, sideline outs and
across-the-field throws on the move. There isn't a pass he can't
complete and he does so with remarkable accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the arm strength to play on Sunday afternoons right
now,'' said Canyon coach Larry Mohr. ``I used to work at the Dallas
Cowboys training camp (in Thousand Oaks) and I saw guys like Troy
Aikman every day. This kid has that kind of arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller is honored by the comparisons but not overwhelmed by the
pressure they bring. Even at the beginning of the season, when word
spread that Hart had a quarterback destined for greatness, Boller
remained low key. He worried a little about living up to
expectations, wondering what would happen if he fell short.
Ultimately he decided that all he could do was try his best, and if
the results weren't good enough for others, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Boller is surpassing expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous because people were saying so many
great things about me,'' Boller said. ``But I had confidence in
myself that I could play the game well. All I wanted to do was play
and not worry about the pressure.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE PLAY &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It came two weeks ago. Those who saw it will remember it
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was routine. Hart was opening the second half
against Canyon at its own 25-yard line. It was first down, time for
the pass-happy Indians to throw the ball. The next great
quarterback dropped back, surveyed the field and then threw. He was
on the 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The ball erupted like a heat-seeking missile, slicing a path
through a windless sky. Down the field it flew, easily clearing the
50, then the 40, the 30 and the 20. The receiver, Shane Lavoie, ran
as fast as he could, making a terrific over-the-shoulder catch
inside the 10-yard line before falling down at the 5.
</P>
<P>
   The ball traveled 73 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never real happy when an opposing team makes a big play on
us, but on that one, I just had to say, `Well, I've never seen
anything like that before,' '' Mohr said. ``And I might not ever
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Herrington, who said a game doesn't pass without Boller
making a memorable play, was astounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``No air, no wind, and it goes 75 yards,'' Herrington said.
``That's not something you see every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart head coach Mike Herrington was too involved in the game to
realize what he had just seen, but on the bus ride home he
reflected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started laughing,'' Herrington said. ``I mean, a high
school kid throwing the ball 73 yards in the air. That's
amazing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE IMPACT &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the praise, despite the recognition, despite colleges
that openly covet him and newspapers and television stations that
clamor to cover him, the next great quarterback doesn't think he's
anything special.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of the few.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Boller had just torched Highland High for 345 yards and
five touchdowns in a 56-6 win last Friday in the first round of the
playoffs. Afterward, as Boller and the Indians shook hands with the
Bulldogs, one opposing player approached him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, this guy comes up to Kyle with a pen and a
piece of paper and tells him, `Listen, you're going to play in the
NFL some day, and I just want to make sure I get your autograph
now.' '' Dean Herrington said. ``Kyle could not believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of Kyle Boller, the next great quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a local youth flag-football league phoned the
Herringtons to ask if Boller would mind speaking at its banquet. No
big deal, they said, but could he just say a few words to the kids?
</P>
<P>
   When Boller arrived, it was as if the Beatles had just landed in
New York. The kids formed a deep line in front of their hero,
hoping they might actually talk to him. Boller obliged, then signed
nearly 100 autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back the next day and was telling me, `Coach, I guess
I just don't think of myself the way others do,' '' Mike Herrington
said. ``He doesn't realize the impact he has.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE FUTURE &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The next great quarterback actually sat on the bench last year,
behind senior David Neill, even though some considered Boller the
better player. While Boller played safety, Neill ran the show.
</P>
<P>
   Neill justified the decision by passing for 3,056 yards and 26
touchdowns, then accepting a scholarship to Nevada. He threw for
3,249 yards and 29 touchdowns as a freshman this season and was
named first team All-Big West.
</P>
<P>
   The experience taught Boller about patience and sacrifice, but
it also exposed his only flaw. He hates not playing the position he
loves.
</P>
<P>
   It's something college suitors must remember during their
recruiting. Boller wants to play right away.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't just want to play, he expects to do well, even
dominate, as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he can,'' said his father.
</P>
<P>
   Boller's parents will understand if Kyle chooses Florida State
or Tennessee, two premier programs in hot pursuit. Selfishly,
they'd like him to stay near home, but the closest schools he is
considering are California, Oregon and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he goes to Florida or some place closer to home, we
realize we won't see him very often and that's OK,'' Karen Boller
said. ``We've told him that we want him to make this decision for
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a clue to Boller's thinking, keep in mind
the motivation factor.
</P>
<P>
   Boller wanted to go to UCLA. But since he didn't play as a
junior, the Bruins offered a scholarship to J.P. Losman of Venice
over the summer, then promised they wouldn't recruit another
quarterback. At the time, it was the safer choice. Losman already
had two years under his belt, while Boller was more myth than
reality. The Bruins based their decision on what they'd seen,
rather than heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little upset at the time, I had hoped they would have
waited a little longer, but they did what they had to do,'' Boller
said.
</P>
<P>
   So no hard feelings?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really, but it just makes me want to beat them anytime I
play them in the future.'' Boller said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon plays UCLA next Oct. 9, Cal on Oct. 16. And both teams
could use the next great quarterback.

Coast-to-coast offense merciless
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   IRVING _ You've heard of the ``West Coast'' offense, that
oh-so-trendy game of water torture the 49ers invented and many
others have dutifully copied.
</P>
<P>
   Such a death-by-dinking approach is not the way the Vikings do
business. Denny Green is greedy. Denny wants it all, and he wants
it now. His Vikes _ rhymes with ``Yikes!'' _ walloped the Cowboys
on Thanksgiving Day with what perhaps should be called the
``Coast-to-Coast'' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Detente notwithstanding, the bomb lives. Talk about the vertical
passing game. Talk about stretching a defense. Johnny U. to Raymond
Berry, circa early Cold War, must have looked something like what
the tryin'-one Vikings have become. Dallas' secondary would be
stretched so thin by the reborn, reinvented Randall Cunningham on
Thursday afternoon that it practically turned transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it said a rolling Moss gathers no stones, or Cowboys? Ah,
something like that. What we definitely found out in Minnesota's
46-36 Texas Stadium thrillathon victory is that without Deion
Sanders, there's hardly any ``D'' in Dallas. On Turkey Day, the
Vikings gobble-gobbled up yardage faster than we press-box turkeys
could tabulate.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie dandy, Randy Moss, dealt most of the pain and
humiliation to the locals. He caught two 56-yard touchdown passes,
two of the four of more than 50 yards that Cunningham would throw _
including what had to be an unprecedented three in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, the reformed _ presumably _ bad boy of last spring's
draft, also had a piddling 51-yarder for a score, and he later
dropped a ball that would have gone for another 50, although not
for a touchdown. The three TDs were his only three catches. Scant
wasted motion there.
</P>
<P>
   Want some irony? Moss, passed over by 19 teams because of his
reputation for finding trouble, wanted to be a Cowboy. But the
organization, having gained a reputation as America's Most Wanted
Team in recent years, decided not to mess with him. Michael Irvin
actually called Moss and apologized to the kid personally, saying
if it hadn't been for his own miscreant, antisocial (and overly
social) behavior, the Cowboys might not have shied away from
drafting Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, nonetheless, wasn't in an expansive, philosophical mood
afterward. He said he had nothing to say, at least to anyone who
didn't have a TV camera in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Possession time is supposed to be a proven indicator of a team's
chance of success. The more the merrier, right? Wrong. Dallas held
the football for 38 minutes, Minnesota only 22. How can this be
possible? Easy. None of the Vikings' six touchdown drives, ranging
in length from 56 to 80 yards, required more than five plays to
complete or ate up more than 2{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Hoard, speaking up on behalf of Minnesota's afterthought
infantry and pinch-hitting for an injured Robert Smith, also broke
a 50-yarder that ended with his hopping around the end zone giving
thanks. Relatively speaking, his 12-yard score qualified as a
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the half-dozen possessions ran a mere 10 minutes off
the clock, allowing Dallas ample opportunity to compile its 513
yards of total offense. Troy Aikman passed for 455 of them, going
34-for-57. Each figure established or tied a career high. He fell
short of Don Meredith's 35-year-old Cowboys yardage record by just
five.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind, too, that his receivers dropped nine easily
catchable passes, six in the first half. But should you believe he
went home impressed with himself, you don't know Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred yards, four yards _ it doesn't matter,'' Aikman
said. ``We didn't win the game. We didn't go out there trying to
see how we measured up against them. We had a job to do, and that
was to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys fell to 8-4 at the season's three-quarters
pole, with most of the eight coming at the expense of also-ran
opponents. There's no telling how good they are, or aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, in turn, is 11-1, clearly the class of the NFC and
dogging the unbeaten Broncos (11-0) for Team of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy, of course, to find fault with a Vikings defense that
surrenders yards as generously as it did this day, but Green wasn't
in a critical mood. He laid the blame on the short week, coming off
a euphoric victory over the hated Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one day of practice,'' he said. ``The defense is always
going to suffer. We did the best we could. Dallas did the best it
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Sanders, who was deactivated because of a badly sprained
toe, Dallas' best was pretty bad. Remember, the Vikings were
themselves minus Jake Reed, a third of their one-two-three punch.
But the Cowboys didn't have anybody who could hang with Cris Carter
or Moss, whom Green likens to a baseball center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys can play outfield,'' he said, ``but not
everybody can play center field. Randy has a natural knack for
chasing down the long ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Call Moss Willie Mays. And call the Cowboys really amazed. At
last glance, their shiny silver britches were still smoldering.

HOLIDAY SHOPPERS GOBBLE UP GOODS

(Attention editors: Corrects name of store to ``99 Cents.'' (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For most L.A.-area Valley residents, Thanksgiving
is a day to spend around the dinner table with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   For Sylvia Dean, it was a day to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come today,'' Dean said Thursday morning, while
walking down the sporting goods aisle of the Kmart store in
Northridge, a Los Angeles suburb. ``If I come (Friday), it will be
a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the national holiday, many people left their
turkeys and football games Thursday, and headed for the few stores
open Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to come tomorrow at 6 o'clock in the morning,''
said Kelley Rivera as she pushed a cart full of toys at Kmart.
``I'd rather be in bed knowing I have my presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Kmart, one of the few stores in the L.A.-area that was open
Thanksgiving Day, drew large crowds to its Northridge store.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, shoppers set out in search of that perfect gift or
necessity. Outside, drivers fought for parking spaces, jamming the
parking lot for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   For Dave Larsen, a resident of the Los Angeles suburb Tarzana,
shopping on Thanksgiving is an annual family tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little-known secret, but Thanksgiving is the best day
to go shopping,'' Larsen said. ``After today, I don't even want to
imagine what it's going to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Gross said he went shopping just to ``get away from the
hustle and bustle of my house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have over 50 people there right now,'' said Gross, a
resident of Northridge. ``I needed some time to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   One Kmart employee didn't know why people chose to shop rather
than stay home with their family. But would he shop if he had the
day off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not _ but it depends on the sale,'' the employee
said.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Canoga Park, a shopper at the 99 Cents Only Store
was picking up a few Christmas items in addition to last-minute
Thanksgiving goodies she had come to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Elisa Schwartz said she enjoys shopping when there are fewer
people and didn't want to miss out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a few extra things, and I figured I might as well buy
some Christmas stuff while I'm here,'' Schwartz said as she picked
through mountains of red and green tinsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buying our Christmas tree next week and we need to be
ready.'' &QL;

UCLA WINS SLOPPY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYAMON, Puerto Rico _ The UCLA Bruins flew seven hours and
traversed four time zones to get here, and somewhere along the way
their circuits crossed.
</P>
<P>
   For two interminable hours Thursday evening, their best point
guard was a walk-on. Their best big man was a guard, and their best
players were not named Watson, Davis, Rush or Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most dramatic reversal of fortune was this: The
bumbling, stumbling Bruins actually won a first-round game in a
preseason tournament _ defeating San Francisco 69-62 Thursday night
at the Guerra Sports Complex in the first round of the Puerto Rico
Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   In winning their first first-round preseason game since 1992,
the Bruins saved their best for the final minutes, outscoring San
Francisco 9-0 to turn a 57-56 deficit into a 65-57 lead.
</P>
<P>
   For the effort, No. 10 UCLA (2-0) will face fifth-ranked
Maryland today in the semifinals at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play like we did tonight against Maryland,'' Bruins
coach Steve Lavin said, ``we may be blitzkrieged by 70.''
</P>
<P>
   He was being optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The Dons exposed UCLA's myriad weaknesses, from inexperience and
porous defense to fragile confidence and inconsistent scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Earl Watson, supposedly the Bruins' most improved
player, had 10 turnovers against San Francisco's modest pressure
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Small forward JaRon Rush, the Bruins' most polished scorer, made
2 of 10 field goals, missed a dunk, committed four turnovers and,
for the first time, played like a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having back pains, I wasn't into the flow and I was
nervous,'' he said. Otherwise, no problems.
</P>
<P>
   To the rescue came an unlikely bunch, starting with reserve
guard Brandon Loyd. He made three 3-point baskets in the first
half, when the Bruins committed 18 fouls, 15 turnovers and watched
a 10-point lead become a 40-36 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lavin got into us a little at halftime,'' Loyd said.
``He told us we had to compete harder. They had more fire and
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve guard Rico Hines sparked UCLA with back-to-back
3-pointers early in the second half. The second gave the Bruins a
42-40 lead they would relinquish once, 57-56, and then immediately
reclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbling on a sprained knee and sore hamstring, Hines also
contributed with defense. The Bruins played zone for much of the
game, but during their stretches of man to man, Hines helped hold
San Francisco's leading scorer, Gerald Zimmerman, to nine points _
18 below his average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a lot of team defense on him,'' Hines said. ``We
tried to get a lot of pressure on him, make him put it on the floor
and not give him an easy 3-point shots.''
</P>
<P>
   As Zimmerman struggled, so did the Dons. They shot 27.8 percent
for the game and missed 16 of their first 17 shots in the second
half. When the spell broke, they were trailing by just two points _
such was the chaos and sloppiness of UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so young, we don't have that chemistry yet,'' Hines
said. ``Coach is trying a lot of lineups to see which ones work.
But we have a lot of guys who can play.''
</P>
<P>
   With Watson committing a turnover every three minutes and
throwing wild, aimless alley-oop passes, UCLA turned to sophomore
walk-on Ryan Bailey for floor leadership. Bailey played the four
minutes remaining and directed the Bruins' 9-0 surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see a different guy make the big plays
every night,'' Loyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Good as Loyd, Hines and Bailey were, they stepped aside in the
final moments and let freshman forward Matt Barnes take control. If
not UCLA's best player, Barnes (nine points, eight rebounds) is
certainly its most versatile and its most controlled. He started
the game at shooting guard but ended it at power forward, and from
there he made the game-winning plays.
</P>
<P>
   His offensive rebound with 3:15 remaining became two free throws
and a 58-57 UCLA lead. San Francisco guard Dony Wilcher then missed
a 3-pointer and Barnes grabbed the rebound. A few seconds later, he
missed a forceful drive to the basket, but Dan Gadzuric converted
for a 60-57 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dons missed again, and Barnes corralled another defensive
rebound. He was fouled immediately, hit two more free throws, and
the Bruins had a 62-57 lead with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does so many things, you sometimes take him for granted,''
Lavin said. ``He affects the outcome . . . in such subtle ways you
don't always recognize him.''

ROBINSON TALKS TO UNLV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former USC coach John Robinson has interviewed to
become the next football coach at Nevada-Las Vegas, according to
several sources.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson flew to Las Vegas on Tuesday and met with UNLV athletic
director Charles Cavagnaro and university president Carol Harter,
sources said. It was his second interview with Cavagnaro this week.
Robinson had already met with him on Sunday in Los Angeles.
Although the meetings have intensified, no formal job offer has
been made, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was reportedly enthusiastic about the job. He could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   There are reportedly other candidates, but none has the high
profile or reputation of Robinson. Cavagnaro has stated a desire to
hire a big-name coach, and Robinson would seem to be one of the few
available willing to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   Around USC on Thursday, there was speculation Robinson would be
interested in the job because of the financial security it might
provide. He received a $600,000 buyout from USC last December but
has worked only sporadically on television this past year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Alabama offensive coordinator Charlie Stubbs,
a former UNLV assistant, withdrew his name from consideration,
although he said he had only preliminary conversations with
Cavagnaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just told me to send something to show that I was applying
for the job,'' Stubbs told the Las Vegas Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Cavagnaro has promised to upgrade the football program no matter
who UNLV hires as its next coach, and is expected to put together
an attractive financial package to lure a candidate who would boost
interest in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels will join the new Mountain West Conference next
season and are expanding their football stadium to 40,000 seats.
Cavagnaro fired former coach Jeff Horton last week. Horton had been
the head coach the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 63, was fired by USC last December after four seasons
in his second tenure at the university. He was 37-22-2 but just
12-11 in the last two years. Overall, his record at USC was
104-35-4, four Rose Bowl titles and the 1978 national championship.

UNEDITED UCLA BASKETBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by SLANG associates) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYAMON, Puerto Rico _ UCLA sophomore guard Rico Hines was
credited with two assists in the Bruins' 69-62 victory Thursday
over San Francisco in the first round of the Puerto Rico Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   He should have had one more.
</P>
<P>
   Hines watched in frustration as Bruins freshman center Dan
Gadzuric made one basket and committed two fouls in the first half.
So when UCLA returned to the court for second-half warmups, Hines
pulled Gadzuric aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to play ball,'' he said. ``It's time to make your
presence felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprised but inspired, Gadzuric did just that _ scoring 10
points and grabbing two steals in the second half to help the
Bruins pull away in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first major contribution of the season for Gadzuric,
the heralded center from Holland, by way of Gov. Dummer Academy in
Byfield, Mass. Slowed by tendinitis, he missed significant
preseason practice time and is gradually regaining his timing and
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he joined fellow freshman Matt Barnes as the primary
reason for UCLA's survival.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:18 remaining, Gadzuric followed a Barnes miss to give the
Bruins a 60-57 lead. Two possessions later, he spun past his
defender in the low post for a lay-up that gave UCLA a 64-57
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down, so I had to do something,'' Gadzuric said.
``Rico really helped me out. That was real teammate stuff. I played
much better in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   (ub)Sweet shot:!off! If it were up to Brandon Loyd, UCLA would
play all its games in the Carribean.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about it that helps me get a nice, easy
sweat going,'' Loyd said.
</P>
<P>
   And the more he sweats, the better he shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd perspired early and often against San Francisco, coming off
the bench to make three 3-pointers in the opening half _ 25 percent
of UCLA's first-half point total.
</P>
<P>
   He played just three minutes in the second half after tripping
over coach Steve Lavin on the right sideline and spraining his
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   (ub)Old friends:!off! Hines attended St. John's at Prospect
Hall, a prep school stationed a few miles from Maryland's campus.
He played pickup games with many of the Terrapins and played
against a few in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be real interesting,'' he said. ``The east coast guys
all think UCLA is soft, but this is a different era.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Bruins ready? Lavin thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they guys are eager to play a top-10 team,'' he said.
``They're eager to be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   (ub)Deja vu-CLA:!off! Unlike last season, when Toby Bailey, J.R.
Henderson and Kris Johnson led the Bruins in scoring in 31 of 33
games, this year could bring a different high scorer each week.
</P>
<P>
   For Loyd, that's a basket in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a senior in high school watching the 1995
team,'' he said. ``That year, Ed (O'Bannon) was consistent every
night, but you'd have Toby getting two against Oklahoma State and
then 26 against Arkansas. Or George (Zidek) woud get 15 points one
night and seven the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes a good team. It's a positive thing when you have
different people stepping up each night.''

IS COWBOYS' DEFENSE THAT BAD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Is the Cowboys' defense that bad, or is the Vikings' defense
that good?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. With Deion Sanders, the Cowboys' defense is just
above average. They didn't have him yesterday, and you saw the
results. The Cowboys simply can't stop any passing offense with a
quarterback who does not play in the NFC East. And it is not only
cornerback Kevin Smith's fault. Strong safety Darren Woodson has
had trouble covering receivers in the slot all season. The Cowboys
think so much of free safety Omar Stoutmire that they often replace
him on passing downs. The pass rush gets to the quarterback
occasionally, but the pressure is not consistent enough to help
force turnovers. Even when Sanders comes back from his big-toe
injury, defensive coordinator Dave Campo will have a lot of work to
do to prepare this team for an expected playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   2. If these clubs meet again in the playoffs, what can the
Cowboys do differently to come out victorious?
</P>
<P>
   First, they need everybody healthy. Then, they need to eliminate
the penalties (13 for 152 yards) and the dropped passes (eight).
They also need to play better on special teams. Two Vikings
penalties wiped out 166 yards of return yardage. Both penalties had
little to do with the returns, one of which would have resulted in
a touchdown. On offense, the Cowboys need to do a better job
running the football. Yes, they controlled the ball for 38 minutes,
but they had just 24 rushing plays for 58 yards, a measly 2.4-yard
average. This forced Troy Aikman to throw a career-high 57 times.
On defense, the Cowboys have to do a better job of rushing the
quarterback, as they sacked Randall Cunningham only once. With
Deion Sanders in the secondary, you'd like to think they'd have a
better chance of defending Randy Moss and Cris Carter. We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   3. Does this loss mean the Cowboys have a long way to go to
reach ``elite status''?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not. What we saw yesterday was the best team in the
NFC. And the Cowboys, who were pretty banged up, made a game of it
after falling behind 21-6.
</P>
<P>
   4. If Chan Gailey is such a disciplined-oriented coach, why does
this team commit so many penalties?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey must be scratching his head about this one. In the past
two weeks, the Cowboys have committed 28 penalties for 281 yards.
In that same two-game span, they have rushed for 231 yards. Many of
yesterday's penalty yardage came as Cowboys defenders committed
pass interference trying to cover Randy Moss. But there were many
more penalties that drive Gailey crazy, pre-snap penalties that are
unforced. In all, the Cowboys were penalized five times for
holding, false starts or offsides. The Cowboys can't keep this up
if they want to go far in the playoffs.

HITCHCOCK TO CRACK WHIP ON ERRATIC STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ken Hitchcock tried the silent treatment, but
said the results didn't last long enough. So, the Stars coach
resorted to screaming at his underachieving team yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try the common-sense approach and give everybody the
benefit of the doubt first,'' said Hitchcock, referring to his
philosophy of trusting his veterans to lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Stars fell behind 3-0 to the New Jersey Devils in
the first period Wednesday night and eventually lost, 5-2, at
Reunion Arena, Hitchcock put his foot down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're well into the season and you are what you are, and you
can't pretend. What we are is a very inconsistent hockey club,''
Hitchcock said after a Thanksgiving Day practice. ``Changes have to
be made by us, the coaches. We have to be less tolerant. The way we
are playing is not acceptable, so we have to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into tonight's 7:30 game with the Washington Capitals at
Reunion Arena in Dallas, Hitchcock said he will crack the whip on a
style of basic hockey that isn't fun, but proved fruitful for the
Stars last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a strong defending team that needs to think in terms of
winning hockey games 1-0, not 5-4, not even 3-2,'' Hitchcock said.
``That's a hard way to play, but it's also a very successful way to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the Stars will concentrate on making safe plays
designed to get the puck out of their own end of the ice with
minimal risk. In the past three games, the Stars caused several
opposing goals by turning the puck over. But Hitchcock said the
problems date further than three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been barking about this all year, for 20 games,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the players are starting to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have the same intensity that we've had for the
two years before this,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor, who also added
the Stars were a hungrier team when they were trying to prove they
belonged among the NHL's elite. ``I think we've gotten too
arrogant. We don't respect other teams the way we used to and
what's worse is we don't respect ourselves. It's gut-check time for
us, time to look in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are sharp words for a team that's 11-4-3 and 4-1-1 in
their past five games, but Hitchcock said the Stars have been very
lucky. He said it took a team like the talented Devils to show how
far the Stars have fallen from the consistent level of play they
exhibited last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're playing is not acceptable, so we have to
change,'' he said. ``We're going to talk about it and we're going
to work it and we're going to talk about it and we're going to work
it. But we're going to get it changed.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the silent approach.

COWBOYS NEED TO SHAPE UP IF THESE TEAMS MEET AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ About that January collision course. Is that the
eventual destination of these two teams? To meet again in the
playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   If so, then first things first for the Cowboys. Like scraping
themselves off the Texas Stadium floor, where they were splattered
on Thanksgiving Day like a dropped bowl of giblet gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turkey, the Cowboys were overserved another kind of
fowl yesterday _ namely roadrunner. So what's all the beep-beep
about this Randy Moss? He was held to three catches.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange afternoon of mistakes, penalties and sensational
big plays, the Minnesota Vikings left little doubt about their
offensive might and their NFC superiority. The final score of 46-36
defined both the conference regular-season race and the rookie
impact of Moss, who scored a long-range touchdown on each of those
three catches.
</P>
<P>
   Excuses, however, do overflow for the Cowboys on the defensive
side of the ball. Two hours before game time, Deion Sanders
informed coach Chan Gailey that he was ``No Moss.'' Nine-toed Deion
watched it all from the sidelines in street clothes, nursing his
ongoing toe ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the second half, the other starting cornerback, Kevin
Smith, also become a sideline spectator with lower back problems.
Smith was already wearing skidmarks from two of Moss' touchdown
bombs in the first quarter, part of a very quick, 21-6 lead the
Vikings grabbed.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, a 24-19 lead for Minnesota in the third
quarter. But only the scoreboard suggested it was still anybody's
game. The Cowboys were playing Charlie Williams at one corner and
Terry Billups at the other, Billups having been activated from the
practice squad this week.
</P>
<P>
   The race was on, and the Vikings always had a turkey leg up on
this makeshift Dallas secondary. It was not exactly a brute force
kind of massacre. The Vikings' offensive might is built around
quarterback Randall Cunningham throwing the ball up for grabs and
something good happening because of receivers like Moss and Cris
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Let Mike Holmgren, the Green Bay coach, openly scoff at such
folly. This stuff beat his Packers twice, and now it has also
whiplashed the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In the solemn confines of the Dallas postgame locker room,
defensive alibis were carefully omitted. But if a playoff rematch
does materialize, and if Deion turns up healthy, well ...
</P>
<P>
   All that really matters for now is yesterday. Plus, the Cowboys
have other problems to consider. Several of those would be on the
offensive side of the ball, based on what happened against the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated at the way we lost
this game,'' said Troy Aikman, who was talking strictly about the
offensive performance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 455 yards on his passing side of the ledger, and 36
points on the board, Aikman's disgust was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were one-dimensional the entire afternoon. They got
it done strictly by air. Aikman had to throw 57 times because the
running game was completely taken away by a Vikings' defense that
has been known to give it up on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Until the fourth quarter, Dallas was always close enough on the
scoreboard to want to run the ball. They simply couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in thinking we'd run it successfully _ we had to run
it,'' said Aikman. ``It's what we wanted to do first.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman also dismissed one prevalent locker-room theory that the
Vikings stacked for the run and gave up the pass. ``What they did
was guess along with us, showing an eight-man front when they
thought we'd run,'' he said. ``But it wasn't an all-out,
run-stopping defensive scheme. We just didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith was willing, but ended up with 44 yards on 18
carries. When the Cowboys needed ground yardage, particularly in
the red zone, there was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Credit here goes to the Minnesota defensive front. They won that
battle.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cowboys were throwing, and scoring, they also left
themselves short on production because of one familar and one very
new problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid penalties turned possible TDs into field goals on the
Cowboys' first two possessions. This continues to be the one
glaring no-no of the Chan Gailey era. By now, excuses are null and
void.
</P>
<P>
   And the same goes for a sudden case of dropsy by a variety of
receivers. There were eight officially counted and a couple of
others were marginal. Pitiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about guys running wide open and still dropping
the ball,'' Gailey said. ``It wasn't just the yards we lost at that
point, but the yardage that could have been gained if the catches
had been made.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a lucky side for the Cowboys, it's that Aikman
escaped injury. He was repeatedly battered, although never sacked.
``Troy took more of a beating than I ever wanted him to,'' said
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for all the Cowboys, particularly pride-wise. If
there is a January meeting with the Vikings, much will have to
change, or the final result won't.

VIKINGS' FAITHFUL GIVE THANKS COWBOYS PASSED ON MOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ They were gathered 'round a table, gnawing on
turkey legs and chilling, being interviewed by Madden and
Summerall, just the way the original pilgrims did so many years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Between bites, Randy Moss, Dennis Green and the freckly,
out-of-place dude in the purple blazer could hear the Minnesota
Vikings fans gobbling.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the blazer, new owner Red McCombs _ NBA dropout, NFL
drop-in _ was clearly enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a Thanksgiving Day in Texas!'' proclaimed McCombs, whose
Norse roots go all the way back to the fjords of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a great day to be a Lars, a Red or a Randy.
</P>
<P>
   Young, misunderstood Moss, making a statement of sorts, had
slipped behind and around the Cowboys' secondary just enough to
catch three passes, chew up 163 yards and score three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herschel Payback Time!'' a handmade sign in the Vikings' fans
section read, after the visiting plunderers' 46-36 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vikings thank Dallas for Moss,'' chirped another.
</P>
<P>
   For Cowboys fans, today the truth hurts. Moss is the real deal.
And then some.
</P>
<P>
   Ignored by the Cowboys in the April draft because of his alleged
questionable character, Moss took rampant advantage yesterday of a
bad situation _ i.e., the Cowboys' injury-riddled secondary.
</P>
<P>
   What was left was no contest. What's to come in January,
however, might not be much of a fair fight, either. Moss looked
that good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was anything personal against the Dallas
Cowboys,'' Vikings coach Green said. ``I think Randy just wants to
come out and show everyone that he can play.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth snap of the afternoon, clearly mindful of Moss,
Cowboys defenders Darren Woodson and Kevin Smith had made the
mistake of taking the bait on an apparent running play to Robert
Smith. The brief misstep allowed Moss to lope downfield where,
after Smith lateraled back to the quarterback, he gathered in
Randall Cunningham's pass and hopped in for his first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That one carried 51 yards. The one at the end of the first
quarter, where he outfought cornerback Kevin Smith, went 56 yards.
The one in the third quarter, also for 56 yards, vaulted the
Vikings into a commanding, 39-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Moss is a great wide receiver,'' said someone named
Terry Billups, stand-in Cowboys cornerback. ``He goes out and makes
big plays. They throw the ball up, and if he's covered or not, he
goes up and gets the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys in position, and he still went up and got the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the scouting report said, in other words. Moss was
everything he was advertised to be, except for the disreputable
headlines he was supposed to bring.
</P>
<P>
   And that remains a bum rap, Vikings coordinator Brian Billick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has gotten criticism from people who've never met him,''
Billick said. ``That has to be a motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss himself declined to say. After the interlude with John
Madden and the turkey leg, Moss retired to the dressing room and,
when he emerged, elected not to speak. He does this sometimes, the
Minnesota writers say.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's too late for the Cowboys to declare Greg Ellis a
mulligan. They missed on Moss, as did 19 other teams.
</P>
<P>
   But as owner Jerry Jones said yesterday, one more time, ``I
stopped a long time ago dwelling on a player that we could have
drafted and what he could have done for us. Don't forget that we
picked Troy Aikman over Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to making the pick, it was very important, in
such a high profile situation, that we show a sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   No convicted criminals, in other words. It was the right
attitude and the wrong decision, all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe things will be different, should January's chill find the
two teams meeting again.
</P>
<P>
   But as coordinator Billick said, ``You can't lose a Deion
Sanders and have it not affect you. But it's just like us losing
Jake Reed. It scares me to think how we would have done today if we
had had Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   If Billick is equating losing Count Do-Rag with the Vikes losing
their No. 3 receiver, that's wrong. But the Cowboys' secondary is
in such disarray, who's to say what a rematch would bring?
</P>
<P>
   Like the fans' banner above the postgame turkey celebration
read, ``Anything is Moss-ible.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the best one _ ``Our Moss _ Dallas' Loss.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked that way, pilgrims. Thanks.
</P>

VIKINGS' RANDY MOSS HAS THREE CATCHES, THREE TDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ After he had flashed through Texas Stadium like
an electrical storm, Randy Moss exercised his right to remain
silent.
</P>
<P>
   But then, what could he have said to make yesterday's
performance more understandable to mere mortals?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say,'' Moss told the crowd of reporters
gathered around his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you see it?'' Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle John
Randle asked. ``Didn't that say it all?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Moss, the Minnesota rookie with the speed and impact of
a lightning strike, had said quite enough in burning the Cowboys
with three 50-plus-yard touchdowns that sparked the Vikings'
spectacular 46-36 victory at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left was for the witnesses and bystanders to speak
in awe about what they had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sit here and talk about what he does all day,''
running back Leroy Hoard said, ``but you're still going to be left
shaking your head when he does it. So I just watch the film,
congratulate him and wait to see what he does next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have already seen quite enough, thank you, from the
player they could have had in the NFL draft. They had seen him
running free behind Kevin Smith and Darren Woodson on the game's
fourth snap for a 51-yard touchdown catch, giving the Cowboys a
glimpse of what they could expect all day.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys watched as Smith grabbed him, but couldn't keep him
from making a 56-yard play that put the Vikings up 21-6. And they
stared in horror as Moss shrugged off Charlie Williams' tackle and
turned a 4-yard hitch into a 56-yard score, topping it off with a
hesitation move that froze cornerback Terry Billups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he caught that hitch and went up that sideline, it was
amazing,'' Hoard said. ``You've got to realize the guy is 6-4, and
he's running by people like that. That's not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could have drafted Moss, passing on him with the
eighth pick to take defensive end Greg Ellis. In all, 19 teams let
Moss slide _ one of them twice _ before Minnesota grabbed him in
the 21st spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad \Rthe Cowboys\S didn't take me,'' Moss told the Fox
television crew before taking his vow of silence in the locker
room. ``I'm glad all those teams passed on me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because he ended up on the Vikings, who have the NFL's
most exciting offense, and who at 11-1 could be the favorite to
represent the NFC in the Super Bowl. But much of the reason for
that is Moss himself, who has caught 47 passes this season for an
average of 21.6 yards a catch. He passed the 1,000-yard mark
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Moss finished with only three catches, but he dominated the game
with 163 yards and three touchdowns, not to mention the 50-yard
pass interference call he drew when the Cowboys' Kenny Wheaton
grabbed him trying to prevent another huge play. The only drawback
on Moss' day was a dropped pass late in the fourth quarter. Of
course, he could be forgiven because he had leaped over a defender
and stretched his 6-4 frame to get to the ball in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he surprises me sometimes,'' Vikings Pro Bowl receiver
Cris Carter said. ``I was surprised he dropped that ball at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball's in the air, he's just like Jerry Rice. When
the ball's in the air, he has another gear and a tremendous ability
to adjust to the flight of the ball. Some guys just have it. He has
it and you can't teach it, not to the level that he has it. He just
has it.''

COWBOYS GET DRESSING DOWN ON TURKEY DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Minnesota rookie receiver Randy Moss couldn't
join the Cowboys as he wished.
</P>
<P>
   So yesterday, he gave his thanks and beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Again, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Moss caught three passes, all for touchdowns, to overshadow a
455-yard passing day by Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman in leading
the Vikings to a 46-36 Thanksgiving Day victory against the Cowboys
before 64,366 fans at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, whom the Cowboys passed on with the eighth pick in the
1998 draft because of his bad-boy past, reaped his revenge by
amassing 163 yards receiving against a Deion Sanders-less Cowboys
secondary. His first-quarter touchdown receptions of 51 and 56
yards sparked the Vikings to a 21-6 lead. His 56-yard score in the
third quarter put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Moss has been making the entire league pay since
falling to the Vikings as the 21st pick. After the game yesterday,
Moss said he's now glad the Cowboys didn't draft him and lamented
not being able to match up against the All-Pro Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, Deion was hurt,'' Moss said. ``A lot of people wanted
to see our matchup. I had to make it happen anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Moss heroics, the Cowboys simply didn't have enough
great players or great plays to keep up with the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham passed for 359 yards and
four touchdowns. Receiver Cris Carter complemented Moss with seven
receptions for 135 yards, including a 54-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   The 46 points scored by the Vikings were the most by a Cowboys
opponent since Cincinnati scored 50 on Dec. 8, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   And if it hadn't been decided already, the NFC Central-leading
Vikings (11-1) clearly established themselves as the team to beat
in the NFC with the decisive victory against the Cowboys (8-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us will be in the playoffs,'' Vikings coach Dennis
Green said. ``But right now, we are focused on winning home-field
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey was left with a healthy dose of
respect for Moss and the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an exceptional receiver,'' Gailey said. ``He can go make
plays, and they are a scoring machine. But I didn't think they'd
score that many points against us. Hopefully, we'll get a chance to
play them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Right, now the Cowboys are just focusing on getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey pointed to a litany of mistakes as the reason for the
loss _ namely eight dropped passes, 13 penalties for 152 yards and
a failure in the red zone that forced the Cowboys to match the
Vikings' touchdowns with field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a good football team,'' Gailey said. ``We didn't
play good enough to win the game. Obviously, they made a ton of big
plays. But we made too many mistakes on offense. We had dropped
passes and untimely penalties that stopped drives.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cowboys, who have been chided for their dominance
in the NFC East, seemed to make enough plays to prove that they
rank among the better teams in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman continued his hot performances of late, completing 34 of
57 passes for a career-high 455 yards and a 67-yard touchdown pass
to former Country Day star Patrick Jeffers in helping turn what
appeared to be an early blowout into a 24-19 game in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings seemed unstoppable in the first quarter when they
averaged 22.7 yards per play and jumped out to a 21-6 lead. But
Aikman brought them back with his club-record 11th career 300-yard
passing game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense was equally as efficient as the Vikings',
totaling 513 yards. Aikman connected with nine different receivers,
led by Michael Irvin with 10 catches for 137 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And if not for two third-quarter plays by Moss, the outcome
might have been different. After not being heard from in the second
quarter because of double-teaming by the Cowboys' defense, Moss set
up a 12-yard touchdown run by Leroy Hoard by drawing a 50-yard
interference penalty. He then closed the quarter with a 56-yard
catch-and-run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a short pass from Cunningham, Moss broke a tackle from
reserve cornerback Charlie Williams and sprinted up the sideline.
He finished the play by burning backup cornerback Terry Billups
with a stop-and-go move to put the Vikings up 39-22 with six
seconds left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Close, however, was not good enough for the Cowboys, who refused
to be satisfied with a moral victory. They also declined to use
Sanders' injury (sprained left toe) or the second-quarter departure
of cornerback Kevin Smith (lower back bruise) _ which put Williams
and Billups, a recent practice squad-signee, in at cornerback _ as
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no consolations in this ballgame,'' Aikman said.
``There are too many guys on this ballclub that have accomplished
too much to sit here and say we proved ourselves because we kept up
with an outstanding team. We come to ballgames to win, not saying
`keep it close.' We want to win. And we didn't get it done.''

JEFFERS BOLSTERS BATTERED COWBOYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys continue to lose receivers to
injuries. But their passing game seems to be in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ogden suffered a right shoulder bruise in the first half of
yesterday's 46-36 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, joining Ernie
Mills and Deion Sanders on the Cowboys' receiver hit list. But
Patrick Jeffers stepped in to add to his local-boy-makes-good
legend, making three catches for 92 yards, including a 67-yard
touchdown for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat did a nice job,'' Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said of
the Fort Worth Country Day graduate. ``I have a lot of confidence
in him. He makes plays and runs excellent routes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers, who came to the Cowboys in a trade with Denver before
the season, was inactive for eight of the Cowboys' first nine
games. He caught his first pass against Arizona Nov. 15, and Sunday
against Seattle he nearly scored on a pass from Aikman at the end
of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:32 left in the first half yesterday, he beat Vikings
defensive back Jimmy Hitchcock on a post route and won a foot race
to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the touchdown play, I was just hoping \RHitchcock\S
wouldn't dive to trip me up,'' Jeffers said. ``I just looked for
the ball and ran as fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the 6-foot-3, 217-pound Jeffers heard
comparisons to Broncos receiver Ed McCaffrey, who leads the AFC in
receiving yards. He doesn't seem to mind such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be comparisons to Ed,'' Jeffers said.
``He's the standard for tall white guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers coach Dwain Painter, who was with Jeffers in
Denver last season, said he knew Jeffers had the type of talent to
be an impact play for the Cowboys' passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so big and has deceptive speed,'' Painter said. ``He has
excellent ability to get in and out of breaks, change directions in
the routes. He can run and he has excellent hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will figure prominently into our offense in December.''

RUNNING BACK'S KNEE INJURY PUTS DAMPER ON VIKINGS' VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _After rolling up 471 yards of offense en route to
a 46-36 victory against the Cowboys yesterday at Texas Stadium, not
all was jubilant for the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive week, the Vikings lost one of their
big playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   With receiver Jake Reed out for the season with a back injury,
running back Robert Smith, one of the NFL's most explosive rushers,
left the game with what was called a sprained knee in the second
quarter. He is scheduled to have a magnetic resonance imaging today
to determine the extent of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping it's a sprain and not real serious,'' Vikings
coach Dennis Green said. ``We're concerned it might be several
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith, who has three touchdown runs of 50 or more yards
this season, was barely missed. Veteran Leroy Hoard stepped in and
carried five times for 58 yards and two touchdowns, including a
50-yarder in which he burst through traffic inside, flattened
Cowboys cornerback Terry Billups and rumbled down the sideline for
the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm here,'' Hoard said. ``I'm not here to rush for
1,500 yards, but like everyone else who doesn't play that much,
when you're called upon, you've got to go in there and do your job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game plan doesn't change when I'm in there. We run the
same plays, but what is expected has to change a little. You know I
ain't going 80 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that he did go 50 yards, Hoard replied, ``Even a blind
squirrel finds an acorn every once in while.''
Disappointed without Deion
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' celebrated receivers, Randy Moss and Cris Carter,
said they were disappointed Deion Sanders, the Cowboys' All-Pro
cornerback, spent the day on the sideline with a sprained big toe.
</P>
<P>
   With Sanders out _ he was later joined by fellow starter Kevin
Smith, who left in the second quarter with a back contusion _ the
Vikings' wideouts went wild, combining for 10 catches, 298 yards
and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily Deion was hurt, but injuries happen,'' Moss said. ``A
lot of people wanted to see our matchup, but I had to make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carter, ``We were looking forward to the opportunity to
play against him because he's a phenomenal player. When you first
see on the schedule that you're coming to Dallas on Thanksgiving,
you're looking forward to it because you know you're going to play
against the best. He might be the best cornerback ever to play the
position.''
</P>
<P>
   One man not disappointed in Sanders' absence was Green, who was
ecstatic to see backups Billups and Charlie Williams on the field
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``National Football League,'' Green said. ``You know what I'm
saying? Everybody's got to carry their own water. Everybody's a
pro; everybody's getting paid.''
Closing in on history
With four games remaining in the regular season, Moss is closing in
on several NFL rookie receiving records.
</P>
<P>
   His 11 touchdown catches are two shy of the NFL record, set by
Green Bay's Bill Howton in 1952 and matched by San Diego's John
Jefferson in 1979. His 1,014 yards are 459 behind the 1,473 posted
by Houston's Bill Groman in 1960.

INJURY SPOILS SANDERS-MOSS DUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The long-anticipated matchup between Minnesota
Vikings rookie receiver Randy Moss and Cowboys All-Pro cornerback
Deion Sanders was pre-empted two hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has been hampered by a sprained left big toe, told
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey that he wouldn't be able to play. The
Cowboys' banged-up secondary, which was already playing without top
backup cornerback Kevin Mathis (fractured forearm), took another
hit late in the second quarter when starting cornerback Kevin Smith
was sidelined with a lower back contusion.
</P>
<P>
   That left reserves Charlie Williams and Terry Billups to go
against Moss and the vaunted Vikings passing attack. Billups was
called up last week from the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham passed for 359 yards and
four touchdowns. Moss caught three passes for 163 yards and three
touchdowns and Cris Carter caught seven passes for 135 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, whose team unsuccessfully tried to mix coverages to slow
down the Vikings, said not having Sanders was a major setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Deion on the field makes a big difference,'' Gailey
said. ``You don't lose a player of his caliber and it not affect
your football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys hope Sanders and Smith will be ready for the New
Orleans Saints on Dec. 6. \Nname: _ Clarence E. Hill Jr. Second-ary
helpings With Sanders' absence and the first-half injury to Kevin
Smith, rookies Billups and Izell Reese saw extensive action against
the NFL's third most-potent passing offense. Each played well as
the Vikings were limited to 98 yards passing in the second half.
Reese's third-quarter interception led to a Cowboys field goal that
closed the gap to 32-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made plays on special teams, now I'm trying to make plays
to help us win games,'' Reese said. ``\RThe Vikings\S have some
high-caliber receivers, big-play makers. They really hurt us
today.''
</P>
<P>
   For Billups, brother of former NFL defensive back Lewis Billups,
he couldn't have been better prepared for his first professional
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd see some playing time, I just didn't know how
much,'' Billups said. ``It came against one of the best teams we're
going to see. I felt prepared because I face some of the best wide
receivers in the league every day in practice.'' Rookie comparison
Comparisons were inevitable between the player the Cowboys drafted
in April, defensive end Greg Ellis, and the one many believed they
would draft, Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was steady, if not spectacular, with two passes deflected
at the line of scrimmage and one tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I wanted to make a statement. That's the kind of guy
I am,'' Ellis said. ``Against another rookie, it doesn't matter
whether it's Randy Moss or \RBengals linebacker\S Brian Simmons or
anybody else.'' \Nname:_Stephen V. Schroats Dropping by When it
came to sustaining first-half drives, the Cowboys' offense dropped
the ball. Again and again.
</P>
<P>
   By game's end, the unofficial tally had reached eight dropped
balls, including three by Michael Irvin and two each by Billy Davis
and David LaFleur and one by Eric Bjornson.
</P>
<P>
   What caused this sudden case of butterfingers? Residue from a
pregame turkey brunch?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say. You know that guys on this level can catch
the football,'' said Patrick Jeffers, one who held his own. ``I
think more than anything, it was just a case of being overanxious.
But anything more than one is too many.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by running back Sherman Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was trying to make big plays. We just got
overanxious,'' Williams said. \Nname:_ Stephen V. Schroats Nothing
special Kevin Smith had his first career punt return (11 yards),
and Sherman Williams had his first career kickoff return (18
yards). And Minnesota's David Palmer would have had two long kick
returns if not for penalties.
</P>
<P>
   This was all part of a colorful day on special teams for the
Cowboys that included rushing 11 men to try to block a
second-quarter punt by Minnesota's Mitch Berger. That punt rolled
for 65 yards before being downed at the Cowboys' 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to do something aggressive,'' special
teams coach Joe Avezzano said of the call to try to block the punt.
``It was a risk/reward thing. We knew the downside would be a punt
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Cowboys' punt rush did get a piece of a Berger
kick that went 9 yards. But on that play, Billups was back for his
first career punt return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries really hurt us on special teams,'' said Avezzano, who
also lost his third-line kickoff returner Jeff Ogden to an injury.
``By the end of the game, we were looking for volunteers.''
\Nname:_ Mitchell Krugel Another flag day Penalties plagued the
Cowboys again yesterday. In a victory against Seattle on Sunday,
the Cowboys committed 15 infractions for 129 yards. Against
Minnesota, they had 13 for 152 yards. In their three previous
games, they had 25 penalties for 213 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties yesterday were costly. Leading 24-19 in the third
quarter, the Vikings faced a third-and-18 from their 38-yard line.
Quarterback Randall Cunningham threw long for Moss, who didn't
catch the ball because Cowboys defensive back Kenny Wheaton was
holding his jersey. That 50-yard pass interference penalty set up a
12-yard touchdown run by Leroy Hoard, and the Cowboys never cut the
lead to less than 10 points afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two near the red zone in the first half, but after
that, it seemed like we quit them \Rpenalties\S,'' Gailey said.
``But we just had too many mistakes today.'' \Nname:_ Mitchell
Krugel Charting Emmitt With his second three-touchdown effort in
the past three games, Emmitt Smith has 123 career rushing scores to
tie Marcus Allen for the all-time NFL lead.
</P>
<P>
   With his 44 yards rushing, Smith passed Jim Brown into fifth
place on the NFL's all-time rushing list. Smith has 12,341 yards
rushing. Fourth on the list is former Cowboys star Tony Dorsett,
who had 12,739 career yards. \Nname:_ Mitchell Krugel He said it

BANGED-UP COWBOYS HAD NO CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys doubled him. They singled him. They
even held him twice. But with Deion Sanders unable to play because
of a sprained big toe, they still had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings rookie Randy Moss stomped out the Cowboys'
best-laid plans. He caught only three passes. But he might as well
have caught 300. All went for touchdowns, 51, 56, and 56 yards as
the Vikings trounced the Cowboys, 46-36, yesterday at Texas
Stadium, the most points the Cowboys have allowed in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player and he's young, but age doesn't mean
anything to him,'' said Cowboys safety Kenny Wheaton, whose
``50-yard'' pass interference call against Moss led to a Vikings
touchdown in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't coach making plays,'' Wheaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without Sanders made a difference in the game, several
Cowboys players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're banged up,'' said cornerback Charlie Williams, who
replaced Sanders. ``Not having Deion made a difference. When we get
everybody healthy and back in the lineup, we'll be contenders. I'd
love to see them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss (163 yards) and Cris Carter (7 receptions for 135 yards and
1 TD) led a big-play attack that saw each of the Vikings' six
touchdown drives take no longer than five plays, or 2:28 off the
game clock. Five of the touchdown plays traveled at least 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Smith missed the second half with a back
contusion. But he played long enough to become part of the Vikings
highlight film in the first quarter that could have summed up the
whole game. When Smith and safety Darren Woodson bit on a
flea-flicker, Moss ran past them to catch a 51-yard touchdown pass
just 1:57 into the game. Smith tried to grab Moss on his second
catch of the game, but Moss ran down Randall Cunningham's throw
anyway, for 56 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Those scores sandwiched Carter's 54-yard touchdown, which came
when he beat the coverage of Woodson and Wheaton. Before the first
quarter was over, Cunningham had 184 of his 359 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of their stuff was just up the field and they made plays
on the ball,'' safety George Teague said. ``Randall tossed it up
there, and they got it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys adjusted in the second quarter, doubling both
outside wide receivers. They also blitzed more so that Cunningham
would not have time to throw. The strategy worked for a while. From
the beginning of the second quarter to near the end of the third, a
hurried Cunningham threw 14 incompletions, was sacked once and
threw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, once down 21-6, had closed to 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to mix it up and we got a better feel for the speed
of the game in the second and third quarter,'' coach Chan Gailey
said. ``But then we let them get right back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton's pass-interference penalty on Moss set up a 12-yard
Leroy Hoard scoring run to give the Vikings a 32-19 lead. Then Moss
broke the Cowboys' spirits when he caught a short Cunningham pass
in the flat, broke a Williams tackle at midfield, then outran the
rest of the Cowboys for a 56-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings led 39-22.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, mercifully, the Randy Moss show was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like he is an exceptional receiver,'' Gailey
said in the understatement of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had a great day.''

WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES GATHERING REVEALS A SPLIT FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the 50-year-old World Council of Churches gathers this week
in Harare, Zimbabwe, for just its eighth assembly, its member
churches _ now more than 330 _ will represent a history remarkable
for both its faithful witness to Jesus Christ and for its
scandalous divisions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 2,000 years, traditional Christianity has held to a
few core beliefs. Chief among them is that Jesus of Nazareth was
both fully God and fully human, that he died for humanity's
sinfulness, that he was bodily resurrected from the dead and that
those who trust in him are saved by God's grace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is far from an exhaustive Christian theology, and though
some may quibble with my wording, it will be hard to find any among
the churches represented in Zimbabwe that would deny those basic
beliefs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But despite a theological center nearly all churches can affirm,
the very existence of 300-plus different denominations and branches
of Christianity shows something has gone dreadfully wrong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not, of course, simply Christianity that is so divided.
Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and other faiths, too, are fractured,
though perhaps not as spectacularly as Christendom. But, unlike
Christianity, none of those religions locates its roots in a single
historical human being with a unique claim to divinity _ a man who
is reported (in John 17) to have prayed for unity among his
followers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sad reality is that Christians too often have forgotten that
``the truth'' does not reside in a dogma or a creed. Rather,
Christian faith affirms that ``the truth'' was and is a person, who
declared himself ``the way, the truth and the life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given that belief, one might think followers of that truth could
get along with one another, even if they have sometimes-sharp
differences with followers of other faiths. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't happened. Indeed, theological divisions and
discord appeared in the 1st century church and are recorded in the
New Testament book of Acts. By the time of the First Council of
Nicea in 325, the church was in a profound argument with itself
over this simple question: Who is Jesus Christ? And though the
creed resulting from that council professed both Christ's divinity
and humanity, the argument went on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At important milestones in church history one always finds
powerful ideas clashing with other powerful ideas, each represented
by dynamic and often colorful personalities. To say that human ego,
politics, sinfulness and depravity have played a role in the
development of the churches gathering in Zimbabwe is simply to
state the obvious. The less obvious qualifier is that honest church
leaders recognize those failures and look on the church as less a
museum for saints than a busy hospital for sinners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the first truly cataclysmic break in Christendom
occurred in the 11th century, when long-standing disagreements
between Western and Eastern Christians resulted in a split that
produced what today we still call Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman
Catholicism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is instructive to note, by the way, that the Orthodox
churches are members of the World Council of Churches but have
become skittish about their continued participation, while the
Catholic Church has never joined, but ``works cooperatively'' with
it, as the council says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 16th century Protestant Reformation and the establishment in
that same era of the Church of England divided the remaining
Catholic Church and eventually produced so many denominations and
sects that it takes a computer to track them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet the astonishing thing about the faith is that the hope
for unity has never died, and efforts to reunite it continue _ with
some success. In fact, the 20th century ecumenical movement that,
at its best, the World Council of Churches represents has
reconciled some of the disharmony plaguing the faith. Lutherans,
Catholics, Episcopalians, Presbyterians and others are, at various
levels, talking with each other now and, in some cases, wiping out
old barriers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet many differences remain, from how to celebrate the
sacraments (and how many sacraments there really are) to how to
spread the Christian gospel while creating good relations with
other faiths. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the World Council of Churches' assembly in Zimbabwe
will be a stage on which to see these paradoxical realities:
Christianity's humiliating _ at times hateful _ divisions and its
commitment to bringing a message of reconciliation to the whole
world. &QL;

 &HT;    COLUMN: Sadly, Miami of Ohio must hope for bowl berth at 10-1
 &HT;    By Dwayne Bray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Joel Maturi should be an FBI agent, chasing down
the Unabombers of the world. Or maybe an IRS agent. He has those
steely eyes and that poker face that convey serious business.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, Maturi is a jovial sort who doesn't work out of a
federal-office building. His work address is on the idyllic campus
of Miami University in Oxford, an hour's drive from Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's athletic director for not even a year, Maturi needs to
have a little sleuth in him as he tries to finagle a bowl berth for
Miami's 10-1 football team.
</P>
<P>
   In a sad commentary on the state of college football, the
RedHawks appear on the verge of being left out of one of the 22
NCAA-sanctioned bowl games. If that happens, Miami would be the
first team in good standing with the NCAA in the past 10 years not
to receive a bowl bid after a 10-win campaign. How could that be?
</P>
<P>
   The RedHawks play a soft schedule in the Mid American
Conference, no doubt, but whose fault is that? Not theirs.
</P>
<P>
   When they traveled to Chapel Hill to play then 12th-ranked North
Carolina earlier this season, they returned to Butler County with
the biggest college upset of the day. Add that to the fact that
they boast the second-leading rusher in the country in Travis
Prentice and that should mean bowl city.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't, not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   While college football fans focus most of their attention of the
higher-tier bowls _ will Ohio State get invited to the Orange Bowl,
for instance? _ perhaps the bigger drama is which deserving teams
will be left out of bowl play altogether.
</P>
<P>
   How many times will successful mid-majors such as Miami get
squeezed in favor of mediocre, 6-5 teams from the Big Ten and the
Southeastern Conference? The belief here is that teams should not
be awarded a bowl berth for playing one game over .500, no matter
what league they're from.
</P>
<P>
   Maturi has his sights set on the Liberty Bowl in Memphis or the
Music City Bowl in Nashville. He argues that Miami has 78,000
alumni within a few hours' driving distance of those towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of the bowls, we have offered them a significant
guarantee, which means we would buy tickets if we can't sell
them,'' said Maturi, a Notre Dame graduate who most recently was AD
at the University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty and the Music City would rather have West Virginia,
which is 7-3. The Mountaineers, however, are coveting a Gator Bowl
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   So Maturi is working officials from Memphis and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned in this business somebody is going to buy their
way a little more than you,'' he says. ``We've even called the TV
networks to let them know we're marketable with Travis Prentice. We
also are touting our cradle-of-coaches reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   The win over North Carolina, however, looms large, perhaps in a
negative way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a pretty good football team and some people would rather
lose to a West Virginia than to a Miami,'' Maturi notes.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a big blow if Miami doesn't get into a bowl. Such a
shaft promises to hurt recruiting, because kids don't want to play
for a winning team that has to sit out the post season? Maturi also
has to worry about losing coach Randy Walker to a higher-profile
program, one that can get its team into a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to just hurt for our young men and our coaching
staff if someday I have to go to them and say, `You went 10-1, you
beat a nationally ranked team, but you're not going to be playing
anymore football this year.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt.''

 &HT;    Holyfield among gospel network investors
 &HT;    By Danielle Herubin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Stuart attorney Willie Gary and a group
of investors, including heavyweight boxing champion Evander
Holyfield, have launched a family-oriented gospel television
network.
</P>
<P>
   MBC Gospel Network, currently only available to satellite dish
owners, will offer a mix of gospel shows, church broadcasts,
religious music, spiritual talk shows and a news network that
reports only good news, Gary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put family values back where it should be,'' Gary
said. ``I want to reach out to the people, I want to reclaim our
youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary is a wealthy personal injury lawyer who spends a great deal
of his time and money working with the underprivileged. His most
recent case, however, was representing Flo-Sun Inc.'s three sugar
companies in a series of suits by cane workers _ the type of
workers he usually represents.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors include Marlon Jackson of the Jackson Five and
former Major League baseball player Cecil Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   MBC's CEO Alvin James declined to say how much money investors
put up for the network, except to say it is in the millions. He
said the investors have committed to keep the network going for
years, even without profits. ``We have the resources to stay the
long haul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The network was officially launched from its Atlanta offices on
Nov. 17. And though negotiations are continuing with cable and
media companies, so far its programming is only available to
satellite dish owners (Galaxy 6, transponder 13).
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the shows go on, 24 hours a day. Programs in the works
include a Larry King-style talk show called The Spiritual Impact,
hosted by Gary, and a music video show called Rythym and Praise,
hosted by Jackson's daughter, Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   The good news will be brought to viewers by broadcasting
students at historically black colleges, James said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building a news organization that would focus strictly
on positive news,'' James said. ``We're calling it family news.''
</P>
<P>
   James also said there are plans for a two-hour home-shopping
program, which will promote religious books and tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Gary said money raised from some programs will be used for
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make a lot of money, but we want to share the
wealth,'' Gary said. ``God has blessed me _ I don't need the money,
but I thrive off challenges.''

 &HT;    Clemson panel studying better faculty integration
 &HT;    By Lyn Riddle
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON, S.C. _ Bruce Ransom is 49 years old. He's earned a
Ph.D. in political science from the University of Virginia, worked
as a top aide for a famous governor and headed a public policy
research institute.
</P>
<P>
   He brings a mix of academic and real world experience into his
classroom. But something else sets the associate professor apart
from many of his colleagues. He's black, one of only 45
African-Americans on a full-time faculty of 1,089. That amounts to
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Ransom said, ``4 percent does not put Clemson in bad
company.'' In fact, most major research institutions across the
United States do no better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemson President Constantine ``Deno'' Curris wants to do
better. He has established the Commission on the Status of Black
Faculty and Staff, headed by Ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The commission begins its work as Clemson faces two lawsuits
alleging present and former faculty members were discriminated
against because they are black.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in 1996 in U.S. District Court, Romando
James, an assistant professor with the university's Agricultural
Extension Service, alleges he was passed over for a full
professorship because he is black. A faculty member for 18 years,
James holds two master's and a doctorate, but was denied promotion
twice by Diane Smathers, who heads the Family and Youth Service
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Cromer, James' lawyer, said James was denied the first
time because he did not have a doctorate. He earned one in 1992 but
was told he did not have a statewide reputation and had not
published enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's written books, done television documentaries, done
motivational programs,'' said Cromer. ``He's well deserving of a
full professorship.'' Cromer expects the case to be heard soon
after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Haile Larebo, who was born in Ethiopia but spent most
of his life in England and Italy, sued Clemson for racial and
national-origin discrimination. Larebo was fired after five years
in the history department. He said he had gotten excellent
evaluations three years in a row and then was told by his
supervisors that students did not understand his accent.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, his superiors claimed he was disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Larebo, now an assistant professor at Morehouse College in
Atlanta, said he endured ``continuous harassment'' at Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I realized I was a black man was when I arrived
at Clemson,'' he said. ``There is division not only among the
students but also among faculty. The statements they make are so
shocking you cannot believe these are educated people.''
</P>
<P>
   His suit is on appeal before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals after being dismissed on summary judgment by Judge William
Catoe. Larebo believes Clemson's commission is an outgrowth of his
lawsuit, but doubts it will do much to heal the rift between the
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need sensitivity training,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ransom said the commission was not set up as a result of the
lawsuits, though he acknowledged the facts of the cases may become
part of the study.
</P>
<P>
   He said the primary goal is to look at whatever barriers the
university inadvertently has set up to keep blacks from becoming
faculty members, as well as those that keep the ones who are hired
from feeling they are full partners in the life of the university.
</P>
<P>
   Many major colleges boast about successful minority recruitment,
but when the numbers are analyzed, it is often found that there has
been a revolving door of faculty members dissatisfied because they
feel disenfranchised from the community at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a part of an effort to create an image,''
Ransom said. ``That's the challenge to Clemson _ to make black
faculty members feel like they are not a guest visiting but really
a central and crucial part. I think we haven't gotten there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said schools generally thought to have done well at
encouraging minority participation include the University of
Maryland, which brought in several full professors to pursue
research on public policy from a black perspective, and Harvard
University, which established the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for
Afro-American Research. The Du Bois institute has hired researchers
of varying backgrounds to study the black experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of talent, they've brought together a stable of
thoroughbreds, you might say,'' Ransom said.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom came to Clemson four years ago after his boss, New Jersey
Gov. Jim Florio, was defeated. He also taught at Rutgers for 15
years. But his roots are in South Carolina. He is a native of
Mullins, a tiny town in the tobacco-growing Pee Dee region in
northeast South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As he and the other 12 commissioners begin wading through
information, preparing for a preliminary report at the end of the
school year, several statistics stand out. None of the school's top
administrators is black. One academic dean _ for health education
and human development _ is black.
</P>
<P>
   As for staffers, the school's overall black population is 16
percent of its 2,669 nonacademic employees. Trouble is, most are
janitors and cooks, Ransom said. One trustee is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I've been able to move to do the sorts of things
I've wanted to,'' said Ransom. ``But we're still at the point of
looking at numbers. We want to create a host of activities that
goes beyond just counting heads.''

 &HT;    Coverdell says he's made inroads with black voters
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The story across the South on Nov. 3 was the record
turnout of black voters that propelled Democrats into statewide
offices held by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) believes he's found an exception to
that story line: himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although exit polls showed Coverdell with only 8 percent of the
black vote in Georgia, a post-election analysis done by his
pollster suggests that Coverdell's share of the black vote was as
high as 21 percent. If the figure is accurate _ and there are some
who doubt it vigorously _ Coverdell would have set a Republican
record in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   No other Republican candidate for statewide office, with the
exception of former Attorney General Michael Bowers in his first
election as a Republican, has come anywhere close to capturing as
much support among black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, Coverdell's pollster, said he believes it explains
why Coverdell did well against Democrat Michael Coles when so many
other Republicans across the South faltered. Strong black voter
turnout in Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia helped Democratic
gubernatorial candidates defeat Republican incumbents or, in the
case of Georgia, keep the governor's office in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrates, as the Bush brothers demonstrated in their
gubernatorial runs (in Florida and Texas), that Republicans can win
votes from a broad demographic coalition,'' Ayres said. ``Paul
Coverdell has already showed Republicans around the country how you
can use education as an effective issue. And now he's demonstrating
... how you can put together a broader demographic coalition than
many Republicans have traditionally accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Secrest, a Democratic pollster who handled several races in
Georgia this year, said Ayres' figures are not ``indefensible'' but
that he would wait until he did his own analysis later to determine
if they are accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me a bit if (Coverdell) made
statistically significant inroads in the black community,'' Secrest
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way Coverdell got 20 percent of the black vote,''
said David Bositis, senior analyst for the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, who studies black voting trends.
</P>
<P>
   Bositis, who just completed a detailed study of black voter
turnout in the midterm elections, said Coverdell would have won by
much more than the 52 percent he received on Election Day if he had
gotten one-fifth of every black vote cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the election would have been that close is if
Coles had gotten 90 percent of the black vote,'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether accurate or not, Coverdell's eagerness to call attention
to his support among black voters underscores the predicament
Republicans find themselves in with the changing dynamics of the
American electorate, particularly in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Because black voters have traditionally voted 9-to-1 for
Democrats, Republicans have been able to win in the South if they
win 60 percent or better of the white vote.
</P>
<P>
   This midterm election, however, shattered many of those
assumptions. Black voters turned out in sharply higher numbers than
in previous elections. In Georgia, for example, black voter turnout
jumped from 19 percent in 1994 to 29 percent this year. The story
was similar in South Carolina and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   If these trends continue, Republican candidates will be faced
with the almost impossible task of offsetting heavy black voter
turnout with much, much greater support from white voters. Either
that, or they need to draw much greater support from black voters.
Inclusion, a term that Republicans have used for years, becomes not
just a matter of party rhetoric but a matter of ``tactical
imperative,'' said Secrest.
</P>
<P>
   As they lick their wounds from the results of the Nov. 3
elections, Republicans have found solace in the strong performance
of several Republican candidates among minority voters. Gov. George
W. Bush in Texas captured 27 percent of the black vote and almost
half the Hispanic vote, a large segment of the Texas electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Republican, won 27 percent of the
black vote. In the Senate, Arlen Specter (R-Penn.) won 27 percent
of the black vote, Sen. Christopher Bond won 33 percent in Missouri
and Sen.-elect George Voinovich won 30 percent of the black vote in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these candidates had some ties to the black community,
Bositis said. Voinovich, for example, is the former mayor of
Cleveland, a majority black city, and was fairly supportive of
affirmative action as Ohio governor.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who won only 3 percent of the black vote in his 1992
runoff election victory, has no special links with the black
community.
</P>
<P>
   But Coverdell said his opposition to illegal drugs, which he
advertised on statewide television and on black radio stations in
South Georgia, resonated among black voters.

 &HT;    Holyfield among gospel network investors

 &HT;    Peachtree City pulls back from widely publicized natural-gas
police fleet
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEACHTREE CITY, Ga. _ Peachtree City is putting the brakes on a
highly publicized three-year experiment with natural gas-powered
police cars.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted last month to spend $904,338 to buy 33
new police vehicles so that all officers living in the city can
drive a car home. Only four of those cars will be powered by
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 12 of the 23 cars in the current police fleet use
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Jim Murray was a big booster of natural gas police
cars back in 1995, when the city started converting police cars. He
predicted maintenance costs and pollution would be decreased. CNN
did a segment on the Police Department fleet, and reporters from
national papers called.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the other agencies went into it like we did,'' Murray
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance costs didn't drop as much as expected, and the city
had problems fueling a lot of cars in succession, since compression
had to build up in the pump, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers said natural gas cars didn't provide as much
acceleration or as many miles per tank as regular gas cars,
according to the chief, and officers who drove into other counties
to pick up suspects sometimes had problems finding natural gas
pumps to refill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Tyler, spokeswoman for the city, said Peachtree City still
is dedicated to natural gas. She said the city has 96 total
vehicles, of which 16 are fueled by natural gas. The natural gas
police cars will be used by other city departments or by police
administrators, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is dedicated to alternative fuels,'' Tyler said.
``But we're also dedicated to having the most efficient police
force.''

 &HT;    Panel urges $1.2 million for dams
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More inspectors, more money and more attention
are needed to address the growing problem of unsafe dams in Texas,
according to a report by a state House committee.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended that the Legislature add 15 staff members,
at an annual cost of $1.2 million, to the state's six-member
dam-safety team. It also called for legislation requiring more
frequent inspections and allowing local soil and water districts to
levy taxes or fees on property owners to raise money for upgrading
dams operated by such districts.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the House Natural Resources Committee said fewer
than 2 percent of the 7,200 dams in Texas are inspected annually.
Of 1,560 dams in populated areas, nearly 400 need improvements to
withstand all or a reasonable part of a worst-case storm without
collapsing and unleashing floodwaters onto downstream homes,
businesses, schools and roads. Eight hundred of the dams in
populated areas need evaluations to determine their adequacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding early dam failures, Texas has been lucky in
recent years,'' the report warned. ``Over the last decade, there
has been only one known death resulting from 44 dam failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the deteriorating conditions of the state's
smaller dams and the continued growth in the state's population are
increasing risks to the downstream public and to the health and
safety of the public users of many of these dams.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to be released shortly, but the Austin
American-Statesman obtained an advance copy from the committee. The
panel's review, ordered by House Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale Center,
echoes many of the findings of a report released in July by a task
force appointed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission. Shortcomings in the conservation commission's
dam-safety program and state law were first detailed in May 1997 by
the American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendations are expected to receive serious
consideration by the Legislature, which convenes in January.
However, some lawmakers could be resistant to expanding local soil
and water districts' taxing power.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the recommendations seem workable, said Jeffrey Saitas,
executive director of the conservation commission. ``There seem to
be some reasonable steps in trying to grapple with a challenging
issue for this state,'' he said. ``I think it goes far enough in
taking the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Robby Cook, D-Eagle Lake, a member of the committee,
said he was surprised to learn that there are so many dams in Texas
and that development downstream from inadequate structures is
exposing more and more people to risk. He said putting financial
and personnel resources into better maintenance, inspections and
repairs would be money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of behind the eight-ball now,'' Cook said. ``When
you're dealing with public safety it's a whole lot better to react
early and plan so we don't get into disastrous consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has more dams than any other state. The dams, made of
earth, rock, concrete and other materials, hold back streams or
rivers for flood control, irrigation, livestock, industry, power
generation, recreation and fire protection.
</P>
<P>
   But many dams, especially smaller ones, have fallen into
disrepair. Their owners _ farmers, ranchers, homeowners'
associations, soil and water districts, cities, counties and
utilities _ often cannot afford hundreds of thousands of dollars or
even millions for upgrading, the committee concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The panel identified private dams, 62 percent of the statewide
inventory, as a special challenge. The vast majority of 98 dam
failures in Texas since 1900 involved private dams. The panel
offered no plan for raising money to repair private dams but called
for creation of an insurance risk pool.
</P>
<P>
   The committee identified loopholes in state law but offered no
recommendation on whether they should be plugged. For example,
state law does not require a permit for construction of a dam.
Rather, a permit is required only for the surface-water right
associated with a dam.
</P>
<P>
   But small dams built on private property for livestock and
domestic uses require no water right and therefore are built
without scrutiny by state regulators. Flood detention ponds that
are normally dry also are exempt from the water-rights process and,
therefore, from the need to have construction plans approved. The
livestock and detention dams nonetheless are supposed to meet state
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended that some safety standards be relaxed.
For example, dam owners could develop emergency warning plans in
cases where existing structures ``cannot be reasonably upgraded,''
the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations drew a mixed review from Brad Iarossi,
president of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, a
national group based in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly going from a staff of six to 21 is an enormous
investment in dam safety that we think is great,'' Iarossi said.
</P>
<P>
   But he questioned substituting emergency plans for structural
improvements. ``I'm not sure emergency action plans work that well.
You may get people out, but you can't get their homes out,''
Iarossi said.

 &HT;    Bills may put brake on driving under 18
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Having chewed up and spit out a plan to rein in
some older drivers, the legislative meat-grinder is about to take
another bite at a plan to curtail nighttime driving by teens.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dallas Rep. Tony Goolsby, citing impressive negative
reaction, withdrew his bill that would have required motorists over
age 75 to take a road test to renew their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Sen. Royce West says he will soon renew his crusade to
get some drivers under 18 off the roads at night. A similar bill
has been filed in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is careening headfirst into opposition from the
Senate committee chairman who killed it last time and a governor
(and father of two 16-year-old daughters) who also supports the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   At the gubernatorial candidates' debate in El Paso last month,
Bush said he had not heard much about the graduated license plan
that phases in the full-privilege license that teens see as their
ticket to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the law ought to stay the way it is, at first blush,''
said Bush, who, referring to his twins, likes to joke that ``there
are not enough DPS officers in the state of Texas to protect my
fellow Texans from these new drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Also lining up against the plan is Sen. John Whitmire,
D.-Houston, the Senate Criminal Justice Committee chairman, who
refused to give it a hearing in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a lot of governmental control and intervention
that is unnecessary,'' he said Monday. ``Parents should be allowed
to supervise and use their good judgment with their kids before we
go into more government control.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Texans by the thousands safely navigate the streets every
day and night, said Whitmire, father of 16- and 15-year-old
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have tragedies and accidents, and they are
regretful,'' he said Monday. ``But I don't think this legislation
would cure them.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of graduated licensing says it has been at least a
partial cure in states that have enacted it.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 28 states have intermediate or provisional licenses
that gradually increase driving privileges. Twenty-three states
restrict nighttime driving. Eight states limit the number of
passengers in a young driver's vehicle. For example, an
inexperienced driver in Connecticut can have only one passenger in
his or her vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which
supports graduated licensing as a way to reduce wrecks and deaths,
said motor vehicle crashes are the top cause of death for people
ages 15-20.
</P>
<P>
   Texas statistics for 1997, the most recent available, show the
state had 348,000 licensed drivers under 18 out of about 13 million
licensed drivers. Those drivers were involved in 27,360 of the
562,407 accidents statewide. That means 2.6 percent of the drivers
were involved in 4.9 percent of the wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the plan is co-sponsored by House
Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo. Under the plan,
drivers under age 18 would get ``intermediate'' licenses barring
them from driving from 30 minutes after sunset until 30 minutes
before sunrise unless accompanied by a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The intermediate license would become a full-privilege license
after six months, if the holder did not have a traffic violation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would be phased in, beginning with a voluntary system
that would allow under-18 drivers to take an intermediate license
in return for a mandatory insurance discount.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johns of the Southwestern Insurance Information Service
says experience in other states shows that the program reduces
accidents and fatalities and, in turn, leads to reduced insurance
premiums for young drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry, however, opposes any plan mandating
premium cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see the history before there is any mandated
discount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Prairie Rep. Joe Driver, a State Farm agent and father of
a teen daughter who thinks she is getting her license this week
(memo to daughter: Dad says don't count on it), said Monday the
graduated license concept is a lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   The motive, says Driver, is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious thing is it is going to save lives,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side, Royce West, D-Dallas, is gearing up for
another battle on the issue, according to aide Janna Burleson.
Restricting nighttime driving for new drivers is a ``no-brainer,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   West's bill will include exemptions for young drivers who must
drive to get to or from work at night. His 1997 bill, which
dead-ended in the Senate, would have allowed full-privilege
licenses for 17-year-olds who completed driver's education courses.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, a 16-year-old who has completed a
state-approved driver's education course gets a full-privilege
license without taking a road test.
</P>
<P>
   It's too much responsibility, too soon and with too little
experience, says Driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas PTA, again, has made the restricted driver's license a
top priority in its legislative program, according to Pam Hearne of
Lubbock, the organization's membership chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now in Texas they have a very brief amount (behind the
wheel) before they get the license,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearne agrees with Whitmire that parents can restrict nighttime
driving by their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have a lot of parents that don't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearnes bar their 16-year-old son from driving after 9 p.m.
But still, he has had two wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically goes to and from school,'' said Hearne. ``His
first was to, and his second was from.''

 &HT;    Serial killings feared in Mississippi town
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two elderly women have been found strangled in their homes in
the past two weeks in Columbus, Miss., where that sort of thing
just didn't happen before, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually have one or two murders a year, but they're
heat-of-passion killings, beer-joint killings,'' said Columbus
Police Chief Donald Freshour.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Everett, 67, was found in her bedroom Nov. 17 strangled to
death and bound with electrical cord from an appliance.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 10, Louise Randall, 80, was found dead in her home, also
in the bedroom, also bound and strangled.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of forced entry or burglary at either home,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, there have been three other unsolved killings,
including that of an elderly man found Oct. 13, in this city of
30,000 near the Alabama border. Freshour said he does not think the
1996 case is linked to the most recent strangulations, but he isn't
ruling out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Police have interviewed dozens of transients and other possible
suspects but don't have any real leads, Freshour said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residents of Columbus, especially the elderly, are
buying guns and installing security devices in record numbers
because they fear a serial killer may be on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   The police department, worried about first-time gun owners
having accidents, are offering free gun safety classes twice daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think killing two people makes someone a serial
killer, but I think people have legitimate reason to be
concerned,'' Freshour said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials held a town meeting at the civic center Monday night
and fielded questions from those in the crowd of 250.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus City Council last week put up a $10,000 reward for
information on the slayings, and $10,000 more was put up from the
family that owns the Columbus Commercial Dispatch and a television
station in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going crazy,'' said Hal McClanahan, a lawyer in
Columbus. ``I'm in a choir at my church, and women aren't even
coming to choir practice. They are afraid to come out of the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the two women died on consecutive Tuesdays, residents
feared that someone would be found this Tuesday, but the night
passed without a killing, McClanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wind up with another dead white female,'' he said,
``it's going to be tense over here.''

 &HT;    Deadline draws near for owners of storage tanks
 &HT;    By Elizabeth McGuire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With less than a month remaining, industry
experts estimate more than one-third of underground storage tanks
in Texas do not meet federal leak-protection standards set 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 22, gas stations and other users of underground storage
tanks must either upgrade or shut down their systems, according to
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA regulations _ set in September 1988 _ are designed to
prevent gasoline leaks that can contaminate ground water, which is
the source of drinking water for half of the U.S. population. ``It
only takes one gallon of gasoline to ruin 5 million gallons of
drinking water,'' said John Cernero, enforcement officer for the
EPA's underground storage tank program.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations require owners of underground tanks to upgrade,
replace or remove tanks built before 1984 and to install leak
detection systems and corrosion protection for underground pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and industry
organizations say only 60 percent to 70 percent of the 31,650
active facilities are in compliance.
</P>
<P>
   These improvements come with a huge price tag. Average costs
range from $7,000 to $10,000 per location, depending on numerous
variables, including the number of tanks per site. ``To upgrade an
entire facility could cost as much as $30,000,'' said Joe Woodard
of the resource commission.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives anticipate mom-and-pop operations with
between two and four locations to be hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that because the margin of profit is so small,
there are a lot of these folks that will not be able to afford to
upgrade,'' said Scott Fisher, vice president of policy and public
affairs for the Texas Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys that have been in business a long time say
'the government has put me out of business.' I wouldn't argue that.
But you have to look at it the environment, especially in the fact
that Texas relies so heavily on ground water for its water
sources,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The association estimates its members have spent more than $400
million on removing tanks or installing monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Owners who acknowledge the environmental benefits are still
dismayed at its financial impact. ``It's not an improvement you can
sell,'' said Neal Newberry, owner of Tarrytown Texaco in Austin,
``It's just something you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination aside, delays also have been common due to
overbooked certified contractors. ``I talked to one particular
contractor who had not accepted a new account since March,'' said
Woodard. ``His work orders would carry him through the year.''
Ashraf Surani, who owns three convenience stores in Austin,
described the backlog as ``a tremendous problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been scheduled, and hope the contractor will get to
it,'' Surani said. ``He has been promising.''
</P>
<P>
   One Austin-based contractor, Tanknology Inc., estimates it will
work on 8,000 sites this year. Tanknology has 40 employees in
Austin and 450 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA regulation ``has been very positive for our business.
The whole industry is going nuts,'' said Dan Kubala of Tanknology.
``Industry (analysts) expect the work to continue at this level
until the third quarter of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial business owners are not the only ones facing these
problems. ``All these regulations don't just apply to retailers,
but also to federal and state agencies and factories,'' said
Cernero.
</P>
<P>
   Kubala said it all boils down to human nature and
procrastination: ``It's the same reason there is a line at the IRS
office at midnight. Now just think if you only got to do your taxes
once? That's how this is.''
</P>
<P>
   With just weeks to comply, industry executives and station
owners are wondering how noncompliant tank owners will be
penalized. The EPA and the resource commission both firmly say the
deadline will not be extended and that all tanks not in compliance
will be served violations.
</P>
<P>
   To enforce the law, the resource commission promises an enhanced
inspection process, possible flexibility if owners have contracted
repairs before the deadline, and steep penalties for recalcitrant
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty under the Health and Safety Code is $10,000
a day per violation. ``It's a rare case to need it, but it's
available to us,'' said Patrick Shaughnessy, spokesman for the
resource commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many speculate that the resource commission simply doesn't have
the staff to expeditiously enforce the regulations. Cernero said,
``It may take (TNRCC inspectors) a year before they get to
everyone, but the penalty will be higher the longer the time gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher of the petroleum marketers association said the group is
asking the state to identify those that are not complying with
them, and to give them notice of violation.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the high cost involved, some compliant owners are
unsympathetic to their delinquent peers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Smith of Triple S Petroleum, who along with his brother
operates 26 stations in the Austin area, is unrelenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't have any sympathy for those who haven't
done the work,'' Smith said. ``I've spent the money _ hundreds of
thousands of dollars. We shouldn't be at a competitive
disadvantage. I'm not trying to sound callous, but it's not like
anyone didn't know it was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Some owners still doubt the state's resolve. Tom Bull, owner of
Ken Walker's Texaco said, ``I almost think they are going to have
to go easy on (the smaller operators.) For lots of them it's their
livelihood. I'm trying to predict the government here, and that's
tough to do. But it would be hard to shut them all down.''

 &HT;    Crusader may bring his anti-preference ideas to Florida
 &HT;    By Christine Stapleton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In Ward Connerly's perfect world there
would be no box to check when a baby is born. Caucasian? African
American? Hispanic? Native American? Asian? Other?
</P>
<P>
   Universities wouldn't have different test-score standards for
admissions based on a student's skin color. Employers wouldn't
practice racial bookkeeping. No one would be treated differently
because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you use race as a basis for rewarding somebody, it causes
people to stand on the sidelines and seethe with anger,'' Connerly
said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   In his home state of California, Connerly is well-known as an
outspoken and controversial conservative. Although his skin is
brown, he doesn't consider himself an African American. Connerly is
the man who successfully spearheaded Proposal 209 _ the
constitutional amendment that outlawed racial and gender
preferences in government and education in California. He launched
a similar initiative in Washington state that passed in November.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly is a long-time friend of former California Gov. Pete
Wilson. He is a successful Sacramento businessman and a regent of
the University of California, the nation's largest institution of
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   But in Florida, Connerly is unknown. That may not be the case
for long: Florida is one of five states to which Connerly is
considering bringing his message. If he chooses Florida and is
successful in getting enough signatures, Florida voters could see a
proposed constitutional amendment similar to California's on the
ballot in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So why would a wealthy California businessman who's heard a
lifetime worth of Uncle Tom/Oreo/House Slave insults want to come
to Florida for more abuse?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that our nation is headed in the wrong direction
in race,'' Connerly said.
</P>
<P>
   Students not impressed
</P>
<P>
   And politically, the time may be right. For the first time since
1974, Republicans control Florida's House, Senate and the
Governor's Mansion. Connerly hasn't spoken to Gov.-elect Jeb Bush
about his crusade. But he has already made an appearance in the
state; he recently spoke at Florida State University's law school
in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   His ideas did not go over well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more of a legacy among a lot of students at FSU that
the white man has had his foot on our neck, what's wrong with a
little affirmative action to get it off?'' said Connerly, who had
an ancestor who was a slave five generations ago. ``I can't tell
you how many of those FSU students talk about slavery and they're
further removed from slavery than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's roots in slavery aren't contested, but he has been
accused by family and friends of embellishing his impoverished
childhood in Louisiana and California. He is not popular among
African American leaders. Jesse Jackson once called him a ``house
slave'' and a ``puppet of the white man.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's father left when he was 2. His mother died when he
was 4. Then he lived with his grandmother and aunts and uncles.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's part Irish. He's got some French blood in him, also
Choctaw Indian. He's definitely not an African American, he said.
</P>
<P>
   'Goldwater conservative'
</P>
<P>
   ``My detractors say that I'm ashamed of being black,'' Connerly
said. ``One of the nuances of this whole debate is that we try to
herd black people into classifications that we haven't selected. I
don't have any shame at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly considers himself a conservative, specifically a
``Goldwater conservative.'' Barry Goldwater, the long-time senator
who died in May, was considered a catalyst for the modern
conservative movement.
</P>
<P>
   Government should not invade a citizen's personal life, Connerly
said. That is why Connerly fought, and won, another controversial
battle: medical benefits for ``domestic partners'' of employees in
California's higher education system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not abridge my rights on a willy-nilly basis,'' Connerly
said. ``That applies to my race, my sexual orientation. If I were
gay _ and I'm not _ it's none of your business. What right does the
government have to limit my pursuit of happiness?''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly remains married to the white woman he married 36 years
ago; they have raised two children.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Sacramento State University in 1962 and went
to work for the California Department of Housing and Community
Development. He eventually became the deputy director of
California's housing department, but left to start his own
consulting firm with his wife Ilene.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he befriended a young state representative named
Pete Wilson. He was one of Wilson's largest campaign contributors,
he said. He said he wrote policy papers for Wilson and raised more
than $2 million for Wilson's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson offered Connerly a position on his Cabinet but Connerly
declined. Wilson then offered him a position as a regent. Connerly
believes part of the reason he got the position was because of the
color of his skin.
</P>
<P>
   He took the job, a 12-year term without pay. Connerly figured it
wouldn't take much of his time. Then the parents of a white student
who had been denied admission to medical school contacted Connerly.
The father, a statistician, had reviewed admission records and
suspected his son was being denied because he was white.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly reviewed the university's admission data and concluded
that race, not grades, played too significant a role.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly then became embroiled in a bitter battle over
affirmative action programs on campus. In July 1995 the regents
narrowly passed Connerly's resolution to end ``preferences'' in
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Proposition 209, which California voters passed in
1996. The constitutional amendment outlawed preferences for women
and minorities in government contracting and hiring and in
university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Connerly is dubbed ``anti-affirmative action,'' he said
he is actually against ``racial preferences.'' Affirmative action,
as Connerly defines it, is well and good.
</P>
<P>
   ``A contractor wants to put out bids and make sure that minority
builders are aware of his project, so he advertises in Black or
Latino newspapers, that's affirmative action and that's good,''
Connerly said.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want more black students at a college and you ``allow
a black student to be admitted with a 980 SAT but if you're white
you must have a 1300, that's not affirmative action, that's a
preference.''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with preferences?
</P>
<P>
   Two things, Connerly says. It demeans those who receive the
preferential treatment, convincing them that they aren't as good as
whites and that they are entitled to special treatment. For whites,
``it drives their prejudices underground,'' making the racial
divide deeper, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly and his nonprofit organizations, the American Civil
Rights Institute and American Civil Rights Coalition, are studying
Florida's political and racial climate. They will decide in several
months whether to push for a ballot initiative and begin collecting
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncharted territory,'' Connerly said. Attacking
affirmative action in a southern state with a strong Cuban
population will raise its own set of problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't bother myself with all that. The message is the
same.''

 &HT;    Sparrow lost fourth of population despite rescue try
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ An endangered sparrow species in the
Everglades lost a quarter of its population from 1997 to last
spring, federal scientists say, despite painful efforts to save it
earlier this year by flooding marshes to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited population figures are much lower than
estimates in May, when the scientists said rescue efforts had led
to the best breeding season in six years for the Cape Sable seaside
sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a calculation error pure and simple, done in a hurry,''
Everglades National Park biologist Sonny Bass said this week.
Without the efforts to save the sparrow, ``we could have lost half
the population.''
</P>
<P>
   The new numbers may feed skeptics' attacks on the park's
research, which justified federal efforts last winter and spring to
keep water off of the bird's crucial nesting grounds just south of
Tamiami Trail.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shut its
floodgates along the Trail, making water back up north of the park.
That contributed to a regionwide glut that devastated the St. Lucie
River, Lake Okeechobee, the Miccosukee Indians' reservation and the
tree islands of the central and northern Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants for the Miccosukees, who are leading the attack,
complain that park scientists haven't made their research fully
available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But Bass said the change in population estimates doesn't alter
years of research showing that repeated flooding in the park's
north end has driven the sparrow toward extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers of the 5- to 6-inch-long bird, found only in the
southern Everglades, have dropped by more than half since 1992,
federal scientists estimate. Just south of the floodgates, the
population has dropped more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers now believe that 3,056 of the sparrows lived in the
park during the birds' nesting season last spring, down from 4,048
in 1997, corps ecologist Jon Moulding said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the scientists had estimated the bird's population at
6,012.
</P>
<P>
   ``These survey numbers don't mean anything to us,'' said Will
Post, a Charleston, S.C., ornithologist working for the Miccosukee
tribe. ``We're still waiting to get the data to make an independent
evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Post has questioned much of what the park scientists say about
the sparrow, from their estimates of its lifespan to how readily it
seeks out new habitat. The controversy is prompting an independent
review by other experts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that review, park researchers said they've answered
65 questions from skeptics. But they won't make the answers public
until the Miccosukees' scientists do the same with their findings,
said the park's chief sparrow expert, University of Tennessee
ecologist Stuart Pimm.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether the floodgates will be closed for the next
nesting season is expected in December.
</P>
<P>
   Pimm has said the short-lived, ground-nesting sparrow loses much
its population each year through natural causes unless it can breed
_ something it can't do if its grassy habitat is under water.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the floodgates shut, those nesting grounds were wet as
late as April. That forced the nesting season to start three weeks
later than it had the year before, Pimm's researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a long-established formula, the researchers listen for
singing males _ the females are silent. They multiply by 16 to get
the total population, Moulding said.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida water managers have blamed the high water mostly
on El Nino, the global weather pattern that dumped unusually heavy
rain on the region last winter. But they said the flooding of the
central Everglades complicated their efforts to relieve a similar
glut in Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   The corps released the lake water into the St. Lucie and
Caloosahatchee rivers, devastating tourism-related businesses
downstream. Scientists suspect the releases also caused a plague of
lesion-covered fish in the St. Lucie estuary.
</P>
<P>
   Some Treasure Coast residents blamed the woes on the sparrow.
Others said water managers and the corps were using the bird as a
scapegoat for their real agenda, keeping the lake full for the
Glades' sugar farms.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen Beach bait shop owner Henry Caimotto said the new
population numbers show that the flood control system doesn't work
for anybody _ birds or people.
</P>
<P>
   Former Martin County Commissioner Maggy Hurchalla said the
efforts to save the sparrow didn't cause the St. Lucies' problems.
She said the whole drainage system needs an overhaul _ something
that water managers and the corps propose spending $7.8 billion to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Okeechobee would have dumped down the St. Lucie if the
Cape Sable sparrows had all died,'' Hurchalla said. ``There's not
one easy scapegoat to blame it on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   These past weeks I've been trying to step into Agosto Pinochet's
shoes, trying to figure out what must be going on inside him.
</P>
<P>
   The former Chilean dictator, of course, has now been denied
immunity from prosecution, and faces possible extradition from
London to Spain for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet had arrived in London in September, taking residence in
a five-star hotel in the posh district of Mayfair, not far from the
gardens of Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   London had always been the city of his dreams,``the ideal city
to live in'' _ as he had said publicly more than once. But the need
for back surgery necessitated a change in his routine during this
last trip.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, since 1990 when he stepped down from the presidency of
Chile, Pinochet has traveled to London at least once a year. His
visits were discreet and private. Each time Margaret Thatcher _ a
woman he devoutly admires _ invited him to tea. He usually went
shopping in the morning_ his favorite store is Burberry's _ and
then had lunch with friends in Fortnum &AMP; Mason.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most unchanging rituals was a visit to the Army
National Museum, and another to Madame Tussaud's wax museum, where,
deep in thought, he would spend hours in front of Napoleon
Bonaparte's figure.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is deeply moved by everything related to Napoleon.
During this last visit he bought half a dozen books about the
emperor and was planning to go to Paris again to visit the tomb in
Invalides.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon put an end to those happy
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the notion of empires was always in Pinochet's mind. As
have other dictators of his kind, Pinochet thinks of himself as an
envoy of Providence, someone who is Goodness incarnate and has been
destined to exterminate Evil, whatever that means. It's the same
feeling of omnipotence felt by the ayatollahs, Pol Pot and hundreds
of fanatical fundamentalists at large in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet's case is more pathetic because once out of Chile,
and away from the glow of his wealthy Latin American supporters, he
suddenly looks like a tainted mortal.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for London, Pinochet agreed to talk in Santiago
with a correspondent for The New Yorker magazine, Jon Lee Anderson,
author of a much-praised biography of Che Guevara. The interview
was arranged through the efforts of Pinochet's daughter Lucia. She
thought that if an honest and well-meaning journalist talked with
her father, it might put to rest the malicious talk about his old
regime.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of what Pinochet told Anderson allows us to really
understand him for the first time. Pinochet, for instance, is still
seeing Marxists everywhere, as did the brutal commandants of the
Argentinean military juntas.
</P>
<P>
   For Pinochet, the world is divided into two irreconcilable
halves, the Marxists and the Christians, a notion that presupposes
that a war between them is unavoidable. For Pinochet, this is a
matter of life and death, and anything goes. You don't defeat the
enemy: You destroy him. The only possible way to deal with the
enemy is extermination: concentration camps, slavery, torture.
</P>
<P>
   I expect that the nastiest thing Pinochet must be feeling right
now is his total incomprehension of why he was arrested. To his way
of thinking, he didn't do anything wrong: the blood, the exiles,
the brute force, all those were ``necessary actions.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how he reconciles this with the fact that the great
newspapers of the Christian nations say it's unthinkable that his
crimes should go unpunished merely because he was chief of an
illegitimate government, or because he enjoys a diplomatic immunity
conquered at bayonet's point. No doubt he thinks the world is in
the hands of the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the time Pinochet seized power in 1973, he hadn't done
anything, either brilliant or terrible. He was a mediocre man, very
conservative, never noticed by anybody anywhere. But like Francisco
Franco, his most admired leader, after Napoleon and Thatcher, he
gained absolute power. Now, to his surprise, Pinochet has found out
that another power, a lot less absolute _ that of justice _ wants
to seize him. He must think this is an inexplicably sarcastic act
of God.
</P>
<P>
   At 83 years old, Pinochet has stopped wearing dark glasses, like
he did in his violent years. But it's as though he has kept on
using them. In his later years in Chile he would rarely look people
in the eye. His blue pupils would appear to be fixed on the beyond,
which for him maybe is empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never was a dictator, only an aspirant to dictator,'' he
told Anderson. ``As every man interested in history knows, I've
learned that dictators never end well.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Pinochet think then of this twist of life, this fate
that keeps him locked in a hospital room, waiting for the sort of
democratic institutions he never trusted _ chambers of
representatives, stewards of the law _ to decide his fate? If he
returns to Chile _ and he will, no doubt about it, dead or alive _
he won't be able to leave his country again.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet failed to learn that exile is no longer what it was in
the 1970s, during the heyday of Latin American dictatorships. Today
the exile of dictators is of a singular kind: They are condemned
not to leave the country they so tormented. The moment they go out
into the world, the world traps them. It's a laughable destiny, but
not unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Pinochet will have his last glimpse of London, but his
victims will keep on seeing him, endlessly.

IMPERIAL FRANCE LEAVES ITS MARK ON AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Second Empire style of architecture became
chic in Paris in the latter half of the 19th century and quickly
spread to post-Civil War America.
</P>
<P>
   This imposing style of architecture is named after the reign of
Napoleon III (1852-1870), when the emperor chose to re-create Paris
as the world capital of art and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many distinguishable features of Second Empire is the
mansard roof. It is commonly dotted with dormer windows, featuring
ornamental detailing on top of each.
</P>
<P>
   A mansard roof is four-sided and double-pitched with a steep
slope straight, convex or concave and usually covered with
multicolored shaped slate tiles or tin plates arranged in a
decorative pattern, making the roof a strong architectural element.
</P>
<P>
   The mansard roof takes its name from its creator, 17th-century
French Renaissance architect Francois Mansart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napoleon had the Louvre palace in Paris enlarged, among other
architectural changes to the city in the mid-19th century,'' said
Doug Bucher, preservation architect with the Albany firm of John G.
Waite &AMP; Associates. ``This building became the model for other
Second Empire designs. American architect Richard Morris Hunt was
studying at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris at the time and
helped with the Louvre project. He was among the first to bring the
style back to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Two international grand expositions, held between 1855 and 1867,
featured fantastic architecture, art and furnishings. Those
expositions helped make the Second Empire look fashionable in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bucher said the style was popular in America because it was at a
time when the nation was prospering and could build larger than in
the past. Because this boom period was under the administration of
Ulysses S. Grant, the style was also occasionally referred to as
the Grant Style.
</P>
<P>
   Bucher said the mansard roof design also allowed an additional
story, rather than just attic space.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cities, where there were restrictions on the height of
a building of not more than two to four stories. The mansard roof
allowed a full extra story, without breaking any rules,'' Bucher
said. ``The addition of dormer windows provided extra light to this
additional floor, which was a much better space than an attic for
servants, in better country houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Empire architecture was viewed as the ``high style'' of
the Victorian era.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1870s, America was pretty well developed in the Second
Empire style, especially in rich cities such as San Francisco,
though many of those examples were destroyed in the Great
Earthquake of 1906.
</P>
<P>
   It was the State, War and Navy Building (now the Old Executive
Office Building) next to the White House in Washington, D.C., that
served as the prototype for other public buildings across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Architects and architectural pattern books of their day also
would help to spread the style to other cities, where the mansard
roof was a popular topping for town houses as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Empire style lent itself to formal and informal
interpretations, where homes and public buildings were made from
materials ranging from wood and brick to stone, granite and marble.
Interior floor plans were symmetrical and asymmetrical.
</P>
<P>
   Formal buildings tended to be symmetrical, while the country
house tended to be asymmetrical. But floor plans also varied in
country homes, because mansard roofs were commonly added to the
flat-roofed Italianate villa and other pre-Victorian houses, thus
updating them in the architectural style of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Country houses also were more picturesque, featuring towers,
protruding bays and porches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I think of Second Empire, I think of the movie
`Psycho,' Bucher said. ``It's the tower. I always think of haunted
houses when I think of Second Empire. I think of seeing them as
spooky and haunted. What horror lurks up in that tower?''
</P>
<P>
   Everything in the Second Empire style had a heaviness about it
and rich details.
</P>
<P>
   Entry doors were heavily paneled, whether single or double
doors, and many featured etched or frosted glass panels. The same
type of decorated glass was used for skylights. Doors also had
great ornamental knobs and hinges cast in bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the style was at its best, the materials were also the
best,'' Bucher said. ``If a building had a bay window on it, it
would also have a mansard roof on it. Very elaborate cornices were
created to support the roof from brackets to panels.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the lavish detailing, there could also be
structural problems, said Frank Pitts, an architect in Troy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked on some perfectly awful Second Empire-styled
buildings,'' Pitts said. ``They leak like a sieve. Every geegaw has
been plastered on, making them difficult to maintain ... There are
way too many edges from a waterproofing standpoint. Water gets
trapped at the cornice line. It's not an honest and forthright
style.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, interiors were rich in detail, color and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, Bucher said, a house would have a range of styles,
from Rococo and Renaissance Revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The living room might be decorated in the Rococo style with
lots of gilding and light colors, while the dining might be in the
Renaissance Revival style in mahogany or walnut woodwork, Bucher
said. ``Wall-to-wall Aubusson carpeting from France would also have
been used in many of the formal rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The formal rooms also were defined by elaborately and heavily
mantelpieces in wood, marble and tile. Over mantels would have
mirrors built into them and ceilings were of very ornate
plasterwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also see the notion of frescoed ceilings with paintings
that were either hand-painted or stenciled or a combination of both
with lots of gold leaf and color,'' Bucher said. ``The ceiling
decoration was either painted on plaster or applied to canvas and
then glued to the ceiling, which were usually 12 feet to 14 feet
high in grand houses and 12 feet in a typical town house and lower
as you go up to the floors above.''
</P>
<P>
   There were colorful French wallpapers and frescoes on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was most fashionable to say that you had French
wallpaper,'' Bucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms were illuminated by gas wall fixtures that were also
elegant in design and chandeliers aglow with glass prisms and
hundreds of gas burners in them.
</P>
<P>
   Steam radiators come into play in the 1860 and '70s. Second
Empire had very fancy cast-iron radiators that were so
sculpture-like that they became part of a room's decor.
</P>
<P>
   Bathrooms were designed with lots of built-in cabinetry, making
the room as elaborate as a bedroom or dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon III was overthrown in 1870. Paris fell out of favor as
a fashion capital, and the Empire style was quickly succeeded by
Romanesque and Queen Anne styles.

EXHIBIT FOCUSES ON THE HISTORY, CULTURE OF THE BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The war between the United States and Mexico ended
more than 150 years ago, yet politicians, historians and
hard-working Mexicans and Americans are still figuring out the
ramifications of the accord that ended the territorial conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico ceded
California and New Mexico to the United States and, recognizing the
loss of Texas, agreed to use the Rio Grande as a boundary.
</P>
<P>
   And the treaty turned a dry, hostile, abandoned country into
what is now known as the Texas-Mexico borderlands. It transformed
the Rio Bravo (as the Rio Grande is known in Mexico) from a
regional lifeline into a watery dividing line between two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The region is now the focus of a museum exhibit _ ``Rio Bravo,
Encounters and Disencounters'' _ created by Jorge Bibriesca to give
meaning to the history and culture along the southern portion of
the international border. The exhibit opened Wednesday at the
Reynosa Historical Museum and will open on Jan. 14 at the Piedras
Negras Casa de Cultura. It recently closed in Nuevo Laredo and the
Mexico City suburb of Coyoacan.
</P>
<P>
   Bibriesca, who is the curator of the Pape Museum and Library in
Monclova, said that while the southern bank of the Rio Grande is
home to millions of Mexicans, it is little known or understood by
those who live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began collecting material along the border, I found out
just how intellectually abandoned the border has been,'' Bibriesca
said by telephone from Monclova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that people along the border knew nothing about the
history of the place where they lived,'' he said. ``When I asked
people in Matamoros what they knew of the mighty river on whose
banks their homes are built, they couldn't tell me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the exhibit grew out of a congress of Mexican
historians who met here last year to plan for the 150th anniversary
of the treaty signed on Feb. 2, 1848.
</P>
<P>
   ``They contracted me to put together an exhibit that would
celebrate Mexico's northern border,'' Bibriesca said.
</P>
<P>
   He set out looking for material, combing museums, city archives
and dusty warehouses on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazed me that I often found more material about Mexican
life on the Texas side of the border than our own,'' he said. ``The
recently established `Los Caminos del Rio' historical program
between Texas and Tamaulipas was a wealth of information, and I got
a lot of good stuff from museums in San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   So much good stuff, in fact, that the exhibit is actually two
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibit will take on a different focus in each of the
cities in which it appears,'' Bibriesca said. ``It is a living,
changing portrait of border life.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, while the Nuevo Laredo exhibit took as its theme
U.S.-Mexico customs traffic, in the Mexican interior Bibriesca
found a lot of curiosity about the ``cholos'' from Ciudad Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Cholos are the modern descendants of pachucos, Mexican-Americans
written about by the Mexican writer Octavio Paz, Bibriesca said.
</P>
<P>
   While originally a U.S. cultural phenomenon, cholo style has
migrated south, returning to its Mexican cultural roots.
</P>
<P>
   Fedora hats, big shirts and baggy pants have found a home in
Mexican cities from Ciudad Juarez to the Mexico City suburb of
Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl.
</P>
<P>
   The pachucos (and their latter-day counterparts) that Paz wrote
about in the late 1940s were angry, culturally lost between a
motherland only vaguely remembered and a homeland that relegated
them to the bottom of the barrel, rejecting their ancestral
language, their dark skins and their mythology while exploiting
their labor.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, that anger often finds expression in gangs
and street violence, inwardly directed within their own community.
But in Mexico, the cholo edge softens, becoming more a symbol of
rebellion against increasing materialism and individualism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it is very important to include the cholos,
because it brings something that is otherwise very `historical' up
to date,'' said Fabiola Alejandra Solas, 21, a student at the
Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Mexico think of cholos with positive imagery, said
Liliana Cabrera Aguilar, 21, a fellow student.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cholo types here in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl that are
very committed to building the community,'' Cabrera said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyoacan exhibit was a three-room montage of artifacts,
photographs, life-sized reinforced cardboard cutout characters and
short historical monographs. Food and music occupied the center of
the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northern music expresses the character of the northern spirit:
strong, brusque and explosive,'' a description reads.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 19th century, accordions, tarolas, bejo sextos and
12-stringed guitars have banged out and crooned European-flavored
polkas and trademark ranchera music along the river. With the
arrival of the 20th century, haunting corridos brought narrative
life to border legends.
</P>
<P>
   Border food started out traditionally Mexican, but the border
region was the first in Mexico to embrace hamburgers and hot dogs
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken crossed the
Rio Grande, bringing fast food to northern Mexico to stay.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Mexico City earthquake of 1985 drove many displaced
residents northward, and the flavors of southern Mexico reasserted
themselves along the border.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is like the border itself, constantly changing,
awash in influences from north and south.
</P>
<P>
   With a wry laugh, many have called the union of the two
countries along the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande a shotgun marriage with no
possibility of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Bustamante, director of the Tijuana-based Colegio de la
Frontera Norte, observes that in most respects people have more in
common with residents of Buenos Aires, Argentina, than San Diego,
only 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he noted, there are nearly a million
border crossings between the United States and Mexico daily, and
the North American Free Trade Agreement rapidly is knitting the
countries' economies ever closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the exhibit teaches me is about a culture that is neither
here nor there,'' Cabrera said. ``It is two places at once.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (``Rio Bravo, Encounters and Disencounters,'' or ``Rio Bravo,
Encuentros y Desencuentros,'' is now open at the Reynosa Historical
Museum in Reynosa, Mexico, across the border from McAllen, Texas;

BOOK OFFERS INSIGHT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH EMPLOYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ People still come up to Leigh Steinberg and say,
``Show me the money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sports lawyer who helped inspire the film ``Jerry
Maguire'' said that workers often focus too much on money instead
of stopping to think about those things they truly value _ and how
to get them from their employer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Winning With Integrity,'' the new book he co-wrote with
Michael D'Orso, Steinberg tells about a 1993 conversation between
football safety Tim McDonald and ``Jerry Maguire'' Director Cameron
Crowe. ``I have a wife,'' McDonald said. ``I have a family. At this
point in my career, I've put in my time and I feel like, `Where's
the money? Where's the money?'''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe turned that phrase into ``show me the money,'' and Cuba
Gooding Jr. turned it into an Oscar. But Steinberg said in a recent
interview that money wasn't what guided McDonald to the San
Francisco 49ers; six teams were interested in him, but McDonald
wanted to join a team in his home state of California. Besides, he
had never played for a winning team before.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of scrambling among six teams to work something out,
Steinberg and McDonald were able to focus on getting the best deal
they could from the 49ers. McDonald has been with the team ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   People negotiate all the time, Steinberg said _ whether they're
buying a house or setting a curfew for their children or asking for
something from their current or prospective boss.
</P>
<P>
   But most don't do it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of negotiating is intimidating to many
people,'' Steinberg said, adding that people tend to be either too
meek or too aggressive _ and in both cases wind up unhappy with the
results. ``We're trying to flee from about 300,000 years of
insufficient human evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step to negotiate effectively is to figure out what
exactly you value most about a job, Steinberg said. If you're
considering two jobs and all you're thinking about is money, he
warned, you're liable to be torn if both companies offer similar
financial packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human psyche eventually clamps down and says, `Make a
decision _ any decision _ and you will feel much better.' But it
might be the wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter to you whether Company A has a better product
than Company B? If you save half an hour a day on your commute, is
that worth $3,000 a year to you? Is it important to be part of a
team or to have autonomy? Does your prospective boss at Company B
have a better reputation than the one at Company A? Would you be
willing to move to Cleveland for an extra $10,000 a year?
</P>
<P>
   Even if all you want is something more from your current
employer, Steinberg said, you should think about whether a pay
raise is your main goal. Would you rather be able to telecommute?
Is flexible scheduling important? Which is more important to you:
extra time off or extra pay? Could your employer pay tuition for
courses that help you build skills?
</P>
<P>
   When Steinberg became a sports lawyer in the 1970s, one thing
that helped him build his business was determining what kinds of
athletes he wanted to represent. Once he decided that he would
target athletes with strong family values and a desire to serve the
community, he could make sure they knew that he shared their
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew that economics had never been my big motivation,''
Steinberg said, adding that he often talked with the players'
families as well. ``In many cases, these were parents who raised
their kids with certain values _ and didn't particularly want their
kids to become self-indulgent playboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating a profile of potential clients also helped Steinberg
become more focused; instead of trying to pursue hundreds of
college draftees, he could quickly narrow the field to those he
would have the best chance of success with. He said people in many
jobs can be better off if they become talented specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a niche world,'' Steinberg said. ``Very narrow
areas of expertise can be very productive. Develop your own
profile. Develop your own niche.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another big negotiating mistake, Steinberg said, is being so
focused on what you want that you don't consider it from the
company's side. You need to understand how the company earns its
money and how your job fits in.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much value do you really have?'' he said. ``This requires
brutal self-assessment that many are loathe to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't overlook your own weaknesses. ``A mistake many people make
is to assume _ or hope _ that a troubling issue or question simply
won't come up,'' Steinberg writes in the book. ``This is a deadly
mistake. Remember that while you are assessing your strengths and
weaknesses, the other party is making the same assessment, and his
focus will be on your weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there things you have done or can do to make yourself more
valuable to your employer? Do you have ideas for improving or
marketing a product or have other suggestions about increasing
productivity? Do you have skills that colleagues don't have? Do you
know the salaries of people in comparable jobs?
</P>
<P>
   ``The office manager who is totally tuned in to her boss and
makes his life infinitely easier in a multitude of different
situations, who has over a long period of time developed a deep
knowledge of his needs, is someone who has leverage, whether he
knows it or not,'' Steinberg writes. ``He will certainly learn how
much he needs her if he is faced with the possibility of losing
her.''
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready for a one-on-one negotiation, Steinberg
suggests that you spell out what you want rather than waiting for
the employer to do it. ``I want to present my rationale first _ my
concept of the world,'' he said in the interview. That starts the
negotiation at the place where you want it rather than where the
employer wants it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if there is a second company involved,
Steinberg suggests you let the potential employer make the first
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing creates a more dramatic result than competitive
bargaining.''
</P>
<P>
   If you get an offer from another company, that will certainly
strengthen your position with your current employer _ if you can be
tempted to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employer will say, `Look, I'm not going to get into a
bidding war.' But they will _ if they feel the employee is worth
it.''

`911' BRINGS STUDENTS TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This could be any student lounge or college dorm
room: Adam Olsen, sprawled on the bed, is studying for tomorrow's
test while other students are watching ``Boyz 'N the Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a flash, a loud alarm signals that ordinary college
life is about to dramatically shift for these students, members of
the student-run Five Quad Volunteer Ambulance Service at the State
University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Four students bolt, and in a matter of seconds, Olsen, 20, is
behind the wheel of an ambulance, siren wailing, as it rumbles down
the skull-jolting cobblestone road at the university.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before, a young woman fell down several steps of the
Campus Center, and now, her left leg, arm and lower back are seized
with pain.
</P>
<P>
   After the ambulance arrives, A.J. Klimek, the crew chief, asks
the woman a series of questions _ ``What happened?'' ``Did you get
knocked out?'' ``Do you remember all the events?''
</P>
<P>
   These are standard inquiries meant to check her physical
condition and her lucidity.
</P>
<P>
   The injured theater student is put on a stretcher and then
rolled to the ambulance. Inside, Klimek asks her questions about
her medical history, and Robin Stein takes her pulse and blood
pressure. When the crew arrives at the University Health Center,
doctors take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being out there, helping people, I love being in the
middle of the action. It's in the blood,'' said Klimek, 23, a
senior. ``I get an adrenalin rush, but it's not what it used to be;
I've been doing this game for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Klimek has been with Five Quad for two years, but has been an
emergency medical technician for five, riding with the volunteer
ambulance and fire department in his hometown of Schuyler, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   There, he has seen people in cardiac arrest, and people his own
age killed in a car crash. His father, Anthony, is the fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been running calls since I was 3 years old,'' he said.
``I was born into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Klimek is one of the 99 members of Five Quad, about 40 percent
of whom are women. They are motivated, in part, by a drive to help,
the thrill of the work and their future _ Five Quad alumni include
doctors and health administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Students at 201 colleges and universities nationwide offer some
degree of medical help or are in the process of forming squads,
according to the National Collegiate EMS Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people, if something is going on by the roadside, pull
over to help, and there's the other half of society that just
doesn't. These guys are in the first half,'' said Dr. Marc Stern,
Five Quad's medical adviser and the first student to sign up as a
volunteer in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In his first days as a junior at the university in 1972, Five
Quad co-founder Barry Bashkoff watched an injured football player
languish on the sidelines for 20 minutes, before a police car
finally showed up. A patrolman then decided to call an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought that was too long,'' said Bashkoff, who was a
volunteer firefighter on Long Island before transferring to
SUNY-Albany. Bashkoff, 48, has made a career in the health field,
and now sells ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   Bashkoff, Stern and a few other students spent a year and a half
trying to convince a skittish university administration that they
were committed to starting an ambulance service. At one point,
students wheeled five vans and ambulances, in various states of
disrepair, to university entrances to draw attention to their
cause. Five Quad officially began in October 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the service has a $72,000 budget funded by student
activity fees and, as one of the most popular student
organizations, turns away an overflow of volunteers. Five Quad
responds within an average of one to two minutes at main campus,
five to six minutes if the call comes from buildings in downtown
Albany. Members also respond to calls within a five-mile radius of
the campus and provide backup for an area rescue squad.
</P>
<P>
   Five Quad trains students to become emergency medical
technicians and requires experienced EMTs _ students, for instance,
already serving in their hometown ambulance squads _ to earn their
stripes as dispatcher trainees, before progressing to EMT
attendants, drivers and crew chiefs.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These students seem to defy the college stereotype. Their
sentences tend to be clipped and matter-of-fact, in the manner of
the police or doctors who want to transmit information with
certainty. They staff a bare-bones headquarters at the University
Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   The bunk room, in the back, holds six single beds, with a closet
stocked with blankets. Over the door, connecting the two rooms, is
a poster of the smiley face, announcing, ``Don't Worry, Be Happy.''
A bullet hole is blown through the face's forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Scanner chatter, always in the background, is a constant
reminder that the red phone, which the university police use to
summon Five-Quad, also is never far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``911'' for Five Quad can include intoxications, psychological
emergencies _ suicidal tendencies spike at the end of the semester
and holidays _ as well as flu calls and requests for transportation
to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back sometimes and say, `Wow, you know how much I've
seen, and I'm only 20 years old,''' said Olsen, a junior who is
studying biology.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen has learned, also, how to shut the door, once a shift is
done. ``We are students and love to have a good time, too. We know
how to balance both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're serious and we're fun,'' said Brett Morey, the president
of Five Quad. ``As long as you have the balance, you'll be OK.''

<P>
   The arrest and detention of Augusto Pinochet is serving a
purpose, far beyond warming the hearts of the thousands of friends,
relatives and colleagues of his victims _ men and women who have
waited nearly a quarter of a century for justice and solace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its ethical and legal implications, the dictator's
detention reveals many of the contradictions and deeper truths
about how societies move from authoritarian to democratic rule, and
how they settle scores with a past that never should have existed.
</P>
<P>
   Both in general and in specific reference to Chile, Pinochet's
predicament raises far more questions than answers _ questions that
years ago should have been asked in Chile and Latin America, and in
countries as dissimilar as Mexico and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called transitions to democracy in Latin America during
the 1980s, in eastern Europe in the late '80s and early '90s, as
well as in Asia and Africa, all rested on a few basic premises that
at the time seemed self-evident. Dictatorships do not just fade
away; military rulers do not simply walk into the sun when they get
bored or tired.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving their departure and the overall dismantling of their
regimes, as of one-party systems, implied providing them with a way
out: a safe departure, to a safe haven, for a safe future.
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, the political golden handshake of amnesty or
tacitly letting bygones be bygones was accompanied by a desire to
know, if not to punish. Truth Commissions, Never Again Commissions,
White Books and the like were created and supported.
</P>
<P>
   But the understanding always was that the personal safety and
financial integrity of the dictators remain protected and that
details of their policies _ economic in some cases, geopolitical in
others _ be preserved by their democratic successors.
</P>
<P>
   This was the deal in Chile, in Argentina, in Uruguay, in a
certain sense initially in Nicaragua, in South Korea, South Africa
and even in some places in eastern Europe. It was formal and
institutionalized in some cases, de facto in others, but it made
democracy possible. It seemed a small price to pay, a pill not too
bitter to swallow, a necessary and sufficient condition for moving
on.
</P>
<P>
   But too many questions simply went unanswered. Who made the
deals? With whom did the political leaders consult? How freely did
the leaders and the led consent to the agreements and how well
informed were the countries' citizens? Would the arrangements
withstand international and historical scrutiny, particularly of a
passionate and critical nature? Would the amnesties resist the test
of time, further investigations and new revelations?
</P>
<P>
   By now, South Africa's Truth and Amnesty Commission has released
its findings _ albeit, amid the tensions and discomfort of all the
political parties and even of two old friends and heroes who are
true role models for transitions everywhere: Nelson Mandela and
Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for disenchantment with the South African
commission's report, one clearly stands out. The idea that inspired
its creation was that the spirit of national reconciliation guiding
the shift from apartheid to majority rule in South Africa should
also prevail in dealing with the country's past. But this is no
longer as relevant or widespread as when the commission was set up.
</P>
<P>
   What then seemed fair, prudent and tolerant, today appears
callous and cynical. What today is deemed unacceptable and
insensitive then felt cautious and moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly for Mexico. The country is painfully, desperately,
slowly proceeding with its move toward democratic rule, and while
settling scores with the past is certainly not the most pressing
task, it is one of the most delicate ones. From the student
massacre in Tlatelocolo in 1968 to the localized ``dirty war'' of
the 1970s to the electoral fraud of the 1980s and the corruption of
the 1990s, the legendary ruling party has a great deal to answer
for.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile and elsewhere, many believe, sincerely, that the best
solution is to bury the past, the dead and the bank accounts _ and
move forward. Others think that some degree of accountability and
punishment is indispensable to ensure that impunity cease being a
leitmotif of political life.
</P>
<P>
   But no one really knows the cost of each option: whether
forgiving and forgetting is possible, or if burrowing into the past
is unavoidable. The Chilean precedent confounds everyone willing to
think the matter through.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chile has left its friends and its people perplexed,
perhaps undeservedly. For the past decade, the conventional wisdom
about the country was simple. Moderation and sensibility had
prevailed, national reconciliation had been achieved, successful
economic policies had been pursued. The past decades of
revolutionary turmoil and bloody repression had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know that while Chile is a more prosperous nation than
before, it is as unequal in wealth and income distribution as ever,
and the polarization of its society is as acute as 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the country's left, and center, and sympathizers and allies,
as well as for much of international public opinion, Pinochet is
the personification of evil: The man with the dark glasses is as
bad as they come. Yet for a large minority of the population, he is
still the saviour of a nation threatened by heathen communism and
inflationary socialism.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably preferable for Chileans to have uncovered this
split of opinion, and for the rest of the world to begin to grasp
that dealing with the past is a very complicated matter, and that
easy solutions, as brisk and painless as they may seem, generally
do not work.
</P>
<P>
   We can thank the dictator for this, but for nothing else.

MINIATURE RAILROAD HOBBY GROWS INTO LIFE-SIZE CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: New Hampshire, Wisconsin)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ The miniature worlds created by Lou Sassi seem
nearly as much work as the life-size scenes they mimic.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Sassi's re-creation of Boston &AMP; Maine
Railroad's Claremont branch, 47 miles of backwoods line that pass
through the New Hampshire town of Contoocook.
</P>
<P>
   To re-create telephone lines from the mid-1950s, Sassi consulted
with a longtime New England Telephone linesman, who helped Sassi
lay out the poles and accurately run the ``cables,'' actually
string, stiffened by a coating of white glue.
</P>
<P>
   Sassi has learned that if he photographs a real building, using
a 35-mm camera from 50 feet away, the resulting picture will yield,
to scale, images of store signs that he can incorporate into his
modeled world.
</P>
<P>
   And he has learned to improvise: Sassi is just as likely to use
sandpaper to fashion gravel roofs as he is to rely on the expansive
stock of supplies available to modern model railroad enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sassi has just written a book that explains the tricks, methods
and supplies needed to begin modeling HO scale (1:87 of life-size)
railroads.
</P>
<P>
   If you truly embrace this hobby, be prepared to undertake
projects that are never quite finished. The Contoocook layout that
he built for his new instructional book, ``A Realistic HO Layout
for Beginners'' (Kalmbach Books, $16.95), took three years; Sassi
has been working on his '50s-era B &AMP; M West Hoosic Division since
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Although imitation is implicit in modeling, Sassi believes the
pastime ultimately draws out the personality of hobbyists as they
start to rely on their own creative reserve to build these
railroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Model railroading delves into the artistic qualities of the
individual, who is trying to re-create the full-size objects and
make them look believable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Building model railroads has, in fact, pretty much absorbed
Sassi's life, which he traces according his increasing involvement
in a hobby that has become a job. Sassi, 53, is the staff
photographer for the Rensselaer Model Railroad Society, whose
accurate modeling has built its reputation as an educational
resource. He also is one of the principle photographers of layouts
for Model Railroader, a Wisconsin magazine with a circulation of
more than 200,000 readers.
</P>
<P>
   His interest began as a boy, when his dad gave him a Lionel
train set. In 1959, Sassi, then a teen-ager in Saratoga Springs,
N.Y., saw his first issue of Model Railroader and switched to the
smaller HO layout. The magazine's pictorial spreads of these tiny
railroads impressed Sassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started building an HO empire on a 4-by-8 sheet of
plywood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hobby took a back seat in the mid-1960s as Sassi pursued an
education and career as a draftsman and surveyor. Newly married,
Sassi also couldn't consider a layout when living in an apartment
in Schenectady, where he worked for General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sassi began pursuing the interest in earnest once he settled in
his home in Charlton; the hobby also nursed him through the
difficulty of being laid off from an engineering firm in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was therapy from the trauma of (the) layoff.''
</P>
<P>
   He used the career lull as a chance to gradually build a
free-lance career, using an inexpensive camera to start
photographing layouts nationwide for Model Railroader, for which he
also wrote articles. Today, his photography of intricate model
landscapes amounts to full-time work.
</P>
<P>
   Sassi's home layout of the Boston &AMP; Maine West Hoosic Division
was the cover story in the July 1988 issue of Model Railroader
magazine. It is also featured on the cover, with a 10-page layout
inside, of the 1999 Great Model Railroads, an annual magazine that
showcases premier layouts around the country. Sassi's layout was
also displayed in the 1996 issue.

   RENSSELAERVILLE, N.Y. _ Driving up a hill at dusk, bare tree
branches spread out against a dimming sky. The Catskill Mountains
crop up, sudden, blue and stately, then recede around the next
curve. Smoke seeps from chimneys in hollows, caressing the cold
air. A sliver of moon hangs cockeyed above a ridge of evergreens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, too fortunate farmers, if they knew their own good
fortune!'' Virgil wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet life in the country isn't just a pastoral dream. Farmers are
a dying breed. Jobs are scarce. And rural residents struggle with
hardscrabble realities like rising taxes, scant zoning and the
threat of pollution that can accompany development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a modern cow barn. I can't even give it away,'' Earl
Potter said at a recent town meeting designed to consider
solutions. High taxes are part of his problem. He pointed a gnarled
finger at a summer resident seated two chairs away. ``The people
that moved here, you brought your money with you, right?''
</P>
<P>
   The man nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people here that don't have that kind of money,''
the old farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion took place during a weeklong Countryside Exchange
_ a program that drew eight planners from Scotland, England, Canada
and the United States to Rensselaerville, a town near Albany, late
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The team of international troubleshooters swoops down on rural
communities and leaves behind visions for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of rural issues are the same throughout the world,
really,'' said Rob Guest, a forester from York, England.
``Particularly the issues of urban drift and the younger people
leaving and the economy shifting away from the primary land uses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the exchange has visited spots such as Port
Gibson, Miss., and communities along the Chesapeake Bay. It is
largely a volunteer effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll use Rensselaerville in my lectures to students from China
and the Caribbean,'' added Alison Caffyn, who teaches rural tourism
development at the University of Birmingham in England.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Campbell, who has helped people buy and manage land in
countries such as Nepal and the Philippines, said she would take
the lessons she learned in New York back to the highlands of
northern Scotland, where she helps create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how to attract development without ruining
country settings. The answer is not so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of dissension,'' said Gayle Lenane, a
mother of three who lives here. ``In the last few years, we've
started to grow, with summer people and cottage industries, and we
still want to keep the integrity of our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Rensselaerville, population 2,000, is a magnet for second-home
owners; columnist and television commentator Andy Rooney is one of
several well-off folks who have summer places here. Weekend or
seasonal dwellers are a third of the town's population. When they
leave, businesses find it tough to survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
   On a late October Saturday, team members of the Countryside
Exchange talked with residents over platters of ham heaped with
homemade mashed potatoes at the Tri-Village Firehouse in Preston
Hollow.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders led small group discussions, the conversation
spilled over to the kitchen, where firefighters offered their own 2
cents while washing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure, declared Travis Myhre, 19: Living in a
62-square-mile area with one gas pump and two corner stores ``is a
buzz kill ... You gotta keep up with the times.'' But peace and
quiet is good, countered Fire Chief Brian Wood, 25, who just bought
a house with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to deal with people, with traffic. If I had to
sit in traffic, I'd probably kill someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian's brother suggested a Wal-Mart with a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nonsense,'' countered Travis. ``We got a Wally-World in
Cobleskill. I want a huge bar, with dancing!''
</P>
<P>
   A nightclub, yes, said Brian. ``A place to go. Because there's
nothing to do out here. No bowling alley. No nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet mention tourism as a way to help the economy and there is
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism ``can be a dirty word around here,'' said Sharon
Costello, owner of the Mill Cottage Gallery and a driving force
behind the arrival of the Countryside Exchange. ``We'd like to
revitalize the community with a sensitive tourism that is
nature-based and history-based, as opposed to the Disneyworld kind
of tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Nature and history are two things Rensselaerville has a lot of.
Founded in 1787, the town grew to one of New York's most prosperous
communities by the early 1800s, thanks to lumber, grist and woolen
mills. It is home to the 100-acre Rensselaerville Institute think
tank and the 2,000-acre Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve with waterfall
and nature trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely magical. It's just a perfect gem in its
setting,'' said Judith Cligman, a historic preservationist from
Essex County, England. ``You have a mix of natural, scenic and
historic features that's rarely found in rural America.''
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: the variety of small businesses, including
antiques shops, restaurants, maple syrup works, an herbalist, art
gallery and a bed and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the international team made 54 recommendations to help
this rural area. The goal was to build community, protect nature
and historic structures, boost the economy and balance the needs of
full-time and seasonal residents.
</P>
<P>
   Among their suggestions: Update zoning. Change local law so that
board members represent all five area hamlets and include a youth
representative. Create a job mart for youth. Design a logo and
calendar of events. Come up with a way to involve weekend residents
in community projects.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions included starting a buy-local plan. Encourage
small-scale production of niche forest products and cottage
industries. Bring farmers in from outlying areas to teach new
opportunities. Expand the Farmers Market. Seek grants or tax
incentives for barn renovation, open land management and historic
preservation. And market the area in a coordinated fashion.

<P>
   Residents said the exchange had already produced benefits. ``We
know people from (other hamlets) that we would never have met
before,'' Gayle Lenane said.
</P>
<P>
   For young people, Bob and Edith Lansing donated space for a
community center at the Rensselaerville Inn, which they are
renovating.
</P>
<P>
   And the team itself, which wore red ``Rensselaerville'' baseball
caps at the final meeting, promised to continue its relationship
with the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave here 25 pounds heavier,'' said John Kuester, who
previously pioneered a partnership among 10 rural communities in
southeastern Minnesota. ``I also leave with a deep sense of awe for
this place, for the people and for your commitment to each other.''

<P>
   Oilers (6-5) at Seahawks (5-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Quarterback Jon Kitna was the most valuable player of
NFL Europe's World Bowl in 1997. Those Barcelona Dragons _ you
can't stop them, you can only hope to contain them. Now, he gets
only his second start in the big league against an average Oilers
defense. He'll put up some points, but the key for Seattle is
stopping running back Eddie George. The Seahawks have 41 sacks, but
pass rushing isn't the key, run stopping is. George already has
1,025 yards rushing and should add on about 100 more.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers, 19-14
</P>
<P>
   Saints (5-6) at Dolphins (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This is where Coach Jimmy Johnson earns the big bucks.
His Miami team is coming off a crushing loss to New England on
Monday Night Football. After the game, Johnson simply stood on the
sideline with his jaw open. He was stunned. Now Johnson must pick
his mouth off the carpet and propel his team to win. They must have
this game and it's a scary one for the Dolphins. Quarterback Kerry
Collins is beginning to look like the franchise quarterback he was
supposed to be in Carolina. And the New Orleans defense, which has
played great all season, is up to the task for stopping one of the
worst receiving corps in football.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 13-12
</P>
<P>
   Eagles (2-9) at Packers (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Blowout city, Part II. Some Minnesota coaches felt
that Packers Coach Mike Holmgren was overconfident before his game
with the Vikings. The Packers lost by two touchdowns. Holmgren had
better not be cocky this week, no matter how bad the Eagles are.
Coach Ray Rhodes, who was on the San Francisco staff when Holmgren
was there, would love to beat his old friend. He'll have the troops
fired up. But the Packers have a top-three wide receiver in Antonio
Freeman, who is averaging 19.9 yards per catch on third down. He
and quarterback Brett Favre hook up at least five times.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 28-10
</P>
<P>
   Redskins (2-9) at Raiders (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Raiders quarterback Donald Hollas may not be a pretty
thrower, or the best player in the league, but he is 4-1 as a
starter, with his only loss coming to undefeated Denver. Not bad.
Washington showed a lot of guts in coming back against Arizona. But
they must be drained. That was a long game and it has been a long
season. They have nothing left to play for except the `p'
word_pride. The Raiders are playing for their own `p' word _
playoff position.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 30-18
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (11-0) at Chargers (5-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Denver can clinch the AFC West with a victory or an
Oakland loss. But they'll win the division, either this week or
next. It's just a matter of time. But that of course is not the
story with this team _ whether they can go undefeated is. They
won't, and this is the road block. The Broncos look unbeatable,
especially early in the game, when they have outscored opponents in
the first quarter by 104 points, the second largest margin in
league history (the Chiefs did by 128 points in 1966). If the
Chargers can weather the storm early, and they will, they'll be in
the ballgame. San Diego is a different team than when these two met
earlier this month and the Broncos cruised, 27-10. The Chargers'
defense has gelled even more and given up just 255.7 yards a game,
tops in the league. San Diego allows only 65 yards on the ground.
Memo to Terrell Davis: Pack some extra padding. You are going to
get hit harder than you have all season.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 24-23
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT GAME
</P>
<P>
   Giants (4-7) at 49ers (8-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The only chance the Giants have of winning this game
is if they open up the offense. That's what a vastly overmanned New
Orleans team did against the 49ers last week and they made a game
of it. The Saints threw deep on their very first pass play of the
game. Will the Giants try that? They should. Have quarterback Kent
Graham, who has one of the strongest arms in the league, throw at
least 40 passes _ and not that dink and dunk stuff, either. The
Giants will probably be in the game because Coach Jim Fassel knows
he can't be conservative on offense if he has any chance of
winning. Defensively is where the Giants are in trouble. With a few
exceptions, they don't have the firepower to stay with the 49ers'
offense, which averages an NFL-high 422.2 yards a game.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ The instinctive reaction to word that Chile's Augusto
Pinochet has been denied immunity in London and faces extradition
to Spain is: Good, at least one bloody dictator can be held to
account.
 &HT;    But it isn't a simple issue, and the simple answer can have very
bad consequences.
 &HT;    It is no accident that the French government congratulated
itself on having foreseen possible embarrassment and refused
Pinochet a visa before his ill-fated London trip. Nor is it
surprising that Spain's Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar initially
commented that ``the best outcome would be if the government
doesn't even have to decide.''
 &HT;    A jumble of issues is now provoked by the collision of demands
for pure justice and the demands of politics, the demands of peace,
the demands of reconciliation. Further, the new emphasis on the
international right to judge certain crimes complicates the
question of who is to be the judge of whether circumstance or
unyielding moral dictates should prevail.
 &HT;    It has been pointed out that the peaceful, constructive
transition of Spain from a fascist dictatorship to a sturdy
democracy was achieved, despite ominous predictions of another
civil war, by refusing to judge the past. South Africa found relief
from intolerable prospects of confrontation and revenge in its
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
 &HT;    Many countries _ El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, and
ex-communist countries of eastern Europe as well as Chile _ have
sought to transcend ferocious or deeply wounding civil strife by
trying to tell the truth instead of by insisting on punishment. Is
their choice to be overruled on the grounds that crimes committed
were crimes against all of humanity, not just their own nation?
 &HT;    The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, who initiated the warrant
for Pinochet's arrest, has been working on testimony collected by
victims of the regime for several years. He is a man of rigor, who
pushed corruption and drug cases and tracked the ``dirty war''
against Basque terrorists.
 &HT;    Garzon's document calling for Pinochet's arrest and listing 91
people kidnapped, tortured or killed also lists a long series of
international declarations and agreements which Britain has signed
proscribing genocide, war crimes and torture. There is no question
about the straightforward legal sincerity of Garzon or of the fact
that crimes were committed.
 &HT;    There has been a tendency of late, particularly in connection
with the atrocities in former Yugoslavia, to proclaim the
inevitability of eventual punishment as a kind of consolation for
not being able to stop the terror and not being able to catch the
perpetrators. The Pinochet arrest gives the satisfaction of being
able to feel that some day evildoers everywhere will get their due.
 &HT;    Indeed, the new treaty on establishing a permanent international
tribunal, which the United States has refused to sign, has been
hailed as a signal advance that will deter future criminal
monsters. But this is fantasy. If anything, an advance, locked-in
provision for punishment makes it harder to end a conflict short of
total victory. It leaves no room for negotiation or compromise.
 &HT;    Of course, a possible answer is that there never should be
compromise with evil. Justice must be complete, there must be no
escaping the highest law.
 &HT;    That leaves the underlying question of what we really hope to
achieve and what standards are to be applied. Even today in Chile,
there are people who consider Pinochet a savior rather than a
murderer. He was able to make his deal for lifetime immunity there
because he still had considerable support when he turned power over
to a freely elected president.
 &HT;    It isn't just a matter of who is to decide. It is whether the
desired outcome should be punishment, revenge, blind justice
regardless of its consequences or removal of civil conflict and a
better chance of peaceful life.
 &HT;    When, as was the case at Nuremberg after World War II, it is
possible to achieve all at once, so much the better. But the best
in moral terms must not destroy the chances of improving how people
live.

 &HT;    PARIS _ The instinctive reaction to word that Chile's Augusto
Pinochet has been denied immunity in London and faces extradition
to Spain is: Good, at least one bloody dictator can be held to
account.
 &HT;    But it isn't a simple issue, and the simple answer can have very
bad consequences.
 &HT;    It is no accident that the French government congratulated
itself on having foreseen possible embarrassment and refused
Pinochet a visa before his ill-fated London trip. Nor is it
surprising that Spain's Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar initially
commented that ``the best outcome would be if the government
doesn't even have to decide.''
 &HT;    A jumble of issues is now provoked by the collision of demands
for pure justice and the demands of politics, the demands of peace,
the demands of reconciliation. Further, the new emphasis on the
international right to judge certain crimes complicates the
question of who is to be the judge of whether circumstance or
unyielding moral dictates should prevail.
 &HT;    It has been pointed out that the peaceful, constructive
transition of Spain from a fascist dictatorship to a sturdy
democracy was achieved, despite ominous predictions of another
civil war, by refusing to judge the past. South Africa found relief
from intolerable prospects of confrontation and revenge in its
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
 &HT;    Many countries _ El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, and
ex-communist countries of eastern Europe as well as Chile _ have
sought to transcend ferocious or deeply wounding civil strife by
trying to tell the truth instead of by insisting on punishment. Is
their choice to be overruled on the grounds that crimes committed
were crimes against all of humanity, not just their own nation?
 &HT;    The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, who initiated the warrant
for Pinochet's arrest, has been working on testimony collected by
victims of the regime for several years. He is a man of rigor, who
pushed corruption and drug cases and tracked the ``dirty war''
against Basque terrorists.
 &HT;    Garzon's document calling for Pinochet's arrest and listing 91
people kidnapped, tortured or killed also lists a long series of
international declarations and agreements which Britain has signed
proscribing genocide, war crimes and torture. There is no question
about the straightforward legal sincerity of Garzon or of the fact
that crimes were committed.
 &HT;    There has been a tendency of late, particularly in connection
with the atrocities in former Yugoslavia, to proclaim the
inevitability of eventual punishment as a kind of consolation for
not being able to stop the terror and not being able to catch the
perpetrators. The Pinochet arrest gives the satisfaction of being
able to feel that some day evildoers everywhere will get their due.
 &HT;    Indeed, the new treaty on establishing a permanent international
tribunal, which the United States has refused to sign, has been
hailed as a signal advance that will deter future criminal
monsters. But this is fantasy. If anything, an advance, locked-in
provision for punishment makes it harder to end a conflict short of
total victory. It leaves no room for negotiation or compromise.
 &HT;    Of course, a possible answer is that there never should be
compromise with evil. Justice must be complete, there must be no
escaping the highest law.
 &HT;    That leaves the underlying question of what we really hope to
achieve and what standards are to be applied. Even today in Chile,
there are people who consider Pinochet a savior rather than a
murderer. He was able to make his deal for lifetime immunity there
because he still had considerable support when he turned power over
to a freely elected president.
 &HT;    It isn't just a matter of who is to decide. It is whether the
desired outcome should be punishment, revenge, blind justice
regardless of its consequences or removal of civil conflict and a
better chance of peaceful life.
 &HT;    When, as was the case at Nuremberg after World War II, it is
possible to achieve all at once, so much the better. But the best
in moral terms must not destroy the chances of improving how people
live.

SOME CAREER WRESTLING CAN LEAD TO PRIZES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Say you are Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura. You are
ready to move from wrestling to another career, but what the heck
are you qualified for?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see: You are a master of hype, you know how to take a
punch and you've spent years making phony gestures appear real.
</P>
<P>
   Voila! Politics. Now Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura is Jesse ``The
Mind'' Ventura, the governor-elect of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   That is just one of many career lessons available from the world
of professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   People scoff at wrestling because ``it isn't real.'' This just
in: ``ER'' isn't real. ``Melrose Place'' isn't real. Besides, which
is more real: professional wrestling or a campaign promise?
</P>
<P>
   So set aside prejudices and get ready for an out of ``The Body''
experience. Here are enough career tips to choke a Hulk:
</P>
<P>
   _ Re-create yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling was fading in the 1970s, but its promoters were smart
enough to change. They made the wrestlers more theatrical, even if
it meant losing those fans who actually believed that somebody
could get punched in the face 43 times and not bleed.
</P>
<P>
   Plan on re-creating yourself at least a couple of times in your
career. You may want to shift to management or move to a more
lucrative field or protect yourself from a fading industry. And
even if you are content doing the same thing decade after decade,
you had better stay up to date or you could end up without a job.
</P>
<P>
   _ A little hype never hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   If someone gave you a dollar for every wrestling ``Match of the
Century,'' you would have enough money to buy a politician.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a promotion or a raise or just about anything else,
you had better learn the art of hype. What qualifications do you
have that others do not? What do you do particularly well? How can
you package yourself effectively? Don't lie and don't mislead, but
spin like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, though, that hype will get you only so far. Even in a
fantasy world, you won't beat Hulk Hogan if all you can bench press
is a pastrami sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure the right person is watching.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of wrestling theater is for the referee to be distracted
or get bumped by one of the wrestlers, then crumble into a heap.
One wrestler then pins the other, but it doesn't matter because the
referee doesn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   If you have something you are particularly proud of, try to make
sure that at least your boss and your boss's boss know about it. If
you are filling in and dealing directly with the higher-ups, do
whatever you can to shine (other than back-stabbing), even if it
means putting in unpaid overtime.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss always takes credit for your ideas, share your
proposal with several people and ask for suggestions before
presenting it. That will make it harder for someone else to take
credit.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss discourages suggestions, see if you can make them
through an ally who has connections with the boss's boss. And ask
yourself why you are working for such a pencil neck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand who is really in charge.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you are the greatest hero or the dirtiest
villain in wrestling; if the crowd doesn't respond, you are toast.
</P>
<P>
   Management and labor unions often forget that. They concentrate
so much on beating each other that sometimes they forget about
keeping their customers. A union contract isn't worth much if the
company goes out of business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wins and losses are not usually clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   When the San Francisco 49ers play the Green Bay Packers, one
team wins and the 49ers lose. But wrestling matches often end in
flukes; a wrestler or manager interferes, somebody uses a foreign
object or the referee fades into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Career accomplishments can turn into distant memories in a
hurry. Do whatever you can to take advantage of them, but don't
rest on them. They are rarely monumental.
</P>
<P>
   Do not dwell on your losses, either. Even if you have been
fired, you can turn it into a victory if you grow from it. Losing a
job does not carry the stigma that it used to.
</P>

ECOLOGICAL MOVEMENT TAKES ROOT IN CENTRAL MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AHUACUATLAN, Mexico _ High in a valley here in the Sierra Gorda
mountains of central Mexico, a graying cannonball of a woman in a
denim jumper and straw hat squeezes an ancient accordion and leads
150 schoolchildren in a song.
</P>
<P>
   No Sesame Street dropout, Martha Ruiz Corzo is a front-line
soldier in the fight to preserve the remnants of Mexico's
fast-disappearing natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``United in the fight to save the Earth, we shall not be
moved,'' rang the verse that Ruiz, director of the Sierra Gorda
Biosphere Reserve, sang with the primary school children.
</P>
<P>
   Deforestation, overpopulation, streams, and rivers awash in
human waste and garbage threaten Mexico's vast and diverse
collection of plants, animals, and resident and migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   If they are to be saved, it will be children like these,
schooled in earth-friendly principles of conservation, recycling
and responsible reproduction, who will ultimately carry the battle,
Ruiz said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   And here at the Jose Maria Morelos school, Ruiz's message seems
to be taking root.
</P>
<P>
   One day each month, representatives from the federal biosphere
visit the school to meet with children and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Results have been student-led drives throughout the village of
Ahuacuatlan to collect and send for recycling thousands of pounds
of paper, cardboard, glass and plastic that once littered the
streets and fields. And the children are transforming their former
bare-dirt playground, said teacher Humberto Marquez Correa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, we had just bare ground in the schoolyard,''
Marquez said. ``Now, the people from the biosphere have brought
trees that the children have planted, and they are growing tall
around the school's fence line.''
</P>
<P>
   The biosphere, one of 30 such preserves in Mexico, was
established in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million acres in a chunk of rugged mountains 200 miles
northeast of Mexico City, Sierra Gorda is home to nearly 600
species of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. There are more
than 1,700 species of plants, including 14 kinds of conifers.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, pumas, and an occasional black bear prowl the lush
jungles, mountain pine forests, or desert reaches, while military
macaws, red-tailed hawks and migrating monarch butterflies wing
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an encounter zone between the southern extension of
many neo-arctic species and the northern limits of those found only
in the tropics,'' said Ruiz's son, Roberto Pedraza Ruiz, 23, an
expert on the reserve's biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists and naturalists have just begun to explore Sierra
Gorda's riches; three previously unknown species of plants and four
new butterflies have been discovered within the last year alone,
Pedraza said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Gorda is also home to nearly 100,000 people scattered in
some 300 communities throughout the mountains. While new
settlements are prohibited, those already established _ many dating
back to pre-Columbian times _ must be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ironically, the reserve's vertical topography and poor
soil may be its salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of impoverished farmers have given up the fight to
produce enough corn and beans to feed hungry families and have
migrated to the United States. Rural residents now supported by
dollars sent home are abandoning ranches and homesteads and are
flocking to Sierra Gorda's small but booming cities.
</P>
<P>
   And as the people leave, the forest and animals are returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot more vegetation now than there was even 10
years ago,'' said Ruiz's husband, Roberto Pedraza Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   Credit also goes to the private, nonprofit Sierra Gorda Ecology
Group started by Ruiz and Pedraza with their two sons, Roberto and
Mario, nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Pedraza, a successful accountant for 20 years, and
Ruiz, a schoolteacher from a wealthy family, took their young sons
to a ranch in the Sierra Gorda to find peace in a simpler life in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we soon saw the environmental problems here, and we
couldn't ignore what was happening,'' Pedraza said. ``This area is
still very rescuable, and so we took up action. Now, with all of
our work, we have lost the peace we had gained.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza began growing pine and white cedar seedlings to plant on
deforested parts of his ranch; soon curious neighbors began taking
his seedlings home to plant on their land.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than 800 plots of green young trees dot formerly bare
mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use native species, and the local people who help us plant
them fence them off to protect them from cows. With minimal care,
we get impressive results,'' Pedraza said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the federal designation, there is still plenty of work
for the ecology group. Mexico's environmental secretariat must
compete with larger, more important agencies for scarce funding, so
the Sierra Gorda Ecology Group canvasses Mexico, the United States
and Europe for funding for important projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become experts at knocking on doors and asking for
money,'' the younger Roberto said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Gorda Ecology Group works in three broad areas:
environmental education; community development and protection; and
rescue of soil, forest resources and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Besides planting trees, the group is looking for foreign support
to help buy back land from private holders for the reserve's 11
pristine core zones. Ruiz said a group in Germany may pay
landowners not to cut timber on 2,500 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also has established recycling centers in
mountain communities. Plastic, glass and cardboard are sent to the
state capital for reprocessing instead of thrown into streams and
ravines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have sent more than 320 tons of garbage to Queretaro in the
last 8 years,'' said Oralia Camacho Montes, the group's education
program coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The group helps people build a low-tech, high-efficiency stove
that burns 60 percent less firewood than traditional open-hearth
fireplaces. And the use of composting latrines is slowly replacing
the ancient practice of simply going to the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anything, the group is the key to Sierra
Gorda's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send 16 promoters to visit 163 schools, with a total of
16,000 students, every month,'' Camacho said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, teachers and parents were suspicious, but persistence
and results have won them acceptance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought we were making the children work to collect the
recyclable garbage, then keeping the money,'' she said. ``But we
keep good records, and people see a cleaner, healthier sierra. Now
they ask for us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve is arguably Mexico's
most successful, problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   Timber poachers still cut old-growth pine trees, taking the best
and leaving the majority to rot. And just last year, two jaguars
were killed by peasants; as few as 10 jaguars may still remain
within the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruiz and the others at the Sierra Gorda Ecology Group think
their educational efforts are taking hold, and will ultimately end
such practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of work to do, but I know we can make it,''
Ruiz said. ``Little by little, we are going to get the forest
back.''

AMERICAN DELEGATION TO VISIT CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As momentum to re-examine U.S. policy toward
Cuba builds, a group led by Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., will visit
the island to assess the impact of the 36-year U.S. economic
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   On her five-day trip, starting Monday, the Democratic
congresswoman plans to look into different aspects of Cuban life,
including health care, religious freedom, education and government,
and then write a report for Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe sooner or later U.S. policy toward Cuba is going to
change. It's got to change,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   She last visited Cuba 21 years ago with her predecessor and
then-boss, Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., on a similiar fact-finding
mission. Joining her this time will be Alameda County Supervisor
Keith Carson, Oakland Vice Mayor Ignacio De La Fuente and Oakland
City Council members Henry Chang Jr. and Jane Brunner.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Munoz, a professor of history and politics in the ethnic
studies department at UC-Berkeley, said Lee's visit would help
shape the ongoing debate in Washington on Cuba policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her presence there will contribute significantly to
making it a possibilty for the U.S. Congress to debate the issue in
such a way that it would be beneficial to lifting the embargo,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, a visit by a liberal Democrat, such as Lee, is not
expected to have as much impact on Washington discourse as visits
by Republican members of Congress, especially conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interest in reviewing Cuba policy is gaining bipartisan
support in Congress. Twenty-one senators have officially urged
President Clinton to establish a bipartisan national commission to
analyze the effects of the sanctions on America's economy and its
relations with its allies, among other areas.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Tuesday that the proposal had ``some
merit'' and was being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are considering questions such as the composition and
mandate of the commission,'' said State Department spokesman James
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   While organizations led by anti-Castro Cuban exiles have long
been the most powerful voices on Cuba policy in Washington, newer
Cuban American groups are urging more dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is the Cuban American Alliance Education Fund, a
Washington, D.C., group with about 10,000 members nationwide.
Co-founded by Delvis Fernandez-Levy, a retired educator from
Hayward, Calif., it advocates expanded trade, especially of food
and medical supplies, and more liberal visitation policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a sense of optimism that next year is going to be a
year we'll see major changes in U.S. Cuba policy,'' said
Fernandez-Levy, also the organization's president. ``My sense is
most people in Washington are not happy with the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are people in the Bay Area happy with the sanctions, said
Lee, which prevent Cuban Americans from visiting family members
more than once in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   From a business standpoint, American companies are becoming more
vocal about stating their desire to trade with and invest in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that during the last two years, more
(American) companies have become public about their interest toward
Cuba and more companies are conducting transactions in Cuba where
permissible,'' said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade
and Economic Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The number of American business executives traveling to Cuba has
grown every year, from about 500 in 1994 to 2,000 last year and an
estimated 2,500 this year, according to Kavulich.
</P>
<P>
   Although travel to Cuba is still restricted, the number of
visitors also is growing rapidly. The number of legal travelers _
such as journalists, academics, business people and those seeing
family members _ has grown about 9 to 12 percent each of the last
five years, totaling about 120,000 last year, said Kavulich.
</P>
<P>
   The number of unauthorized travelers, such as tourists, has
grown even faster, increasing by about 20 percent annually, and is
expected to reach 20,000 this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich is optimistic about prospects for American companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three to five years from when U.S. commercial
transactions with Cuba are normalized, the United States _ through
companies that import, export, invest, provide financing and
through tourism _ will be influencing 80 percent or more of Cuba's
economy, or GDP,'' he said.

<P>
   Again Boris Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia. In a
normal situation in a normal society this news ought to have evoked
just one kind of feeling: compassion for an elderly man who must
discharge far-from-easy duties. In Russia, however, circumstances
do not allow one to indulge exclusively in these emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of Galina Starovoitova; the uproar around the
Federal Security Service following Boris Berezovsky's accusations
of a plot to kill him; the escape of six dangerous criminals from a
Moscow jail; the triumphant victory by the anti-Semitic
``Fatherland'' political bloc in a Krasnodar election _ this is far
from being a complete list of events that have occurred merely in
the course of the past week.
</P>
<P>
   And this amid mounting hysteria, when even a person's death is
used as an excuse for settling political accounts. The president is
sick, but are we all right?
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, Boris Yeltsin's hospitalization could indeed
aggravate the situation even more. The radicals will, with even
greater enthusiasm, start harping on the need to remove the
president from office. Kremlin officials will, with fresh vigor,
continue the search for a new boss. Bandits can breathe a sigh of
relief: They will be forgotten in the political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   All this points to an obvious conclusion: Today there are
powerful social groups in Russia that, judging by the logic of
their life, will continue to rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   But let's keep a clear head. What has actually changed in the
country since the president fell ill? Has he only now stopped
running the state? The condition of his health has long forced him
to take it easy. Has he only now left the country unattended? For
sure, Russia has a prime minister who was approved by parliament.
Is there now reason to believe that the premier has illegally
usurped power? But under the Constitution, the head of cabinet
performs presidential duties in the event that the president is
unable to do so himself.
</P>
<P>
   The only tricky point is the formal transfer of powers from the
president to the prime minister through an edict, something for
which Boris Yeltsin is apparently not ready. Yet, should we be so
upset over this given that it is only the ``nuclear briefcase''
that is ever transferred by edict? Hardly anyone seriously believes
that this is one of the trappings of power over which Russia can be
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The situation with the political powers that be is more or less
clear, but what about those who are going to take over? Is anyone,
except for the chronically feverish radicals, interested in the
idea of the president being relieved of his duties ahead of term
and, for that matter, in early elections?
</P>
<P>
   Although the election campaign began a long time ago, none of
its favorites are as yet ready for a showdown. The party of power
has not as yet decided on its single leader. Today this role is
being claimed by both Yuri Luzhkov and Viktor Chernomyrdin. Yevgeny
Primakov does not aspire to it but others are claiming it on his
behalf. Representatives of the ruling establishment refer to him as
a possible ``common nomenklatura'' candidate. This group is
obviously not ready for a forced presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are others particularly well prepared. Gennady Zyuganov has
unexpectedly acquired a rival in the person of the Moscow mayor,
who has recently managed to bite off a hefty bit of support from
the leftist electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government, formed with the participation of the
Communists, has not achieved overnight success. Nor is the famous
Gen. Alexander Lebed in particularly good shape. To date Boris
Berezovsky, his main image maker and sponsor (who has also fallen
on hard times), has not yet found a way to make up for Lebed's
mistakes in Krasnoyarsk, of which he is the elected governor.
Neither does Grigory Yavlinsky seem to be rapidly gaining
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, amid the ongoing crisis, no one has enough funds
for the elections. In short, all the indications are that no one is
going to force presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the worst comes to the worst and early elections do
become inevitable? Even then a sociopolitical catastrophe is not a
foregone conclusion. The country has a prime minister who is in a
good position to lead the country to a nationwide ballot. So no
matter what, there is indeed a safety factor. Let us understand
this and not give way to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Neither politicians nor special services nor psychics, even if
they really want this, will be able to cause an era of chaos
against our will. The country will calm down as soon as its
citizens calm down. And then the president's pneumonia will remain
nothing more than a sad page in his medical history. Not in the
history of the country.

   Again Boris Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia. In a
normal situation in a normal society this news ought to have evoked
just one kind of feeling: compassion for an elderly man who must
discharge far-from-easy duties. In Russia, however, circumstances
do not allow one to indulge exclusively in these emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of Galina Starovoitova; the uproar around the
Federal Security Service following Boris Berezovsky's accusations
of a plot to kill him; the escape of six dangerous criminals from a
Moscow jail; the triumphant victory by the anti-Semitic
``Fatherland'' political bloc in a Krasnodar election _ this is far
from being a complete list of events that have occurred merely in
the course of the past week.
</P>
<P>
   And this amid mounting hysteria, when even a person's death is
used as an excuse for settling political accounts. The president is
sick, but are we all right?
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, Boris Yeltsin's hospitalization could indeed
aggravate the situation even more. The radicals will, with even
greater enthusiasm, start harping on the need to remove the
president from office. Kremlin officials will, with fresh vigor,
continue the search for a new boss. Bandits can breathe a sigh of
relief: They will be forgotten in the political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   All this points to an obvious conclusion: Today there are
powerful social groups in Russia that, judging by the logic of
their life, will continue to rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   But let's keep a clear head. What has actually changed in the
country since the president fell ill? Has he only now stopped
running the state? The condition of his health has long forced him
to take it easy. Has he only now left the country unattended? For
sure, Russia has a prime minister who was approved by parliament.
Is there now reason to believe that the premier has illegally
usurped power? But under the Constitution, the head of cabinet
performs presidential duties in the event that the president is
unable to do so himself.

 THE STORY OF `FURBY,' the MOODY FURBALL

 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over Mattel. In three days he
planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in 25
years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the BIG toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, very late by
industry norms.
 &HT;    To be sure, the recent success of toys containing
microprocessors, from Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has
buttressed the belief that technology is the toy industry's savior.
Earlier generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive
to a child _ but the newer ones insinuate themselves into their
owner's life like a pal.
 &HT;    In past months, some schools even banned virtual pets because
children were more focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying
attention to the teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids
began to mourn digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like
Furby, which exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate
themselves even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a
secret language, playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    What's more, the technology is increasingly invisible. No
instruction manual is necessary and children can have what they
most desire: the perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him. The company seemed concerned that if the
inventor, whom I'll call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may
increase the fees he demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    According to Eric, an earlier version of Furby was manually
controlled with dials and came to life like a puppet. This Furby
uttered not a chirp from its yellow beak. But, Eric said, the
finished Furby would be able to play games, communicate with other
Furbies via infrared signals, learn English by means of positive
reinforcement and teach a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue).
No two Furbies would share the same personality or react to stimuli
in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    The master plan was to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in
'99 or 2000, the way other companies might to give the development
more time. Furby's category _ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz
lingo _ had already shown its potential, having grown 223 percent
in 1997 over the year before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category was pegged ``the hot one.''
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of all new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy
companies to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can
heavily discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, began to formulate opinions about which toys would be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    But Furby was a hands-down winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart
committed, on the spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire
production run. Everyone wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated
success. So sure was Tiger of Furby that at one point, it even
planned to require Furby-buying retailers to order other, less-hot
toys too from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    After the toy fair, Furby's ears got smaller _ that was to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, succeeded in ironing out the Furby
Communication Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies talk to
each other through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and colleagues worked to fabricate Furby's history _ what
they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby needs a
context to explain where the creature comes from, which can be
explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger marked the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

New York. A contest on the Cartoon Network will give children who
learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy for Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

'TIS THE SEASON TO CLEAN THE CHIMNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRENDAN LYONS  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What does creosote have to do with Jack Frost, fireplaces and
charred homes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Everything.
</P>
<P>
   It's the time of year when temperatures dips as steadily as
homeowners scoop logs from their wood piles - some never giving a
thought to the condition of their chimney.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure, experts say chances are it needs a good
scrub. Otherwise, you could end up being one of the many
grief-stricken homeowners who stand on their front lawn watching
firefighters try to save their burning home.
</P>
<P>
   Creosote is the tarlike flammable byproduct of burning wood that
builds up on the inside of a chimney. When creosote catches fire,
it burns so hot it can crack fireplace linings and allow flames to
spread into the walls of a home, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   Chimney fires are also very sneaky, because smoke curling out of
a brick stack does not look peculiar and the first sign of trouble
is often a tremendous back-flow of smoke or an inside wall of a
home that is so hot it could fry an egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the drop in temperature, people start looking for
alternate means of heat and they tend not to pay particular
attention to chimney maintenance, which is something they should
have high concern for,'' said Ken Hassett, the first chief in
Clifton Park, N.Y. ``Once a chimney fire is discovered, it can be
difficult to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Office of Fire Prevention and Control doesn't track
chimney fires, which officials said are listed under the general
classification of structural fires. Still, firefighters and chimney
sweeps contend education and the popularity of natural gas
fireplaces have cut down on the number of creosote-related chimney
fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, I used to walk into a restaurant for lunch,
covered with soot, rand people would look at me with my top hat and
say `What are you?''' said Peter Looker, a chimney sweep from
Ballston Spa, N.Y. ``Now, it's pretty much accepted that there are
chimney sweeps around and chimneys need to be cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   An average chimney can be cleaned professionally for about $85,
Looker said, and should be done every year or so depending on how
often a fireplace or wood stove is used.
</P>
<P>
   While all wood produces some creosote, seasoned wood produces
much less of the black substance than green wood or wood from
sap-rich trees, such as pine. The creosote forms when gases from
burning wood slither up the chimney, hit cooler air and then
condense on the side of the flue.
</P>
<P>
   Even though people with natural gas fireplaces and wood stoves
are safe from creosote-related disasters, those systems can pose
their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole direction of problems in this industry has shifted
from chimney fires and people burning wood to natural gas
problems,'' said Gary Menia of United Specialists chimney service
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common problems with natural gas systems is that
they burn more efficiently, which means the gases that are vented
up a chimney are cooler than wood fires. The cooler air condenses
into moisture, which can eat away at the innards of an older
chimney and eventually block the vent with the crumbled remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, a gallon of water per hour is condensing inside
the chimney,'' Menia said.
</P>
<P>
   If a chimney gets blocked, the natural gas residue can seep into
a home without any telltale odor or heat, in some cases raising the
amount of carbon monoxide in the home to dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``With natural gas, you have no idea it's happening, which is
why we have (carbon monoxide) detectors,'' Menia said.

SUVS ARE A MENACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ SUVs: To me, the letters stand for ``Stupid
Unnecessary Vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   How do I hate them? Let me count the ways. And when they are
driven by someone with a telephone at his or her ear _ someone
alone with no load of children or lumber _ I entertain the most
sadistic fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a rant against sport utility vehicles _ though not
against the people who drive them because I know some really,
really nice people who drive them. But I've hated the things for
years, and a couple of recent experiences pushed me over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   The first occurred as I tried to negotiate Cesar Chavez Street.
Ever since I learned to do so in high school driver's ed, I have
always looked around and ahead at the road to prepare for any
possible dangers. (Back then, they called this ``defensive
driving.'' Now the term means, ``Do nothing to tick off another
motorist or you'll get shot.'')
</P>
<P>
   But on Cesar Chavez I could look nowhere. To the left of me was
a bronze-tone SUV. To the right of me was a forest green SUV. In
two of the three lanes in front of me were a white SUV and a teal
minivan. (``Mini.'' What a lie.) Naturally, each Bunyanesque
vehicle contained but a single occupant, one of whom was on the
phone. I felt like a tiny little calf being rounded up by four
1,500-pound Brahma bulls.
</P>
<P>
   No, I felt like a prisoner, literal and existential. A blind
prisoner. Captive forever in a rolling fortress.
</P>
<P>
   No way out. No way out.
</P>
<P>
   Now I can't stop noticing how many times my view of the road is
totally blocked by a Stupid Unnecessary Vehicle. Before my
imprisonment on Cesar Chavez, I thought I was just being
hypersensitive. Now that I've begun to count, I see I was not.
</P>
<P>
   Have I mentioned the road behind me?
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Society of Automotive Engineers, the
headlights of normal cars are mounted about 24 inches above the
road. But Stupid Unnecessary Vehicles, like pickup trucks, have
headlights that sit 36 to 39 inches off the pavement. This happens
to be just about dead even with the side rear-view mirror on most
compact cars like my Honda. As a result, SUV headlight glare can be
10 to 20 times more severe than recommended levels.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling as I do about SUVs, imagine my chagrin when I learned
the following:
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that, in collisions, SUVs do more damage and
kill more people than do regular cars, many insurance companies
still do not charge SUV owners higher rates. As the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety found, when an SUV broadsides a car,
the car's occupant is 27 times more likely to die than in a car-car
crash. If the car is small, like my Honda, the SUV is 47 times more
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their gluttonous, gas-chugging engines that burn exactly
the same petrol as your car or mine, Stupid Unnecessary Vehicles
are classified as trucks and therefore do not have to meet as high
an emissions control standard as cars do. Consequently, they get to
spit out three times the amount of nitrogen oxide _ a prime element
of smog _ as cars do.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts by state agencies and lawmakers to curb these polluters
have been fought by the auto industry at every turn. Earlier this
month, the California Air Resources Board finally voted to raise
SUV, pickup and minivan emissions standards to the level of autos _
starting with new vehicles in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, people who never go any farther off-road than
their driveway and who confine their ``hauling'' to chocolate
labradors keep buying SUVs. In 1971, SUVs, minivans and pickups
accounted for about 16 percent of all new vehicle sales. Today they
make up just under half. So far this year, San Francisco, Marin and
San Mateo counties made room for almost 42,418 more new Stupid
Unnecessary Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate we are going, the only hope for owners of normal
cars may be the sunshine ordinances we use to keep skyscrapers from
completely wrecking Downtown.

STORING MUSIC OFF THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAL BOVOSO and STEFEN REILLY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's amazing how many industry-invented crises we've weathered
in our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   Television would kill the movies. Computers would kill the book
industry. Dual-deck cassette players would lead to massive
copyright infringement and the collapse of the music industry.
Video on demand would kill the video rental business.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail would kill the post office (OK, that one comes close).
And now, horror of horrors, we're faced with MP3, massive copyright
infringement and the collapse of the music industry as we know it
(again!).
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is shorthand for MPEG Layer 3, the music compression
technology that allows you to store and send near-CD quality music
over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 reduces audio signals by removing any bits that can't be
heard with the human ear, resulting in files about one-twelfth
their original size. The fear, of course, is if music can be taken
off the Web, who will want to buy a CD?
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, San Jose, Calif.-based Diamond Multimedia
Systems is releasing the RIO, the first portable music player that
stores and plays back MP3 files, just in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, not only can you download music, you can take it with you
as well. The RIO can store up to 60 minutes of digital music, which
the manufacturer claims only takes about six minutes to download
from your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you have to have a desktop to begin with and the
patience to get the music onto your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   We downloaded three songs from one of the many MP3 sites on the
Web for a total of approximately 12 minutes of music. It took more
than 45 minutes of download time with our 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, an hour of music would take about four hours to
download. It's not difficult, but it sure is tedious. We tried it
with a 33.6K modem and recommend it only for those of you with the
patience of a saint or absolutely no personal life at all.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you are really into the MP3 scene, you'll love the
little (3 1/2-inch x 2 1/2-inch) RIO. At only about 2 1/2 ounces,
it's like a small Sony Walkman, but because there are no moving
parts (it's digital, folks), there's no skipping even when it's
taking a good shaking, making it a great workout companion.
</P>
<P>
   The RIO takes a single 1.5V alkaline battery, which is good for
about 12 hours of playback. Extra memory cards are available.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the MP3 platform rhapsodize about its virtues,
claiming you can't tell the difference in sound quality between it
and a CD, but we notice the phrase ``near CD quality'' in all the
literature.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, when you're sick of that hour of music you've
loaded into your RIO, you have to go back and reload it with new
songs from your desktop. And, of course, before you can do that,
you have to choose and download those songs from the Web. There
goes another four hours of your life.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, this new technology comes with a fairly hefty price
tag. The RIO, which should be in stores as you read this, retails
at $199.95. Removable flash memory upgrade cards run $49.95 for a
half-hour and $99.95 for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for the fact that street prices will be lower than
these, as far as we're concerned, these numbers reach into the
``ouch!'' range for what is essentially the newest toy in the
computer aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those of you really into MP3, the RIO does what it
says it will _ allow you to download music from the Web _ and does
it pretty well. We're just not convinced that what it does is
really worth all the effort. See ya. Sal and Stef.

BOEING'S SUPERSONIC EFFORT FINALLY HAS A HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At an evangelical church not far from Disney World,
services were held in the shadow of its massive variable-sweep
wings and five-story tail.
</P>
<P>
   Several times it was nearly sold for scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   And for the past eight years, it deteriorated in the rain and
Florida humidity at a junkyard near Cape Canaveral, covered by
weeds and all but forgotten, the last artifact of America's efforts
to build a supersonic passenger plane.
</P>
<P>
   The full-scale, $11-million mock-up of The Boeing Co.'s
supersonic transport has had a vagabond existence since it was sold
to a Nebraska millionaire and transported in seven railroad cars
from Seattle to Florida after Congress killed the SST project in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most of it has finally found a permanent home, thanks to a
California aviation pioneer who had help from friends at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the highly publicized saga of the old ferry Kalakala,
which was rescued from mudflats in Alaska and recently returned
here for restoration, the effort to save this piece of aviation
history played out with little public notice.
</P>
<P>
   A 100-foot section of the fuselage, including the cockpit and
the plane's ``droop snoot'' needle nose, was rescued from the space
center junkyard, shipped cross-country in trucks and is being
restored at the recently opened Hiller Aviation Museum near San
Francisco. Eventually, visitors will be able to sit in the
first-class cabin and even operate from the droop snoot, which was
designed to be lowered to give pilots better visibility during
takeoffs and landings.
</P>
<P>
   The mock-up will be as close as anyone gets to a Boeing-built
SST until well into the next century. Boeing recently decided to
delay by at least 10 years developing a generation passenger jet
that would fly several times faster than the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for quite a display. We feel very fortunate to have
it,'' said Stanley Hiller Jr., a longtime member of Boeing's board
of directors who spent two decades trying to turn his dream of an
educational aviation museum into a reality. The Northern California
museum that bears his name opened this past May.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we finish the restoration,'' he said of the SST mock-up,
``it will look like a flyable aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuselage section acquired by the museum already is on
display with some 75 other airplanes, and its needle nose was
recently mated again to the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from being restored, however. As Hiller said, ``If you
saw it now, it looks a little like it's been in a very long sleep.
It was just lying in the weeds and rain for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue and white Boeing paint job has faded and the fuselage
has been consumed by rust and streaked with years of grime since
that day on Sept. 29, 1966, when the sleek mock-up, only a dozen
feet shorter than a football field, was unveiled to the media,
airline representatives and other VIPs at Boeing's Developmental
Center here.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Legend &AMP; Legacy: The Story of Boeing and Its
People,'' Robert Sterling wrote of that moment:
</P>
<P>
   ``The visitors were gathered on a balcony in the Developmental
Center; a bridge connected the balcony to the mock-up, which was
bathed in darkness until the moment of unveiling. A series of
spotlights came on one by one, illuminating the immense needle-nose
blue-and-white plane in sections. The last spotlight threw its beam
at the large `USA' on the tail, as a voice intoned over a
loudspeaker: `This ... is the Boeing supersonic transport!' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the plane's nose was raised and lowered, guests were escorted
across the bridge into the model's interior, which Sterling wrote
was ``as spectacular as the exterior.'' The carpeting was a rich
but pleasing blue. Each of the seats, which alternated deep reds
and purples with splashes of orange, contained its own television
screen, a personal touch that would become available only when
Boeing introduced the 777 nearly 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The mockup was not just for show. It was built to test
engineering designs for two prototypes of a Boeing SST that would
carry 250 passengers at mach 2.7, or about 1,800 miles per hour.
That's faster than today's jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The mock-up had the same section breaks and critical dimensions
as the planned prototypes, including wings that could be swept back
after takeoff to provide a more efficient angle for supersonic
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prototypes were to be made of titanium, the mockup
was built of wood, steel and aluminum. Fifty tons of steel, 42,800
linear feet of lumber of 3,500 sheets of plywood went into the
mockup.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only SST Boeing would build.
</P>
<P>
   Painted by critics as a white elephant and by environmentalists
as a destroyer of the Earth's ozone, the project ended abruptly on
May 20, 1971, when the U.S. Senate killed further funding.
</P>
<P>
   More than $1 billion already had been spent on developing the
SST.
</P>
<P>
   The 288-foot mock-up was put up for sale, but initial bids came
from companies that wanted Boeing to pay them to haul it away as
junk. Finally, it was sold by sealed bid to Marks O. Morrison for
$31,119. Morrison was a pilot, aviation buff and millionaire from
Nebraska who wanted the model as the centerpiece for an aviation
museum he planned in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1973, with the help of Boeing engineers, it was taken
apart, loaded on to seven railroad cars and hauled to Kissimmee,
Fla. There it was reassembled on a concrete slab the size of a
football field that had been poured in a cow pasture about 15 miles
east of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's transportation bill was $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation museum, which opened July 4 that year, was
literally built around the mockup, with the plane's tail _ the tip
of which rose 50 feet _ sticking through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the museum drew crowds, but visitors eventually
stopped coming and the museum closed in 1981. It would have cost
too much to take the plane apart and move it elsewhere, so it
remained when the property was sold to Faith World.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentecostal church held services under the wings until 1988.
Two years later, the building was sold to another church group, the
Osceola New Assembly of God. And it wanted the SST out.
</P>
<P>
   The story quickly attracted attention. Time Magazine sent a
reporter. A CBS crew showed up.
</P>
<P>
   At a Sunday service, church pastor Ernie DeLoach told his
congregation that he hoped the plane could be saved rather than
hacked into bits, but it had to go so the church could expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some of you are going to miss this plane, and that some
of you will shed tears,' he said. ``Some churches have steeples.
Ours has an airplane tail sticking through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The mockup was nearly sold for $10,000 to a scrap dealer, but
the deal fell through just days before the plane was to have been
chopped up.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a retired NASA engineer named Charlie Bell came
calling on the Osceola New Assembly of God.
</P>
<P>
   Bell liked to collect space-age artifacts and had restored a
couple of Redstone and Atlas rockets. At the request of the Puerto
Rican government, he had even built a rocket park near San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   After reading in a newspaper that the SST mockup might end up on
the scrap heap, Bell bought it in late 1990 for an undisclosed
amount and, with the help of friends, took it apart in seven
sections and transported them to a former steel plant he owned on
Merritt Island, just outside one of the gates to the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, aviation buffs from around the world who knew
about Boeing's SST project and the history of the mockup would
track Bell down and visit the old steel plant just across the
highway from the Shuttle Bar &AMP; Grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it needs is a good high-pressure washing ... and some
tender loving care,'' Bell told a Post-Intelligencer reporter who
visited the mockup late last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bell said he was talking to someone interested in
buying the mockup and putting it in a museum. The buyer turned out
to be Stanley Hiller Jr.
</P>
<P>
   A native of San Francisco, Hiller pioneered many of the
vertical-lift concepts that led to the modern helicopter. He built
his first helicopter, which he named the XH-44, in a friend's
garage at age 16. It was the first helicopter ever to fly on the
West Coast, hovering over the football field at Berkeley Memorial
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, at age 18, he founded the Hiller Aircraft Co. It would
produce more than 2,000 helicopters for military and commercial
use.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller's $25 million museum opened in May on land leased from
San Mateo County near the San Carlos Airport. It features 100
exhibits and 75 aircraft, including some built by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller, now 73, has a fondness for Boeing planes. He was on the
company's board for 22 years. It was his ties with Boeing that led
him to the SST mockup. And Hiller understood the plane's importance
in aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fit the theme of our museum, which is not only to look back
but to look ahead in aviation to the next 100 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing helped Hiller locate the mockup and sent engineers to
Florida to examine its condition. Hiller hoped to bring all of the
mockup back to his museum, but it would have taken up too much
space.
</P>
<P>
   The fuselage section, cockpit and nose were taken to California
on two flat-bed trucks. Boeing coordinated the difficult wide-load
transport task with the various states along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is providing expertise to ensure the mockup is
restored to its original condition, including the cabin interior
and cockpit instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our being able to do this is a real credit to Boeing,'' Hiller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bell nor Hiller will say how much the museum paid for
the mockup. Bell said he didn't make money on the deal; he just got
back what he paid the the Osceola New Assembly of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I could help find a home for it,'' Bell said. ``It
could easily have ended up as scrap metal.''

THE BOOK ON APPLES

<TEXT>
<P>
   If Snow White had known anything about apples, she would not
have been at all tempted by the gleaming red beauty the Evil Queen
offered her (with the dwarves away) as a deadly gift.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty in apples, as anyone who has ever bitten into one of the
high-gloss Red Delicious sold in most supermarkets can attest, is
so often a cruel tease. One bite and yuck! For this tasteless mush
Eve was evicted from Paradise and a fairy-tale princess suffered a
dreamless sleep?
</P>
<P>
   In fruit, as in life, beauty has too often been cultivated at
the expense of substance and good taste. In his new book,
``Apples,'' (North Point Press), author and longtime National
Public Radio reporter Frank Browning writes that ``more than any
other apple, Red Delicious (created near the end of the 19th
century and the most popular apple in America by the middle of the
20th) demonstrated the power of cosmetics in the fruit business.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on his family farm in Kentucky, where Browning continues to
care for the orchards he helped his father tend as a child, people
will tell him how much they prefer ``the old-fashioned Reds to the
fancy, perfectly shaped, perfectly colored ones at the supermarket.
Yet without fail, whenever we bring in a bin or two filled with
deeper, darker Delicious, those very same customers will go
straight for the pretty apples and leave the pale striped
(old-fashioned) ones behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the old-fashioned quality of the original Red Delicious
(with its ``vermilion stripes'' over a ``creamy base,'' as Browning
describes it, and its ``sweet, almost perfumey flavor'') is pure
delusion. There is nothing old-fashioned about an eating apple,
despite its association with primordial, natural perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little that we eat or even plant for decoration is
altogether natural, and hasn't been for centuries,'' Browning
writes. ``Before the Europeans crossed the Atlantic, there were no
proper apples in North America; there were only thorny crabs, Malus
coronaria, green little nubs too bitter to eat. Nor were there
oranges or apricots or peaches or pears.
</P>
<P>
   ``All were gardeners' confections, formerly wild trees of
Mesopotamia, central Asia or the South Pacific, grafted and
hybridized and set down in stylized plantations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming is fundamentally unnatural,'' says Browning, who now
divides his time between his family farm in Kentucky and his home
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd read John McPhee's book `Oranges' and I thought, God,
apples are a lot more interesting because of their economic
position in the world and all of the myths attached to them.''
</P>
<P>
   When you plant an orchard, says Browning, ``what you are doing
is organizing the wilderness of plants whose only natural purpose
is to replicate their own genetic materials. DNA's objective is to
make more DNA, not to make apples taste good or to make broccoli
with wonderfully tight heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering is, in Browning's view, simply what man and
nature have been doing, sometimes accidentally, sometimes by
design, for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apple tree and an apple eater have two very different
agendas,'' he writes in ``Apples.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A large tree with a multitude of small green apples makes a
far more ambitious breeding machine than a small, carefully
manicured tree with just a few big apples, which is where the apple
eaters' and apple growers' agendas come in. Most apple eaters
prefer to bite into large, pretty apples. To get a good supply of
those, the grower strips off one-half to two-thirds of all the
infant apples that form at bloom time. This is called thinning.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is just one of the hundreds of ways apple growers scheme
and manipulate to produce enough attractive, edible, transportable
apples (outwitting insects and rots and blights and inclement
weather) efficiently enough to make a living doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Browning's research took him to England and France to interview
the manufacturers of fine cider (not the freshly squeezed apple
juice most of us associate with the term, but the traditional
fermented beverage over which its most distinguished producers
exercise as much care as does any vintner over a fine wine), to
geneticists at Cornell who are collecting and mapping the DNA of
the world's oldest apples, to apple growers in Washington
(including the man who popularized the Granny Smith apple and who
predicts that Granny Smiths and Fujis will dominate the market well
into the next century) and, most exotically, to the primeval apple
forests of Kazakhstan, where many geneticists believe the apple was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a few Christian fundamentalists continue to insist that
the apple came from the Holy Lands,'' Browning writes. The
scientific debate centers, instead, on ``southwest Asia, in the
Caucasus mountains, or South-Central Asia, on the slopes of the
enormous range that separates China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan.''
</P>
<P>
   Browning knew that the world-renowned Russian geneticist
Nicholai Vavilov (who died in one of Stalin's prison camps) had
visited both areas and favored the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Browning writes about genetic engineering, surveys apple recipes
of the world and traces the literary and religious legends
associated with the apple (which he notes is descended,
genetically, from the rose). From its role as the forbidden fruit
of paradise to its appearance as the golden fruit that conferred
immortality on ancient gods, the apple has been linked almost
inextricably, Browning writes, ``to the power of love and evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Browning knew that power of apples even as a child in Kentucky,
where the preachers would stop in Sunday after church to select
their apples, but have them set aside (because it was forbidden to
do business on Sunday) to be paid for and picked up the following
day.

CHINESE MITTEN CRAB FLOURISHES IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In Hong Kong, where they're in short supply, a
palm-sized Chinese mitten crab with ripe ovaries and testes is such
a delicacy that a single crab sells for as much as $20.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and state water project pumps
near Tracy. Calif., the same exotic crabs are such a costly
nuisance that millions were crushed and buried this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong-born American entrepreneur is proposing a win-win
solution to this novel problem: Harvest the hairy-legged
crustaceans and ship 'em across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the commercial harvest of mitten crabs, which are
gumming up the works in the state's water pumps and aqueducts, will
be examined in detail by the California State Fish and Game
Commission on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   But while water project managers are intrigued by the idea,
wildlife biologists are wary. After all, if the commercial harvest
earned one entrepreneur millions of dollars, what would stop others
from sneaking different exotic crabs into California in the hope of
launching similar businesses?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese mitten crab is just one of several mitten crabs,
and we don't want to encourage other people to import other
species,'' said biologist Kathy Hieb, the Department of Fish and
Game's expert on mitten crabs.
</P>
<P>
   Mitten crabs were first detected in San Francisco Bay in 1992 by
shrimp trawlers. State and federal officials suspect importers
smuggled the crabs into the country to sell to Asian Americans,
then either intentionally or accidentally released some into the
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Game wardens discovered mitten crabs being offered for
sale at markets in both San Francisco and Los Angeles as long ago
as 1985, Hieb said. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inspectors have
even intercepted some live crabs that were being smuggled into the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The crabs have thrived so mightily along California's shoreline
that they now number in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, their fall migration this year through the Delta to the
Bay to spawn in salt water was so huge that it overwhelmed fish
rescue operations at the Bureau of Reclamation's Delta pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They physically blocked a lot of our valves and pipes and
other operations that divert fish (from the pumps), which
compromised our salvage efforts,'' said bureau biologist Scott
Siegfried. ``Fish died because crabs were in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco attorney David Jung says his client offers the
ideal recycling solution. Without identifying the interested
entrepreneur, Jung has asked the state's Fish and Game Commission
to allow his client to harvest the mitten crabs commercially for
live shipment to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client's proposal is not only a simple one, it may also be
a symbiotic solution to the problem,'' Jung said in a letter to
commission executive director Robert Treanor.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau of Reclamation spokesman Jeff McCracken welcomes the
plan. He said, ``If we could just scoop 'em out at the pump during
their migration, that'd be ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, while the proposal is simple in theory _ turning a profit
on a problem species while reducin its numbers _ the reality is
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Because mitten crabs are an exotic species and a known vector of
the Oriental liver fluke, which is transmissible to humans, it's
illegal to possess them live in California. Treanor said the state
would have to rewrite its regulations to allow a commercial
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the establishment of a new inland commercial
fishery _ crayfish is the only one at present _ may require
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And as a practical matter, ``a commercial fishery is not going
to get rid of it (mitten crabs),'' Treanor said.
</P>
<P>
   The mitten crab population explosion astonishes those who have
observed it firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only dozens in 1996 and between 16,000 and 20,000
in 1997'' at the Bureau of Reclamation's Tracy pumps, Siegfried
said. ``On at least one day this past fall there were over
25,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitten crabs are ``a brand-new organism filling a niche that it
occupies better than anything else,'' he said. ``It'll eventually
stabilize, but it could take more than two years to control it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the state has no formal crab management or control
program.
</P>
<P>
   Biologist Hieb said there's a chance the species could
experience a population collapse. Such collapses have occurred in
Europe, where the species invaded in the 1930s. But, she added, the
brutal truth is that ``we don't know what's going to happen.''

 By MIKE FREEMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals (6-5) at Chiefs (4-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Cardinals are in the playoff hunt. When is the
last time you heard that phrase? The Chiefs may not make the
playoffs. When was the last time you heard that as well? Arizona is
ahead of where most thought they'd be this season because
quarterback Jake Plummer is playing unbelievable football. He has a
96.2 passer rating in his previous four games. He will have a tough
time this week because the Chiefs have the second best pass defense
in the league. But because Kansas City is reeling so badly now, the
Cardinals win a close one on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 27-24
</P>
<P>
   Falcons (9-2) at Rams (3-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Falcons are no longer worrying about winning the
NFC West. They see the San Francisco 49ers in their rear-view
mirror. The Falcons are looking at the bigger picture, and their
eyes are turned towards Minnesota. There is a chance, albeit
slight, that Atlanta could get the home-field advantage throughout
the playoffs if the Vikings slip. That is their greater goal, and
the Falcons won't let a sorry Rams team get in the way, even if
quarterback Chris Chandler is ailing. Atlanta clinches a playoff
birth with a victory or a New Orleans loss and Detroit tie or loss.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 35-7
</P>
<P>
   Panthers (2-9) at Jets (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Jets this year have often followed up a great
victory with a puzzling loss. Last week, they hammered a solid
Tennessee team. This week come the hapless Panthers. Will history
repeat itself? Not this time. Coach Bill Parcells has probably
spent the past few days yelling at the Jets from sunrise to sunset,
trying to imprint on their brains that Carolina is dangerous. The
only true danger on the Panthers is linebacker Kevin Greene, tied
for the league lead in sacks with 14. He'll do some damage.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 28-17
</P>
<P>
   Colts (2-9) at Ravens (4-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The kind of year quarterback Peyton Manning is having
is scary. He's a rookie, and unlike many rookie quarterbacks he has
taken every snap, all 693 of them. His streak of a touchdown pass
in every game this year is the most by a rookie since Joe Namath in
1965. But Manning can't play safety or linebacker or defensive
line. The Colts have one of the worst defenses in football, giving
up 367 yards a game. Baltimore's offense should pick Indianapolis
apart, especially running back Priest Holmes, who ran for 227 yards
last week against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars (8-3) at Bengals (2-9)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Blowout city. The Jaguars are not happy campers after
losing to Pittsburgh last week. While the home team has won the
past five meetings, and six of the last seven games in this series
were decided by 8 points or less, this game won't be close.
Jacksonville cranks up its running attack and quarterback Mark
Brunnel, who has a 97 rating in past three games against
Cincinnati, will throw for over 300 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 28-0
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers (4-7) at Bears (3-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Tampa Bay is probably the most disappointing team in
the league. Things will only get worse. Chicago has just three
victories but a number of their games have been extremely close;
they should have seven or eight W's. The last time Tampa Bay was at
Chicago, the Bears won by 6 points off two Buccaneers fumbles. This
season, Chicago's 12 fumbled takeways ranks third in the NFC. Don't
be scared by the fact Erik Kramer isn't starting _ he's being
replaced by backup Moses Moreno _ because the Bears are going to
run the ball a zillion times anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, 15-9
</P>
<P>
   Bills (7-4) at Patriots (6-5)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: How this game turns out depends on the index finger of
quarterback Drew Bledsoe. He has two slight fractures and Bledsoe
maintains he can play; he's listed as questionable. But there is
some question about whether it's possible for a quarterback to
effectively throw a football the entire game with such an injury,
though Bledsoe threw beautifully in the final minutes against
Miami. If he plays, the Patriots win, because this team could be on
the verge of a three- or four-game winning streak. They are also
starting to get some of their injured players, like wide receiver
Terry Glenn, back on the field. Doug Flutie is the X-factor, as
he's coming home, and could be pumped up. He's 10-0 at Foxboro
Stadium _ 5-0 when he played with the Patriots and 5-0 with Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 17-16
</P>
<P>
   Oilers (6-5) at Seahawks (5-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Quarterback Jon Kitna was the most valuable player of
NFL Europe's World Bowl in 1997. Those Barcelona Dragons _ you
can't stop them, you can only hope to contain them. Now, he gets
only his second start in the big league against an average Oilers
defense. He'll put up some points, but the key for Seattle is
stopping running back Eddie George. The Seahawks have 41 sacks, but
pass rushing isn't the key, run stopping is. George already has
1,025 yards rushing and should add on about 100 more.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers, 19-14
</P>
<P>
   Saints (5-6) at Dolphins (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This is where Coach Jimmy Johnson earns the big bucks.
His Miami team is coming off a crushing loss to New England on
Monday Night Football. After the game, Johnson simply stood on the
sideline with his jaw open. He was stunned. Now Johnson must pick
his mouth off the carpet and propel his team to win. They must have
this game and it's a scary one for the Dolphins. Quarterback Kerry
Collins is beginning to look like the franchise quarterback he was
supposed to be in Carolina. And the New Orleans defense, which has
played great all season, is up to the task for stopping one of the
worst receiving corps in football.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 13-12
</P>
<P>
   Eagles (2-9) at Packers (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Blowout city, Part II. Some Minnesota coaches felt
that Packers Coach Mike Holmgren was overconfident before his game
with the Vikings. The Packers lost by two touchdowns. Holmgren had
better not be cocky this week, no matter how bad the Eagles are.
Coach Ray Rhodes, who was on the San Francisco staff when Holmgren
was there, would love to beat his old friend. He'll have the troops
fired up. But the Packers have a top-three wide receiver in Antonio
Freeman, who is averaging 19.9 yards per catch on third down. He
and quarterback Brett Favre hook up at least five times.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 28-10
</P>
<P>
   Redskins (2-9) at Raiders (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Raiders quarterback Donald Hollas may not be a pretty
thrower, or the best player in the league, but he is 4-1 as a
starter, with his only loss coming to undefeated Denver. Not bad.
Washington showed a lot of guts in coming back against Arizona. But
they must be drained. That was a long game and it has been a long
season. They have nothing left to play for except the `p'
word_pride. The Raiders are playing for their own `p' word _
playoff position.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 30-18
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (11-0) at Chargers (5-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Denver can clinch the AFC West with a victory or an
Oakland loss. But they'll win the division, either this week or
next. It's just a matter of time. But that of course is not the
story with this team _ whether they can go undefeated is. They
won't, and this is the road block. The Broncos look unbeatable,
especially early in the game, when they have outscored opponents in
the first quarter by 104 points, the second largest margin in
league history (the Chiefs did by 128 points in 1966). If the
Chargers can weather the storm early, and they will, they'll be in
the ballgame. San Diego is a different team than when these two met
earlier this month and the Broncos cruised, 27-10. The Chargers'
defense has gelled even more and given up just 255.7 yards a game,
tops in the league. San Diego allows only 65 yards on the ground.
Memo to Terrell Davis: Pack some extra padding. You are going to
get hit harder than you have all season.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 24-23
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT GAME
</P>
<P>
   Giants (4-7) at 49ers (8-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The only chance the Giants have of winning this game
is if they open up the offense. That's what a vastly overmanned New
Orleans team did against the 49ers last week and they made a game
of it. The Saints threw deep on their very first pass play of the
game. Will the Giants try that? They should. Have quarterback Kent
Graham, who has one of the strongest arms in the league, throw at
least 40 passes _ and not that dink and dunk stuff, either. The
Giants will probably be in the game because Coach Jim Fassel knows
he can't be conservative on offense if he has any chance of
winning. Defensively is where the Giants are in trouble. With a few
exceptions, they don't have the firepower to stay with the 49ers'
offense, which averages an NFL-high 422.2 yards a game.
</P>

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I connect to the Web at 32,000 (bits per

   DEAR WRONG: Well, obviously you don't understand the underlying
tenet of advertising, namely that if ad executives told the
complete truth about a product, their forked tongues would snap off
and fall wriggling to the floor. Remember, their job is to get you
to give money to their clients, and they're certainly not going to
let a silly thing like honesty threaten the lease payments on their
Beemers.
</P>
<P>
   My advice? Read the fine print. The lawyers make them put that
in to keep torch-toting mobs of villagers at bay. Can't download at
56K? Sorry, not our fault. It says so right on the box. Now go away
or we dump the boiling oil.
</P>
<P>
   You may have a 56K modem, but I'd be surprised if you connected
at anything faster than 32. There are too many things out there
conspiring to slow down connection speed, from bad phone lines to
bad Internet providers. And even if you get a fairly fast
connection, that doesn't mean the page or file you're downloading
is going to come in fast. It all depends on how much traffic the
remote site has, how fast their servers are, how good their link to
the Net is and how much wood a woodchuck could comfortably chuck.
</P>
<P>
   Want to download that ``Star Wars'' prequel clip? Good luck. Too
many other four-eyed loners with no lives are trying to beat you to
it. When Internet Explorer first debuted, it took one guy I know a
full day to download it. Get used to the wait. It's part of what
makes surfing so much fun: You have plenty of time to read.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Why would Apple hire Jeff Goldblum to sell
iMacs? He's so weird.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   DEAR PUZZ: It's sad isn't it? It's like he's so ashamed and
embarrassed by what's he's doing that he can't even look the camera
in the eye. I wonder why he didn't have the same problem in ``The
Lost World.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When things don't go right inside my computer,
I like to format the hard drive and start from scratch. Will this
shorten the life of my computer?
</P>
<P>
   _ Deja Vu All Over Again
</P>
<P>
   DEAR VU: It'll probably lengthen it by keeping you from picking
up the nearest large, blunt object instead. I reformat every time
Windows explodes on me _ I think I'm up in the hundreds _ and have
never had a problem. Well, other than having to use Windows.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Hallo!!!!!! I am a very big fan of ``Calcutta
(Taxi, Taxi, Taxi'') so I wondred if you could send me it on
(E-mail address deleted). If you didn't understood my wrote, so is
it because I from Norway.

<P>
   _ Your Biggest Fan
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BIGGEST: This was sort of funny when it first started, but
it's gotten out of hand. Even if I really was the rock band of the
same name, you people in Scandinavia should stop expecting
handouts. And stop sending me all that fan mail. I'm not them!
Well, unless you're a beautiful, single Scandinavian woman, of
course.

OUR REPRESENTATIVES CERTAINLY SANK TO THE OCCASION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It won't go down in history as Congress' finest hour _ or as
Congress' finest 12 hours, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was unreasonable to expect that someone, anyone, would
rise to the occasion when the House Judiciary Committee convened to
wrestle with the idea of impeaching the president of the United
States. Today's poisonously partisan political climate rarely lends
itself to statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment of a president is serious business, perhaps the most
serious business Congress can deal with outside of a declaration of
war. But the 37 members of the Judiciary Committee treated last
Thursday's all-day-and-into-the-night impeachment hearing as if it
were just another day at the office, turning the earth-shaking
matter of presidential impeachment into little more than a routine
exhibition of petty politics.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats bickered, sniped, whined and
generally conducted themselves with less professionalism than you'd
encounter at a contentious meeting of a small-town school board.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a modicum of dignity and decorum amid all this, it
was provided by independent counsel Ken Starr, whose dual role as
star witness and chief accuser drove committee Democrats to
distraction and drove Starr's own ethics adviser to resignation on
the morning after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Dash, who was chief counsel to Senate Democrats in the
Watergate hearings 25 years ago, had counseled Starr to decline the
Judiciary Committee's invitation to testify. Starr testified
anyway, in defiance of Dash's view that it was improper for an
independent counsel to act as an advocate for impeachment in a
congressional proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical or not, Starr's two-hour opening statement effectively
laid out the case against President Clinton: perjury, obstruction
of justice, abuse of power. Starr quietly and dispassionately
detailed the evidence that, in his view, suggests a pattern of
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats didn't even make a run at disputing Starr's
allegations of presidential wrongdoing in connection with the
Monica Lewinsky scandal. Instead, they set out to discredit Starr
with accusations of conflict of interest and improper investigative
methods.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats would fire questions at Starr and then interrupt
his answers, apparently in hopes of eliciting inaccurate testimony
or of getting him so flustered that he would lose his composure.
</P>
<P>
   Starr kept his cool, even late in the evening when presidential
lawyer David Kendall grilled him about media leaks by the
independent counsel's office and alleged mistreatment of witnesses
by Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Democrats barely bothered to ask Starr any
questions, opting instead for self-indulgent tirades about his
persecution of the poor ol' president.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were no better. Not one member of the majority
transcended the partisan pettiness to make thoughtful inquiries
about the evidence presented by Starr. The Republicans devoted
their time to gratuitous speeches about the terrible treatment the
independent counsel has suffered at the hands of his detractors,
and to asking obsequious questions that Starr could answer in a
word: ``Absolutely!''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the hearing was a pathetic display by a group of
pathetically misguided politicians. Some of these committee members
are constantly babbling about their constitutional
responsibilities, but when given a chance to fulfill those
responsibilities, they behaved like nitwits who don't know the
Constitution from Constitution Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr was finally sent home and committee members no longer
had the independent counsel to kick around or fawn over, they
descended into a round of mindless wrangling about the ground rules
for an executive session.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the rest of us, the majority eventually imposed
its will. The room was cleared, the TV cameras were shut off, and
the American people were allowed to turn their attention to the far
more intelligent escapades of Jay Leno and David Letterman.

MUST SMALL-SCREEN BEAUTIES BE SO SMALL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a little late, but I'm finally reporting for duty as a
Calista Flockhart weight-watcher. It has been one of those
situations in which you wait for signs, but none comes. You wait
for inspiration, but feel zip. You figure: It's her life. Let the
woman be.
</P>
<P>
   But finally, there was this intriguing cinematic happenstance:
Calista Flockhart portraying a bulimic sufferer. How odd. How
eerie.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, HBO rebroadcast an episode of its splendid
``Lifestories'' series. These short films told stories simply but
forcefully, and were often written and executed with both emotion
and intelligence (unlike network fare).
</P>
<P>
   In the film, first aired in 1992, Flockhart plays Mary-Margaret,
a high-school senior obsessed with her weight. She hits the gym as
hard as she hits the bathroom to throw up. Mary-Margaret seeks
``help'' after her parents learn of her disorder, but she's smart
enough to fool them, her doctors, even her psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors are the enemy. So is anyone who refuses to see her as
normal.
</P>
<P>
   In college, she meets a young woman just like her. ``She
understands me,'' she says in voice-over. They are shown jogging
hard each morning and evening, eating until they're full, and then
throwing the stuff up. Their bodies are paper-thin, their eyes and
cheeks sunken, their spirits defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 85 pounds,'' the friend tells Mary-Margaret. ``For the
first time I actually feel thin.'' But that isn't enough. She wants
to lose more. More? In the next scene, the girl is dead. She has
starved herself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone watching ``Lifestories: The Secret Life of Mary-Margaret:
Portrait of a Bulimic'' should come away with a stomachache. How a
young person could literally starve herself is beyond comprehension
for most of us. But the movie makes clear the motivations. We see
thin and pretty. They see fat and ugly. Inner demons are at work
here.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Gold, who left ``Growing Pains'' after fighting anorexia,
denied early rumors that she was troubled. ``It takes over your
life because it takes over your mind,'' she said during an
interview. ``You deny it because you don't even want it to be true.
It was.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked why. ``It's a lot of things,'' Tracey said. ``Pressure
to be thin. Pressure to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood runs on perfection. Outward perfection. Thin
perfection. Female perfection. Teeny-weeny is the standard for
female beauty, even though men can be anything, from Dylan
McDermott gorgeous to Sammo Hung chubby.
</P>
<P>
   The billion-dollar industries based on diets, cosmetics,
cosmetic surgery, fashion and pornography play powerful roles in
creating this kind of mean hallucination. So does the mass media,
with advertising-dominated women's magazines the worst culprits.
</P>
<P>
   But we move on, dismissing the facts: That every year, thousands
of women die of anorexia and bulimia, and many others undergo ugly
mutilations such as stomach tucks, breast implants, liposuction.
Nowhere is this more extensive than in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart may or may not suffer from an eating disorder, but I
wonder how much she has bought into Hollywood's beauty myth, the
perception that the smaller you are, the better you look.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder the same about the others who hover on the line of
so-skinny-she-looks-disgusting. Courteney Cox of ``Friends.'' Helen
Hunt of ``Mad About You.'' Teri Hatcher, formerly of ``Lois and
Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.'' Lara Flynn Boyle of ``The
Practice.'' The list is long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't you starve yourself, if you're convinced that the
best way to an acting job is to weigh 90 pounds?'' asked Camryn
Manheim of ``The Practice,'' one of the few large-sized actresses
with regular, pivotal roles. ``It's pervasive and almost impossible
to counteract. Where some people see anorexia, many others see
picture-perfect. And that's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. A couple months back, ``Today's'' Katie Couric
followed up a Jill Rappaport story on the NBC sitcom ``Friends'' by
referring to Cox's waiflike body as ``skinny'' and adding that
``someone needs to feed her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But she looks incredible,'' was Rappaport's response.
</P>
<P>
   Couric, again: ``But she's so thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport: ``But she looks incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Mary-Margaret, I bet.

<P>
   You've got kids, and 'tis the season to be shopping. And
shopping and shopping. The high season of holiday bingeing begins
Friday, as throngs of sweaty shoppers separate themselves from some
hard-earned cash. If this kind of action appeals to you, get thee
to a mall.
</P>
<P>
   If not, just pick up the phone. Catalogs for cool kid stuff
abound, and your next purchase is just a 1-800 number away. Here
are six great places to start.

<P>
   CREATIVE KIDSTUFF
</P>
<P>
   What began as a packed-to-the-ceiling toy store in Minneapolis
in 1982 has grown over the years into a small Minnesota-based
chain. Then two years ago, Creative Kidstuff launched its own
fun-to-read catalog featuring the same off-the-wall and
often-educational products that line the stores' shelves. Great
baby bounty includes Dot the Dog Rocker, a softer-than-a-blankie
alternative to the traditional rocking horse for toddlers ($60),
and a Happy Sounds Ball, which hits the ground with 17 cartoonlike
sounds _ Ding! Kaching! Boing! Gachew! ($17). Older kids will like
the Bungee Jumper ($20) and the Wobbler, a heavy-duty plastic
gadget that you stand on, using your body weight to weave balls
through a bull's-eye maze. The BoBo ball is a colorful curlicue of
tricot ``feel-good'' fabric that's springy and squishy and makes a
nice rattly noise that kids 6 months and up will like ($15). Call
(800)353-0710.

</P>
<P>
   EDUTAINMENT CATALOG
</P>
<P>
   This 5-year-old source for computer software beefed up its
catalog this fall with toy, book and video offerings such as the
Blue's Clues game ($12.95), the Smithsonian Mega Science Lab
($27.95) and the GeoSafari Talking Globe ($99.95). The bulk of the
catalog, though, is still software, and this is a good place to
find popular, quality titles for fairly reasonable prices. Old
faves include The Learning Company's Spellbound and Midnight Rescue
($29.95, the pair) and Reader Rabbit's Preschool ($29.95). New this
year: Madeline Rainy Day Activities by Creative Wonders ($19.95),
the Rugrats Movie Activity Challenge by Broderbund ($29.95) and
Disney's GameBreak! The Lion King II: Simba's Pride ($34.95). For
last-minute shoppers, guaranteed overnight delivery is available
for orders placed by 3 p.m. Dec. 21. Call (800)338-3844.

   TOYS TO GROW ON
</P>
<P>
   The no-nonsense guarantee of this company is that if you have a
problem, their employees won't rest until it's solved. Chances are,
though, that they're getting plenty of shut-eye. The toys I've
ordered from this catalog over the years are quality creations that
my kids still play with. Really. Little girls will love the Fairy
Princess Dress-Ups trunk, containing everything from a sparkling
tiara to shimmering wings ($34.95) and the Little Pony Fantasy
Castle ($39.95). Other great gifts include the Jungle Adventures
Playset (including mountain rocks and more than 20 animals;
$29.95), the Bug Box (90-plus plastic critters; $19.95) and a Make
Your Own Menorah kit ($24.95). Lizard pens come in a set of six for
$7.95. Dial up (800)542-8338 to get 'em.

FILM: ``Very Bad Things'' &QL; 
RATING: 1 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: Peter Berg &QL; 
FEATURING: Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz &QL; 
LENGTH: 106 min. &QL; 
RATED: R &QL;
</P>

   _
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old boys are likely to be highly impressed by ``Very
Bad Things,'' although, if you are 12, you've probably already seen
much funnier episodes of ``South Park.'' For the rest of us, this
story of a bachelor party that goes wrong is too loud and familiar.
Jon Favreau, groom-to-be of Cameron Diaz, lets himself get talked
into a last hurrah with his pals. They take a Vegas road trip, led
by the self-satisfied Christian Slater. The group also includes
Jeremy Piven and Daniel Stern as a pair of squabbling brothers.
</P>
<P>
   When Piven accidentally kills a hooker, and then Slater
intentionally kills the hotel security man who stumbles onto the
crime scene, more shouting takes place. The fellas conspire to hide
the corpses, which leads to a bigger and badder series of
incidents. As there's nothing fresh about this _ immorality was the
foundation of ``Animal House'' 20 years ago _ ``Very Bad Things''
is sad and dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things'' is rated R for adult language, sexuality,
nudity, violence and drug use.

INFO BOX: &QL; 
FILM: ``A Bug's Life'' &QL; 
RATING: 4 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTORS: John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton &QL; 
FEATURING: Voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus &QL; 
LENGTH: 92 min. &QL; 
RATED: G &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' startles with its visual realization, but it
also goes for something more. ``Bug's Life'' is up to the energetic
and breathless lunacy of the great '30s Warner Bros. cartoons. It's
not only an animation achievement, it's one of the year's best
comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Like the best comedies, it has a hapless straight man, Flik
(voiced by Dave Foley). Flik is an awkward but ambitious ant who
wants to fit in at the ant colony. The ants are slaving to deliver
tribute _ food _ to a dangerous pack of grasshoppers led by the
majestically arbitrary Hopper (voiced with loving menace by Kevin
Spacey). When Flik fouls up the tribute gathering, he ventures
forth to bring home a group of circus entertainers who are
horrified to find out they're supposed to defend the colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bug's Life'' gives each bug a distinct look and gives us a
sense of characterization, unlike ``Antz,'' which was so starstruck
that it thought just employing movie star voices was enough; nobody
got around to writing anything new for its superstars to do. ``A
Bug's Life'' is so full of comedy that its best jokes aren't all
given away in the trailer.

FILM: ``Home Fries'' &QL; 
RATING: 4 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: Dean Parisot &QL; 
FEATURING: Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson &QL; 
LENGTH: 92 min. &QL; 
RATED: PG-13 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a movie includes a first date that takes place at a Lamaze
class, you know you're in for something unusual. ``Home Fries'' has
a lovely romantic swooniness and the kind of comedic complexity
that isn't easily described.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' follows brothers Dorian (Luke Wilson) and Angus
(Jake Busey), and their relationship with their manipulative mother
(Catherine O'Hara). Dorian and Angus used a Cobra helicopter to
frighten their stepfather, Henry, to death. Now Mama wants them to
kill Sally (Drew Barrymore), who is carrying Henry's baby. But
Dorian gets to know Barrymore, and the unlikeliest of romances
starts to bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore manages a dewy independence; she seems both fresh and
formidable. And ``Home Fries'' has a courtliness that makes its
rapid spins and leaps funnier. Who'd have guessed that the best
time for movie comedy would be now, instead of the summer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' is rated PG-13 for mild violence, adult language
and adult situations, such as the Lamaze class.

FILM: ``Ringmaster'' &QL; 
RATING:11/2 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: Neil Abramson &QL; 
FEATURING: Jerry Springer &QL; 
LENGTH: 90 minutes &QL; 
RATED: R &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his big-screen starring debut, talk-show ringleader Jerry
Springer makes a sad attempt to defend his real-life personal freak
show.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on a trailer-park clan headed by Connie Zorzak
(Molly Hagan), a struggling young mom who works at the local
doughnut hut and tries to find a job for her shiftless husband
(Michael Dudikoff) as well as keep him off her sleazy daughter
Angel (Jaime Pressly). After catching the two in a compromising
position, she seduces her daughter's fiance and then lands the
whole lot of them on the fictitious ``Jerry Show.'' Springer,
meanwhile, tries to remain above it all _ there are so many
cutaways to him rubbing his head and looking perplexed, you start
thinking he might have a brain tumor. In the end, no one learns
anything and Jerry continues on as the deity of the dimwit set.
Talk about art imitating life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ringmaster'' is rated R for profanity, adult subject matter,
rude humor, sexual situations and Jerry Springer singing.

FILM: ``Babe: Pig in the City'' &QL; 
RATING: 3 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: George Miller &QL; 
FEATURING: Magda Szubanski, voice of E.G. Daily; narrated by Roscoe
Lee Browne &QL; 
LENGTH: 96 min. &QL; 
RATED: G &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This follow-up to the 1995 talking-pig movie deserves credit for
giving us a new story, rather than simply rehashing the original.
But it's missing the element of surprise that the first had, as
well as the relationship between Babe and Farmer Hoggett (James
Cromwell), whom the sequel reduces to a glorified cameo.
</P>
<P>
   The action gets going when Hoggett falls down a well, resulting
in injuries that keep him from running the farm. So Mrs. Hoggett
(Magda Szubanski) brings Babe to a sort of everycity where she can
enter him in a moneymaking, farm-saving contest. Madcap antics
ensue. Despite being so busy, the movie is rather quiet and
slow-paced. The cast menagerie ranges from cute to adorable.
Fittingly, it works best when it abandons its humans and lets its
animals rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' is rated G. It includes some slapstick
violence and a mild swear word or two.

FILM: ``Very Bad Things'' &QL; 
RATING: 1 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: Peter Berg &QL; 
FEATURING: Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz &QL; 
LENGTH: 106 min. &QL; 
RATED: R &QL;

<P>
   Twelve-year-old boys are likely to be highly impressed by ``Very
Bad Things,'' although, if you are 12, you've probably already seen
much funnier episodes of ``South Park.'' For the rest of us, this
story of a bachelor party that goes wrong is too loud and familiar.
Jon Favreau, groom-to-be of Cameron Diaz, lets himself get talked
into a last hurrah with his pals. They take a Vegas road trip, led
by the self-satisfied Christian Slater. The group also includes
Jeremy Piven and Daniel Stern as a pair of squabbling brothers.
</P>
<P>
   When Piven accidentally kills a hooker, and then Slater
intentionally kills the hotel security man who stumbles onto the
crime scene, more shouting takes place. The fellas conspire to hide
the corpses, which leads to a bigger and badder series of
incidents. As there's nothing fresh about this _ immorality was the
foundation of ``Animal House'' 20 years ago _ ``Very Bad Things''
is sad and dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things'' is rated R for adult language, sexuality,
nudity, violence and drug use.

INFO BOX: &QL; 
FILM: ``A Bug's Life'' &QL; 
RATING: 4 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTORS: John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton &QL; 
FEATURING: Voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus &QL; 
LENGTH: 92 min. &QL; 
RATED: G &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' startles with its visual realization, but it
also goes for something more. ``Bug's Life'' is up to the energetic
and breathless lunacy of the great '30s Warner Bros. cartoons. It's
not only an animation achievement, it's one of the year's best
comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Like the best comedies, it has a hapless straight man, Flik
(voiced by Dave Foley). Flik is an awkward but ambitious ant who
wants to fit in at the ant colony. The ants are slaving to deliver
tribute _ food _ to a dangerous pack of grasshoppers led by the
majestically arbitrary Hopper (voiced with loving menace by Kevin
Spacey). When Flik fouls up the tribute gathering, he ventures
forth to bring home a group of circus entertainers who are
horrified to find out they're supposed to defend the colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bug's Life'' gives each bug a distinct look and gives us a
sense of characterization, unlike ``Antz,'' which was so starstruck
that it thought just employing movie star voices was enough; nobody
got around to writing anything new for its superstars to do. ``A
Bug's Life'' is so full of comedy that its best jokes aren't all
given away in the trailer.

INFO BOX: &QL; 
FILM: ``Home Fries'' &QL; 
RATING: 4 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: Dean Parisot &QL; 
FEATURING: Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson &QL; 
LENGTH: 92 min. &QL; 
RATED: PG-13 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a movie includes a first date that takes place at a Lamaze
class, you know you're in for something unusual. ``Home Fries'' has
a lovely romantic swooniness and the kind of comedic complexity
that isn't easily described.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' follows brothers Dorian (Luke Wilson) and Angus
(Jake Busey), and their relationship with their manipulative mother
(Catherine O'Hara). Dorian and Angus used a Cobra helicopter to
frighten their stepfather, Henry, to death. Now Mama wants them to
kill Sally (Drew Barrymore), who is carrying Henry's baby. But
Dorian gets to know Barrymore, and the unlikeliest of romances
starts to bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore manages a dewy independence; she seems both fresh and
formidable. And ``Home Fries'' has a courtliness that makes its
rapid spins and leaps funnier. Who'd have guessed that the best
time for movie comedy would be now, instead of the summer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' is rated PG-13 for mild violence, adult language
and adult situations, such as the Lamaze class.

FILM: ``Ringmaster'' &QL; 
RATING:11/2 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: Neil Abramson &QL; 
FEATURING: Jerry Springer &QL; 
LENGTH: 90 minutes &QL; 
RATED: R &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his big-screen starring debut, talk-show ringleader Jerry
Springer makes a sad attempt to defend his real-life personal freak
show.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on a trailer-park clan headed by Connie Zorzak
(Molly Hagan), a struggling young mom who works at the local
doughnut hut and tries to find a job for her shiftless husband
(Michael Dudikoff) as well as keep him off her sleazy daughter
Angel (Jaime Pressly). After catching the two in a compromising
position, she seduces her daughter's fiance and then lands the
whole lot of them on the fictitious ``Jerry Show.'' Springer,
meanwhile, tries to remain above it all _ there are so many
cutaways to him rubbing his head and looking perplexed, you start
thinking he might have a brain tumor. In the end, no one learns
anything and Jerry continues on as the deity of the dimwit set.
Talk about art imitating life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ringmaster'' is rated R for profanity, adult subject matter,
rude humor, sexual situations and Jerry Springer singing.
</P>

INFO BOX: &QL; 
FILM: ``Babe: Pig in the City'' &QL; 
RATING: 3 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: George Miller &QL; 
FEATURING: Magda Szubanski, voice of E.G. Daily; narrated by Roscoe
Lee Browne &QL; 
LENGTH: 96 min. &QL; 
RATED: G &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This follow-up to the 1995 talking-pig movie deserves credit for
giving us a new story, rather than simply rehashing the original.
But it's missing the element of surprise that the first had, as
well as the relationship between Babe and Farmer Hoggett (James
Cromwell), whom the sequel reduces to a glorified cameo.
</P>
<P>
   The action gets going when Hoggett falls down a well, resulting
in injuries that keep him from running the farm. So Mrs. Hoggett
(Magda Szubanski) brings Babe to a sort of everycity where she can
enter him in a moneymaking, farm-saving contest. Madcap antics
ensue. Despite being so busy, the movie is rather quiet and
slow-paced. The cast menagerie ranges from cute to adorable.
Fittingly, it works best when it abandons its humans and lets its
animals rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' is rated G. It includes some slapstick
violence and a mild swear word or two.

By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got kids, and 'tis the season to be shopping. And
shopping and shopping. The high season of holiday bingeing begins
Friday, as throngs of sweaty shoppers separate themselves from some
hard-earned cash. If this kind of action appeals to you, get thee
to a mall.
</P>
<P>
   If not, just pick up the phone. Catalogs for cool kid stuff
abound, and your next purchase is just a 1-800 number away. Here
are six great places to start.

</P>
<P>
   CREATIVE KIDSTUFF
</P>
<P>
   What began as a packed-to-the-ceiling toy store in Minneapolis
in 1982 has grown over the years into a small Minnesota-based
chain. Then two years ago, Creative Kidstuff launched its own
fun-to-read catalog featuring the same off-the-wall and
often-educational products that line the stores' shelves. Great
baby bounty includes Dot the Dog Rocker, a softer-than-a-blankie
alternative to the traditional rocking horse for toddlers ($60),
and a Happy Sounds Ball, which hits the ground with 17 cartoonlike
sounds _ Ding! Kaching! Boing! Gachew! ($17). Older kids will like
the Bungee Jumper ($20) and the Wobbler, a heavy-duty plastic
gadget that you stand on, using your body weight to weave balls
through a bull's-eye maze. The BoBo ball is a colorful curlicue of
tricot ``feel-good'' fabric that's springy and squishy and makes a
nice rattly noise that kids 6 months and up will like ($15). Call
(800)353-0710.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   EDUTAINMENT CATALOG
</P>
<P>
   This 5-year-old source for computer software beefed up its
catalog this fall with toy, book and video offerings such as the
Blue's Clues game ($12.95), the Smithsonian Mega Science Lab
($27.95) and the GeoSafari Talking Globe ($99.95). The bulk of the
catalog, though, is still software, and this is a good place to
find popular, quality titles for fairly reasonable prices. Old
faves include The Learning Company's Spellbound and Midnight Rescue
($29.95, the pair) and Reader Rabbit's Preschool ($29.95). New this
year: Madeline Rainy Day Activities by Creative Wonders ($19.95),
the Rugrats Movie Activity Challenge by Broderbund ($29.95) and
Disney's GameBreak! The Lion King II: Simba's Pride ($34.95). For
last-minute shoppers, guaranteed overnight delivery is available
for orders placed by 3 p.m. Dec. 21. Call (800)338-3844.

   TOYS TO GROW ON
</P>
<P>
   The no-nonsense guarantee of this company is that if you have a
problem, their employees won't rest until it's solved. Chances are,
though, that they're getting plenty of shut-eye. The toys I've
ordered from this catalog over the years are quality creations that
my kids still play with. Really. Little girls will love the Fairy
Princess Dress-Ups trunk, containing everything from a sparkling
tiara to shimmering wings ($34.95) and the Little Pony Fantasy
Castle ($39.95). Other great gifts include the Jungle Adventures
Playset (including mountain rocks and more than 20 animals;
$29.95), the Bug Box (90-plus plastic critters; $19.95) and a Make
Your Own Menorah kit ($24.95). Lizard pens come in a set of six for
$7.95. Dial up (800)542-8338 to get 'em.

MUST SMALL-SCREEN BEAUTIES BE SO SMALL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a little late, but I'm finally reporting for duty as a
Calista Flockhart weight-watcher. It has been one of those
situations in which you wait for signs, but none comes. You wait
for inspiration, but feel zip. You figure: It's her life. Let the
woman be.
</P>
<P>
   But finally, there was this intriguing cinematic happenstance:
Calista Flockhart portraying a bulimic sufferer. How odd. How
eerie.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, HBO rebroadcast an episode of its splendid
``Lifestories'' series. These short films told stories simply but
forcefully, and were often written and executed with both emotion
and intelligence (unlike network fare).
</P>
<P>
   In the film, first aired in 1992, Flockhart plays Mary-Margaret,
a high-school senior obsessed with her weight. She hits the gym as
hard as she hits the bathroom to throw up. Mary-Margaret seeks
``help'' after her parents learn of her disorder, but she's smart
enough to fool them, her doctors, even her psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors are the enemy. So is anyone who refuses to see her as
normal.
</P>
<P>
   In college, she meets a young woman just like her. ``She
understands me,'' she says in voice-over. They are shown jogging
hard each morning and evening, eating until they're full, and then
throwing the stuff up. Their bodies are paper-thin, their eyes and
cheeks sunken, their spirits defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 85 pounds,'' the friend tells Mary-Margaret. ``For the
first time I actually feel thin.'' But that isn't enough. She wants
to lose more. More? In the next scene, the girl is dead. She has
starved herself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone watching ``Lifestories: The Secret Life of Mary-Margaret:
Portrait of a Bulimic'' should come away with a stomachache. How a
young person could literally starve herself is beyond comprehension
for most of us. But the movie makes clear the motivations. We see
thin and pretty. They see fat and ugly. Inner demons are at work
here.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Gold, who left ``Growing Pains'' after fighting anorexia,
denied early rumors that she was troubled. ``It takes over your
life because it takes over your mind,'' she said during an
interview. ``You deny it because you don't even want it to be true.
It was.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked why. ``It's a lot of things,'' Tracey said. ``Pressure
to be thin. Pressure to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood runs on perfection. Outward perfection. Thin
perfection. Female perfection. Teeny-weeny is the standard for
female beauty, even though men can be anything, from Dylan
McDermott gorgeous to Sammo Hung chubby.
</P>
<P>
   The billion-dollar industries based on diets, cosmetics,
cosmetic surgery, fashion and pornography play powerful roles in
creating this kind of mean hallucination. So does the mass media,
with advertising-dominated women's magazines the worst culprits.
</P>
<P>
   But we move on, dismissing the facts: That every year, thousands
of women die of anorexia and bulimia, and many others undergo ugly
mutilations such as stomach tucks, breast implants, liposuction.
Nowhere is this more extensive than in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart may or may not suffer from an eating disorder, but I
wonder how much she has bought into Hollywood's beauty myth, the
perception that the smaller you are, the better you look.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder the same about the others who hover on the line of
so-skinny-she-looks-disgusting. Courteney Cox of ``Friends.'' Helen
Hunt of ``Mad About You.'' Teri Hatcher, formerly of ``Lois and
Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.'' Lara Flynn Boyle of ``The
Practice.'' The list is long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't you starve yourself, if you're convinced that the
best way to an acting job is to weigh 90 pounds?'' asked Camryn
Manheim of ``The Practice,'' one of the few large-sized actresses
with regular, pivotal roles. ``It's pervasive and almost impossible
to counteract. Where some people see anorexia, many others see
picture-perfect. And that's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. A couple months back, ``Today's'' Katie Couric
followed up a Jill Rappaport story on the NBC sitcom ``Friends'' by
referring to Cox's waiflike body as ``skinny'' and adding that
``someone needs to feed her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But she looks incredible,'' was Rappaport's response.
</P>
<P>
   Couric, again: ``But she's so thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport: ``But she looks incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Mary-Margaret, I bet.

</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-BREAKOUT _ HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ A death row inmate escaped
early today by cutting through a fence, hiding on a prison building
roof, jumping another fence and avoiding several shots fired by a
guard. It was the first escape from Texas' death row since the
1930s. Austin is covering from Huntsville and from the Corrections
Department angle in Austin. (Ward/Rodriguez, Austin
American-Statesman) WITH GRAPHIC of how the escape took place. ETA
on both: 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-BILL-CLEMENTS _ The godfather of the Republican party has
disappeared from the political scene as the GOP reaches its apex in
Texas. We visit with former Gov. Bill Clements, the man who started
off the Republican takeover. Where is he now? (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   2STRIKES _ ATLANTA _ Despite a state law that demands mandatory
prison time for the type of crime probationer Timothy Carl Dawson
committed in 1995, a judge ordered probation. Dawson is now
suspected of killing five people _ four of them in hotel rooms. And
there are at least another 49 like him, probationers who would be
in jail but somehow have avoided the 10-year prison term demanded
by the Georgia Sentencing Reform Act, better known as the state's
``two-strikes-and-you're out'' law. ``I simply cannot understand
why any judge, who is sworn to uphold the law, won't follow it when
it's plainly written in black and white,'' said Gov. Zell Miller,
the architect of the law. (Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CONNERLY-FLA _ Florida is one of five states to which Ward
Connerly is considering bringing his message against racial
preferences. If he chooses Florida and is successful in getting
enough signatures, Florida voters could see a proposed
constitutional amendment similar to California's on the ballot in
2000. (Stapleton, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SPARROW-RESCUE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ An endangered sparrow
species in the Everglades lost a quarter of its population from
1997 to last spring, federal scientists say, despite painful
efforts to save it earlier this year by flooding marshes to the
north. (King, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMSON-INTEGRATION _ CLEMSON, S.C. _ Clemson President
Constantine ``Deno'' Curris wants to his school to hire more
minority staffers. He has established the Commission on the Status
of Black Faculty and Staff. (Riddle, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED. (FREELANCER, not for use by NYTimes News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NATURALGAS-PULLBACK _ PEACHTREE CITY, Ga. _ Peachtree City is
putting the brakes on a highly publicized three-year experiment
with natural gas-powered police cars. Police Chief Jim Murray was a
big booster of natural gas police cars back in 1995. CNN did a
segment on the Police Department fleet, and reporters from national
papers called. (Ellis, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-SLAIN _ Two elderly women have been found strangled in
their homes in the past two weeks in Columbus, Miss., where that
sort of thing just didn't happen before, residents say.
(Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-GASTANKS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ With less than a month
remaining, industry experts estimate more than one-third of
underground storage tanks in Texas do not meet federal
leak-protection standards set 10 years ago. (McGuire, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-DRIVERS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Having chewed up and spit out a
plan to rein in some older drivers, the legislative meat-grinder is
about to take another bite at a plan to curtail nighttime driving
by teens. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-DAMS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ More inspectors, more money and
more attention are needed to address the growing problem of unsafe
dams in Texas, according to a report by a state House committee.
(Haurwitz, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-KIDNAPPED _ MIAMI _ Nearly six years after the
kidnapping by Colombian rebels of three Florida-based missionaries,
whom some government officials have written off as dead, there's
fresh hope that they might still be alive. Mark Rich, Dave Mankins,
and Rick Tenenoff were kidnapped on Jan. 31, 1993, from a Panama
village near Colombia. Initially, demands for a $5 million ransom
were made, but then the rebels cut off contact, leading some to
believe the men were killed. But recently, a guerrilla defector
indicated the men are alive, and the new Colombian president has
promised help. Meanwhile, the wives and children of the three men
are on an emotional roller-coaster ride. (Emling, Cox News
Service). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-PASSAGE _ WEST BANK, Gaza _ Every Palestinian has a story
of a travel nightmare: lengthy interrogations, sneaking around
checkpoints, babies born at crossroads. Now, that begins to end as
Palestinians, flanked by Israeli soldiers to keep them on track,
get wholesale permission to travel through Israel to their lands in
The Gaza Strip and the West Bank. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). WITH
PHOTOS. MOVED.

<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   COVERDELL-BLACKS _ WASHINGTON _ The story across the South on
Nov. 3 was the record turnout of black voters that propelled
Democrats into statewide offices held by Republicans. Sen. Paul
Coverdell (R-Ga.) believes he's found an exception to that story
line: himself. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   It won't go down in history as Congress' finest hour _ or as
Congress' finest 12 hours, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was unreasonable to expect that someone, anyone, would
rise to the occasion when the House Judiciary Committee convened to
wrestle with the idea of impeaching the president of the United
States. Today's poisonously partisan political climate rarely lends
itself to statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment of a president is serious business, perhaps the most
serious business Congress can deal with outside of a declaration of
war. But the 37 members of the Judiciary Committee treated last
Thursday's all-day-and-into-the-night impeachment hearing as if it
were just another day at the office, turning the earth-shaking
matter of presidential impeachment into little more than a routine
exhibition of petty politics.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats bickered, sniped, whined and
generally conducted themselves with less professionalism than you'd
encounter at a contentious meeting of a small-town school board.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a modicum of dignity and decorum amid all this, it
was provided by independent counsel Ken Starr, whose dual role as
star witness and chief accuser drove committee Democrats to
distraction and drove Starr's own ethics adviser to resignation on
the morning after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Dash, who was chief counsel to Senate Democrats in the
Watergate hearings 25 years ago, had counseled Starr to decline the
Judiciary Committee's invitation to testify. Starr testified
anyway, in defiance of Dash's view that it was improper for an
independent counsel to act as an advocate for impeachment in a
congressional proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical or not, Starr's two-hour opening statement effectively
laid out the case against President Clinton: perjury, obstruction
of justice, abuse of power. Starr quietly and dispassionately
detailed the evidence that, in his view, suggests a pattern of
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats didn't even make a run at disputing Starr's
allegations of presidential wrongdoing in connection with the
Monica Lewinsky scandal. Instead, they set out to discredit Starr
with accusations of conflict of interest and improper investigative
methods.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats would fire questions at Starr and then interrupt
his answers, apparently in hopes of eliciting inaccurate testimony
or of getting him so flustered that he would lose his composure.
</P>
<P>
   Starr kept his cool, even late in the evening when presidential
lawyer David Kendall grilled him about media leaks by the
independent counsel's office and alleged mistreatment of witnesses
by Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Democrats barely bothered to ask Starr any
questions, opting instead for self-indulgent tirades about his
persecution of the poor ol' president.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were no better. Not one member of the majority
transcended the partisan pettiness to make thoughtful inquiries
about the evidence presented by Starr. The Republicans devoted
their time to gratuitous speeches about the terrible treatment the
independent counsel has suffered at the hands of his detractors,
and to asking obsequious questions that Starr could answer in a
word: ``Absolutely!''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the hearing was a pathetic display by a group of
pathetically misguided politicians. Some of these committee members
are constantly babbling about their constitutional
responsibilities, but when given a chance to fulfill those
responsibilities, they behaved like nitwits who don't know the
Constitution from Constitution Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr was finally sent home and committee members no longer
had the independent counsel to kick around or fawn over, they
descended into a round of mindless wrangling about the ground rules
for an executive session.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the rest of us, the majority eventually imposed
its will. The room was cleared, the TV cameras were shut off, and
the American people were allowed to turn their attention to the far
more intelligent escapades of Jay Leno and David Letterman.

FRESH BYTES: IF HOLIDAY SEASON MEANS BUYING NEW PC, THERE'S A LOT
TO DIGEST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    (ital) Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends
 &HT;    We're so glad you could attend
 &HT;    Come inside! Come inside! (endital)
 &HT;    _ Emerson, Lake &AMP; Palmer 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, it never ends.
</P>
<P>
   Computing power gets more powerful, and does so at an increasing
rate. Prices drop just as quickly. Today's technology will be
obsolete tomorrow _ and you can almost take the words ``today'' and
``tomorrow'' literally.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a Christmas-season PC shopper to do? If you're aching
to put a computer under the tree this year, how do you guarantee
that it won't be a doorstop by next Christmas _ or even this
Easter?
</P>
<P>
   First, develop the proper attitude. Realize that, no matter what
you do today, there will always be something better to buy
tomorrow. It's a fact of life about the personal computer industry.
Make peace with it rather than agonize over it.
</P>
<P>
   Second, shop smart. If you buy old technology today, it's not
going to be fresh when you set it up, much less when you try to
load the latest and greatest programs on it a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   While you don't have to spend the astronomical sums you once did
for a modern PC, buying the cheapest you can find is only going to
leave you frustrated sooner rather than later. On the other hand,
depending on how you use a personal computer, you don't have to
overspend to get a machine that will provide you several years of
service.
</P>
<P>
   As it has matured, the computer market has developed into three
main branches.
</P>
<P>
   Budget buyers are looking for a low-cost computer that will do
most of what they want, ranging from managing family finances to
doing work at home to playing games. The sub-$1,000 category of
computers _ which really includes systems up to about $1,200 _ has
been one of the hottest in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The second branch are buyers who want to do work at home,
operate a home office or want a computer for education. They may be
doing some desktop publishing, working on graphical presentation or
may need to set up a home office. They need a PC that's a bit more
powerful or sophisticated and thus a bit more expensive _ in the
$1,200-$2,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the high-end user, usually a computing
enthusiast and/or a hard-core gamer. Typically, these folks use
fancy graphics applications, play state-of-the-art games and may be
willing to pay whatever it takes for faster-than-normal Internet
access. Their systems start at about $1,800 _ and the sky's the
limit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Budget buyers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ryan, an editor with Family PC magazine, said budget
systems may be all that most home computer users need. You can
spend the minimum and still get plenty of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is to spend the minimum amount required to get a
computer that runs the software you want to run today,'' Ryan said
via e-mail. ``With the exception of 3-D games, which appeal to a
small segment of the computer-buying public, I haven't seen a
compelling application that requires more processing power than you
get in a $700 system.''
</P>
<P>
   The systems that a year ago sold for close to $2,000 or more now
cost less than $1,000. Power comes cheap nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Processor _ Shop for a system with at least a 300-megahertz
processor, which can be easily found in budget systems today. Most
300-Mhz chips in low-cost systems are going to be either Intel's
Celeron, the Advanced Micro Devices K6-2 or a Cyrix MII.
</P>
<P>
   There are two chips to avoid. The original 300-Mhz Celeron
lacked an onboard cache _ a kind of buffer that speeds up the
movement of data into and out of the chip. The latest 300-Mhz
Celeron that comes with a cache is called the 300A.
</P>
<P>
   Also, stay away from Cyrix's MediaGX chip, which robs at least 2
megabytes of system memory for use with graphics. That means if you
buy a computer with 32 MB of memory, only 30 MB is available to run
programs. Many of the super-cheap PCs that sell for as little as
$399 use this chip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memory _ Remember that the more random access memory your
computer has, the faster and smoother it will run. Thirty-two MB is
the minimum, but RAM is so inexpensive these days that
computer-makers are loading up their low-end products with 48, 64
and even 96 MB of memory.
</P>
<P>
   However, memory prices are forecast to recover in 1999, so it's
smart to get as much memory as you can afford now. It may not be
this cheap again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hard drives _ As with memory, hard drives are very inexpensive.
That makes it easy to recommend a minimum 4-gigabyte hard drive for
budget systems _ most have this size, or larger.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM drive _ Most budget PCs do not come with DVD-ROM, the
new, higher-capacity compact disk format for data and movies. That
makes your choice here easy. Look for a standard CD-ROM drive with
a maximum speed of 24X _ meaning it's 24 times faster than the
original CD-ROM drives.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modem _ Again, your choice is easy here. All computers sold
today come with a fast 56K fax modem.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these, unfortunately, are a low-cost type known as a
winmodem. With a traditional modem, the commands used to control
the device are stored on chips on the modem. But with a winmodem,
these instructions are stored as a file on the computer's hard
drive. When the PC launches the Windows operating system, the
instructions are loaded into the modem.
</P>
<P>
   Winmodems are notoriously flaky. Reading the comp.dcom.modems
news group on Usenet on the Internet, you can find dozens of cries
for help from owners of these modems. If you can find a budget PC
that does not have a winmodem, and its specifications are
acceptable, buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, however, that because the ``guts'' of a
winmodem are software-based, they can be upgraded just by applying
a software patch. If you own a winmodem that has difficulty making
or maintaining a connection to other computers, frequently check
the manufacturer's Web site for new updates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Video _ Look for a budget system that has at least 2 MB of video
memory. Most low-cost computers have at least that much, but if you
can find one with 4 MB, consider that a plus. The more video memory
on a graphics card, the more colors your PC can display at higher
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   You should also insist on a video card that can handle 3-D
graphics for games. It should be compatible with Microsoft's
DirectX graphics system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Audio _ Nearly all PCs sold today come with 16-bit, wavetable
sound (for realistic music) and a set of adequate speakers.
However, a growing trend is positional audio, which creates a 3-D
effect. Some games that support positional audio, for example, can
make sounds that seem to come from behind you. It's a neat feature
to have if you want to play games, and merely an option to consider
if you don't.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monitor _ Most budget systems don't come with a monitor, so the
category name ``sub-$1,000'' is often a misnomer. But as with PCs
themselves, the cost of monitors _ particularly smaller ones _ has
been dropping.
</P>
<P>
   You should look for at least a 15-inch monitor that has a
maximum dot pitch of .28mm. The dot pitch refers to how close the
screen's pixels _ the tiny dots that make up an image _ are to each
other. The smaller the number, the better.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to find a decent 15-inch monitor in the $200
price range.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slots and ports _ Nearly all PCs today come with Universal
Serial Bus ports, along with the traditional serial and parallel
ports. But you'll want to pay close attention to how many internal
expansion slots a budget PC includes.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion slots are used to add features to a computer. For
example, if you decide you want to buy a scanner, and you want it
to scan images quickly, you'd probably want to consider adding an
SCSI card to your computer. You'd do this by plugging the card into
one of these slots.
</P>
<P>
   There are two primary kinds of slots _ ISA and PCI. The former
is an older design, while PCI is newer and works better with the
Windows Plug &AMP; Play feature. By this time next year, ISA slots will
be a rarity _ they will be gone from most PCs sold starting in 2000
_ but for now you'll want one in your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus look for a budget computer with at least one ISA and one
PCI slot. Some budget systems have a shared slot _ you can install
an ISA or a PCI card, but not both _ and you should avoid these.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Basic home/business &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kristina Blachere, an assistant editor with Computers.com _ part
of the CNet family of technology-related Web sites _ advises home
PC buyers to think carefully about how they would use a PC. And
research is very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``When choosing which brand of PC to buy, doing research is
important,'' Blachere said via e-mail. ``Read reviews. When you're
evaluating a potential system, find out what kind of components are
going into it. You'll have to look around to find good analyses of
these products, it's worth it not to get stuck with substandard
components.''
</P>
<P>
   The single most common application used on home computers
continues to be word processing, and this hasn't changed since
people first started bringing these machines into their dens.
</P>
<P>
   Many people use their PCs either to run a home business, or to
bring work home. These kinds of machines need to be a bit more
powerful than budget systems, because work done at home often
involves graphics. These machines also get used for home education,
and multimedia-based children's software also benefits from a more
powerful system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Processor _ Consider at least a 300-350 Mhz or faster Pentium II
or Celeron processor. The K6-2 and the Cyrix MII remain
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memory _ Sixty-four MB of memory is the minimum in this
category, largely because many home-business users tend to run
three or more applications at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for a home worker to be using a word
processor, a spreadsheet, e-mail and a Web browser at the same
time. More memory makes this less painful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hard drive _ Look for a system with 4 GB to 6 GB of hard drive
space. And again, the more the better, particularly if you do work
with graphics files, which can be large.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia software also tends to take up quite a bit of space
as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modem _ A 56K fax modem remains the standard here, although
business users may want to consider a modem that will handle voice
and comes with voice-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuters may want to consider ISDN or some other form of
higher-bandwidth connection, but that remains a luxury for now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM _ As with the budget line, a 24X drive is the minimum.
DVD really doesn't come into play in this category yet _ there just
isn't the software out there to justify including it.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, this will change, particularly as more reference
works and databases are available on DVD. But for now, you can pass
without worry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Video _ For educational software and home business use, a
minimum of 4 MB of video memory is a must, particularly since a
larger monitor (see the next category) also is a good idea. With
the kinds of recommended processors in this category, you also
begin to see video cards that use Accelerated Graphics Port
connections. These are faster than PCI-based cards, and they tend
to have more memory as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Audio _ The specifications here are about the same as for a
budget system, though positional audio becomes more important if
you use educational or multimedia software.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monitor _ A 15-inch monitor also is the minimum here, but a
17-inch model is highly desirable, particularly if you do tend to
work with more than one program open at a time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slots and ports _ Expandability becomes more important for those
who use their computers for work. Look for systems with at least
two ISA and two PCI slots.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiast/gamer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Romero _ co-author of the hits Doom and Quake and
co-founder of Ion Storm, a Dallas-based game company _ doesn't
believe gamers should compromise at all when it comes to high-end
PCs. Asked via e-mail for his recommended minimum specifications,
Romero came up with the following:
</P>
<P>
   (ital) ``OK, a hard-core gamer is going to want this stuff:
</P>
<P>
   Intel Pentium II MMX 450Mhz w/512K L2 cache
</P>
<P>
   ViewSonic 21 P815 USB Hub Monitor
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs RIVA TNT 3D accelerator
</P>
<P>
   256Mb RAM
</P>
<P>
   9.1Gb Ultra-wide SCSI Hard drive, 7.5ms seek, 1mb buffer
</P>
<P>
   Adaptec 2940 Ultra-wide SCSI adapter
</P>
<P>
   Creative AWE64 value
</P>
<P>
   Logitech USB First Mouse+ wheel mouse
</P>
<P>
   Plextor Ultraplex 40max CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Mad Catz Panther XL joystick
</P>
<P>
   Databurst ISDN external modem
</P>
<P>
   BSG Intensor chair or an Altec Lansing USB speaker system
</P>
<P>
   With some extra cash, I would get a Roland SoundCanvas SC-88 Pro
and an MPU-401 card.'' (endital)
</P>
<P>
   Romero estimated this would set you back about $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most gamers don't have that kind of cash lying
around. So Romero was shown the following specs, of which he
approved:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Processor _ Insist on a 400 or 450 Mhz Pentium II chip. Although
AMD just introduced a 400 Mhz version of its K6-2, not all games
support its 3-D-graphics enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memory _ Sixty-four megabytes would be considered the absolute
minimum. Most gamers aren't multitasking when they play games, so
64 will do just fine in most cases. But more is always better, RAM
is cheap and ... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hard drive _ Games take up a huge amount of space. It's not
uncommon for a graphically intense title to grab up to 400 MB or
more off a hard drive. That's nearly half a gigabyte, and dedicated
gamers who buy many titles are going to quickly find themselves
constrained.
</P>
<P>
   That's why 6 GB to 8 GB should be the minimum. Romero mentioned
an SCSI-based hard drive, and while these are faster, they also are
very expensive. Drives that use the Ultra-DMA or EIDE standard are
just fine and are much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modem _ Romero also mentioned an ISDN modem, and gamers who play
multiplayer titles over the Internet _ or enthusiasts who can't
stand to wait for Web pages to load _ should consider ISDN if it's
available in your area.
</P>
<P>
   It won't come cheaply, though. ISDN modems generally are twice
as costly as traditional modems, and ISDN service from the phone
company is pricey, too. Southwestern Bell charges $56 a month, not
including installation fees. And most Internet service providers
also charge more for an ISDN account.
</P>
<P>
   But since cable modems are not available in most areas (Time
Warner Cable won't bring them to Houston until next spring) and
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service from the phone company is
even further off, ISDN remains a bandwidth junkie's best friend for
now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROM _ The gamer/enthusiast category is the only one in which
a DVD drive makes sense. There are already a handful of adventure
games available on DVD _ including the excellent Tex Murphy:
Overseer _ and more are on the way. However, be aware that many
DVD-ROM drives, while they are compatible with traditional CD-ROM
disks, aren't as fast as CD-only drives. That's changing as DVD
technology improves, but it will be a while before DVD-ROM drives
catch up. If you feel you need blinding CD-ROM speed, it might be
worth skipping DVD for now. A true enthusiast doesn't mind cracking
a PC's case to install something better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Video _ For gamers, a video card that supports either Silicon
Graphics' OpenGL standard, or 3Dfx's proprietary Glide technology,
is a must. The hottest games use these display schemes, as well as
Microsoft's DirectX.
</P>
<P>
   Additional video memory is important for games as well. Advanced
video cards can use extra memory to aid in rapidly generating
incredible effects, so look for cards with at least 8 MB of video
RAM.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Audio _ Positional audio is a must for gamers. There are two
standards _ one from Aureal, A3D, and the other from Creative Labs,
Environmental Audio. More games currently support A3D, but Creative
Labs is gaining, largely on the basis of its popular SoundBlaster
line of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Game-players also will want a set of speakers with a subwoofer,
a large bass speaker that usually is placed on the floor. Or, for
the ultimate in audio immersion, consider Romero's suggestion for
the BSG Intensor, a chair with speakers built into the base and
back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monitor _ Because gamers want their experiences to be immersive,
a bigger monitor puts you in the middle of the action. A 17-inch
monitor is the minimum. But with the cost of 19-inch monitors now
where 17-inch models were last year, they are worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slots and ports _ Gamers may want to add a special 3-D-only card
to their current graphics card, such as one that uses 3Dfx
Interactive's Voodoo or Voodoo2 chips. And enthusiasts may want to
add an SCSI card, or a video-capture card. For those reasons,
you'll want two ISA and three free PCI slots.
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in home video editing, consider a PC that
has a IEEE 1394 connector _ also known as FireWire or ILink,
depending on the PC maker _ which can be used to connect consumer
electronics devices, including some video cameras. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
`KILLER APP' APT TO BE NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Nowadays I see many computer ads mention ``killer
applications'' and ``killer utilities.'' What exactly are they?
</P>
<P>
   A. Time for a quick lesson in computer industry jargon and hype.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, ``killer app'' meant an application that validated a
particular category or product. The original killer app was
considered to be Lotus 1-2-3, because it made the IBM-compatible
personal computer a must-have item in business.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the World Wide Web has been called the killer app
for the Internet, making it essential. And the Internet itself has
been called a killer app, validating the concept of computer
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Some predicted killer apps don't make it. Desktop
videoconferencing was once called a killer app, but its widespread
use has not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   And some killer apps come and go. Remember when CD-ROM-based
multimedia was all the rage? While CD-ROMs are now the primary way
software is distributed, the Internet instead has become the
primary way to deliver information that includes text, images and
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``killer app'' is largely misused. Any well-done computer
program is dubbed a killer app. But real ones come along only
occasionally, and they cause a fundamental shift in the way people
use a technology.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently bought a new printer and installed the software
that came with it. That was easy _ I just put the CD into the
CD-ROM drive and it started automatically (I have Windows 98). But
now, the printer maker has sent me a floppy disk with an updated
driver. When I put it in the computer, it doesn't start
automatically like the CD did. And I don't really understand the
limited directions on the floppy's label. How do I get this driver
in my computer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Put the floppy in the drive on the computer, then open the My
Computer icon on your desktop, followed by the floppy drive icon.
If you see a program there called SETUP.EXE, double- or
single-click on it _ depending on how you have Windows 98 set up _
to launch it.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't see that file, then go back to My Computer and open
the Printers folder. You'll see the current driver there _
right-click on it, and choose Properties. Click on the details tab,
and one of the buttons on that screen will be New Driver ... Click
that button.
</P>
<P>
   A box called Select Device will pop up. Click the Have Disk
button and the system will find the floppy and begin the
installation process.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Time to replace the old computer, and I have enough cash to
get a really nice one. I am tempted to get one of these new
flat-panel monitors, but I'd like to hear the pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the biggest pros is the crisp, bright, easy-to-look-at
screen. Flat-panel monitors, which are like the quality,
active-matrix screens found on notebook computers, don't suffer
from flicker as do traditional monitors. They also take up less
space because they are so thin.
</P>
<P>
   But there are negatives, the first being cost. The cheapest ones
run at least twice what a traditional monitor of the same size
would cost.
</P>
<P>
   They wash out as you view them from the side, so you usually
must be directly in line with the screen for a good look. If you
buy one of the new digital flat-panel screens, you'll also have to
get a special video card to work with it.
</P>
<P>
   They also are not as flexible when it comes to resolution.
Usually they have a ``native'' resolution _ say, 800-by-600 pixels
_ and if you go below that the screen image is shrunken or
distorted.

By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Got game? Well, if you don't, this is a good year
to get game.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 video-game consoles
are hitting the sweet spot in their life cycles, with dozens of
excellent titles available, many for as little as $20, even as the
machines' prices have dropped to $129.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more and more companies are creating compelling
titles for the personal computer, whose power and expandability
make truly eye- and ear-popping experiences possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the best year for games ever, that much is
already clear,'' said Jennifer Pahlka, director of the Game
Developers Conference. ``(PlayStation and Nintendo 64) both are
hitting the biggest installed base ever.''
</P>
<P>
   And we're talking big indeed. Industry estimates say Americans
will spend more than $6.3 billion this year on video games, a
record total that outstrips the domestic gross at movie box
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Seema Williams, an analyst who follows the video-game industry
for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said part of what is
driving the great year is that the slow-starting N64 console now
has enough distinctive games that take advantage of its better
graphics abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nintendo is finally coming into its own,'' Williams said.
``The No. 1 complaint for several years has been that there were
not enough N64 games. For the first time, they're on fairly
reasonable footing in terms of hot games.'' &QL; 
MORE POWER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   N64 is newer and more powerful, with better graphics
capabilities that will be further augmented by this week's release
of the !bold!Expansion Pak!off!, which doubles a console's memory,
allowing it to display more and smarter enemies, in better-looking
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo games have always appealed to a younger audience, with
sweeter characters and gore-free situations. That's still largely
the case, but games like the new ``Star Wars''-based title, Rogue
Squadron, and the dinosaur-hunting Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, will
provide a broader range of choices.
</P>
<P>
   But the season's hottest game, on any platform, likely will be
N64's The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. Crafted by gaming
legend Shigeru Miyamoto _ also responsible for such huge-selling
franchises as Donkey Kong and Mario Brothers _ this Zelda title has
already been dubbed the ``game of the century'' by Next Generation
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zelda'' was released this week, and Nintendo company
spokespeople say they've had more than 400,000 preorders and expect
to sell more than 2.5 million copies by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other titles supporting that, but if you're looking
at one premier flagship title, it has to be Zelda,'' said
Nintendo's Beth Llewelyn. ``People have described it like walking
into the middle of your favorite book or movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the game for the holiday season,'' Williams said. ``The
first shipment is sold out, and some people will be lucky to get
one for the holidays. I don't hear enough buzz about a similar
title for the PlayStation to give it a similar pickup in sales.'' &QL; 
LOTS OF TITLES &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say there aren't plenty of choices on the
3-year-old PlayStation machine. Roughly 500 PSX games are available
in the United States, and the mix of titles is changing, said Sony
Computer Entertainment America spokeswoman Molly Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The PlayStation has always had plenty of titles that appeal to
the twitchy, gore-minded older teens in the household. Now it
finally is getting games anyone can play, including Spyro the
Dragon, Crash Bandicoot: Warped, and upcoming titles based on the
animated movies ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Those help fill out a bulging portfolio that includes such
much-awaited new releases as Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider III,
Twisted Metal III, Madden '99 and NFL Gameday '99!off!.
</P>
<P>
   ``PlayStation is the leader in the industry, with more than 12.5
million units installed,'' said Smith. ``The best reason people are
going to buy it is purely for the entertainment experience that our
system offers that no one else can offer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the computer side, the arrival of Apple Computer's iMac is
starting to make the Mac gaming market more attractive finally,
Williams said. With about 500,000 of the low-cost, slickly
designed, simple-to-set-up machines expected to be sold by year's
end, ``some of those (gaming) companies will be looking to move
their titles over to this mass market,'' Williams said. ``It's
low-hanging fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   But hyped-up IBM-compatible PCs loaded with two fast graphics
accelerator cards, screaming processors, big screens, high-end
stereo sound and joystick controllers remain the machine of the
gaming ubergeek.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pry those guys off their PCs,'' Williams said. &QL; 
BEYOND THE NERDS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the housewife in Pacoima who enjoys simpler
gaming pleasures, the PC game market is diversifying, moving away
from a hard-core audience of twitchy teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is now convinced there are people who are casual
gamers who will go out and buy different games, like !bold!Deer
Hunter, Barbie Nail Designer, You Don't Know Jack!off!, and Parappa
the Rapper, Pahlka said. ``This is somebody who's not going to
spend 20 hours a week playing a game. They want to play an
entertaining game for maybe a shorter period.''
</P>
<P>
   So increasingly there are trivia games, hunting games, digital
versions of board games and TV game shows, music games, games that
combine education and entertainment, games that allow you to create
something on the computer and print it out and assemble it.
</P>
<P>
   And next year, everything will change again, in part because of
Sega's Dreamcast console, being unveiled today in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A strange and powerful hybrid that includes a built-in 33.6 Kbps
modem, a tiny personal digital assistant that plugs into the
Nintendo-like bat-shaped game controller, and a high-performance
processor tweaked to provide graphics performance as much as four
times better than a Pentium II computer.
</P>
<P>
   A Sega spokeswoman said the machine is expected to debut in the
United States next fall, accompanied initially by 12 to 15 titles.
Its arrival will begin the eclipse of the PlayStation and N64,
though both platforms should be sources of enjoyable games for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The two warring consoles remain the best gaming alternative for
many families, especially in households where access to a PC is
nonexistent or limited. Some families may wait until Dreamcast
debuts next year, but the cheap prices and broad selection of this
generation of consoles likely will be hard to resist for many.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't resist, what does Williams recommend? The N64, with
its newer technology and superior performance, will probably have
more interesting titles in the next couple of years. But the better
approach depends on what your family wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go stand in a software aisle and see which game your kid
points to,'' Williams said. ``It always has to be a software buy.
Because the prices aren't that different, go for (the console that
runs) the software your kid wants.'' &QL;

A FEW PCS MANAGE TO TRANSCEND GENERIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a simple truth: For the most part, consumer PCs are
pretty much alike. The very thing that makes systems compatible
with each other _ accepted industry standards _ also renders them
generic.
</P>
<P>
   That puts computer vendors in a tough position. How do they
differentiate their boxes from their competition, and still compete
in price? Some do it with color, others with design, some with
bells and whistles and others by giving specific models a certain
niche.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two consumer desktop PCs that stand out from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aptiva SE7 _ $2,200, IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The original Aptiva S series, introduced almost two years ago,
was known for three things _ its jet-black styling, its pizza-box
drive module and its astronomical price. IBM has kept only one of
those three features _ the color. The SE7 is more in line with
high-end PC pricing, and no longer has the drive module.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo for the former, boo-hiss for the latter. I really liked
the pizza box, which allowed you to place the Aptiva's mini-tower
under a desk while still providing desktop access to the floppy and
CD-ROM drives. In the SE7, those drives are back in the mini-tower.
</P>
<P>
   The SE7 comes with a 450-megahertz Intel Pentium II chip, a
whopping 16.8-gigabyte hard drive, 128 megabytes of memory, a
DVD-ROM drive, a 56K voice and fax modem, an ATI Rage Pro AGP
graphics card and 16-bit stereo sound.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the system with IBM's snazzy new 15-inch, flat-panel
monitor, which sells for $1,099. It, too, is jet-black, with
stylish control buttons that look like waves. As with most
flat-panel monitors, it's best to use this one in its native
resolution of 1,024-by-768 pixels. Drop down to 800-by-600, and the
text becomes blurry and images seem unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   The system comes with a set of matching speakers that look like
a pair of triangles. They have mediocre sound, fine for basic
multimedia but lacking for action games. They cry out for a
subwoofer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the SE7 is definitely not a gamer's machine, at least
not in its base configuration. It lacks positional 3-D audio, a
form of surround-sound that's becoming more and more essential for
game-playing. And the graphics card has only a paltry four
megabytes of video memory. To really unleash the system's
substantial muscle on games, I dropped in a Diamond Multimedia
Monster II add-in card, which uses 3Dfx's Voodoo2 chips.
</P>
<P>
   IBM includes a lot of user-friendly software. The SE7 comes with
ViaVoice, the company's voice-recognition software, which converts
your words into text. There also are several programs that make
diagnosing problems and investigating your PC's capabilities a
snap.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vaio Digital Studio PCV-E302DS _ $1,500, Sony Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With its new Digital Studio line, Sony is trying to link what it
does best _ personal electronics _ with personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Studio appeals to those who want to do more with
their PCs than just play games, write letters and surf the Web. If
you've been intrigued by the creative aspects of working with
different kinds of media on a computer, this machine may be for
you.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with a 350-megahertz Pentium II
processor, 64 megabytes of memory, a 10.6-gigabyte hard drive, a 5X
DVD-ROM drive, a Matrox MGA-G200 AGP video card, a 56K fax modem,
and Aureal Positional 3-D audio.
</P>
<P>
   The system arrived with a 17-inch Sony Vaio monitor with an
excellent Trinitron screen, with speakers and a subwoofer built
into the base, that sells for $600.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is one of the few available with what's known as an
IEEE-1394 connection. Sony calls this port an I-Link connection;
other companies use the name FireWire. It's primarily used for
connecting home entertainment devices, such a stereos, videocameras
and CD-ROM players.
</P>
<P>
   Sony combines this port with very simple software for video
editing. Just connect a 1394-equipped videocamera to the computer,
launch the software and grab what you've recorded on tape. You can
then use the software to pick and choose recorded segments, piecing
together a mini-movie.
</P>
<P>
   You can then plug in a CD-ROM or mini-disc recorder and transfer
the finished video, again via the 1394 port.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you have one of these recorders for mini-disks _
Sony's proprietary, tiny CD-ROM music format _ there's software on
the PC to make custom discs.
</P>
<P>
   As a computer alone, the Digital Studio is an excellent
performer, though a bit pricey. Other 350-megahertz systems can be
had for about $200 less these days. The video editing software,
which makes this PC different, is very simple; that's both its
downfall and its virtue. Once you get used to this, you'll wish it
could do more.

family? These suggestions should get you through the holiday season
and beyond. &QL; 
GEAR &QC;
</P>
<P>
   _ Apple iMac: The coolest computer in world history, and
fastest-selling in Apple's history. Its all-in-one form, brilliant
design, excellent technology and Macintosh operating system make it
a snap to set up and connect to the universe. Overcome its
downsides with a Superdrive from Imation and Virtual PC emulator
software from Connectix (about $200 total). For about $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sony DVP-S300: A good, highly rated midrange DVD player that
will give you razor-sharp pictures, great sound and lots of cool
extras. For about $400.

art and track information from the company's Web site. The ultimate
party machine. About $2,500, plus the CD changer (another $200).
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft Digital Sound System 80 computer speakers:
Terrific-sounding 80-watt speakers and subwoofer connect through
USB port or sound card. Software creates a built-in 10-band graphic
equalizer. Also sounds great with televisions, personal stereos,
even Power Macs. Around $260.
</P>
<P>
   _ Compaq 2015c hand-held computer: Windows CE 2.0-based computer
about the size of a paperback comes stuffed with goodies. Pocket
versions of Microsoft's Word, Excel, Outlook, Internet Explorer and
Powerpoint, built-in modem, PCMCIA card slot and software for your
desktop computer. About $650.
</P>
<P>
   _ Philips Nino 320: Slick-looking personal digital assistant
using Windows CE, includes voice memo ability, flash memory slot, 8
Megabytes of RAM and a great display for around $500.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbie Photo Designer Digital Camera: A terrific creative tool

drop them into preset Barbie photo frames in your computer, and
dress them up with simple editing and special-effects tools. Create
scrapbooks and digital flipbooks, even pick the music.
</P>
<P>
   _ Color Game Boy: Nintendo has sold 65 million Game Boys, and
now has finally added a color screen. Only about 15 new color
titles will be available by Christmas, but even the 500
black-and-white Game Boy titles will show up to 10 colors on the
new machines.Now that's a technological marvel. About $65.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro game controller: The
combination joystick and gamepad offers plenty of basics, but best
of all is how internal positional sensors translate your body
English into commands for a game. Cool. Comes bundled with a very
good game, Motocross Madness. Even cooler. About $75.
</P>
<P>
   _ My Design dolls: Dial up Mattel's Web site at www.Barbie.com
and order a Barbie companion doll of your own design, pick hair
color and style, name, outfit, accessories and even
``personality.'' Beware, however. With a six- to eight-week wait
for delivery, this may be best for January birthdays. Around $40.
</P>
<P>
   _ Furby: The pint-size interactive plush toy has already become
a collectible. Speaks its own language, knows when other Furbys are
in the room, and learns your speech too. About $30. &QL; 
PLAYSTATION &QC;
</P>
<P>
   _ Parasite Eve: The ``cinematic role-playing game,'' is a
gorgeously rendered and engaging sci-fi detective adventure, though
briefer than you might want. Great sound too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Xenogears: Beautifully hand-drawn animations bring alive this
sci-fi role-playing game that's one of this year's best in the
genre.
</P>
<P>
   _ Metal Gear Solid: This adventure game already is drawing high
praise and higher expectations. Early looks are impressive, so it's
likely to be a big hit. Better for older youths and adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twisted Metal III: The crazed car combat series returns for
more, with eight new battlegrounds, 12 new vehicles and numerous
new weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Apocalypse: Bruce Willis' digital doppelganger stars in this
well-done action adventure shooter set in the future. For older
teens.
</P>
<P>
   _ Street Fighter Collection 2: Capcom packaged three of its
arcade hits into a single PSX disk, so you, too, can punch out
Balrog and Vega. Definitely for older players.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tomb Raider III: Every gamer's favorite busty adventurer, Lara
Croft, returns to the screen. For teens and up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit: Drive some of the world's
fastest cars along challenging, detailed courses at excessive
speeds. You can even drive the police cars in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   _ MediEvil: A fun, tricky, goofily ghoulish 3-D
action-adventure, with odd but engaging animation and terrific
production values. Highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small Soldiers: Based on the summer movie, Archer has to free
his friends and fight Chip Hazard and his Globotech goons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Crash Bandicoot: Warped: This terrific sequel sends Crash and
his sister back in time, under and over water, along the Great Wall
and more. For a cheap alternative, the first two Crash titles can
be had for $20 each.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asteroids: The early arcade classic has received a nicely done
3-D update. Simple and fun for the nostalgic older gamer, or a
younger new one. Blasting space rocks can be so satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spyro the Dragon: A sweet-natured adventure game involving a
young dragon who must gather jewels, rescue his elders and beat the
goofy villains. Terrific for younger gamers. &QL; 
NINTENDO 64 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   _ Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time: This long-awaited and
sprawling title has already been dubbed game of the century by one
magazine. Will keep kids (and adults) entranced for weeks. Maybe
the console's best-ever title.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buck Bumble: A cyberbee must protect the hive. Great 3-D
graphics, a bug's-eye view and multiplayer matches. Tell your kin
to buzz off.
</P>
<P>
   _ F Zero X: A fluid and fast hovercraft racing game that is a
terrific demonstration of the N64's graphic capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gex 64 Enter the Gecko: A witty update of the franchise, with
dozens of gecko moves and fun spoofs of television and movie plots.
</P>
<P>
   _ Milo's AstroLanes: A futuristic and fun bowling game. Best
feature is the ability to sabotage an opponent's ball as it rolls
toward the pins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virtual Pool 64: Strikingly lifelike and feature laden. Set up
trick shots, learn the rules, play a variety of opponents and
games. Might even make you a better pool player.
</P>
<P>
   _ Body Harvest: Pitched for a much older crowd than is common on
the N64, you play a human who's sent back in time to hunt down
alien invaders before they eradicate mankind.
</P>
<P>
   _ NFL Blitz: The arcade hit, still with ``no rules, no
substitutions and nowhere to hide.'' Play all this season's games,
and even store favorite plays on a Controller Pak. &QL; 
NINTENDO GAME BOY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   _ Pokemon: A massive craze in Japan, now winning over America.
Tamagotchi times role-playing adventure times collectibles times
head-to-head competition. Comes in two versions. Get the version
your child's best friend doesn't have, and buy the linking cable so
they can swap pokemon and challenge one another.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men in Black: MIB the Series: A fun side-scroller based on the
cartoon series, not the movie. Great color graphics, but also runs
in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pitfall: Beyond the Jungle: A challenging Color Game Boy
update to the durable franchise is tough from the first swinging
vine. &QL; 
PC/MAC &QC;
</P>
<P>
   _ Trespasser: You're on an island they overlooked in cleaning
out Site B from ``The Lost World'' movie. Way too many hungry
dinosaurs want to turn you into a Jurassic bon bon. Good luck,
buddy. You'll need it.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Cameron's Titanic Explorer: This disk he did for love.
An hour of film footage evokes life on board, as do tons of photos,
1,200 pages of Senate testimony, and much, much more for the family
Titanic freak. But sorry girls, no Leo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: Flight Simulator with guns,
finally. Good game, too. Endlessly expandable and compatible with
planes from Flight Simulator 5.0 and 98.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy: The TV game shows come to the
PC, with plenty of stumpers for your own home's fan. I'll take a
``T'' and Presidents for $500, Vanna and Alex.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Bug's Life Adventure: Collect grain, fight off birds and bad
bugs, explore 15 levels. A good game for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dance Studio: Create your own animated music videos,
choreographing moves, mixing music, choosing performers, camera
angles, lighting and backdrops. Cool, and very different.
</P>
<P>
   _ Planetarium Gold Complete Guide to the Universe: Telescopic
views of planets and stars, a starfinder, animation of celestial
movements, screen savers, guides to constellations, an astronomical
calendar, dictionary and trivia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ultimate Family Tree Platinum: A dizzying array of functions

SHOPPING WITHOUT DROPPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So many gifts, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   As you head to the malls today, remember, you've only got 16
days until Hanukkah and 27 days left until Christmas to buy
presents for the people you love a lot, those you think of fondly,
and those who, well, your mother taught you to be nice to in spite
of your differences.
</P>
<P>
   And be ready to spend more than you did last year, reports the
American Express Financial Advisors. The group that makes a living
keeping track of how we spend money says folks across the country
will spend about $915 on gifts this year, up from $879 last year.
And for those of us on the West Coast, we'll be spending a total of
$1,522 for gifts, travel and entertaining expenses.
</P>
<P>
   To make this year's shopping expedition easier, we've already
scouted the malls, catalogs and Web sites for what's new and nifty
(and even thrifty) for everyone on your list. &QL; 
MONEY IS NO OBJECT (You have to ask?)  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry, furs and trips fall into this category _ but don't stop
there. Think of toys for big kids, like Neiman Marcus' Cracker Jack
box of caramel corn with really ritzy prizes. For her, an 18k gold
ring with a ruby or emerald, priced at $950; for him, a box with a
limited-edition pair of enameled cuff links, priced at $400.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas for big-spenders include:
</P>
<P>
   $63,700 _ Lottery winners looking for something to spend their
new-found bucks on should think about a single red rose _ made of
48 carats of rubies with 2.38 carats of diamonds. It's a
one-of-a-kind brooch by Le Vian, available at Macy's at the
Northridge Fashion Center.
</P>
<P>
   $18,000 _ If she wears St. John knit suits, how about a St. John
wristwatch? It's a hefty stainless-steel tank (the season's hottest
style), trimmed with a bunch of diamonds. The new collection also
has a sporty stainless-steel model for $450 at upscale stores such
as Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   $2,500 _ The economy is booming again, and power pens have made
a major comeback. One of the most impressive is Parker's
limited-edition silver snake design with real emerald eyes that was
first introduced in 1906. Look for it at luxury goods stores, or
call (212) 601-8344.
</P>
<P>
   $1,695 _ A tiny but incredibly precise camera like those used by
spies, the Leica Minox CLX is sold at camera and electronic stores
everywhere. Other way-cool cameras are Nikon's new Coolpix 900s
megapixel digital camera for $799, and Fujifilm's new Endeavor 1000
MRC Tiara, touted as the world's smallest 24mm Advanced Photo
System camera, for $479.95.
</P>
<P>
   $800 _ For the guy who always wanted a swanky car with an
elegant hood ornament, check out Lalique's limited-edition
Sagittarius crystal flacon that's reminiscent of a '30s hood
ornament and mounted on wood to be used as an objet d'art. The
crystal bottle, which features the torso of a man and the body of a
horse, is filled with a manly fragrance and sold at Neiman Marcus,
Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   $590 _ For the executive (or wanna-be's) desk, the
sterling-silver Bolide Office Collection at Christofle, Beverly
Hills. The set includes a small desk clock, letter opener, pencil
holder, ruler and business-card holder.
</P>
<P>
   $549 _ A mirrored, lighted curio cabinet designed to showcase
eight of her limited-edition Barbie dolls, available at J.C. Penney
stores.
</P>
<P>
   $525 _ Tommy Hilfiger's bright yellow M400 mountain bike for
pedaling off to Starbucks or cruising along the coast. It's
available at Cannondale bicycle retailers; call (800) 245-3872.
</P>
<P>
   $399 _ Gearys Beverly Hills' pewter cocktail shaker with narrow
spout and handle on a gallery tray with two martini goblets. Just
the thing for mixing a batch of Cosmopolitans at your next soiree.
</P>
<P>
   $395 _ For that next black-tie gala, give him a custom-made
tuxedo from the Lands End catalog. To order, call (800) 356-4444.
</P>
<P>
   $300 _ You couldn't afford the Gucci ``G'' watch that was so hot
last year, but Calvin Klein's new stainless-steel collection is
almost as statusy _ and way cheaper. Available at Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   $295 _ Got a global friend? He'll always know what time it is in
Los Angeles and Paris with Swiss Army's new Odyssey GMT watch,
available at department and jewelry stores.
</P>
<P>
   $250 _ You call her your angel, so give her a pair of wings.
You'll find the Christmas Angel white satin bras with real feathers
(not that fuzzy marabou stuff) at Victoria's Secret for $250;
matching bikini panty is $30.
</P>
<P>
   $199 _ Euro-wires are sooo last year. Diamond studs are the
season's ticket, available at Mervyn's stores. While you're there,
check out the matching tennis bracelet for the same price. &QL; 
SENSIBLY CHIC (Gifts under $150) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you can't afford a diamond bracelet or new car. You've
still got style when it comes to picking presents that might
include a sterling-silver bracelet with a tiny heart charm engraved
with your initials for $110 at Tiffany &AMP; Co., Beverly Hills; or the
new Jeep Home/Road Emergency Kit that comes with a three-band
radio, warning flashes and spotlight, first-aid kit, tire inflator,
lighter-to-lighter jumper and other goodies for $99.99 at
Jeep/Chrysler dealers. But read on, we've got more ideas below:
</P>
<P>
   $139 _ A classy cigar humidor in antique cherry for the guy who
is still smoking, from Bombay stores.

stapler for his desk by Casco. Available at upscale office-supply
stores and Barney's New York in Beverly Hills.

from places like Italy, Guatemala and Sumatra. To order, call (800)

checkbook cover, available at major department stores.

GIFTS FOR KIDS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Barbie is still big, and so are Hot Wheels and Tonka toys, but
the major news is toys that talk on a variety of subjects ... and
even call your kid by name. And in spite of all those
techno-advances, there's a new generation discovering the joys of
old-fashioned board games.

A FOOT IN THE MOUTH WAS NEVER SO SWEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Ever been accused of putting your foot in your
mouth?
</P>
<P>
   It's no compliment, and it usually leaves a nasty taste, huh?
</P>
<P>
   But Miz Hot Tips has discovered the right foot can taste exactly
like Ghiradelli chocolate. She's talking about Toe-Food Chocolates,
a San Francisco-based company that makes life-size (a woman's size
6{) bare feet in solid chocolate for $17.95, as well as tiny,
bite-sized feet packed in a toy missile called Mistle Toe for
$14.95, or in a bag called Mazel Toe that says ``Congratulations on
your great feat'' for $8.95.
</P>
<P>
   The edible novelties are the creation of podiatrist Mark Wolpa,
who says he designed the chocolates 15 years ago as holiday gifts
for his foot-doctor friends and patients but found they had a
broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to us, but a lot of our customers have foot
fetishes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Wolpa says he learned about it when he opened a Web site and
invited browsers to submit clever foot expressions for free
chocolate. After weeding out all the unprintable ones, he picked an
L.A. woman's entry, ``The only foot you'll have in your mouth
better than mine,'' as a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the contest and the product have a strong
toehold on this special group of chocolate foot fans, but the bulk
of his business is with professional party planners, like the one
who ordered 825 foot-shaped suckers last month for the opening of
``Footloose'' on Broadway.
</P>

<P>
   KID STUFF: Formal festivities are coming up, and the kiddos will
need to look their very best, but don't put them in those sweet
little red velveteen numbers you wore as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   Don't go there, advises Miz Hot Tips, who checked out several
stores and found that today's little darling wants to look like her
teen-age baby sitter, with marabou feathers around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   If you're opposed to those older styles, Mervyn's fashion
adviser Chris Daniel suggests a compromise, such as tea-length
dresses of velvet or taffeta in grown-up colors such as black and
purple. And for boys, how about houndstooth pants and vests with a
Mickey Mouse tie (no bow ties). If junior complains, remind him
that even Roy Disney Jr. of the super-successful Disney company
wears them. And he's way past 10 ...
</P>
<P>
   NEW SHOPS TO SHOP: Always on the prowl for new stores, Miz Hot
Tips shares her newest list. Opening today at the Oaks mall, 222 W.
Hillcrest Drive, Thousand Oaks, is Nickelodeon, a toy and clothing
store for fans of such Nickelodeon TV shows as ``Rugrats'' and
``Blue's Clues.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Beverly Center, 8500 Beverly Blvd., West Los Angeles,
there's a new store called Privilege, that carries some of the same
clothes seen on ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Friends'' and ``The Nanny.
</P>
<P>
   And in Beverly Hills, three new stores have opened in time for
holiday shopping. They are the Italian ready-to-wear store called
MaxMara at 323 N. Rodeo Drive, Marina Rinaldi for women sizes 10 to
22 at 319 Rodeo Drive, and the Bobby Jones sportswear boutique at
310 N. Beverly Drive. The latter specializes in luxury golfwear
inspired by the legendary golf icon, who is featured in film clips
shown on video monitors throughout the store.

PLAYING CATCH HAS GOTTEN TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sunday against the Denver Broncos, Oakland wide
receiver Tim Brown made his best play of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was a tackle on an interception.
</P>
<P>
   This season, many of the league's top wide receivers have turned
from game breakers into excuse makers. A combination of injuries,
bad quarterbacking and lunkhead game plans have left owners
searching for somebody _ anybody _ who can catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the receivers ranked in the top 10 before the season
can't even crack a fantasy lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Take Lions wide receiver Herman Moore. Please. Before the
Thanksgiving Day game, when he finally showed signs of life, he had
amassed a paltry 484 yards and developed a pathological fear of the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Moore has determined the reason for his lack of
production. It's everybody else's fault. He sulked with a leg
injury while Johnnie Morton and some no-names picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy who was probably the second receiver taken in
some drafts. Makes you want to do yard work.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Other top receivers who couldn't catch a ``Seinfeld'' rerun:
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis receiver Isaac Bruce has been hurt much of the year,
as has Patriots receiver Terry Glenn and Cardinals wideout Rob
Moore. Green Bay wide receiver Robert Brooks has not fully
recovered from off-season back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, of the Raiders, has been lost in Jon Gruden's offense
since Jeff George went down because of a groin pull. The most
popular target on the team seems to be tight-end Rickey Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals wide receiver Carl Pickens leads the AFC in yardage, but
has only found the end zone three times. This may have something to
do with Neil O'Donnell, who doesn't have Larry Brown to throw to in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Coslet is down to third-string Paul Justin at
quarterback. Who knows? One of the cheerleaders may be starting
before long.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a whole new crop of younger receivers is taking over.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC, Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson is finally
backing up his trash talk, grabbing eight touchdowns and ringing up
755 yards. The Colts' Marvin Harrison is also shredding opposing
secondaries, with 741 yards and seven touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, all the talk is about Minnesota rookie sensation
Randy Moss, the return of the human highlight film. Sunday against
the Packers, Moss looked like he was playing against his
12-year-old nephews in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Comparing the Packers' secondary to 12-year-olds
is an insult.
</P>
<P>
   To 12-year-olds everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So who to go with down the stretch? I wouldn't give up on
Arizona's Moore, who looks like he's finally healthy. The fact that
Jake Plummer woke up doesn't hurt Moore or teammate, Frank Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   I think Denver wide receiver Rod Smith will heat it up in the
last five games, with Ed McCaffrey slowed because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   And if your league counts defensive statistics, you might stick
with Tim Brown. He's a heck of a tack &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tip of the Week &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When basting your turkey, be sure to use natural . . . Wait a
minute, wrong tip. You've already eaten the turkey, and some of
your fantasy football turkeys already have been roasted. I'd start
every 49ers player I could get my hands on. I sense a Monday night
blowout against the Giants. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
l
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City running back Bam Morris is apparently determined to
stay out of the big house long enough to score some more
touchdowns. I'd start him this week against the Cardinals
defenders, who did a wonderful impression of turnstiles against
Washington. &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week it's Redskins quarterback Trent Green, who threw for
382 yards and four touchdowns and ran for another. This time next
year, he'll be working at Wendy's. &QL;

NEW APPRECIATION FOR ANIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you or a family member has recently become
enamored of Japanese animation, known as anime, chances are that
some odd cultural references have sailed right over your heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Anime Companion'' by Gilles Poitras (Stone Bridge Press)
aims to explain these details, with more than 500 short entries
explaining everything from Aichi province to zori thonged sandals,
along with citations from various anime movies where those details
figure in the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Poitras runs a popular Web site devoted to anime that is the
basis for this fun book that's made for browsing. Learn tidbits
about Japanese culture, food, politics and more, and see how anime
has used that.
</P>
<P>
   POETRY IN MOTION: The type hovers over the screen, first in
Portuguese then slowly dissolving into English. Pictures fade in to
view, and a poem evanesces into form, a lovely tone poem to a
magical couple of days in the tiny town of Evora, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the highlights of the just-completed California
Digital Arts Workshop, held last week at the American Film
Institute's campus in Los Feliz. The workshop brought in more than
a dozen artists with little or no experience creating online art,
taught them such basic tools as HTML and Macromedia's Flash
Generator, then turned them loose to create.
</P>
<P>
   One felicitous product is ``Evora A Doce,'' the online amalgam
of type, poetry, pictures and, soon, music put together by Northern
California poet Theresa Whitehill.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a trip Whitehill took last year with her husband,
Lisbon-born artist Paulo Ferreira, to research a magazine story
about fado, the somewhat melancholic urban folk music of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Burned out by weeks of interviews and research, Whitehill and
Ferreira went to unwind in Evora, an ancient town most notable for
a series of religious sites from vastly different eras, including a
Neolithic contemporary of Stonehenge, a shrine to the Roman goddess
Diana, and a chapel made entirely of human bones and constructed by
a Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were walking on the streets and the poem started happening,
and I was writing it down on napkins,'' Whitehill said. They went
into a tiny cafe on a side street to eat. ``We were talking about
how you can't remember a flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffused with fado and the peculiar vibe that has drawn people
for centuries to Evora, Whitehill ``took a bite of something and
started to cry. It was just incredible. (The bar owner) knew
something was happening and asked us. He said a lot of people come
in here and don't really know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't interest poetry reviews in the piece, then got a
chance to go to the workshop, where she knew the poem could be at
the center of a work of art that would be far richer.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting piece includes a couple of paintings by Ferreira,
pictures she took and more. Assuming she can get the singer's
permission, she will include some fado accompaniment as well.
</P>
<P>
   As with other workshop participants, the experience was bracing
for Whitehill, opening her eyes to the Web's artistic
possibilities, particularly using the Flash technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cinematic,'' said Whitehill. ``The transitions are
very soft, the ability to fade in and out. I'm trained in
letterpress work and the Web has always been so ugly to me
typographically. (But Flash) lends itself well to this kind of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Furman, a Laurel Canyon artist, also used Flash for her
still-incomplete piece on Martha Stewart's impact on women's sense
of self and place in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at this woman who's creating all this beauty
around her while most families are struggling to survive,'' Furman
said. ``Part of the project is asking people to submit their own
stories, anecdotes, observations about her. Everyone has opinions
about her. Is she a Donna Karan or Mrs. Fields, or is she a Leona
Helmsley?''
</P>
<P>
   Like Whitehill, Furman is enthused about the technology's
possibilities for creating distinctive new kinds of art, and for
making it available even to people who are uncomfortable with
galleries and museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the immediacy of it, the ephemeral qualities of it,''
Furman said. ``I can see why photographers love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other projects include a retired Jet Propulsion Lab scientist's
site for a manned mission to Mars in 2030; a Venice video artist's
extended set of images of childhood toys and reactions to them; and
a faux genetic research lab's site, said Maija Beeton, AFI's
director of advanced technology programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Evora poem can be seen temporarily at
www.eriktek.com/cdaw/sites/theresa, and others' work can be found
elsewhere in the sites parent directory.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, all the work will move from the eriktek.com
temporary home to www.californiaculture.net, a statewide version of
the Los Angeles Web site connecting museums and other cultural
facilities that has been run by the Getty Center, said Beeton.
</P>
<P>
   TOO LATE TO LIST: Try as we might, the holiday game and gear
guide the Daily News just published can't possibly cover all the
cool stuff coming out this season. Over the next few weeks of the
Digital L.A. column, I'll highlight some of the later-arriving
goodies of note.
</P>
<P>
   First is Diamond Multimedia's Rio PMP-300, a nifty, tiny piece
of technology whose talents led the Recording Industry Association
of America to sue (so far unsuccessfully) to stop its production.
The player copies songs from your computer in the compact MP-3 file
format. The Rio comes with a computer connecting cable, superb
MusicMatch software to create and manage your MP-3 library and
earphones. Get it while it's hot, before the RIAA kills it. About
$200.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonka Workshop CD-ROM Playset is an interesting hybrid of
real-world and virtual toy. A workbench of plastic tools fits over
your computer's keyboard, allowing your toddler to make like a
carpenter while controlling on-screen activities through the
workbench, and ``building'' dozens of projects.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're itching to make use of that DVD-ROM drive on your
new computer, IBM has come out with World Book Discoveries, based
on the World Book encyclopedia. The multimedia title focuses on
cultural, scientific and other developments throughout history, and
comes loaded with about seven hours of video, 5,400 images and more
than 900 animations.
</P>
<P>
   Redjack: Revenge of the Brethren is a handsome hybrid
Windows/Macintosh role-playing game of pirates and adventure set a
couple of hundred years ago. Its 3-D look and extensive narrative
make for a more movie-like experience.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of movielike experiences, ``I'm Your Man'' is a
just-released interactive movie on DVD-ROM, a perfect gift for
people who want to use the DVD-ROM drive in their new computer for
more than playing CDs. Your decisions help shape the direction of
the movie's narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Magic's HairWear 'n' Charms is a Mac/PC disk from Mattel
that allows children to create jewelry on screen, then print the
pieces on plastic sheets that shrink into tough, attractive jewelry
once they are baked in an oven. Comes with plastic sheets,
decorative accessories, and even an corrugated baking sheet. This
title is part of a really terrific set of girl-oriented titles from
Mattel that combines computerized creativity with real-world crafts
like jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   WWF War Zone has been perched in the Top 10 lists all fall for
both the Nintendo 64 and the PlayStation, with all the World
Wrestling Federation's stars and even federation owner Vince
McMahon doing play-by-play. Plus you can create your own wrestlers,
something McMahon has yet to quite pull off.
</P>
<P>
   Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is the much-awaited N64 dinosaur hunting
first-person shooter. Unlike most N64 games, this one is definitely
for more mature players, given its gore, but the opponents are
smart and the graphics great.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' is hitting not only the theaters and home
computers, but also the PlayStation. Gather grain, beat bad bugs
and free the colony from its oppressors as you move through 3-D
environments.
</P>
<P>
   Cool Boarders III is the latest sequel to a fun series of
Playstation snowboarding games. &UR;  &LR; Good, but it can't quite keep up
with 1080 on the N64. Then again, most other games can't either.
</P>
<P>
   Future Cop: LAPD has nothing to do with our favorite folks in
blue, but is an engaging if moderately bloody PlayStation action
game where you play a cop in a robotic anti-crime machine, cleaning
up the streets of a Blade Runner-esque L.A. Electronic Arts also
just announced a PC/Mac version with more levels and network
capabilities. If the computer version is as fun as the PlayStation
one, look out.

   Take Lions wide receiver  &UR; Herman Moore. Please. Before the
Thanksgiving Day game, when he finally showed signs of life, he had
amassed a paltry 484 yards and developed a pathological fear of the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Moore has determined the reason for his lack of
production. It's everybody else's fault. He sulked with a leg
injury while  &UR; Johnnie Morton and some no-names picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy who was probably the second receiver taken in
some drafts. Makes you want to do yard work.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Other top receivers who couldn't catch a ``Seinfeld'' rerun:
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis receiver  &UR; Isaac Bruce has been hurt much of the year,
as has Patriots receiver  &UR; Terry Glenn and Cardinals wideout  &UR; Rob
Moore. Green Bay wide receiver  &UR; Robert Brooks has not fully
recovered from off-season back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, of the Raiders, has been lost in  &UR; Jon Gruden's offense
since
 &UR; Jeff George went down because of a groin pull. The most popular
target on the team seems to be tight-end  &UR; Rickey Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals wide receiver  &UR; Carl Pickens leads the AFC in yardage,
but has only found the end zone three times. This may have
something to do with  &UR; Neil O'Donnell, who doesn't have  &UR; Larry Brown
to throw to in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Bruce Coslet is down to third-string  &UR; Paul Justin at
quarterback. Who knows? One of the cheerleaders may be starting
before long.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a whole new crop of younger receivers is taking over.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC, Jets wide receiver  &UR; Keyshawn Johnson is finally
backing up his trash talk, grabbing eight touchdowns and ringing up
755 yards. The Colts'  &UR; Marvin Harrison is also shredding opposing
secondaries, with 741 yards and seven touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, all the talk is about Minnesota rookie sensation
 &UR; Randy
 &UR; Moss, the return of the human highlight film. Sunday against the
Packers, Moss looked like he was playing against his 12-year-old
nephews in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Comparing the Packers' secondary to 12-year-olds
is an insult.
</P>
<P>
   To 12-year-olds everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So who to go with down the stretch? I wouldn't give up on
Arizona's Moore, who looks like he's finally healthy. The fact that
 &UR; Jake Plummer woke up doesn't hurt Moore or teammate,  &UR; Frank
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   I think Denver wide receiver  &UR; Rod Smith will heat it up in the
last five games, with  &UR; Ed McCaffrey slowed because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   And if your league counts defensive statistics, you might stick
with Tim Brown. He's a heck of a tackler. &QL; 
Tip of the Week &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When basting your turkey, be sure to use natural . . . Wait a
minute, wrong tip. You've already eaten the turkey, and some of
your fantasy football turkeys already have been roasted. I'd start
every 49ers player I could get my hands on. I sense a Monday night
blowout against the Giants. &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City running back  &UR; Bam Morris is apparently determined to
stay out of the big house long enough to score some more
touchdowns. I'd start him this week against the Cardinals
defenders, who did a wonderful impression of turnstiles against
Washington. &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week it's Redskins quarterback  &UR; Trent Green, &UR; who threw for
382 yards and four touchdowns and ran for another. This time next
year, he'll be working at Wendy's. &QL; 
Bill Muller's Fantasy Football notebook appears every Friday. He

FALL TV CROP SHOWS WHY  CABLE GROWS  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER

<P>
   PHOENIX - End of sweeps come, me want read book.
</P>
<P>
   Fall's big ratings period has concluded. As has, it seems, the
broadcast television age.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a unified premiere-week strategy and more hype than
ever, the Big Four networks continue to shrink their combined
audience. Millions have left since last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cable grows. The startup WB grows. Only the Nielsen shadow knows
how low traditional networks can go.
</P>
<P>
   Before the network doom buggy reaches escape trajectory, let's
take a post-sweeps, almost-midseason pause and look for bright
spots. This won't take long.
</P>
<P>
   Among the three dozen fall newcomers, I've found exactly two
confirmed keepers. That total seems puny until you consider that
last year's list _ 1. ``Ally McBeal'' _ was shorter by half.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Sports Night'' and ``Cupid'' are both talky and quick,
sometimes funny and sometimes poignant, and I love 'em both. These
shows alone are reason to keep paying your electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cupid'' suffers a terrible time slot on Saturdays, and is,
accordingly, audience-poor. Shame.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Piven plays the eternal title character, who works to
make love connections for mere mortals. Whether he is or isn't
really a mythical matchmaker is part of the fun, as is the breezy
byplay between Piven and co-star Paula Marshall, who plays a more
grounded relationship therapist.
</P>
<P>
   This show is cool. Support cool shows.
</P>
<P>
   Such as ``Sports Night,'' which is fighting a needless
categorization battle with its network.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a drama? Is it a comedy?
</P>
<P>
   It is both, and it is excellent. Set in the studios, back
offices and control room of a perpetually sportscasting entity much
like ESPN's ``SportsCenter,'' ``Sports Night'' is ``The Front
Page'' for our time, packed with crackling dialog and complicated
but loveable characters.
</P>
<P>
   A challenging hybrid, ``Sports Night'' delivers the most viewing
satisfaction of any new series. Don't mess it up, ABC. And lose the
laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping down a full tier, maybe more, there are a handful of
new shows that still occasionally might attract my clicker. They
are: ``TheHughleys'' (also from ABC), ``Buddy Faro'' (CBS), ``Will
&AMP; Grace'' (NBC), ``That 70's Show'' (Fox), ``Felicity'' (WB) and
``Seven Days'' (UPN).
</P>
<P>
   Which strikes me as a comparatively stunning total, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Finding so many acceptable-to-OK new shows from a freshman class
judged to be so poor is a bit of a surprise. Finding two that are
OK-to-excellent is outright nuts.
</P>
<P>
   None of the above shows can be classified as hits, however, and
there are new shows that can be classified as hits (``Jesse,''
``King ofQueens'') that would never make any critics' best-of list.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new shows projected as stiffs have more or
less behaved that way, counting ``Encore! Encore!,'' ``The Secret
Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' ``Costello,'' ``Wind on Water,'' etc.
The ``Fantasy Island'' remake has been perhaps the biggest
disappointed on the schedule. Too bad about ``Trinity,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the newcomers, ``Felicity'' had the most obvious
potential at launch, but has squandered a lot of good will on dour
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   I admire its look, its uniform tone, its stars, its obvious
aspiration to be bigger than a prime-time soap for undergrads. But
it's been much too self-conscious and twee to really love. I mean,
the title character actually walked up to that dude she really
likes at a party and said, ``We need to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Like that. At a Halloween party. ``We need to talk.'' Twee.
</P>
<P>
   The WB has announced that the series will henceforth lighten up.
Amen, if true.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Boldness rules  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big lesson for the network-TV business from this fall crop
should be: Break the rules. No, lose the rules completely.
</P>
<P>
   As has been documented repeatedly, the networks have employed
nakedly formulaic programming to aggressively pursue
advertiser-coveted Yuppies. This has been a failed strategy from
the perspective of both critics/viewers and accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Though their affiliates mostly continue to mint cash (thanks
largely to highly profitable local newscasts), broadcast networks
have become money-losers whose programs drive viewers to more
distinctive cable fare.
</P>
<P>
   What sets shows like ``Sports Night'' and ``Cupid'' apart are
that they toy with the formulas by which shows live their lives.
Formula-bound shows can still work _ example: ``Will &AMP; Grace'' _
but the writing and acting has to be top-notch.
</P>
<P>
   The problem there: New networks have drained the Hollywood
talent pool of writers, producers and actors. Creative types of
lesser notches have ascended to lofty positions at studios and
networks. Accordingly, quality has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Business expansion during the coming digital age might turn
things around for their giant parent companies, but networks'
programming power is dimming more every day.
</P>
<P>
   True, the big nets remain the only medium by which advertisers
can assemble a mob of viewers all at one time. That's why they call
the Super Bowl super.
</P>
<P>
   But how often do we get an O.J. verdict or presidential
admission of adultery with which to stoke the communal campfire?
</P>
<P>
   Not too often, let's all hope.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hope, two network programming suits, Warren
Littlefield at NBC and Peter Roth at Fox, have in recent weeks been
replaced by new suits with cable-network backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   New NBC boss Scott Sassa comes from Ted Turner's cable
multiplex. Doug Herzog, the new program-picker at Fox, comes from
MTV and Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with reporters about his shows, Fox's Roth
threw the word ``distinctive'' around as if it were a Nerf
adjective. (Or is it an adverb? Can you tell that I watch TV for a
living?)
</P>
<P>
   The presumption is that Sassa and Herzog, who in past lives were
responsible, at least in part, for bringing the Cartoon Network and
``South Park'' to life, know ``distinctive'' when they see it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
High-spud crash  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweeps months, designed to help local stations pump up their
already-plump bottom lines, were once occasions to put the nation
on full spud-alert. Network programers filled sweeps with sweeping
miniseries, must-see series episodes and really special specials.
Sweeps was an excuse to toss a Presto log on the communal campfire.
Artificial, yes, but the glow was nearly lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, sweeps has the look and feel of a dying ritual.
Stunting local TV news outfits grow ever more desperate to hijack
your attention. As for network programing, go ahead and name your
big TV highlight from the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``the Temptations'' miniseries had its moments. PBS's
``Frank Lloyd Wright'' had many. ``Rear Window'' was OK, but it was
no ``Rear Window.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, what? Schmaltz, unfulfilled hype and Fox reality
specials.
</P>
<P>
   Weep for sweeps, but save some sorrow for the heart of the
network business, which is the creation and maintenance of reguarly
scheduled series.
</P>
<P>
   We're still amid a bit of a golden age for hourlong dramas,
which thrive creatively despite the continuing expansion of
newsmagazines. Likewise, there's also as much genuinely good comedy
available on TV as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences may be withering, but the better series still can
thrill. Too bad that some of TV's better returning series have
stumbled this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, ``Frasier'' has proved itself to be less than
``Seinfeld'' in broadcasting's most important time slot, with
significantly lower ratings than the powerhouse it replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the otherwise fine show has started the season in a bit
of a creative slump. Chin up, ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not exactly drunk with pleasure over turning-inward trend at
``Homicide: Life on the Street.'' Once TV's finest drama _ and
still one of the finest of all time _ ``Homicide'' sadly appears to
have lost a step.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for ``ER,'' which hasn't noticeably improved with
recent cast additions. The fall's dominant story line on TV's
top-rated series has been less-than-loveable chiefly because,
despite his limitations as an actor, Eriq La Salle played a better
cranky Dr. Benton than Noah Wyle. And Wyle was a better whelpy
Carter than Kellie Martin. Let's ship this relationship to
permanent intensive care. On my count people: One, two . . .
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the NBC schedule _ somewhere _ ``NewsRadio'' has
survived Phil Hartman's tragic exit, but can it survive yet another
time slot change?
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, ``JAG'' is evidently chugging toward legit hit status,
and it's great to see that maybe everybody does love ``Everybody
Loves Raymond,'' which has become a top 20 hit.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, ``Spin City'' and ``The Drew Carey Show'' remain
must-catch comedies, and ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?,'' a summertime
replacement returning to the schedule Dec. 9, immediately joins the
quality leader-board. If you didn't discover this improv-comedy
showcase during its hot-weather run, now's your chance. It's
brilliant. Rule-breaking and distinctive, even.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ``NYPD Blue'' was terrific TV, so let's hope it marked
the conclusion of a down cycle for the series. Bring on Rick
Schroder.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``The Practice'' has supplanted ``Homicide'' as TV's
best drama.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say for Fox is, where the hell did they put ``King of
the Hill''? &QL;

ANOTHER MEXICAN GRAY WOLF FOUND DEAD ON ARIZONA-NEW MEXICO BORDER 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The discovery of another Mexican gray wolf carcass on the
Arizona-New Mexico border last week further frayed a tense
relationship between local residents and federal officials who are
attempting to reintroduce the endangered breed to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The death means none of the original 11 wolves released into the
Apache National Forest last March remains free. Four others were
shot, five were recaptured (though some will be re-released) and
another is missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been wildly unpopular with the local residents,
who nevertheless bristle at speculation that one of them may be
responsible for trying to sabotage the program through the sights
of a gun. The federal government is promising a $10,000 reward for
information and jail time for the shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the folks near Alpine, Ariz., had come to associate the
term ``endangered species'' with lost jobs and unwelcome federal
intervention long before the Mexican gray wolves arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have filed dozens of lawsuits in the region
in recent years to protect endangered wildlife. The locals say
they've lost jobs and income with nearly every one of them as
they've been told that their old ways of living and working were
destroying habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about the wolf thing, but it's just kind of
the straw that broke the camel's back,'' said area rancher Barbara
Marks. ``If these things made sense that would be one thing, but
it's all political.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting several species of rare fish has meant reducing the
numbers of cattle permitted to graze on public land, cutting into
ranchers' profits when they then have to rent private pasture or
graze fewer cattle. Protecting the Mexican spotted owl has meant
the near demise of the logging industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a negative attitude, certainly (toward the
federal government),'' said Apache County Sheriff Art Lee. ``Nobody
likes the federal government to come in to tell them what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can tell you this much,'' advised Alpine blacksmith Dink
Robart. ``I firmly believe it was none of the local people that
dispatched these wolves, primarily because they know it's something
we have to live with, even though it was shoved down our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican gray wolves were once common in New Mexico, Arizona,
Texas and Mexico. But people in the late 18th century and early
19th century were so successful in killing off the region's
predators that they disappeared from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Mexican gray wolves raised in captivity were released in
Apache County last March by a team of Fish and Wildlife naturalists
who hope to see the group breed and grow to about 100 wolves in
three to five years. The first one was shot by a camper in late
April who said the animal was threatening his family. He will not
be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Three other wolves were found dead of apparent gunshot wounds in
August, October and November.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, I have no idea'' who is behind the shootings,
said Lee. ``I just don't believe for a minute anyone is out there
with the intent of destroying the wolf population.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These wolves to my knowledge were killed during hunting
season, and these seasons bring people in from all over,'' said
Robart. ``When there's 600 rifles out there and 4,800 cases of
beer, you figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff says that his constituents are pretty uniformly
opposed to the wolves, a lot of that opposition being based on
fear, ``and I don't think that's an unfounded fear.'' &QL;

(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   There have been no proven incidents of wolves killing cattle,
though one did attack a pony and another killed a local rancher's
cowdog. Local ranchers say that their cattle are so spread out (and
only occasionally seen) that proving a wolf attack would be nearly
impossible anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But Robart says the major complaint of the Alpine residents is
that the wolf recovery area is a scant seven miles from town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate, but the animals are being placed for the
convenience of the government in an area that's too populated,''
Robart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release sites were chosen for several different reasons,''
said Richard Remington, a regional supervisor for Arizona Game and
Fish. ``A proximity to a major elk calving (as a source of food)
and also access (for the management team) had to be considered. The
acclimation pens are almost a half acre in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, when the wolves have to be in the pens, they have to be
watered and fed and watched,'' Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But supplemental feeding was not as necessary as we
expected,'' Remington said. ``These guys got to killing elk and
deer pretty quickly and got quite good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line is I can take my dog out there (to the release
area) and he'll beat me home,'' Robart countered. ``These wolves
have been in town. They haven't killed a lot of livestock, but they
are a pest, and people are afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, people either like the wolves or they don't. It's
difficult to find people who don't have an opinion,'' Remington
said. ``And there are those who thought the wolves were eradicated
for all the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The wolf team was prepared to do whatever it took to guarantee
that the first generation of wolves survived and reproduced,
Remington said, including supplementing their diet with road kill.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Snow, a spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
said there have been problems with attempts to reintroduce other
varieties of wildlife in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been another problem in New Mexico in fact, with the
introduction of a native trout species,'' Snow said. ``Someone very
clearly stocked some rainbows and another species in the area where
we were planning to restore the Gila trout, and rainbows and browns
compete with the Gila trout. It was fairly clear that someone had
planted some fish from a hatchery of sorts in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``But generally, reintroductions are never easy things to do
either from a biological standpoint, and sometimes from a public
opinion standpoint,'' Snow said. ``Generally urban folks are quite
in favor of restoring wolves where rural folks have a different
opinion on that issue, for obvious reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow wouldn't reveal whether federal investigators believe the
wolf shootings and the sabotaged fish project are related. ``We do
not comment on ongoing investigations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marks says common sense ought to remove area ranchers from
suspicion because of their depending, albeit reluctantly, on the
federal government and its national parkland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ranchers that have a permit to graze cattle on public land, or
a management agreement with the forest service, they have more to
lose than the general public does,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the latest wolf carcass, an 18-month-old male,
came just days after a high profile visit to the area by Secretary
of the Interior Bruce Babbitt. Tests are being made to determine
the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt emphasized the federal government's commitment to the
program, and advised local residents that they had better get used
to the wolves. He described the animals as ``rare and beautiful
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's visit coincided with the arrival of two replacement
female wolves, being held with two of the original males in an
acclimation pen near where they will be released again in coming
weeks. &QL;

TUNING INTO TELEMUNDO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the tale of two brothers with a shared
mission: nabbing bad guys. There'll be drama. There'll be action.
There'll be sibling camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal?
</P>
<P>
   It is to Latino actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reyes y Rey,'' a new series about two cops working cases on
the U.S.-Mexico border, is Telemundo's (KVEA, Channel 52) first
stab at producing a drama. It's one of seven shows the
Spanish-speaking television network has launched, with more on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   And for Latino actors, writers and directors who say they long
have been shunned by major American television networks,
Telemundo's new push to produce its own shows _ both in Los Angeles
and in Mexico _ means a chance to showcase their talents, finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful start for something that the National
Hispanic Media Coalition has been pushing for for the last 10
years,'' said Esther Renteria, national chair of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have felt that English-language TV has ignored Latinos,
especially in prime-time programming, and that so much of the
programming that was shown on the two Spanish-language networks was
imported product. We felt that U.S.-born Latinos were being
ignored,'' Renteria said. ``This is good, not just for the
representation, but also for the jobs that come with the
production.''
</P>
<P>
   If Latino representation in front of the camera is any
indication, Telemundo's efforts could drastically change the
entertainment job landscape.
</P>
<P>
   According to Renteria, there were 800 speaking parts on
prime-time television in 1996 _ and 20 of them went to people of
Latino heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Only about a dozen Latino regulars have spots on the prime-time
schedule, among them Hector Elizondo (``Chicago Hope''), Benjamin
Bratt (``Law &AMP; Order''), Bruno Campos (``Jesse'') and Rita Moreno,
who is a regular on HBO's ``Oz,'' but often shows up on network
fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than an appearance by Gloria Estefan,'' Renteria said,
``that's it, baby. It has to get better just by the sheer numbers.
Within a year or two, Latinos are going to be the dominant minority
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Latinos are expected to be the largest minority in the
country by 2004. And those viewers, says Renteria, are eager to see
television shows that speak to issues and events they face in their
own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sony, which purchased Miami- and Los Angeles-based
Telemundo for a reported $538 million on Aug. 13, bringing with it
a desire to produce original programming.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan at Telemundo is to program for a different
audience than the current leader in Spanish-language television,
Univision (KMEX, Channel 34), which attracts 82 percent of the
market. Univision's 6 p.m. news beats all others in the Los Angeles
market in many key demographics and tops KCBS in overall viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going for a younger bicultural viewer,'' said Nely
Galan, Telemundo's entertainment president. ``For most young
people, Spanish-language television is not something they can
relate to. We want young Latinos to see themselves reflected.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract that young, very American audience, Telemundo is
showing a block of some of Nickelodeon's most popular programs in
Spanish _ ``Aaahh!!! Real Monsters,'' ``Rocko's Modern Life,''
``Rugrats'' and ``Blue's Clues'' _ from 6:30 to 8 a.m. weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   And its original programs try to show the range of Latino
experiences in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cop duo show ``Reyes y Rey,'' for instance, will look at the
immigration experience on the border.
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom ``Una Familia Con Angel'' is a take on ``Who's the
Boss?'' and ``Solo en America'' is a Latin-themed ``One Day at a
Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Telemundo even has game shows that will look familiar to
American viewers. ``Buscando Pareja'' is the network's version of
``The Dating Game,'' but the Latino twist is that a family member
will act as a chaperone on the date. In ``Los Recien Casados,'' the
network's version of ``The Newlywed Game,'' there is a segment
involving the mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is: Will the new venues provided by Telemundo
give Spanish-speaking entertainers a leg up into mainstream
networks or will they simply lead to ghettoization?
</P>
<P>
   ``What Latino writers tell me is that, on the one hand, it is an
alternative career route,'' said Dr. William Bielby, a professor of
sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ``But the
pay is terrible and the opportunity to break out of that is
nonexistent. Some of the Latino writers I talk to are very bitter
to the fact that it's the only alternative to them.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a long way to go, said Dr. Harry Pachon, president of
the Thomas Rivera Policy Institute, a nonprofit organization that
researches issues involving the Latino community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a major step, to be truthful, insofar as
offering another opportunity,'' Pachon said. ``It still doesn't
address the larger issue of how mainstream television is
incorporating Latinos in roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the latest slew of programs produced in North America,
series television on Spanish-language networks mainly has consisted
of soap operas from South America. Only news programs and talk
shows were produced in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Telemundo's Galan said that between 300 and 400 jobs have come
as a result of the new production, and 80 percent of them have gone
to Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from Latinos' paltry presence both in front of
and behind the camera in this country's established networks.
</P>
<P>
   Data released by the Screen Actors Guild echoes Renteria's
claim. Its research indicated that in 1996, 3.9 percent of
performers cast in television and feature film roles were of Latino
descent.
</P>
<P>
   The word from the Writers Guild of America, West is even
bleaker. Latino writers accounted for about 1 percent of total
television employment each year from 1991 to 1997, according to the
1998 Hollywood Writers' Report prepared by UC Santa Barbara's
Bielby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our time has come,'' Galan said. ``I, myself, as a
Latina who owned a production company, got very, very frustrated in
Hollywood. There weren't enough Latino people in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The new programs have not become instant hits. The Nielsen
Hispanic Stations Index indicates that the ratings for ``Reyes y
Rey'' have dropped in each of its first three broadcasts. The same
was true for the first two episodes of ``Solo en America.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Spanish-language television is on the rise. The October
prime-time ratings for both Telemundo on KVEA and KMEX were up from
a year ago. KVEA earned a 5.4 rating, compared to a 5.0 last year.
KMEX received a 33.3 rating, up from 26.8 last year. One ratings
point in the NHSI is equal to 14,500 households.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more diverse the better,'' said Pachon. ``I think
ratings will ultimately be the arbiter of how successful they will
be on these issues. It's too early to tell.''

MOWBRAY ADJUSTING TO LIFE AFTER PRISON 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Sitting in a prison dormitory while serving a life
sentence for her husband's murder, Susie Mowbray made herself a
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sit there and watch the Channel 8 news out of Dallas
during the state fair and they'd show the Ferris wheel. I think it
was called the Texas Star,'' Mowbray said. ``I'd say to myself,
`You know, if I ever get out, I'm going to ride the Ferris wheel.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Contending all along that her husband, a Brownsville Cadillac
dealer, had committed suicide, Mowbray served nearly a decade of
her original sentence before a jury acquitted her in a second trial
last January.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 50, the former Rio Grande Valley homemaker has moved to
Dallas and is making a slow return to life. She has enrolled in
college to complete the undergraduate degree she started years ago,
and is negotiating book and movie deals. She has taken up driving
again, joined a book-review club and has even started to date.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening in a sports bar on Greenville Avenue,
Mowbray was relaxed and talkative, and seemed secure within the
confines of the little chunk of Dallas she has claimed as her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like not standing out,'' she said. ``Dallas has allowed me
that anonymity. It's so big and people are so involved in their
lives, I'm able to blend in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street is Tuffy's, where she goes to watch Dallas
Cowboys games, across from the Granada Theatre where first-run and
classic movies can be seen at discount prices. A little farther is
the glitzy Red Jacket, a nightclub where Mowbray practices swing
dancing with friends.
</P>
<P>
   She shares a brick duplex nearby with daughter Elizabeth
``Cricket'' Burnett, a 25-year-old advertising writer for the
Neiman Marcus department store who has decorated the two-bedroom
apartment with a colorful mix of furniture and art. At the end of
the street is a park where Mowbray walks Mary Patsy, a pampered
beagle owned jointly with Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Mowbray's return to society has been hamstrung, she said, by the
aftereffects of prison. There have been anxiety attacks, hysterical
fits triggered by the appearance of a uniformed officer, and crying
sessions in her daughter's arms, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, after I'm out, I don't feel like I fit into the big
scheme of things,'' she said. ``I don't want to sound like I'm
bellyaching, but lives don't fall into place overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   And because she was once found guilty of murdering her husband,
Mowbray did not inherit any of his estate, which included a
rambling country home in the Valley and a multimillion dollar
insurance payout. She still owes more than $100,000 in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy. I've compared it to being on another planet for
a long time and I've come back. Sometimes I'll just draw a blank,
and Cricket has turned into my caretaker and mentor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the years in Gatesville prison, Mowbray was not around to
help her children as they grew into adulthood, nor was she there to
care for her father when he became ill and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get to do things normally, and it's sad, because my
greatest desire is to be normal, to be like everyone else,''
Mowbray said. ``And I'm not, and I'm not going to be, and I have to
accept it. And I have to get to a point where I like who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, few recognize Susie Mowbray as the blonde housewife
convicted in a murder case that became big news in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She was sentenced to life in June 1988 for fatally shooting her
second husband, Bill Mowbray, as he slept in their bed. Mowbray
told investigators that her husband, depressed over money troubles
and facing prosecution for alleged tax evasion, carried out earlier
threats to kill himself as she lay next to him in bed on the night
of Sept. 16, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The jury believed Susie Mowbray had killed her husband, but they
didn't hear important evidence that supported Mowbray's claims.
</P>
<P>
   The media obsessed over the murder case, describing Mowbray as a
debutante, beauty queen or high-rolling socialite and her dead
husband as a wealthy car dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socialite pulled trigger on big wheel husband,'' read the
headlines in the tabloid Weekly World News after Mowbray was found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of their lives was less glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County prosecutors told the jury that Mowbray's motive
for murder was money, alleging that she killed her husband to gain
nearly $2 million in life insurance proceeds after learning he was
planning to divorce her and remove her as beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not perfect, but I'm not the wicked witch of the north,''
Mowbray said. ``I loved Bill, and I wish what happened to him never
did, but it did and the burden fell on me, my children and my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mowbray's six-year marriage to Bill Mowbray, a Nebraska native
who moved to Brownsville and bought a car dealership, began soon
after she met him while having her Cadillac serviced during a
summer stay in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mowbray was a generous man of varied interests, including
skin diving, underwater photography, hunting and trap shooting, and
Mowbray said her new husband was sincere in his desire to help her
raise her two children from a previous marriage. But he was also a
volatile and moody man who had attempted suicide twice before, had
expensive tastes and was a profligate spender. In the months before
his death, he had become despondent over mounting business debts
and faced a possible prison sentence for income tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Today, few Dallasites are familiar with the tireless campaign to
free Mowbray waged by her son, Wade Burnett, a law student.
</P>
<P>
   After his mother was sent to prison, Burnett pored over trial
transcripts and exhibits until he and an appellate lawyer found
that prosecutors had withheld crucial findings by a nationally
respected blood spatter expert.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first trial, prosecutors had hired Herbert MacDonell,
a New York expert who examined the crime scene photographs,
Mowbray's night gown and other physical evidence and concluded it
was more likely that Bill Mowbray killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors kept MacDonell's findings from Mowbray's defense
attorneys for seven months until the judge ordered them turned over
shortly before trial.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonell was never called to testify, and prosecutors instead
employed an Austin police detective who testified that he found
high-impact spatters on the front of Mowbray's nightgown. The
stains did not indicate that Susie Mowbray had been lying in bed
when the fatal shot was fired, as she claimed, but rather that she
had either leaned or stood over her sleeping husband and fired a
bullet into his temple.
</P>
<P>
   During a special hearing in August 1995 to consider a new trial,
the Austin expert admitted his testimony lacked ``scientific
validity'' because he had assumed that the night gown had earlier
tested positive for blood, which it did not.
</P>
<P>
   Mowbray's outrage about the methods prosecutors used to win her
murder conviction increased when she entered the Gatesville prison,
and heard similar stories from other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like anyone else. I had taken government class and
believed our elected officials were honest. You voted for them, and
went about your business of raising your children,'' Mowbray said.
``Then when I got raped by the (criminal justice) system and put on
a planet where a lot of other women had similar situations, I
realized `Oh My God, I'm not the only one.' It's not an
aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   The long battle to win a new trial taught her that errors made
by the criminal justice system are not easily corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have money,'' she said. ``You can appeal but guess
what? Attorneys want money to appeal and about the time that
happens, the well is dry.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't forgotten the women she met in Gatesville. She
corresponds with several and writes about them in the book
manuscript she is preparing.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent fall morning, Mowbray was out scouting neighborhood
thrift shops searching for suitable outfits for a friend, currently
serving a murder sentence, who she hopes will soon be paroled.
</P>
<P>
   But as she runs the errand in her green Oldsmobile sedan,
Mowbray demonstrates that she has not fully mastered the details of
life outside prison. Realizing too late she is in the wrong lane to
turn into a Dallas shopping mall, she simply stops the car in
midstreet and waits for the others to whiz past on either side.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been the anxiety attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, since I can't afford a psychiatrist, I don't know why I
have them,'' she said with sarcasm. ``They would come out of
nowhere, but where I have them is in stores. Maybe it's all the
choices, sensory overload.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was OK _ `I am woman, hear me roar.' Shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the chill in the North Texas air, Mowbray insists on
keeping the front and rear doors to her duplex open at least a
crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you I was damaged,'' she said, laughing at the
absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   If Mowbray's book and movie deals come through, her anonymous
lifestyle may soon vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say she may soon be back in a South Texas courtroom,
this time as a plaintiff seeking monetary damages against Cameron
County officials for what her lawyers contend was a malicious
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Her long-term goals are relatively simple.
</P>
<P>
   She wants her own home, and after completing college, she hopes
to work as a teacher so she can help steer kids away from crime.
</P>
<P>
   She met scores of young women in prison with little education,
no family support, no skills and many who had committed crimes
while addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we put our rejects,'' she said of the prison
system. ``That is the dumping ground. Everybody is mad at them, so
afraid of them, so frustrated with them. And most of them are just
so pitiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Mowbray can help others, she acknowledges, she has
her own work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I'm not there yet.'' &QL;

COLOMBIAN PULLS STRINGS IN PEACE PROCESS FROM EXILE 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ His phone list of guerrilla contacts is
so thick that, even from exile in Costa Rica, Alvaro Leyva requires
just minutes to communicate with the leader of Colombia's largest
rebel insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on where he is,'' Leyva said, referring to Manuel
``Sureshot'' Marulanda, commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC. ``If he's in Colombia, five minutes. If he's
abroad, ten.''
</P>
<P>
   As Colombia attempts to end its 34-year civil war, Leyva is a
vital link between the government and the guerrillas. A
self-appointed peacemaker, the 56-year-old lawyer and former
senator is one of the few Colombian politicians that the guerrillas
trust.
</P>
<P>
   It was Leyva who arranged the historic meeting in the mountains
of Colombia between Marulanda and newly elected President Andres
Pastrana. The five-hour encounter last July laid the groundwork for
what may be the most serious peace initiative since the war began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become obsessed with the issue of peace. He thinks it's
the only thing worth living for,'' said Juan Manuel Ospina, a
Colombian senator and a longtime friend of Leyva.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how the FARC thinks,'' added Javier Munera, director
of CEUDES, a Bogota-based research center. ``The government would
be crazy not to consult with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But to do so face-to-face now requires a trip to this tiny
Central America isthmus. Earlier this year, Leyva was accused of
illegal enrichment after accepting a check from a frontman for the
Cali drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid arrest, he fled to San Jose, the Costa Rican capital,
where he was granted political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Leyva claims that his name will eventually be cleared.
Meanwhile, he focuses on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Everyday, he works the telephone and has racked up monthly
long-distance bills of $4,000. He sends e-mail to Colombian
officials and rebel chieftains and receives politicians in the
living room of his modest San Jose apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody goes through Costa Rica_ messengers from each
side,'' said Francisco Santos, a peace activist and an editor at
the Bogota daily El Tiempo. ``I'm going to Costa Rica next week.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent 90-minute interview, Leyva received several
phone calls from Colombia, including a request from a Bogota
journalist for a meeting with Marulanda, the elusive FARC leader.
</P>
<P>
   Political intrigue seems to run in Leyva's blood. At 28, he
became the private secretary for former President Misael Pastrana,
father of the current president. He was elected to the congress and
the senate for the Conservative Party and eventually was named
minister of mines.
</P>
<P>
   But his most coveted skill is as an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of government peace commissions, Leyva cultivated
sources within the National Liberation Army, or ELN, the smaller of
Colombia's two main rebel groups, and ventured deep into
FARC-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the camps. I sleep there. I get to know the people. I
eat with them. With all of this one learns a lot,'' Leyva said.
``They know that I don't ask any questions. If tomorrow they were
going to attack a police garrison, no one would tell me anything
nor would I ask. It's none of my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, such contacts allowed Leyva to help secure the
release of several prominent Colombians who had been kidnapped by
the guerrillas. Ospina, the senator, said that few politicians are
comfortable around the rebels and that Leyva acts as a translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, there are communications problems,'' Ospina said.
``Leyva has achieved something important by putting FARC themes
into the language of the system and the themes of the system into
the language of the FARC.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Pastrana's official peace envoy, Victor Ricardo, consults
with Leyva on how to deal with the FARC and the ELN. In such
matters, the Colombian newsweekly Semana describes Leyva as ``the
owner of the microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to e-mail, high-powered radios, and satellite telephones,
getting in touch with guerrillas deep in the jungle now takes
minutes rather than months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is marvelous,'' said Leyva, who works off of an
Acer laptop computer on his cluttered diningroom table. ``Before,
when I needed to make contact, I would wait for 15 days for someone
to arrive, and often they would tell me that I couldn't go (to meet
the rebels) so I would have to send a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides arranging for Pastrana's encounter with Marulanda, Leyva
helped to design a temporary military withdrawl from five
municipalities in southern Colombia that began Nov. 7. The
controversial experiment is designed to foment an eventual dialogue
between the government and FARC leaders by creating a
15,000-square-mile neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his clout, Leyva is more renaissance man than a
traditional powerbroker.
</P>
<P>
   An amateur astronomer, he helped to establish an observatory at
a Bogota university. He runs in marathons, plays the violin, and
once turned his house into a gallery for Colombian artists. He has
produced exercize videos, dubbed English-language films into
Russian, and sold heavy equipment and minerals from the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten into all sorts of businesses, but he's really not
a businessman,'' Ospina said. ``He used to call me every two months
trying to sell me boatloads of urea from the Ukraine.''
</P>
<P>
   Such transactions are the source of Leyva's legal woes. In the
sale of 30 Russian dumptrucks to a Colombian mining firm in 1994,
Leyva received a check for about $57,000 to cover technical
assistance and service.
</P>
<P>
   The money, however, came from the bank account of an illiterate
peasant who, according to Colombian officials, was being used as a
cover for the Cali drug cartel. Prosecutor General Alfonso Gomez
Mendez also claims that no contracts exist as proof of a legal
transaction and issued a warrant for Leyva's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Colombian politicians have been accused of taking drug
payoffs in exchange for favors _ such as voting against the
extradition of jailed traffickers to the United States. But Leyva
held no public office in 1994 and insists that he was running a
legitimate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's known that Leyva has ties to the guerrillas, but not to
drug traffickers,'' said a recent analysis in Semana. ``It's
unclear why (the check) was signed or what favor he could have
provided.''
</P>
<P>
   Piedad Cordoba, a senator with the opposition Liberal Party,
said that until the case is cleared up, President Pastrana should
remove Leyva from the peace process. She pointed out that Pastrana
has been one of Colombia's most outspoken critics of politicians
who sold-out to drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Leyva ``may be very important, but I would prefer someone who
doesn't have this type of accusation surrounding him and who isn't
fleeing from Colombian justice,'' Cordoba said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest warrant against Leyva could be suspended if he became
an official spokesman for the FARC in the peace process, a
nomination that FARC leader Marulanda apparently has endorsed. But
Leyva said he prefers his role as a middleman, even if that means
pulling strings from exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do what the FARC tells me to do,'' Leyva said. ``I
make proposals. I toss out ideas. It's like being an architect. You
draw some lines and see whether or not your clients like them.''

FEW AIRLINES READY WITH DEFIBRILLATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Michael Tighe suffered cardiac arrest on an
American Airlines flight last week, his wife immediately ``knew he
was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He collapsed in his seat, one arm flailing in the aisle. His jaw
fell slack. As his wife shook his shoulders and screamed his name,
frantically pushing the emergency button, Tighe, 62, a Boston
native, lay motionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the flight attendant was there,'' Dolores Tighe, 53,
said, ``with this box.''
</P>
<P>
   The box, a laptop-sized contraption, was a defibrillator, one of
511 in the airline's fleet. Minutes after it was attached to
Tighe's torso, sending shocks through his body, he began breathing
again, making him the first person ever saved mid-air by the
device, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   But to some, the rescue was bittersweet: Despite promises by
several major US carriers to evaluate the benefits of putting
defibrillators on about 1,000 planes, only American Airlines had
them on board most planes as of last week. If Tighe had flown
United Airlines or Northwest, he said Wednesday, he ``definitely
would be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors said that, while the CPR might have helped bring
me around, it wouldn't have sustained me,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his hospital bed in Denver, where his plane made an
emergency landing last Thursday. ``It's a scary thing, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Under Federal Aviation Administration rules governing airline
medical kits, carriers are required to include little more than a
stethoscope, some breathing tubes, and a few kinds of pills _ even
though cardiac arrest is among the leading causes of death in the
nation. The rules on the medical kits have been updated just once
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is considering changing its regulations to require
defibrillators on major carriers _ a shift that could occur as soon
as next year. In the meantime, according to Alison Duquette, a
spokeswoman for the agency, ``there's nothing that prohibits the
industry from putting them on planes.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, American is the only US carrier that has.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, on whose planes 51 passengers suffered heart
attacks in 1997, is still talking with a manufacturer about
installing defibrillators sometime in 1999, a spokesman said.
Northwest Airlines also has no specific target date, instead saying
it is taking ``a really measured approach'' in continuing to
evaluate possibilities for its 400-plane fleet, according to
spokeswoman Kathy Peach.
</P>
<P>
   Even Delta, which was among the first to embrace the device and
announced a program about 11 months ago, has yet to complete
installation of defibrillators on its 587 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the airlines remain exposed to the risk of lawsuits
from passengers who suffer cardiac arrest on board. At least one
has already been filed in federal court in Boston, in the matter of
Steven Somes, a 37-year-old investment manager from Wellesley who
died on board a United Airlines flight from Boston to San
Francisco. Somes was treated only with a medical kit equipped with
``certain minimum requirements,'' according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tighe, Somes suffered cardiac arrest about halfway across
the continent. Three doctors, a nurse, and an emergency medical
technician happened to be on the Oct. 18, 1995, flight; they rushed
to help Somes and administered CPR, but he died during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit filed by his wife, Jamie, the airline
``deprived Steven Somes of a substantial chance to survive'' by
failing to put a defibrillator on board. Part of the airline's
duty, she argues, is to be vigilant ``in eliminating risks to its
passengers,'' including offering all available medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   At $3,000 apiece _ possibly less expensive than making an
emergency landing, which can cost between $3,000 and $5,000 or
higher _ the defibrillator would seem an obvious investment,
Somes's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines have a duty to keep up with technological changes.
... The longer the airlines industry holds off on these, the more
exposed they're going to be,'' John C. Sikorski said.
</P>
<P>
   Among medical and public health specialists, there seem to be
few questions about the benefits of acting fast on the issue. In
Boston, Mayor Thomas M. Menino began installing defibrillators in
emergency response teams and selected public buildings in 1994;
since then, there has been a 50 percent plunge in cardiac arrest
fatalities in those places, according to EMS spokesman Tom Lyons.
Fire departments statewide have seen similar success, according to
previous reports.
</P>
<P>
   And the American Heart Association promotes defibrillators as a
``very safe'' tool, one that helps slow the rapid pace of
deterioration in cardiac arrest patients, whose chances of survival
decline 10 percent every minute they lack treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For Michael Tighe, that time gap lasted just seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As they rushed to his seat, equipped with a defibrillator
installed on the plane just two days earlier, flight attendants did
not know their patient was about to become a poster boy for the
device.
</P>
<P>
   He already knew its benefits well. As community affairs director
for the Boston Public Health Commission, Tighe, now of Concord,
N.H., was part of the city's drive to install the machine in sports
arenas and shopping malls, convincing officials the easy-to-use
model works.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday's trip was intended to be a break from work _ a
trip to California to accompany his wife to a nursing conference,
and a way to visit his daughter there. When he collapsed four hours
into the flight, he lost consciousness and did not come to until he
was lying in a hospital bed in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall anything on the plane or anything,'' he said.
``You're just in a state of shock. I was overwhelmed, scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he added, ``I'm feeling a little queasy. But grateful.''

   ENTERTAIN-RESTAURANTS (New York) _ In a city where apartments

   WOMEN-CANCER (Undated) _ Women cancer survivors often go through

   DUANE-READE (New York) _ I first became a disciple of Duane
Reade in the mid-80s, when I would escape an entry-level job to
spend lunch hours at a branch of the drug chain. I loved the
concept of finding happiness for $20 one day and 20 cents the next.

   MAN-PURSE (Undated) _ The biggest obstacle to American males
adopting the European tradition of carrying a small shoulder,
underarm or hand-held bag _ perfect for housing all of one's
microscopic communications hardware, from cell phones to CD players
_ is that there's nothing appropriate to call these accessories. By
David Colman.
</P>
<P>
   ALUMINUM-XMAS-TREES (Undated) _ The new Hammacher Schlemmer
catalog is selling aluminum Christmas trees with rotating, electric
light color wheels that change the color of the tree every seven
seconds. The odd thing is not that these gaudy inorganic trees are
back in production, it's that I desperately want one. After a
decade of celebrating a tasteful Christmas with freshly cut
evergreens, I'm craving the over-the-top holiday artifice of my
youth. By Frank DeCaro.
</P>

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ A garden library has something in

has several hundred volumes now, some purchased new but more picked
up at used-book stores and rummage sales. By Cass Peterson.

TEST NOT, LEST YE BE TESTED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fur continues to fly over the state's student testing to
evaluate, educate, and then eventually elevate the kids who sooner
or later will have to take care of the rest of us. Under the dread
Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, half to two-thirds
of all the fourth, eighth and 10th graders fell short, into ``needs
improvement'' or ``failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there was a rush to the microphones by politicians
and professional educators. None of the pols, but many of the
teachers, groused that it is the tests themselves that ``need
improvement'' or are ``failing.'' The pols lined up behind Governor
Cellucci, who made a big deal of testing public school teachers in
the just-completed campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No politician who says he's for worse schooling can get elected
around here these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results are unacceptable,'' intoned our guv, who for the
last eight years has called himself ``the co-governor'' or ``the
acting governor'' while these ``unacceptable'' results were piling
up. Since Cellucci edged Attorney General Scott Harshbarger three
weeks ago, Harshbarger wrested a $6-billion-plus settlement from
the tobacco industry, the state's HMOs failed to agree to cover
prescription drugs for the elderly, the Patriots are bailing out
for Connecticut, and more than half of our 200,000 students are not
doing so hot. Did I leave anything out?
</P>
<P>
   All this does not exactly make Cellucci's first full term the
Second Coming. But, in the spirit of bonhomie and good fellowship
made famous by Dr. John Silber, Cellucci's stouthearted chairman of
the state Board of Education, I choose to look on the bright side.
In the three teacher certification tests given since April, the
failure rates were 59, 47 and 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you care if you are not raising some of those kids,
who'll be taught by some of those teachers? The short answer is:
It's in your own self-interest to have the best-educated workforce
possible. The quality of life for all of us improves if they are
taught better, and learn more.
</P>
<P>
   It will be their tax money, Social Security payroll
contributions, sense of social responsibility, notion of charity
and intrinsic goodness or badness upon which all those older
citizens will depend. The smarter the kids are, the more secure the
rest of us will be. We cannot improve their collective IQ; but we
can do a great deal about the quality and availabilty of their
education.
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine a point on it, but when the pablum is
running down your chin in the Happy Acres Nursing Home and Bingo
Parlor, wouldn't it be nice if the people who take care of you
could actually read the labels on your medicine bottle? And figure
out that 50 milligrams three times a day does not mean 5 milligrams
30 times daily? Catch my drift?
</P>
<P>
   When our State House worthies assembled to put the best possible
face on the gruesome test results, our governor scaled Churchillian
heights: ``We will not lower standards.'' Senate President
Birmingham defended the $2.8 billion the state spends annually on
our 1,868 public schools. House Speaker Finneran, officially blamed
by Lieutenant Governor-elect Jane Swift for driving the Patriots
out of Foxborough (an act for which I personally nominate Finneran
for the JFK Library's Profile in Courage Award), chimed in with
suitable cluck-clucking. I couldn't locate any Silber quotes in
Tuesday's Globe, but I've heard Dr. Jawn on TV say the results give
us a baseline to measure what needs to be improved, which makes
sense to me.
</P>
<P>
   I sampled the 10th grade English and science and technology
questions in Sunday's Globe. The math? No way; beyond my ken.
Modesty prevents my reporting my English score (Dave claims he went
seven-for-seven, which astonishes his copy editors and regular
readers _ Ed.) and I admit to muffing two of the 10
science-and-technology brain-twisters. The thought occurs:
</P>
<P>
   Why not a challenge, which I believe will be seconded by a
majority of fourth, eighth and 10th graders within hailing
distance? Why don't we invite our peerless leaders, Mr. Cellucci,
Lieutenant Governor-elect Swift, Messieurs Birmingham, Finneran, et
al., appropriate legislative chairmen, teachers union chiefs, all
the natterers who put their two cents in on ed reform, to take a
full dose of the 10th grade MCAS tests? Maybe we invite Mayor Tom
Menino, who invites us to grade his second term against progress in
the Boston schools, and his Superintendent Thomas Payzant, to take
the test too. Make a game of it.
</P>
<P>
   Charge admission, and use the cash to buy school computers.
Browbeat some newspaper and broadcast wisenheimers to take the
challenge, too.
</P>
<P>
   Would I be willing to risk ridicule by having my test scores
published? Why not? I risk ridicule three times a week by typing
this stuff. So I'll do it if they'll do it. We make the kids do it;
so why not force the tests, and the published scores, on those who
order up the tests? ``Test not, lest ye be tested yourself?''
Sounds kind of Biblical, don't it? I mean, doesn't it?

TURE'S HEATED WORDS STILL GLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kwame Ture was a hot flame frozen in time for uttering two
words. Ture, the former Stokely Carmichael, who died this month,
unleashed the phrase ``Black Power!'' Today, Black Power hardly
seems radical. Two months after shouting ``Black Power!'' in
Greenwood, Miss., during a 1966 march to protest the shooting of
civil rights activist James Meredith, Ture wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Power will mean if a Negro is elected sheriff, he can
end police brutality. If a black man is elected tax assessor, he
can collect funds for the building of better roads and schools
serving black people. ... Where black men have a majority, they
will attempt to use it to exercise control. ... Where Negroes lack
a majority, Black Power means proper representation and sharing of
control. It means the creation of power bases from which black
people can work to change statewide or nationwide patterns of
oppression through pressure from strength, instead of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   The America of 1966 was too exhausted from the battle to end
segregation in public accommodations and schools to deal rationally
with Ture. The FBI labeled Ture ``the long-range peril.'' Roger
Wilkins, the top-ranking African-American in the Justice
Department, once said that President Johnson ``despised us. ...
because we wouldn't put Stokely Carmichael in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people smoldered under Ture's heat. Some white liberals
were turned off by speeches laced with ``honky.'' He was known for
sexism, saying the only place in the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee for the black woman was prone. Many
African-Americans would not go as far as he did in his global
analysis of American violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in Vietnam, if I killed 30 yellow people who were
pointed out to me by white Americans as my enemy, I would be given
a medal,'' Ture said. ``If I were to kill 30 white policemen in
Washington, D.C., who have been brutalizing my people and who are
my enemy, I would get the electric chair.''
</P>
<P>
   But others listened to Ture with a more open ear, from students
who discovered that Black is Beautiful to Martin Luther King Jr.,
who never forgot how Ture went to jail to protest segregation and
for voting rights. Despite differences on tactics and semantics,
King and Ture kept a running dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time, just joking with him.'' Ture said of
King. ``I said, `You remember so and so?' He said, `Yeah.' I said,
`He got shot.' He said, `What? Where?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `In Vietnam. You told him to be nonviolent in
Mississippi. He didn't get shot there. But he got shot in Vietnam.
You should have told him to be nonviolent in Vietnam. That's what
your problem is. You didn't carry your stuff like you say you're
supposed to carry it.''
</P>
<P>
   In April of 1967, Ture received a phone call from King. ``He
called and said, `What are you doing?''' Ture said. ``I said,
`Tomorrow's Sunday.' He said, `Are you going to be a good Christian
and go to church? I said, `Well, like a good heathen, I'm going to
work for the people. I've got office paperwork. I'll be working
since six o'clock in the morning.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well, I want you to come to church.' I said, `Come
to church, where?' He said, `The Ebenezer.' I said, `What's
happening there?' He said, `I'm preaching.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well you know, OK, I can always come hear you preach,
you know. Because even though I don't believe in your stuff, you
make me tap my feet, you know.' We joked. And he said, `Well, I
really want you to come tomorrow.' I said, `OK, I'll come.' He
said, `Because tomorrow I'm going to make my statement against the
war in Vietnam.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think between us there must have been 35 seconds of
silence. And then I said to him. `I'm going to be on the front seat
of your church ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech was very beautiful. ... He used words in that
speech I could never use. I mean, if I were to use those words, I
would be dismissed as irresponsible. But he said, `The United
States government is one of the greatest purveyors of violence in
the world today.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ture would spend most of the rest of his life in Africa, forging
bonds between people of color around the world. His absence here
and the passage of time made it easy to reduce him to a slogan,
allowing the heat to keep us from the light. With crumbling public
schools and the widening gap between rich and poor, Ture's call for
power to be used by the people instead of against the people
remains as alive today as it was in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it not violent for a child to go to bed hungry in the
richest country in the world?'' Ture said. ``I think that is
violent. But that type of violence is so institutionalized that it
becomes part of our way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we accept poverty, we even find it normal. ...
This country assumes that if someone is poor. ... they made a
mistake. That's a lot of nonsense. ... A man is poor for one reason
and one reason only _ he does not have money.''

OFFSPRING'S WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americana.
</P>
<P>
   The word conjures up images of covered bridges and Thanksgiving
day sleigh rides to grandma's house, the old five-and-dime store, a
shave and a haircut (two bits!), mom baking an apple pie, a white
picket fence. All painted by Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   The Offspring entitled its latest album ``Americana.'' But these
are not the sort of images you'll find in the world of the caustic
Orange County-based punk rockers, who play the Palladium in
Worcester Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I grew up and where I live and what I see today,''
says Dexter Holland, singer-songwriter, ``it's really skewn into
something that's quite different from that. The norm from my area:
Every kid's got a tattoo and a nipple piercing, drives a 4-by-4,
and works at Burger King. The icons of America have changed from
what they might have been a generation ago _ it's McDonald's, Jerry
Springer, Bill Clinton's sex scandal, things coming around that are
a little less wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland, like many of, nutures a secret love of trash. ``You
can't help but be entertained,'' he says, ``just because of your
base instincts as a human. But at the same time you're trying to go
beyond and get above that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the more serious side, ``there's a sense of
disillusionment,'' Holland says. ``The common psyche, or American
psyche, is not like when dad grew up and got a stable job and was
with the company for 30 years. Different sets of realities, I just
thought to comment on. It's not supposed to be a masterpiece or an
expose. I would never like to come across as `Oh, look how
intellectual we are.' It's like in (the song) `Staring at the Sun':
How do you live your life? Make your own rules, don't let what
other people say get you down or influence your decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   As you may gather, Holland and his mates _ guitarist Noodles,
bassist Greg K., and drummer Ron Welty _ are a bit older and wiser
than your average punk band. On ``Americana,'' they wrap tales of
junk culture and dead-end lives around melodic, high-octane punk _
with a few twists. One of those would be ``Why Don't You Get a
Job,'' which musically sounds like a mix of the Beatles'
``Ob-la-di, ob-la-da'' and Simon and Garfunkel's ``Cecilia'' cooked
up Offspring style. ``It wasn't intentional, but I know those
things come out in our music sometimes,'' says Holland. ``I just
wanted to write a song musically reminiscent of a '60s song, a
singalong in a bar, a waving-your-mugs kind of thing. It's a
hodgepodge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, ``Americana'' is packed with ripsnorting rock
'n' roll, and dosed with a sprinkling of black comedy. The first
single from the album, ``Pretty Fly (for a White Guy),'' a poke at
suburban white wannabes mimicking inner-city black style, has
exploded all over rock radio. Its hokiness and novelty harken back
to ``Come Out and Play,'' the 1994 hit that catapulted the
Offspring into the platinum-plus stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a message,'' says Holland, ``you shouldn't try to be
something you're not. But it's done with a sense of humor, so it
doesn't sound preachy. When I was growing up, I knew kids who would
go with different fashion identities from one week to the next _
mod, ska, swing, whatever _ and I just picked on another guy _ the
regular suburban white kid that goes to the mall, buys Tommy
Hilfiger, and turns into a hip-hop guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another cool song is ``She's Got Issues,'' in which Holland zaps
a woman's reliance on trendy button-pushing words that are
disguised as insightful communication. She talks of ``baggage,'' of
``closure,'' of ``validation,'' of being a ``victim.'' Sings
Holland, in response: ``Now I now she'll feel abandoned/If I don't
stay over late/And I know she's afraid to commit/But it's only our
second date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't it drive you crazy?'' says Holland, of the buzzwords.
``What did people do in the '70s when they didn't have `closure' _
like when that word didn't exist? How did people get by? ... (The
song) is about people not really wanting to take responsibility and
wanting to blame it on some weird new psychobabble term.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ``Americana'' songs wrestle with defeatism, conformity and
isolation, unemployment, crime, prison, and death. They rewrite
Morris Albert's ``Feelings'' so that hatred is the feeling that
counts. ``It already had a kind of Southern California punk-rock
chorus with the `whoa-whoas' in it,'' says Holland. ``Originally
when you think of the song it was dippy and romantic, and it seemed
really appropriate to turn it on its side, make a '90s version that
would be very aggressive and angry.'' In ``The Kids Aren't
Alright''_ its title a twist on the old Who song _ Holland writes
about a decayed neighborhood and dashed dreams: One kid just smokes
pot and plays his guitar, another kills herself, a third ODs and
dies. Sings Holland: ``The cruelest dream, reality.'' There's a
whole lotta ennui going on.
</P>
<P>
   Is Holland the human as ticked off and negative as the songs
Holland the songwriter pens? ``Just because I sing something in the
first person doesn't mean it's autobiographical,'' he says. And by
sneaking a barbed lyric into a sharp pop song, the Offspring prop
up the old punk rock equation: You turn a negative into a positive
through the music.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans may wonder about the effect success has had on the
Offspring. Holland does too. ``We never expected to sell as many
copies of `Smash' as we did,'' he says. ``All of a sudden people
have this expectation _ they're keeping score based on sales and
you want to say, `There's more involved than that.' There is an
impact you can have with music that goes far beyond, or is very
different, from what the record sales are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smash'' sold 11 millions copies worldwide. The followup CD,
``Ixnay on the Hombre,'' sold 3 milion worldwide. Not chump change.
</P>
<P>
   So how non-punk is the Offspring?
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that punk rock, at this stage, can be
perceived less as a rebellion against the status quo and more as
another, if agitated, wing of pop culture. ``We've become
commentators on a more mainstream level,'' concurs Holland. ``You
think of bands like the Sex Pistols shouting `No future!' 20 years
ago and that was a very fringe, very extreme idea. Turn around 20
years and that's a very normal idea, where a kid feels like `Why
should I bother tyring to go to college 'cause I'm not gonna be
able to get a job anyway?' I might as well work at McDonald's and
smoke pot.'''
</P>
<P>
   How does the Offspring look at itself? At one level, their music
works to reassure, almost to comfort. Yet, it's still prickly,
bursting with rage. Where do they fit?
</P>
<P>
   Holland says they think about it. ``As a band, as people, maybe
it's something you never quite finish going through. I don't know,
maybe by the time you're Aerosmith you've got it all figured out.''

FATAL EXPOSURES AT PVC RESIN PLANT INFLICT DEATH, ILLNESS ON OHIO
TOWN 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM MORRIS 
1998, Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHTABULA, Ohio _ Francis McKinley's obituary is suggestive of
nothing more than the early death of a hard-working, decent man.
</P>
<P>
   Born Aug. 20, 1938, in Conneaut, Ohio. Put in 34 years at a
chemical plant in Ashtabula. Liked fishing, gardening and tinkering
with old cars, although his ``greatest joy came from spending time
with his family.'' Died Aug. 27, 1998, in a Cleveland hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettable, but hardly the stuff of intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Upon closer inspection, however, McKinley's passing becomes
noteworthy _ and, for the men who used to work with him, ominous.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley died of angiosarcoma, a rare cancer of the liver
associated with exposure to vinyl chloride, the main ingredient in
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic. His is the third confirmed case
to come out of a now-abandoned PVC resin plant run for 30 years by
Akron-based General Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. and another nine years by a
company called Vygen.
</P>
<P>
   This, in itself, is significant. Angiosarcoma _ whose appearance
among employees of a B.F. Goodrich PVC plant in Louisville 25 years
ago led to a regulatory crackdown on vinyl chloride _ is a
consequence of outmoded technologies and poor industrial-hygiene
practices. It is a disease the vinyl industry would very much like
to forget.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the keepers of an industry-supported angiosarcoma
registry stated in a confidential report that only 173 cases had
occurred worldwide, and that ``a few more'' could be expected. But
a more recent study from Croatia predicts that there will be 1,200
cases in the United States alone during the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the industry just wants to bury it and say it's
history, but it's not,'' said Dr. Laszlo Makk, a Louisville
pathologist who helped identify the earliest Goodrich cases.
</P>
<P>
   The story developing in Ashtabula, a city of 22,000 on Lake
Erie, has a number of compelling subplots. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   Internal company documents obtained by the Chronicle show that
General Tire workers in Ashtabula were overexposed to vinyl
chloride in the early 1980s, long after the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration established strict exposure limits for the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Although General Tire (renamed GenCorp in 1984) was considered a
beneficent employer, its conduct changed after angiosarcomas and
other cancers began to emerge from the Ashtabula plant.
Angiosarcoma victim Bill Price, who unexpectedly survived, was
tailed off and on for years by a GenCorp-retained private
investigator. The company was trying to prove that Price did not
deserve the full disability benefits he had been awarded by the
state of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   GenCorp, a defendant in a conspiracy lawsuit against 32 vinyl
chloride and PVC manufacturers, claims it has lost track of
employee medical records that a special court master ordered it to
produce. &UR;  &LR; Incredulous, the lead plaintiff's attorney has moved that
the company be held in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ashtabula plant was a logical candidate for
inclusion in a nationwide study of worker deaths in the vinyl
industry because of its age and its high vinyl chloride levels, it
was, inexplicably, left out. Critics say this is but one example of
how the industry-sponsored study was rigged to minimize the extent
of occupational disease.
</P>
<P>
   Citing litigation, GenCorp spokeswoman Rosemary Younts said that
she could not comment on the Ashtabula cancers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ex-workers grow uneasy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the former workers, meanwhile, are growing uneasy.
Francis McKinley's death hit them hard, got them thinking about all
the others who had died prematurely. (At least one of the victims
had serious liver damage in addition to his fatal colon cancer).
</P>
<P>
   One retiree, who asked that his name not be disclosed, has given
his wife explicit instructions: ``When I die, you do an autopsy on
me, and have the lawyer ready. If it's angiosarcoma, sue 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, such sentiments were unthinkable among the 135
or so employees of the Ashtabula plant. From the day it opened in
1954 until the first case of angiosarcoma was diagnosed in 1983,
times were good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plant was always a money-maker,'' said Blair Glink, 71, an
operator and foreman who started in 1960. ``We worked our tails
off. In the late '70s, we were making (PVC) resin as fast as we
could and shipping it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that they weren't rewarded. The pay was generous by
blue-collar standards; Glink recalls a year when the men were given
bigger raises than their union had requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great place to work,'' said former laboratory
technician Bob Glenn, 61. ``It was like a family thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The pleasantly sweet smell of vinyl chloride gas pervaded the
plant, but no one thought much about it. Workers began getting
mandatory physicals after the new OSHA standard took effect in
1975, but the danger didn't seem real to them until Bill Price got
sick eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   Price, now 66 and retired in Florida, had signed on with General
Tire in 1956. ``I was like a rover _ I did a lot of different
jobs,'' he said. ``I was around vinyl chloride all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alive but disabled &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1983, one of Price's routine blood tests showed
an abnormality, and he checked into the Cleveland Clinic. The
angiosarcoma diagnosis was confirmed and he went into emergency
surgery, in what was thought to be a futile effort to save his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of Price's liver was removed. To everyone's
astonishment, he survived, although he never returned to the plant.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1989, Price sought ``permanent and total'' disability
benefits from GenCorp through the Industrial Commission of Ohio.
Company officials argued that he was able to work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under surveillance &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission heard Price's case on Oct. 4, 1989, and he was
awarded $214 a week in lifetime benefits. Just days before the
hearing, GenCorp had hired Corporate Investigative Services of
Cleveland to stake out Price's home in North Kingsville; the aim
was to catch him mowing his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, 1989, GenCorp received disappointing news from
detective Dennis Drellishak. ``Surveillance was instituted at 8:10
a.m. at which time the home appeared to be closed up and the grass
also appeared to be freshly cut,'' Drellishak wrote. Price was
nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   As the years went by, GenCorp tried repeatedly to get Price to
settle his claim with a lump-sum payment of $75,000. He wouldn't do
it, and the industrial commission wouldn't reverse its decision, so
the surveillance continued.
</P>
<P>
   Price was videotaped square-dancing at a YMCA campground in
1991, and his employment, driving, medical and legal records were
checked in 1993, after he had moved to Murdock, Fla. No
incriminating evidence was found.
</P>
<P>
   Price said that he knew he was being watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I could do a little work, but I tired quickly,''
he said. ``I was kind of hurt that they'd pull this kind of stuff
on somebody who was supposed to have been dead. My diagnosis was
that I'd never walk out of the hospital.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GenCorp closed its Ashtabula plant in late 1984, and it reopened
about a year later as Vygen, a company founded by two PVC brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1989, another of the original General Tire workers,
Joseph Succi, was diagnosed with angiosarcoma and quickly
died. &UR;  &LR; His friends were flabbergasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast,'' Blair Glink said. ``There was no finer
gentleman than Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Settling a claim &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although GenCorp had reported Succi's case to the angiosarcoma
registry, it contested his widow's claim for death benefits, saying
his ailment could not have been work-related. Emotionally spent,
Dorothy Succi settled for $48,000.
</P>
<P>
   Had she persisted, she might have learned that conditions in the
plant were unhealthful long after the vinyl chloride threat had
been publicized and regulators had acted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made you think they'd made changes, but we always had the
high levels,'' said Bob Glenn. Indeed, a General Tire memorandum
dated Oct. 3, 1980, confirms that there were numerous equipment
leaks in the plant's polymer building and that some vinyl chloride
readings exceeded 10,000 parts per million _ 2,000 times the
short-term OSHA limit.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Succi also might have been interested in a Nov. 2, 1983,
company memo, which states: ``It is accepted within the medical and
scientific communities that VC (vinyl chloride) is the causal agent
of angiosarcoma in victims who have worked in the VC or PVC
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Others succumbed to cancer after Joe Succi, and some of these
deaths may have been work-related.
</P>
<P>
   Former General Tire production foreman Cliff Ranier, for
example, died in August 1996 of colon cancer _ not an unusual
illness for a man of 67. During surgery a year or so before his
death, however, doctors discovered that ``his whole liver was
bad,'' said his wife, Fay.
</P>
<P>
   Although she never sued GenCorp, Fay Ranier is certain that her
husband's liver damage was caused by 32 years of vinyl chloride
exposure. GenCorp's only acknowledgment of his death was a $14,000
life insurance payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never even got a card from them,'' she said. ``Not a
flower, not a card, nothing. It was like nothing had ever
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This year it was Francis McKinley's turn. He had been in
reasonably good health until late July, when his urine turned dark
and his face grew jaundiced.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `He went downhill fast' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They suspected liver cancer right away,'' said Kim Diliello,
one of McKinley's four daughters. ``He went downhill really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley entered the hospital on Aug. 17. He was diagnosed with
angiosarcoma on Aug. 23 and died four days later. He had just
turned 60.
</P>
<P>
   As McKinley's wife and six children ponder legal action against
GenCorp, the company is busy defending itself in a major conspiracy
lawsuit in Lake Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff's attorney William Baggett Jr. has alleged that
GenCorp and 31 other firms agreed to cover up evidence of vinyl
chloride's toxicity and to water down an industry-funded,
nationwide worker-mortality study.
</P>
<P>
   Baggett is seeking records from Ashtabula that GenCorp claims it
no longer has. ``Vygen assumed custody and control of all the
operating and personnel documents'' when it took over the plant,
said GenCorp's Rosemary Younts, and Vygen's principals cannot be
located.
</P>
<P>
   Baggett, nonetheless, has moved for contempt charges against
GenCorp, which is under a court order to disclose every case of
cancer that has occurred among former plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``GenCorp's implication that such records have just sort of
disappeared into some sort of `defunct' Vygen ether is inconsistent
with federal law,'' says a memo Baggett wrote in support of his
motion.
</P>
<P>
   The OSHA record-keeping standard is ambiguous as to whether
GenCorp was obligated to keep the data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's own documents refer to a section of OSHA's
1975 vinyl chloride rule, which says that an employer must keep a
worker's medical and exposure records for the duration of
employment plus 30 years. One memo raises the possibility that ``we
are going to be sued by an employee or ex-employee alleging that
his exposure to vinyl chloride resulted in present physical
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Baggett: ``When a company, in effect, admits they have
violated a record-retention policy, I think you're fair to infer
that they have something to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Clark, the plant nurse for 10 years, heard the
missing-records story some time ago _ from men who tried to get the
results of their physicals from GenCorp _ and found it ``very
spooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that she supervised the loading of all Ashtabula
medical files onto a truck bound for Akron in 1984. ``That was a
big file cabinet,'' she said. ``It wasn't easy to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Baggett also finds it curious that the plant _ which by 1969 had
logged several cases of acroosteolysis, a painful hand condition
linked to vinyl chloride exposure, and had participated in a secret
acroosteolysis study _ was not included in the nationwide mortality
study, begun in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   His position is that GenCorp ``should have known this was a very
high-risk population. There seems to have been a significant amount
of nonmalignant vinyl chloride disease at the plant. Anyone in
their right mind wanting to conduct honest science would have said,
`Why aren't we studying our workers from this, one of the oldest
plants in the country?' We can only assume that they knew they
wouldn't like what they found.''
</P>
<P>
   Younts said that she had no idea why Ashtabula was left out of
the study. The man in the best position to know, retired General
Tire health and safety director Robert Laundrie, did not return
calls to his Akron home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conditions worsen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By several accounts, conditions at the plant worsened under
Vygen. Francis McKinley, its head of maintenance, told his wife,
Marian, that the place was dirty. ``They didn't want to do any
cleaning,'' she said. ``He was really disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Long, another of McKinley's daughters, said that her
husband worked at Vygen in the late 1980s and was once overcome by
vinyl chloride vapors inside a PVC reactor.
</P>
<P>
   He had no respiratory protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vygen was out of control compared to General,'' said Bob
Glenn. ``They were concerned with the bottom line, and that was
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vygen's owners from 1985 to 1992, Ron Hornack and Jack McCarthy,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 until it closed for good in 1994, Vygen was run by a
Korean chemical company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things seemed to deteriorate more,'' Glenn said. ``We always
thought they were just after our technology.'' Many of the former
workers are still owed money; Francis McKinley had $4,580 coming
when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Today the plant _ propped up for years by $1.7 million in
economic development grants and loans, some of which were not
repaid _ is a decaying shell. Gaping holes in one building denote
where the 18 &UR;  &LR; reactors were pulled out to be sold for scrap. It's
hard to envision it as a profitable, upbeat workplace.
</P>
<P>
   GenCorp, by contrast, is very much alive. It's gotten out of the
PVC-resin and tire businesses and is concentrating on rocket
engines, tennis balls and wall coverings. It reported sales of just
under $1.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture is based on openness, teamwork, accountability,
responsiveness, a passion for continuous improvement and a focus on
meeting the expectations of our customers,'' the company proclaims
on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our journey continues to gain momentum, and, needless to say,
these are exciting times for us!''
</P>
<P>
   The Ashtabula men who helped build GenCorp do not share its
enthusiasm. They have more pressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Succi, Cliff Ranier, Francis McKinley and other old friends
are gone. Who, the survivors wonder, will be next? &QL;

NEW CONTRACT ALLOWS PHISH TO RECORD FREELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Vermont-based jam band Phish has always operated with a lot
of freedom _ and that freedom just got even wider with a recent
contract extension from Elektra Records. ``They're giving us more
and more leeway to do what we want to do,'' says Phish bassist Mike
Gordon. ``They always have, and now it's particularly free for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   While other bands might be straitjacketed into their record
deals, Phish's new three-album pact with Elektra allows the band to
put out a variety of ``esoteric'' albums on its own, through its
fan club newsletter which now has 150,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of ideas for different kinds of albums,'' says
Gordon. ``We'd like to put out an instrumental album, an acoustic
album, a house music album, whatever we can dream up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all kinds of ideas floating around. And we're thinking
of different kinds of live albums,'' says Gordon. ``The only thing
is, Elektra always gets first choice if they want to put it out. If
they don't want it, then we can put it out through the
newsletter.''
</P>
<P>
   Phish has other side projects brewing as well. Singer/guitarist
Trey Anastasio has a new solo album, pulled from his archives of
four-track recordings. And Gordon, who studied film at the
University of Vermont, has a new feature film that he's expecting
to release next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there are 50 hours of footage that went into it and
1,500 hours of editing so far,'' says Gordon. ``I've been working
on it for three years now, in between tours. It's called `The
Outstructional Video.' It's the story of a boy who gets this thing
called the `Outstructional Video' to learn how to play guitar. It's
a drama and it's weird, but actually the editing style is very
conventional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has Colonel Bruce Hampton in it,'' Gordon says, referring
to a musician friend of Phish. ``And it stems from my perspective
on his philsophy of unlearning, instead of learning (how to play
guitar). There will also be some Bruce Hampton music in it and,
after this tour, I'm going back to my home studio to maybe record
some ambient music and ambient sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also have a cameo in it,'' says Gordon. ``I play a country
music star. My name in the film is Mike Gizzard.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of playing together, Gordon says it's
``necessary'' for Phish members _ including keyboardist Page
McDonnell and drummer Jon Fishman _ to branch out into some side
projects to keep the group fresh when it reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
   Phish has branched out with some unexpected activities this
year. The group played the Farm Aid concert (jamming with Neil
Young on ``Down by the River'') and joined Young's Bridge School
benefit for handicapped children in San Francisco. ``Neil invited
all the bands to his ranch. I guess he has a party every year, the
night before the show. It was a real joyous occasion,'' says
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Phish also surprised observers by performing songs from a Velvet
Underground album (``Loaded'') on Halloween, then soon thereafter
playing the entirety of Pink Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon''
during a show in Utah. ``We learned the record in two hours and
played it in the middle of the second set. We were all familiar
with the album and that made it easier ... It wasn't perfect, but
it was fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it in Utah partly because it was one of the only shows
on the tour where there was only a small percentage of the house
that was sold. So we decided to teach a lesson to (fans) who were
on tour with us but skipped Utah. We wanted to show them that the
really unexpected stuff is gonna happen in the middle of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And, speaking of happening in the middle of nowhere, Phish is
still reveling in the success of its ``Lemonwheel'' concert
festival in upstate Maine this summer, attended by 60,000-plus
diehards. The festival setting had a ferris wheel and a rock garden
on the premises, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about another spectacle next year, but we might
vary the setting. It may be in the Southeast or halfway down the
coast, or maybe in Colorado. But it wouldn't be quite the same. It
might be a medium spectacle. And then we'd save it up for a big
millennium thing which is sort of being worked on now, but
nothing's being said yet.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Future of stadium shows: With the New England Patriots
supposedly leaving for a new stadium in Hartford in the year 2001,
there is concern about how the concert market will be affected.
Will acts still come to Foxboro Stadium or switch to the new
Hartford venue? Look for acts to play both, says Dave Marsden,
director of events for the SFX/Don Law Company. ``If it's the
Rolling Stones, the Dave Matthews Band or whomever, they're not
going to skip the Boston market,'' says Marsden. ``This is not
football. The bands need to play the Boston market for record sales
and for radio play. I think they would just add an extra date in
Hartford.'' And don't look for Fenway Park to pick up the slack,
though Paul McCartney did ask the Law Agency to look into playing
at Fenway Park in the early '90s. ``The Fenway people told us to
come in and look around, but holding a show there just wasn't
practical,'' says Marsden. ``There is very old irrigation and there
are weight limits on the field. It just wouldn't work for today's
concerts.''

EVEN WITHOUT STAR POWER, `ON THE TOWN' GLITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even the most jaded of us can appreciate the
appearance of a true celebrity onstage. We might roll our eyes when
the audience applauds a star's initial entrance and grudgingly get
to our feet for a standing ovation following his or her mediocre
performance. Still, it is understandable why theatergoers get as
big a charge from seeing a celebrity in the flesh as audiences do
when a rock star steps to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the big thrills on Broadway these days aren't in seeing
Holly Hunter in ``Impossible Marriage,'' Martin Short in ``Little
Me,'' or Christian Slater in ``Side Man.'' Among the plays and
musicals recently opened, the best bang for the buck is George C.
Wolfe's revival of ``On the Town.'' The original brought together
the talents of Leonard Bernstein, Jerome Robbins, Adolph Green,
Betty Comden, George Abbott, and Nancy Walker, and audiences must
have realized they had been introduced to a new generation of
musical-theater super-talent.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lea DeLaria and Wolfe himself are the only members of
this revival in the same performing-arts boat, &UR;  &LR; this ``On the
Town'' remains true to the exuberant spirit of the 1944 original, a
spirit that embraced a certain immaturity if not amateurishness. As
the critic Louis Kronenberger wrote at the time,  &UR;  &LR; ``It has its
faults, but even they are engaging, for they are the faults of
people trying to do something different, of people willing to take
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of three sailors in 1944 on 24-hour shore leave has
always had a naive quality, of couples meeting cutely in the days
when men were guys and women were dolls. Bernstein as composer and
Comden and Green as lyricists (and actors) then infused that
naivete with musical and verbal wit while celebrating New York as a
metaphor for living life as a kid in a candy store.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the city has bounced back into the public consciousness
as a safe and exciting place to visit or live, a revival of ``On
the Town'' is particularly apt. Like the original creative team,
Wolfe goes beyond the surface naivete, and he updates New York
without forcing the musical into places it doesn't want to go. No
one has made as good a case for multicultural theater as Wolfe has
since taking over at the Public Theater in 1993. Just as his
staging of ``The Tempest'' two years ago successfully infused
anti-colonial politics onto Shakespeare, ``On the Town'' presents
New York as a contemporary melting pot. The sailors, the women who
fall for them, and the supporting cast are a rainbow coalition.
 &UR;  &LR; Additionally, DeLaria has been primarily known until now for her
work as a comedian and singer in gay and lesbian theater. And the
choreographer, Keith Young, comes from a different kind of musical
theater _ Madonna's live shows and music videos.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is far too sophisticated to suggest that ``On the Town''
reflects a color- and gender-blind society. Rather, he's showing
the sheer joy of what that society would look like if it did exist.
And for the most part, the talent he has assembled furthers that
vision. DeLaria, as Hildy the brash-to-the-max cab driver, is the
showstopper, following in the footsteps of Nancy Walker in the
original and Tyne Daly in the semi-staged concert version of six
years ago. Her solo, ``I Can Cook Too,'' is the undeniable
highlight, but it's the enormity of her presence that takes the
production to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Tai Jimenez as Ivy ``Miss Turnstyles'' Smith was tapped from
Dance Theatre of Harlem, and though her acting isn't fine-tuned,
she delivers a startlingly balletic beauty and grace. Almost
everyone and every thing in this production starts out a bit too
shrill but quickly settles into a winning rhythm, including Sarah
Knowlton's delightful Claire DeLoone, an archeologist in search of
a cave man. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The music and lyrics hold up surprisingly well, but Wolfe
perhaps might have been better off only juicing up Robbins's
choreography rather than reinventing the wheel, as Young does. The
choreography has been a problem ever since last summer's staging in
Central Park and Young's isn't at all bad; it just doesn't add
anything here that wasn't done better by Robbins. The production
might have done better letting Young swing for more contemporary
fences.
</P>
<P>
   The big disappointment, though, is Perry Laylon Ojeda's Gaby,
the sailor who falls for a poster of Miss Turnstiles on the subway
and then enlists his pals and their girlfriends to find her. His
two ballads, ``Lonely Town'' and ``Lucky to Be Me'' should bring
the house down, but Ojeda's voice is too thin to cause a rumble.
That serves to highlight that in this ``Town,'' it's the women who
are the focal point. The men are going off to war, but the women
are flexing their muscles. This may be the last time you'll see
DeLaria in a dress because Hildy, Claire, and Ivy are about to
assert their equal rights to wear the pants in their families.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Little Me &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town'' looks particularly good stacked up against
``Little Me,'' the Cy Coleman-Neil Simon musical that was written
as a star vehicle for Sid Caesar and is now resurrected as a star
turn for Martin Short. Short isn't the little one of the title;
that's Faith Prince as the Mae West-ish girl from the wrong side of
the tracks who more or less sleeps her way from rags to riches.
Unfortunately, Prince's bra is the only miracle in a performance
and production that has nothing but Short's controlled
manic-ness &UR;  &LR; and a sexy ensemble to recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   Short plays a variety of roles with the same aplomb he brought
to his ``SCTV'' and ``Saturday Night Live'' characters. Maybe a bit
too much of the same aplomb, as his variations of Ed Grimley and
Jackie Rogers Jr. make you realize Short concocted better comic
characters than Simon did. Like much of Coleman's work, the score
is pleasant and instantly forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Impossible Marriage
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beth Henley didn't write ``Impossible Marriage'' for Holly
Hunter, but she says she had Hunter in mind while writing. Both
have made careers out of oddball tics and off-center musings, but
they're starting to get awfully tiresome, particularly when they
get together. (This is their seventh collaboration.) Henley pairs
both Hunter and Gretchen Cleevely, the young girl in the
Huntington's ``Arcadia,'' with the most inappropriate men
imaginable. We're supposed to exult in their Savannah-styled
eccentricity, but Hunter delivers all her lines as if she's
imitating Lily Tomlin's Edith Ann. Not that Henley gives her much
to work with. Cleevely, on the other hand, throws herself into her
role with enough energy to make you think you might be seeing
something more than outtakes from Henley's earlier ``Crimes of the
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Side Man
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; A star can anchor a production in unexpected ways. Casting
Hollywood bad boy Christian Slater as the only nice person in
``Side Man'' gives Warren Leight's transplant from off-Broadway an
odd kind of warmth and reassurance. Slater plays the son of a jazz
trumpeter. He can walk the swaggering walk, talk the hipster talk,
and laugh the open-mouthed laugh with the best of them, though
he'll never be a Clifford Brown, the trumpeter he worships.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wood is superb as Gene, the father who starts the play
with the optimism of an ``On the Town'' sailor and ends with the
sadness of someone who has seen changing tastes render him
obsolete. As he and his pals watch Elvis on Ed Sullivan  &UR;  &LR; we know
what he doesn't _ time is not on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Not that life was so grand before that, even though Slater's
Clifford _ named after Mr. Brown _ says, in flashback, ``From what
I understand, everybody was happy before I was born.'' Gene was
always a better artist than a person, and Leight is at his best
when developing that theme, particularly with the aid of musical
selections. I'm not as impressed as others, though, at the extent
of that development. As Gene becomes less able to provide for his
family, his wife (Wendy Makkena) goes from Lucy Ricardo to Alice
Kramden to a hysteric out of Carol Burnett's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Slater's Clifford tries to stay loyal to both of them and his
efforts underline the toll that Gene's life takes on his family. In
the end, though, it's Gene we care about, and Leight doesn't give
us enough insight into his passion. The scenes with his fellow
musicians are entertaining, but they go only so far. Gene could
never be Clifford Brown, but Leight isn't Eugene O'Neill or any of
the other great theatrical chroniclers of family dysfunction. And
though there's solid ensemble acting here, ``Side Man'' doesn't
quite capture what it meant to be part of a solid ensemble jazz
group.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(`On the Town'' is at the Gerswhin Theatre; ``Side Man'' is at the
John Golden Theatre; ``Little Me'' and ``Impossible Marriage'' are
at the Roundabout Theatre Company.)

OUR FURNISHINGS, OURSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARGO MILLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ Myrna Kaye's latest book on the social
history of American furniture bears the catchy title, ``There's a
Bed in the Piano.'' It pays tribute to one Charles Hess of
Cincinnati, who had the very American idea of improving on the
commonplace. He must have looked at the wasted space under pianos,
and operating on the principle that nature abhors a vacuum, filled
it with a trundle bed that pulled out from under the piano pedals.
Hess didn't stop there. A piano, and this was the old, square
spinet, is really a piece of case furniture, deriving, as most
furniture does, from the box or chest. Chairs are nothing more than
boxes that have grown a back, Kaye explains. Bureaus are boxes
stacked within a box. A piano is a mallet-struck harp in a box.
Hess simply filled in around the edges until his piano case
sprouted drawers and cubbies and cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   And still Hess pressed on. His piano stool is even more
marvelous. On two small drawers he placed a little cabinet and on
this a round swivel seat whose top folded back to reveal ... a
mirror. Stand this piano stool on the piano case, and, voila! a
shaving stand. For his ``Wardrobe, Piano and Bedstead,'' Hess
received patent number 56,413 on July 17, 1866. In the drawing that
accompanied the patent application, Hess provided sheet music for
the piano rack. The song title? ``Rock Me to Sleep, Mother.'' Now,
there's a man who knew marketing, but there's no evidence, alas,
that Hess's cunning space-saver ever went into production.
</P>
<P>
   For something like 35 years now, Myrna Kaye has been educating
herself and writing on furniture and how we use it. Her engaging
``There's a Bed in the Piano'' (Bulfinch/Little Brown, $38.50)
tells America's story from colonial days to the present. Each wave
of immigrants brought its own furniture and one of the riches of
Kaye's book is its regard for Scandinavian, German, Italian, and
Hispanic furniture sources.
</P>
<P>
   She also looks closely at housing. The house, she says, is the
box that contains all the other boxes. Some time in the 18th
century, American houses began growing boxes on their exteriors.
Depending where we live, we call them porches or verandas or
piazzas. Kaye pondered their origin, and eventually decided they
came to America about 1730 from West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Kaye to describe her own house and furnishings and she
replies ``Early UN.'' It occasionally appears in her lavishly
illustrated book as a ``private residence.'' The reporter who has
trekked all the way to outer Lexington to inspect same is very
wrong to suppose the trim red house on the knoll began as a
farmhouse. ``We built it,'' Kaye beams.
</P>
<P>
   She has bright brown eyes, porcelain skin, and a cloud of white
hair in a Psyche knot. Long residence in New England has scarcely
dimmed her New York accent. When amused or delighted, often both
together, she crows with laughter. She's a hand-patter, too, which
makes tea in the Kayes' kitchen as cozy as the cozy on the teapot.
</P>
<P>
   Studying furniture was Kaye's way of surviving a dislocation.
Myrna and Murray Kaye had moved to Lexington when he, an
electronics engineer, had found work. (He is now retired from
Raytheon Co.) They arrived on Labor Day and by the first of
November it had snowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, I have to do something to make New England home. I
looked around and saw all these weather vanes,'' Myrna Kaye said.
``I started studying the different vanes and wrote 10 up as
articles and I wrote to Robb Sagendorph, who was editor of Yankee
(magazine). I said, `You can have one weather vane for each month,
and here are the first three.' He said `I should write an antiques
column for Yankee.' I said, `I don't know anything about antiques.'
He said, `Well, you didn't know anything about weathervanes. You've
got 12 months to learn antiques.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Kaye began volunteering at museums, figuring she could learn
fastest from curators. One was Jonathan Fairbanks at Boston's
Museum of Fine Arts. ``They had only recently got a department of
American decorative arts, and I said I knew how to dust furniture
and clean and I would do that for them in exchange for letting me
take things apart and learn about how they were made.'' She then
helped catalog the collection. She did somewhat the same thing at
the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities,
spending hot summers in stifling attics and cold winters in
unheated houses studying its collections. With the society's Brock
Jobe she wrote ``New England Furniture: The Colonial Era.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever tried to write with someone else? Very difficult
to write with a joint voice. I would put things in in my voice and
Brock would take them out. I put in zingers to break him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first solo as author was ``Fake, Fraud, or Genuine?
Identifying Authentic American Antiques,'' which is still in print
as a paperback. Her new book has a few zingers, but mostly she is a
eager storyteller. She opens her book and pores over the
illustrations. She marvels that Navajo blankets were used as
roll-up doors. She speculates that the American tractor seat was
the likely source of the cantilevered chair by the modern Finnish
designer, Alvar Aalto.
</P>
<P>
   Quicker than you can say ``decanter,'' she reads ``The Dinner
Party,'' the Henry Sargent classic painted about 1821, as though it
were an open book. She notes the internal and external shutters on
the windows. She notes the crumb cloth laid under the table to
protect the good carpet. The long mirror between the windows
reflects candlelight back into the room, raising the candlepower.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror reminds Kaye of one of her claims to fame, the
invention of the word, ``fawbit,'' which she likes to have rendered
in dark black type in her books. It is an acronym standing for
``fictional accounts without basis in truth.'' It's a fawbit when
someone tells you the reason pier tables have mirrors behind the
lower shelf is so that women could check their petticoats. It's a
fawbit to insist that the low chair called the slipper chair was
purposely designed to allow women to put their slippers on easily.
(Kaye is particularly good on the forms of chairs.) And it's a
fawbit to maintain that the ``egg and dart'' motif in architectural
moldings symbolizes the extremes of life, birth and death, with the
egg for birth and the dart for death.
</P>
<P>
   But a life's own experience can hold truth. Take Kaye's
explanation of porches. She had noticed they start appearing about
1730. No one American architect could have been responsible for the
porches that cropped up along the Mississippi, along the Hudson, in
such southern cities as Charleston and Savannah, and in the West
Indies. The first ``plantation'' style porch in Boston was probably
on Sears Wharf. Double-tiered, it encircled the house built about
1795 by Crowell Hatch, a West Indian. For rich merchants building
country estates in Brookline, such porches were just the thing for
summer living. Three still exist in Brookline, including Green
Hill, the Thomas Handasyd Perkins house later owned by Isabella
Stewart Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   One common American porch, Kaye knew simply by looking, derives
from the temple pediment found on Greek revival houses. But what
about the veranda porch that sweeps around a house at ground level?
Some historians thought they were Caribbean, brought here by
slaves. Kaye would agree but thinks the real origin is West Africa.
Porches, she points out, are ``especially effective in hot, wet
areas,'' like the Bight of Biafra. The first slaves to reach North
America had come from the hot, dry parts of Africa; there were few
of them and they tended to live under the same roof as their
owners. ``In the first decade of the slave trade, the Bight of
Biafra exported 50,000 souls, and the trade from elsewhere
diminished,'' Kaye writes. As field hands on Southern plantations,
these West Africans were housed together well away from their
owners. Like all other immigrants, they built the habitation they
knew, in this case, huts with steep roofs overhanging porches. The
idea soon spread.
</P>
<P>
   The social history of furniture is more than the history of
artisanry. Kaye has to know not just national differences but
regional, and travel helps inform her eye. She has to know how we
behave. She has to know what we ate and eat, and how we dressed and
dress. We of the blue jeans generation sprawl but our parents sat.
Of a certain age, she went to school when whole classes lined up
alphabetically. There was Phyllis Handel, and Phyllis Hanshaft, and
Myrna Hechel as she was then, and Phyllis Hershkowitz. She laughs.
``Of course, I can't tell the three Phyllises what I know now about
their name, that it was considered rustic and people named their
female slaves Phyllis.''
</P>
<P>
   The final chapter of ``There's a Bed in the Piano'' is called
``Messages from Home'' and deals with what our rooms say about us.
Kaye calls the house ``stage and sanctuary.'' Hers is that too.
There's a modern sunporch (with Jacuzzi) off the kitchen and a
living room that shows how to live comfortably with antiques.
</P>
<P>
   In the upstairs guest room is a tall, six-drawer Victorian
bureau. Kaye tells its story to introduce her book. As a piece of
mass-produced furniture, this bureau is nothing wonderful.
``Probably Grand Rapids,'' says Kaye. But the lines are nice. She
thinks it was a man's bureau and that in the two shallow top
drawers he would have kept his handkerchiefs and his stiff,
detachable collars. The bureau was secondhand by the time her
grandmother Mary Caspe spotted it during an outing to the theater
on New York's Lower East Side in the early 1900s. The furniture
store wanted $6, a dollar a drawer. Mary and Samuel Caspe, not long
in America, had five children; and Mary thought to herself, each
child could have a drawer, the older the child the bigger the
drawer; but Zelda (who would be Myrna Kaye's mother) would get two
``because she was a schoolgirl.'' Sam Caspe's arithmetic was a bit
different: A dollar a child, five dollars. The store saw the wisdom
in that. The years pass; Zelda has Myrna and Myrna has Stephen; and
Myrna asks her grandmother for the old bureau for her son. Her
grandmother, pleased, tells her its history. Which, she makes
plain, is part of a larger history. ``You want the whole bureau
should be for Stephen. I wanted each child should have a drawer.
Each of your children has a room. Grandpa would have enjoyed that.
Such a country, America.''

A EUROPEAN'S VIEW ON HOW MONEY MAKES THE MOVIES

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
MOVIES AND MONEY 
By David Puttnam 
Knopf, 337 pp., illustrated, $27.50 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 11 years ago, David Puttnam was ousted as the head of
Columbia Pictures in a battle over movies and money.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 months at the helm, the Oscar-winning producer of
``Chariots of Fire'' was unceremoniously shipped back to his native
England with only his Academy Award to keep him warm. As a producer
he won prizes; as an executive he was a dismal failure.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Puttnam was a quixotic idealist tilting at Hollywood.
He was seen as an arrogant foreigner trying to tell the American
film industry, the most successful filmmakers in the world, how to
conduct their business. To others, he was a visionary alchemist
trying to create gold from that odd stew of art and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam's concept of Columbia Pictures was to have a studio that
mixed a few independent films into the megaplex mixmaster. For
every ``Ghostbusters,'' he wanted a ``Local Hero.'' Even if the
latter was a box-office failure, he gave it support. In a variation
on noblesse oblige, he firmly believed that the big-budget hits had
a moral obligation to support their low-budget brethren.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Movies and Money,'' a thoughtful history of the influence
of money on film, Puttnam doesn't make his stand on artistic
grounds. He stakes out solid economic turf.
</P>
<P>
   His compelling sense of history sent Puttnam back to the days
when film was in its infancy _ the days when an art became an
industry. It seems that each time the creators had a chance to
assume control from either Thomas A. Edison or Jack Warner, they
caved in to commerce. Movies became investments just like ball
bearings and pork belly futures. If they made money, that was good.
If they didn't, that was bad.
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam is not opposed to films that make money. But he doesn't
think that profit should be the sole reason for their existence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, at a press junket to promote ``The Mission'' (starring
Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro, script by Robert Bolt), Puttnam
spoke about his plans for Columbia. One particular film that
intrigued him was ``Housekeeping,'' based on Marilynne Robinson's
novel, to be directed by Scotsman Bill Forsyth. The commercial
forces at Columbia desperately wanted Diane Keaton for the part.
She wanted to play it and the ``Annie Hall'' star had a name. But
Forsyth and Puttnam held out for Christine Lahti. They won. Lahti
was sensational in the complicated comedy but it dropped dead at
the box office. The bean counters were furious, and that was the
beginning of the end for David Puttnam.
</P>
<P>
   One of the telling things about ``Movies and Money'' is that
Puttnam has toned down his own indignation. Formerly, the British
producer of such films as ``The Killing Fields'' and ``Midnight
Express'' railed against the American philistines. But he has
calmed down. He pleads for the European community to stand up for
its own culture, and he voices fear of the triumph of American
cultural imperialism. But he points out that ``The Crying Game''
became a hit because the Americans promoted it, while Europeans
believe ``that a good film shouldn't have to be marketed at all,
that the public will somehow instinctively find and appreciate
artistic quality without the assistance of a vulgar marketing
campaign.'' And he explains how money influences movies not only in
Hollywood but in Europe, in the past as well as in the present.
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam's not in the movie business anymore. He's a lecturer at
the London School of Economics, a chancellor at the University of
Sunderland, a member of the House of Lords, and a knight of the
British Realm. But he doesn't make movies.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there are several sections of ``Movies and Money''
that are drier than stale shortbread. Box office comparisons lead
straight to confusion over dollars-to-pounds conversions, and some
of Puttnam's prose could use a little spice. But overall, ``Movies
and Money'' is a reasonable, intelligent man's attempt to salvage
the artistic soul and economic strength of European cinema at a
time when it's threatened by American homogeneity. And his case is
important not only for Britain but for Americans as well, because
the more diverse the international cinema the better chance there
is for us to see something worthwhile.

`MEMORY'S NATION' LEAVES NO PLYMOUTH ROCK UNTURNED

MEMORY'S NATION 
The Place of Plymouth Rock 
By John Seelye 
University of North Carolina Press, 699 pp., illustrated,  
<TEXT>
<P>
   $39.95 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Plymouth, Mass. agreed to pay $135,000 to settle legal
issues arising from the arrest of some two dozen American Indian
activists last Thanksgiving, most of the money was earmarked for
educational programs and historical markers that will present the
Native American side of the events associated with Plymouth Rock.
</P>
<P>
   In the European-American tradition, the landing of the Pilgrims
in 1620 _ maybe on Plymouth Rock, maybe just on the beach _ has
been interpreted and commemorated as the birth of freedom and
democracy in a brave and fresh new world. But the Indians have a
counter-tradition that regards the landing as the start of a brutal
destruction of a people of an already existing world.
</P>
<P>
   For historian John Seelye, such conflict about the meaning of
Plymouth comes as no surprise. As he shows in ``Memory's Nation,''
these conflicts began almost before the first generation of
settlers had died out, though the earlier conflicts were fought
from church pulpits, on museum walls, and at commemorative
banquets.
</P>
<P>
   In an extensive and often entertaining study of the place of
Plymouth Rock in the national memory, Seelye finds ``in the
American heart an enduring affection for the events of 1620,''
however those events have been interpreted. And while that
affection may not survive the current challenge, it persisted _
perhaps even grew stronger _ as the political foundation of the
rock's symbolic importance diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Well into the 19th century, Seelye writes, the rock was used to
define _ even proclaim _ New England's exceptional status in
American history, when ``the round world was seen in New England as
radiating out in a vast circle from that central point.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the tercentenary of the landing, in 1920 _ where Seelye
ends his account, except for a wistful recollection of a
Valentine's Day weekend in Plymouth a few years ago _ New England's
glory days were long over. ``The rest is cellar holes and Robert
Frost,'' he writes _ a phrase so suggestive that it may never again
be possible to think of New England without hearing those words
droning in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Seelye is a professor of American literature at the University
of Florida, and ``Memory's Nation'' is a work of firm scholarship,
but he is very personally engaged in the story. Forget the
re-created Plimoth Plantation, the ``well-dusted artifacts in
Pilgrim Hall or the tawdry souvenirs,'' Seelye urges his readers.
Instead, ``return to that place and stand looking seaward on a
wintry day. The image you behold is what you project upon that gray
sea and sky and will be as true as any other. So long as there is a
need for such an image, it will have the power of an icon, and you
will not be alone upon that margin, nor will they,'' the Pilgrims
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It took some time for the rock to become an icon. In 1714, it
almost became the foundation for a wharf. It began to be used as a
patriotic symbol only on the eve of the Revolution, when the local
``Liberty Boys'' suggested hauling the rock up next to their
Liberty Pole, ``so closely were their ancestors and the slogans of
the Revolution coupled.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after the Revolution, Seelye writes, the rock
became a rallying symbol for New England Federalists. At the 1798
celebration of the landing, ``the Federalists were clearly in
charge.'' By evening's end _ after a traditional meal of wild game
and fish _ ``the toasts became even more sectionally partisan,''
celebrating the fisheries and the region as ``this incalculable
source of wealth and nursery of seamen.'' And the festivities ended
as the celebrants ``hoisted glasses of pure vitriol to Jeffersonian
Republicans,'' calling for the defeat of particularly hated
Jeffersonian senators and representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Webster (``a Federalist at heart,'' Seelye writes) was a
frequent orator at Plymouth celebrations, in 1820 attacking the
Missouri Compromise under which that territory was admitted as a
slave state (as a balance to free Maine). ``Let us pledge ourselves
here, upon the Rock of Plymouth,'' said Webster, ``to extirpate and
destroy (slavery). It is not fit that the land of the Pilgrims
should bear the shame longer.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``while a fragment of Plymouth Rock remains,'' the
abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison later declared, it would
``rebuke the pharisaical devotee, the trimming demagogue, the
facile conformist, the cowardly persecutor, the effeminate
self-seeker'' who supported slavery.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 19th century, the Yankee establishment had long
since forgotten that its ancestors were immigrants and expropriated
the rock, ``protected behind granite columns, (as) a symbol of
exclusion.'' But writers like John Dos Passos turned the symbolism
around, asking, in a reference to the convicted anarchist
Bartolomeo Vanzetti (who had worked at the Plymouth Cordage Works
and peddled fish in North Plymouth), whether the establishment
realized ``that this fishpeddler you have in Charlestown Jail is
one of your founders Massachusetts?''
</P>
<P>
   The rock was also invoked for more obscure controversies, such
as the theological dispute that roiled New England in the early
1830s. While Unitarian ministers ``would attempt to conjoin the
Pilgrims with their descendants, in effect updating the Fathers so
that they could move forward in step with the Sons,'' Trinitarian
Congregationalists were ``bidding (their) people to walk backward,
to `tread in the footsteps of our pious fathers.''' Nonspecialist
readers may be tempted to skip over this 27-page chapter, but they
will be missing one of the real pleasures of discovery in
``Memory's Nation.'' In that connection, a word of warning.
Seelye's style is at best quirky _ he refers to the rock at one
point as ``the omphalos of New England'' and at another as ``a
squat gnomon'' _ reminding the reader of the 18th-century sermons
and 19th-century orations in which he has immersed himself.
</P>
<P>
   But an absolute delight is Seelye's account of the ``hilarity''
at the annual commemorations by the New England Society in
Brooklyn, N.Y. Out of ``impromptu comic'' Chauncey Depew's 1881
remarks came the line _ used later by Cole Porter in ``Anything
Goes'' _ about it being ``a pity that instead of the Pilgrim
Fathers landing on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock had not landed on
the Pilgrim Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing better illuminates the iconographic uses of
Plymouth Rock than the paintings and murals it has inspired, which
are well represented _ and well annotated _ in this richly
illustrated book. ``The perspective in virtually all depictions of
the Landing,'' Seelye writes, ``is from the shore (that) the
Puritans are contemplating and opens outward to the ocean.'' And
since ``we never see what the Pilgrims are looking at,'' Seelye
writes in a comment that can stand as the ultimate meaning of
Plymouth Rock, ``we are what they are looking at; we are the
realized future.'' Once that ``we'' was New England triumphant;
later, ``we'' were the New England of ``cellar holes and Robert
Frost.''
</P>
<P>
   Now those who recall the people who watched the arrival of the
Pilgrims are winning recognition that the meaning of Plymouth must
be reconsidered again. It is a more conflicted, less certain ``we''
those first immigrants are looking at _ and ``Memory's Nation''
becomes an even more timely and topical book than Seelye could have
intended.

LATE BREAKING NEWS ON BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe was late, later than most of
his mates in leaving the shower. All around the Patriots' locker
room Monday night _ and outside the room, too _ player after player
was talking about what he had just seen and what it all meant.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the field, Shawn Jefferson was talking about what it
meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw something out on the field that I hadn't seen in the
team the last few games,'' said the receiver. ``This can give us a
spark.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, no one knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many people who came up with big plays down the
stretch when it was tight,'' fullback Tony Carter was saying by his
locker. ``We found a way to win. It was so great.''
</P>
<P>
   The game ``was the most exciting I've ever been in,'' said
Carter. Yes, because of the happy way it ended, and precisely
because of the way the Patriots moved the ball 80 yards in 15 plays
with their season hanging in the balance. Yes, all that. But there
was more. Carter went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew couldn't even throw the ball,'' Carter said. ``He was
hurt but he's mentally tough; he didn't want to come out of the
game. I can understand why he didn't want to come out in that
situation because this was it _ everything was on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, no one knew.
</P>
<P>
   It was just about then that Bledsoe emerged from the shower
room. The path from the showers to Bledsoe's locker at the far end
of the dressing room passes right by the Patriots with ``20s'' and
``30s'' as uniform numbers _ Carter, Lawyer Milloy, Derrick
Cullors, Willie Clay, and others.
</P>
<P>
   When Bledsoe neared Clay's locker, the quarterback stooped over
and whispered something into the safety's ear. Clay stood up and
whispered back into Bledsoe's ear and then the two hugged, a long
and heartfelt hug.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, no one knew.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Simmons was was still talking as Bledsoe moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell he was in a lot of pain,'' said the receiver,
``because he kept pulling his finger, like when you jam your finger
or dislocate it or whatever he did, you keep pulling it and you're
hoping you can feel your finger again.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, no one knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know exactly how hurt he was when he came into the
huddle for those last plays,'' Simmons said. ``I didn't know what
was going on. None of us knew, except he was obviously in some sort
of pain. But we were glad he stuck it out. He was the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Milloy was saying, ``People say the Patriots are
never going to win a Super Bowl ... because Drew isn't tough
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, no one knew.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Rucci, the offensive lineman and Bledsoe's pal, talked of
how the Patriots made two fourth-down plays on that final drive,
not to mention the 25-yard TD pass to Jefferson to win the game,
and how that showed a quality ``that's been lacking the last few
weeks.'' And a major reason why ``we were able to do it was because
of Drew.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, no one knew.
</P>
<P>
   So much had been different in the Patriots' offense this game.
Carter and Robert Edwards, the backs, had lined up as wide
receivers this night, and the Dolphins could not adjust, Bledsoe
hitting the backs for long passes. And then there was the wonders
of wonders, Bledsoe twice scampering up the middle on quarterback
draws, a la John Elway, out of the shotgun formation. Yes, there
were the spread formations and also there was Bledsoe running
recklessly downfield and trying to throw a block for Edwards, who
had reversed directions.
</P>
<P>
   So much was different in Bledsoe, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Drew came back into the huddle after those timeouts (in
the final two minutes), I didn't know what was wrong,'' said tackle
Max Lane. ``All I knew was that he was hurt. He was over there on
the sidelines trying to throw the ball. You could see he was
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, no one knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take shots at the guy, saying he's not mobile and
everything,'' Lane went on. ``But on the other side, he's the
toughest quarterback in the league, I think. He stays in there and
takes a lick and he jumps right back up. Drew's as tough as
nails.''
</P>
<P>
   When Patriots fans talk of the ``toughest'' quarterback the team
has ever had, Steve Grogan is the name most often mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's a tough guy,'' said Lane, ``but you've got to put Drew
right up there with him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, no one knew.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until much later, when all the players were gone from
the locker room, when the media were back in the press box, when
even the traiffic on Route 1 finally was moving, that everyone
finally knew.
</P>
<P>
   The word came that Bledsoe had fired those last eight passes _
including the two fourth-down completions for first downs, and the
25-yard TD heave to Jefferson _ with the index finger on his
passing hand broken in two places.
</P>
<P>
   Now people may know about the New England quarterback.

THE STORIES OF LORRIE MOORE: LIFE IS GRIM, AND THEN YOU LAUGH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ ``Wa-SKAHN-sin,'' Lorrie Moore said,
articulating the syllables carefully, a lesson in local
linguistics. ``What you do, instead of breaking the syllables
between the S and the C, you break between the A _ not usually in
Wisconsin, of course _ and the S. So it's W-A, then there's a
break, and there's S-K-A, with a nasal A.''
</P>
<P>
   She was entertaining herself, much the way the characters in her
stories and novels often do, playing with words, turning them this
way and that, being impossibly clever. In the stories, it's usually
a sign of a character's nervousness or discomfort or sense of
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attempt to amuse in times of deep unamusement,'' is the
author's description of the impulse.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Moore herself, a reluctantly transplanted New Yorker
walking the campus of the University of Wisconsin here, where she
has taught in the English department for 14 years, seemed genuinely
amused: Look how well I've assimilated!
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here in the fall of 1984, and really, I thought
`Uh-uh,''' she said. ``I was 27, by far the youngest person in the
department. Everybody then was living the life that I'm living now,
where you go to bed at 9:30 because your kids get you up at 6:30. I
actually like Madison now. It's hard for visitors, and it's hard
for single people in their 20s. But it's a wonderful place to have
a kid. When you start to have a little arthritis in the knees, it's
easy to get around.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers of Ms. Moore's books might recognize the good-humored
resignation, the melancholic wit of such a speech. Her recently
published collection, ``Birds of America'' (Alfred A. Knopf), which
spent several surprising weeks on The New York Times best-seller
list (surprising because literary short stories rarely attract
sufficient numbers of readers), is full of passages like it. The
Times' critic, Michiko Kakutani, among many who praised the book,
called it ``at once sad and funny, lyrical and prickly,''
reaffirming not only ``Ms. Moore's virtuosic skills as a writer,''
but also attesting to ``the deepening emotional chiaroscuro of her
wise and beguiling work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore's characters _ most, though not all, women _ share a
sense that they have little control over life's circumstances;
rather, they have arrived at a place they never expected to be and
are engaged in making the best of it. They seem to be standing
outside themselves, watching, in some disbelief, as their lives
unfold. This often involves ironic observation, wordplay,
ruefulness delivered with an arched eyebrow. And though the stories
rarely involve the outdoors, and only occasionally make use of
landscape, they are frequently set in the Midwest, or else concern
people who live there. It's unintended, perhaps, but in Ms. Moore's
stories, it's almost as if the middle of the country is where
people go to be nonplussed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in ``Community Life,'' there is a Vermont librarian
transplanted to the Midwest, who calms her unease about the
strangeness of her surroundings and betrayals of her boyfriend, a
local politician, by making up uninspired Tom Swifties (``This
hotdog's awful,'' she said frankly.) In ``What You Want to Do
Fine'', there are two men engaged in a love affair, one of them
blind, the other divorced, who escape their odd home life by going
on a meandering automobile journey. In ``Real Estate,'' the most
intricately plotted story in the collection, there is Ruth, whose
marriage is foundering, but who, scrabbling about for a clean
start, goes house shopping with her husband, only to have her new
home and yard invaded by bugs, crows, raccoons _ symbolic
disturbances heralding tragedy. Even so, Ruth manages a quirky,
sharp self-scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``To avoid the chaos of the house entirely, Ruth took to going
to matinees,'' Ms. Moore wrote. ``First-run movies, second-run _
she didn't care. Movies were the ultimate real estate; you stepped
in and looked around and almost always bought. She was especially
stirred by a movie she saw about a beautiful widow who fell in love
with a space alien who had assumed human form -- the form of the
woman's long lost husband! Eventually, however, the man had to go
back to his real home, and an immense and amazing spaceship came to
get him, landing in a nearby field. To Ruth, it seemed so sad and
true, just like life; someone assumed the form of the great love of
your life, only to reveal himself later as an alien who had to get
on a spaceship and go back to his planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the stories are sad, not depressing, and they make an
implicit distinction: Life is grim; people don't have to be.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Stories come from wounds,'' Ms. Moore said. ``You have a
wound, you have an idea, you have an image, you have a voice, and
suddenly they're all stirring up what may be a story.'' ``Life is a
very sad thing,'' Ms. Moore said, chipper enough. ``It's only
partially a gift. Happiness just seems crazy. There is a kind of
happiness, cheerfulness, that is just madness. Sadness is a kind of
sanity.'' She paused, then went on. ``Someone from England came to
interview me,'' she said. ``He doesn't get the fiction assignment
very often, and he doesn't read much fiction, and he said, `I can't
believe how cheerful you are!' He'd made that automatic match
between character and writer.'' She was smiling. ``Of course I
never thought of myself as cheerful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dark-haired and dark-eyed, with a thoughtful expression but a
ready giggle, Ms. Moore, who is 41, has the look and demeanor of a
pretty college girl grown up _ or maybe, in jeans and a pea-coat, a
soccer mom, though her son is only 4, a little young for soccer.
Her husband is a lawyer. They live in a house on Lake Wingra, ``the
most feted'' of Madison's three lakes, she said, though that
doesn't sound right. Lakes Monona and Mendota are larger, more
central and better known. Feted?
</P>
<P>
   ``With an i,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Does she feel at home here? ``I feel like it's a luxury to
think, `Where should I live?''' she said. ``It's such a luxurious
thought. At some point you should just be occupied with the traumas
and what's occurred; it's not so important where it's occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she doesn't look out of place; she just sounds it. The
repartee _ instinctive, clever, word-oriented _ is identifiably
East Coast, maybe identifiably New York City, though she didn't
live there until after college. She grew up in upstate New York,
just north of Saratoga Springs, in Glens Falls, a town she used as
the setting for her 1996 novel about a recollected girlhood, ``Who
Will Run the Frog Hospital?'' Still, when she speaks of the
differences between East and Midwest, it's with New York City in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously New York is a very verbal culture, a culture of
talking that has turned talking into an art form,'' she said. ``To
speak in gross general terms, that's not really what's going on
here. There's a sense of emotional theatricality in New York.
Everything gets vented; your basic hostile encounter with a street
vendor. That's threatening, alien to the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the general impression that people are just plain nicer here,
she remarked: ``Well, there's a way in which niceness is a kind of
hopelessness, too. It's not necessarily an expression of
optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get hate mail, you know?'' she said. ``No one in New York
would ever send me hate mail. It's not a lot, and I get some nice
letters too, but I get hate mail here. They don't sign the letters.
But I have a bad attitude about the Midwest, supposedly. There's a
feeling running through their reading of my work that I'm
insufficiently appreciative of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course that's not a writer's task, to be appreciative. I
wasn't commissioned by the Chamber of Commerce. And if you look at
every single setting in every story, no place is particularly
celebrated. But it's the Midwesterners who are upset by it.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed. ``It's all postmarked from Wisconsin,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was an insurance executive, her mother was the school
nurse. She was the second of four children. ``It was a very
ordinary middle class household,'' she said, though she said her
father wrote occasional short stories and composed music for the
church choir. Both her parents write great letters, she said.
``Both my parents have a little of the writing gene in them,'' she
said. ``The writing gene is just, like, dreaminess, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore graduated from St. Lawrence College, then moved to New
York City, where she worked for two years as a paralegal. Then she
went to graduate school at Cornell, where she studied with the
novelist Alison Lurie and wrote a master's thesis that became her
first book, the short story collection ``Self Help.'' That was
followed by a novel, ``Anagrams,'' and a tenure-track job offer in
Madison. The first year, she was lonesome, overworked, miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kind and let me take a leave my second year,'' she
said. ``I got a moving van and cleared out. I moved back to New
York, and I had no foot left here at all, except that technically I
had this job.''
</P>
<P>
   That she floated back to Madison, drawn in a way that was almost
beyond her control, is the kind of tale she tells on the page.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she lived in an apartment on Ninth Avenue, across
the street from the Port Authority. Buses lined up at night and
spewed exhaust into her living room. The painfully funny existence
of a struggling writer in Hell's Kitchen _ the protagonist, a male
playwright, was tormented by the noise and stink of trucks _ showed
up in a story, ``Vissi d'Arte,'' in her next collection, ``Like
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she had begun returning to Madison one semester
a year; it was during one such sojourn that she met her future
husband, Mark Borns. ``What brought me back for good? I don't
know,'' she said. ``I guess at some point, there I was in New York,
and the apartment was getting impossible. I was getting ill
breathing these bus fumes. And I thought, `What am I doing? I have
a boyfriend in Madison! And I can live so much better there.' So I
came back here, in the summer of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all, like, not knowing why you're doing anything except
it doesn't make any sense what you're doing right now.'' She
laughed out loud. ``It's a terrible story,'' she said.

U.S., RUSSIAN CREW TO DELIVER SECOND COMPONENT OF SPACE STATION 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. and Russian shuttle crew is prepared to deliver the
second large component of the new international space station to
Earth orbit this week, dramatically showcasing NASA's six-year
strategy for assembling the sprawling research outpost with
robotics and multiple spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle astronauts have trained for more than two years to
link the Russian-built Zarya control module launched from Central
Asia on Nov. 20 with the Unity docking node that awaits liftoff on
the shuttle Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour is to blast off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in
Florida on Thursday at 3:59 a.m., EST.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-day mission will feature more than 30 hours of precise
operations with Endeavour's robot arm and at least three seven-hour
spacewalks. Those activities must be carefully choreographed with
the orbital rendezvous activities that NASA astronauts and ground
control teams in the United States and Russia learned to execute so
flawlessly during a three-year series of docking flights to the Mir
space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This easily ranks up there in complexity with any shuttle
mission ever flown,'' said NASA's Robert Castle, who as the lead
flight director will orchestrate the activities from mission
control in Houston. ``At the same time, it's one of the simpler
space station assembly missions. It's an indication of things to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three dozen shuttle assembly missions combined with
nine by unmanned Russian rockets will be required through 2004 to
loft the more than 1 million pounds of hardware for the new 356 by
290-foot orbital outpost. At least 162 spacewalks, two thirds of
them by U.S. astronauts, will be required to join and maintain the
hardware. Unity cost $300 million to build and Zarya cost $240
million.
</P>
<P>
   The massive construction effort began with the launching of
Zarya, a 41-foot long, 42,600 pound module designed to furnish
propulsion, electrical power generation, guidance and
communications during the earliest phases of assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, ground control teams completed a largely
successful orbital check of Zarya. A series of post-launch
maneuvers raised the module's initial elliptical orbit to a
circular orbit of just under 250 miles in preparation for the
shuttle's arrival. One of six large power storage batteries aboard
Zarya was not discharging properly and electronic gear to remedy
the difficulty may be added to Endeavour so the shuttle crew can
attempt a repair.
</P>
<P>
   Unity, which is stowed in Endeavour's cargo bay, is 33 feet long
and 25,350 pounds. It is a cylinder with a half-dozen docking
ports, four mounted radially and one at each end.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two modules will serve as a structural bridge
between future Russian, U.S., European and Japanese segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I relate this to children,'' said Robert Cabana, who
commands Endeavour's six-member crew. ``I say, remember Tinker
Toys?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians will have one of those sticks up there, and we
will take up one of those round pieces and hook the two together,
so you can hook on all the other pieces,'' Cabana said. ``It sounds
simplistic, but that is essentially what Unity is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian service module, whose launch has been delayed
repeatedly by that country's economic difficulties, is due to link
with Zarya at the end opposite the node sometime after mid-1999,
furnishing the living quarters for the station's first occupants. &QL;

KANSAS STATE'S TOUGHEST FOE: COACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Check out the ESPN-USA Today coaches poll and then take a look
on Sunday. Don't be surprised if you find a change at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Why? No reason, really. But the odds are it's going to change.
Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Tennessee plays Vanderbilt in its final regular-season
game tomorrow. Kansas State is done until the Big 12 championship
game Dec. 5 against Texas A&AMP;M in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which is 5 points behind the Wildcats in the coaches
poll, but 30 points ahead of them in the writers' poll, should beat
up on Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   That's going to impress some coaches, enough coaches to make
Tennessee pick up those 5 points to get into the No. 1 slot.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is wrong. Kansas State can do nothing worse
than have a bad week of practice, which shouldn't cost a team
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But some coaches will switch if Tennessee does what is expected
and runs up a big victory.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of such a move is tough to follow. If a voter was
going to be impressed with Tennessee, why not reward the Vols after
last week's pounding of a decent Kentucky team?
</P>
<P>
   If a voter didn't move the Vols past Kansas State last week, why
would he do it this week against a bad Vanderbilt team?
</P>
<P>
   For those Oliver Stone fans out there, there may be a reason.
The coaches have said that the winner of the Fiesta Bowl will be
their national champion.
</P>
<P>
   No debate. No argument. Done.
</P>
<P>
   The writers, always mindful of controversy, said they will wait
until all the bowls are finished and then vote. No guarantees for
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Right now we have this possibility: No. 2 Tennessee beats No. 3
UCLA in a lackluster Fiesta Bowl. The coaches have no choice.
Tennessee would be their national champion.
</P>
<P>
   While that is happening, No. 1 Kansas State beats up No. 4
Florida State in the Sugar Bowl. The writers decide that Kansas
State deserves the top ranking, while the coaches watch in dismay
as they relegate their No. 1 team during the regular season to No.
2.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this potential embarrassment Tennessee needs to be No.
1 in the coaches poll, which is why it will be interesting to see
how the votes come out on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Shock TV
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? First ``60 Minutes'' decides to show one
of Dr.  &UR; Jack Kevorkian's &LR;  assisted suicides and now Oklahoma
television shows the firing of Sooners football coach  &UR; John Blake &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, real death and the death of a coaching tenure are not
the same, but both broadcasts are sick. When Blake was fired by the
board of regents earlier this week, the vote on whether to keep or
dismiss him was televised, with each voter announcing his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Blake was told the outcome before the television
audience was. Blake was 12-22 in his first three seasons, but the
Sooners had won three of their last four games. It wasn't enough
... Don't be surprised if Florida defensive coordinator  &UR; Bobby
Stoops &LR;  winds up in Norman. That's unless he replaces  &UR; Hayden Fry &LR; 
at Iowa ... Word has it that Mississippi coach  &UR; Tom Tuberville &LR;  is
very close to making a deal to move over to Auburn. Hmm. Wasn't
this the same coach who said he was not a candidate for that job
and was surprised and angered to see his name mentioned? ... If
Temple coach  &UR; Bobby Wallace &LR;  is indeed out of the mix for the
Auburn job, Owls officials are prepared to give Wallace an
extension that will put him under contract for eight years that
will include both a raise and a huge buyout clause. Eight years at
Temple?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fry's legacy strong
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fry ends his coaching career without a national championship but
with a legacy that produced some pretty good football in Iowa City
over two decades. During that time, the Hawkeyes made 14 bowl
appearances, which is 14 more than in the previous 20 years of Iowa
football. ``I would have rather gone out with a real good season,''
said Fry, who finished 3-8. ``I've always been an optimist. I never
dreamed that we would experience all the problems we had.'' ... The
horrible year in the state of South Carolina resulted in both
Clemson's  &UR; Tommy West &LR;  and South Carolina's  &UR; Brad Scott &LR;  getting
fired. It was so bad at the end that this joke was going around the
state last week: Before the annual regular-season finale between
South Carolina and Clemson someone smashed the window of a Gamecock
fan's car. Ten tickets to the Clemson game were sitting on the
front seat. When the owner came back, he found 20 tickets on the
front seat ... Scott's fall from grace was particularly hard. In
1994, the former Florida State assistant led the Gamecocks to
victory in the Carquest Bowl, the first bowl win in school history,
and was a leading candidate to replace  &UR; Dennis Erickson &LR;  at Miami.
Four years later, South Carolina was 1-10, the worst record in the
105-year history of the program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Irish scenarios
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All you Notre Dame fans out there, here's what it looks like for
your team in terms of the postseason. A win over Southern Cal
tomorrow puts the Irish in a Bowl Championship Series bowl. Which
one? Well that depends on a few things, mainly the Arizona-Arizona
State game. An Arizona win puts the Wildcats in the Rose Bowl
against Wisconsin. And that more than likely puts the Irish in the
Orange Bowl in Miami against the winner of tomorrow's
Syracuse-Miami game, while Florida State and either Kansas State or
possibly Ohio State face off in the Sugar Bowl. A Notre Dame loss
sends the Irish to the Gator Bowl against Georgia Tech ... Two of
the hottest coaches in Division 1-AA are UMass's  &UR; Mark Whipple &LR;  and
UConn's  &UR; Skip Holtz &LR; , both whom are in playoff games tomorrow.
Don't expect either coach to be in 1-AA much longer. Whipple has
done a marvelous rebuilding job and Minuteman athletic director
 &UR; Bob Marcum &LR;  knows it and knows Whipple will probably get calls as
1-A jobs open up. ``That to me is a sign of Mark doing a good
job,'' said Marcum, who says he will deal with potential suitors
when they arrive ... If Syracuse is going to establish itself as a
legitimate Top 15 program it must beat Miami this afternoon. The
Orangemen have proven they can beat and play with anyone (Michigan
and Tennessee). They also have proven they can lose to anyone
(North Carolina State, West Virginia) ...  &UR; Lou Holtz &LR;  to South
Carolina? Stranger things have happened.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding the right present for your fussy Aunt Agatha may seem a
lot easier this Christmas than finding the right retailer in which
to invest.
</P>
<P>
   First, the good news: This holiday season is expected to be the
best in four years for retailers. An annual survey by Deloitte &AMP;
Touche and the National Retail Federation said shoppers were
expected to spend $173 billion, about 5.5 percent more than in the
1997 holiday season. And the Conference Board reported last week
that consumer confidence rose in October for the first time in four
months.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores and a few other
retail stocks are trading near record highs, most have not
recovered from the summer selloff, when investors thought shoppers
might react negatively to world problems like Russia's default or
Japan's banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was worried about Asia,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, an
analyst at Paine Webber. Everybody but the consumer. ``Main Street
is quite far removed from Wall Street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still concerns. People have not shaken off recent
news of corporate layoffs. Consumers polled in the Deloitte survey
said ``everyday low prices'' were the first thing that would lure
them to a store; last year, that bait placed third.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the economic expansion continues next year, it is risky
to buy cyclical stocks, like those of many retailers, long into a
period of extended economic growth. The trick, analysts say, is to
find retailers likely to post good holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
   Then, an investor should look for the stocks that are cheap
relative to their rivals. Finally, one should make sure the company
has cash to weather a slowdown and management that knows the
meaning of shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top picks of several analysts and money managers is
the Dayton Hudson Corp., the Minneapolis-based parent of Target
discount stores and Hudson's and Marshall Field's department
stores.
</P>
<P>
   It is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23 and is cheaper
than rivals like Wal-Mart and Costco, which have ratios of 41 and
31, respectively. Dayton Hudson's stock hit a one-yearlow of $26.13
in October, but closed at $44.25 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Target division is doing beautifully,'' said George A.
Mairs, manager of the Mairs &AMP; Power Growth fund, which owns some
shares. ``They have clearly tried to differentiate themselves from
Kmart and Wal-Mart by having lines that are more upscale, and I
think this has worked well.'' He said Dayton Hudson stock could hit
$60 within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to sparkle this season is the Zale Corp., the big
jewelry chain. Watches and earrings are always popular gifts, and
Zale has a wide selection of inexpensive items.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Irving, Texas, has a P/E of 15. Its luxury
competitor, Tiffany &AMP; Co., has a ratio of 20. Zale's shares have
risen almost 50 percent from a low of $19.50 in October and are now
at $28.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very professionally run in a business not
traditionally known for it,'' said Michael Exstein, an analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston, who said he expects Zale to hit $35
within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worried about an economic slowdown might be happy to
see that retail stock buybacks have become as fashionable this
season as the color gray. Such a program is one reason Alan Snyder,
head of Snyder Capital Management, owns Pier 1 Imports.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer, based in Fort Worth, sells more than 5,000
imported items, including candles, furniture and tableware. In
September it announced a plan to repurchase five million shares,
its second buyback program this year. Pier 1's stock, now at
$10.50, is way up from its low in October, but is still far below
the $20.625 it reached on March 13. The stock has a P/E of 14, and
Snyder expects the shares to hit $15 within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies we're buying can create their own upward
momentum if the market doesn't recognize their value,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On subsequent flights the node will accept an airlock to
facilitate the many spacewalks, the U.S. research module, a squat
structural truss that will tie in the station's future U.S. power
generating apparatus as well as a multiwindowed cupola that will
serve as a viewing port.
</P>
<P>
   To a great extend each of these future components will be added
to the growing station in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The challenge begins with Endeavour's liftoff. It must be
accurately timed to occur within a 10-minute period to ensure the
spacecraft and its heavy payload of station hardware and shuttle
astronauts achieves the velocity and altitude to rendezvous with
the new station, in this case the already orbiting Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's launch control team has demonstrated proficiency at doing
this. The past five of eight docking missions to Russia's Mir space
station lifted off on time under similar constraints.
</P>
<P>
   With a successful launch, the Endeavour crew should reach Zarya
on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to doing so, however, astronauts will use the shuttle's
robot arm to lift the Unity module from the cargo bay and
reposition it. The task requires remote commands to the arm to
accurately align the node 4 inches above the shuttle's docking
mechanism and airlock. The same docking device was used by the
Russians and Americans to join the shuttle to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   When correctly aligned and still in the arm's grasp, the node
will become the target for the shuttle's docking assembly.
Endeavour's pilots will fire thrusters fore and aft of their
spacecraft, forcing it to dock with the node.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the shuttle is ready for its encounter with
Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   With Cabana and pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls, Endeavour
will approach Zarya from below, pausing at a distance of 600 feet.
The shuttle will then maneuver to a point 350 feet in front of the
module as both race around the Earth at five miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering will continue until the shuttle reaches 250 feet
above Zarya. Endeavour's crew will then slowly descend toward Zarya
with flight engineer Nancy Currie at the controls of the robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   The acrobatics enable Russian ground controllers to communicate
with Zarya without the shuttle impeding the module's Earth-facing
antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as Endeavour descends toward Zarya, Currie's view
from the shuttle's crew compartment will be blocked by the Unity
module which towers nearly four stories out of the payload bay.
</P>
<P>
   She will have to rely on a collection of television cameras
mounted within the shuttle's cargo bay and on the arm itself to aid
her in grabbing the Zarya with the robotic device. Once Zarya is
nabbed, Currie must still rely on a Canadian developed system of
graphics on the outside of the two modules to align Zarya over
Unity.
</P>
<P>
   With the two modules aligned and separated by six inches,
Endeavour's thrusters will be fired to drive the complementary
docking mechanisms together.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will be up to shuttle spacewalkers Jerry Ross and Jim
Newman.
</P>
<P>
   During the first spacewalk, the two men will make nearly 40
power and data connections between the modules. One of the
astronauts will work from the tip of the robot arm, the other from
a portable foot restraint secured to the station modules.
</P>
<P>
   Both men will be equipped with two safety tethers. Additionally,
they will wear back-mounted jet packs that could steer them back to
the modules if the tethers snapped.
</P>
<P>
   During the second spacewalk, Ross and Newman will install two
communications antennas on Unity. The next day, when Cabana leads
his crew into the two station modules for the first time, the
astronauts will complete communications tasks that will permit
mission control in Houston to monitor conditions aboard the node
and many aboard Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   During the third excursion, Ross and Newman will climb the two
modules, at this point rising 80 feet out of the shuttle's cargo
bay, to secure a bag of hand tools that will be used by a future
spacewalk team, and they will inspect the docking mechanism that
awaits the arrival of the Russian service module.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everything to work as planned with no deviations,''
said Ross, who has trained with Newman to deal with a wide range of
difficulties. ``As long as we have a functioning station up there,
and it's ready for the next crew to come up, then I will be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the final spacewalk, Endeavour will undock and pull
away.
</P>
<P>
   If the nascent outpost is in good shape, shuttle astronauts will
not return until May, this time with supplies and equipment,
including a Russian cargo crane. &QL;

GEESE ARE PLENTIFUL, FAIR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These mornings before the sun lifts above what is left of the
scrub oak foliage _ a drab brown _ to melt it, a sheen of frost
lies lightly on the marsh. The sound of shotguns booming is a
convivial reminder of harvest season, and a nice sound to wake to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best mornings for gunning waterfowl are cloudy,
just shy of stormy, maybe some spitting snow to reduce the
visibility from on high of the topography below.
</P>
<P>
   My town is rather famous for waterfowling. At one time as many
used to practice this sport as fished for stripers on summer
nights. But in this Massachusetts coastal town _ and perhaps
coastal towns everywhere _ the open hunting land has dwindled, and
for this and other reasons, waterfowling is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   From the way things are going we just might be able to keep the
season open on Canada geese year-round. This isn't a news flash,
but according to waterfowl biologist H Heusman of the Massachusetts
Division of Wildlife, trends do not favor coastal folks who enjoy
the sound of waterfowling out on the marsh.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the total coastal season this year will be about 60
days for Canada geese as the population has been burgeoning in
recent years, partly because of declining hunting but also because
more geese winter in this state rather than migrate south.
</P>
<P>
   Is it global warming or just part of a natural migration cycle?
Whatever, every golfer in this state knows that we're up to our
ankles in geese.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the hunters in North Carolina, who used to get up to
20,000 geese a year to bang away at. Now, says Heusman, they're
lucky if they see a thousand birds. Where are they? Right here on
the back nine, it would appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had geese wintering in Massachusetts, especially the
south coast in mild winters,'' says Heusman. ``But what we have now
is not just a regular case of mild winters. We have more geese
wintering inland.''
</P>
<P>
   What that may mean, says Heusman, is more open water created by
warmer winters. He does not suggest this is any prima facie
evidence of global warming, but added to some other wildlife data,
he says, it is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen, for example, have noticed that striped bass are
showing up two weeks early and staying later in the fall. And
several northern plant species are receding. Again, inconclusive
evidence by itself, but perhaps part of a larger climatic picture.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the geese are here, plenty of them, and the season
is open until Dec. 15 with a two-bird bag, four-bird possession
limit.
</P>
<P>
   The central zone season opens tomorrow and runs through Dec. 14
with the same limits.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the size of the duck and goose populations, hunting
numbers _ number of licenses and the harvest _ have declined
steadily in the last quarter-century, says Heusman. Similar trends
are found in the annual deer hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers are getting older,'' says Heusman. ``There's
more development, and in a booming economy people have less time to
hunt. But the major factor about the hunting population is aging
and the lack of recruitment of new hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   Development is also a major issue, as most coastal hunters have
discovered. Open marshes, estuaries, and open upland fields are
becoming housing, roads, and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you put a house on the shore,'' says Heusman,
``that's 500 feet of marsh that can't be hunted.''
</P>

   In New Hampshire, where civilization and wildness clash as often
as they do in this state, Operation Game Thief has been in
operation 10 years and state wildlife officials say it has been
effective in apprehending poachers and other outdoors miscreants.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ronald Alie, chief of New Hampshire's Fish and Game
Department Law Enforcement Division, Operation Game Thief has
resulted in a steady number of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 100 Operation Game Thief phone calls are received per
year, and about 10 percent result in arrest,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Most complaints involve taking fish or game out of season,
exceeding limits, and taking non-game wildlife. Callers to
1-800-344-4262 need not identify themselves and if their complaint
results in an arrest, he or she receives a $1,000 bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Operation Game Thief is
that, rather than a governmental program, the operation is
non-profit and supported by private donors.

REVIEWING THE CASE AGAINST MANDATORY HELMETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question came in an e-mail: How could we possibly raise a
question of whether skiers should wear helmets? ``I would think the
deaths last year would be enough to open every skier's or boarder's
eyes to the universal need for helmets,'' wrote the incredulous
reader. ``How can anyone question that?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at the risk of being accused of beating the dead horse
(after all, the Ski Section had two helmet items last week), we
offer a perhaps more thorough response to the question of helmet
use.
</P>
<P>
   When Massachusetts voters were wrangling over a motorcycle
helmet law two decades ago, the anti-helmet position _ mostly from
bikers, but also from civil libertarians who want no laws for
anything _ amounted mainly to an argument for individual liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't motorcycle riders decide for themselves whether to
wear a helmet? went the argument. Why should the state have laws to
keep people from being negligent or even stupid?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the state has long since decided that it has an
interest in keeping people alive _ because injuries can cost the
state medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   When similar logic is applied to skiing, we would have the state
impose laws requiring skiers and boarders to wear helmets. What
that would mean is that ski areas would have to start carrying
rental helmets in their shops.
</P>
<P>
   How will that float on a Saturday morning _ yet another line in
the ski shop as people wait to get fitted for helmets?
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, isn't a helmet a rather personal item, if not
like a toothbrush, at least as much as a shoe? In case you haven't
noticed, skiing is an effort that sometimes produces sweat, wherein
live the germs known on schoolyards everywhere _ cootius mungus, or
cooties.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's a way to kill every last microscopic bug in a
rental helmet, and to chasten the helmet until it's
persperation-free and smelling like a pine tree. But do you want to
put on that rented helmet?
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, helmets keep one's head warm, or so the helmet
sales folks tell us. So if there is a helmet law, and if it's OK
because helmets keep our heads warm anyway, what about warm days?
How about one of those sunny spring days when the breeze created by
ski motion is a relief from the intense April heat: Could you be
arrested or ticketed for taking off your helmet?
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds as if we're searching around to find the devil in
the details, perhaps so. But there are considerable devils to be
found there.
</P>
<P>
   The question of why question helmets, at bottom, is saying,
``Why would one not want to wear something that makes skiing
safer?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, then, wouldn't a suit of chain armor be safer yet? How
about if skiers wore a plastic bubble, like the one over Vail's
Vista Bahn chairs, with their legs sticking out the bottom? It
would be safer yet, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are bandied all around. Some safety analyses say
that in a crash at more than 15 miles per hour with a solid, fixed
object, a helmet would not help. Though that seems to defy the
logic by which motorcyclists and even bicyclists wear helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Are current helmets good enough to prevent serious head injury
beyond mild concussions? Do helmets help save lives? How well do
they work? Does the comparatively minute number of ski deaths and
serious injury _ one per million _ enter into the argument at all?
</P>
<P>
   Here we arrive at my objection, at least to the mandating of
helmets, and perhaps even to seeing them worn by average
recreational skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Skiing is an outdoor sport imbued with the values of
self-preservation and mastery of one's self. Knowledge, physical
and mental acumen, experience, and judgment all become part of the
skier's mastery.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the wearing of a helmet says: ``I am now engaged
in a dangerous activity, and to save myself I will wear this
protective device.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is exactly why the downhill racer wears a helmet, of
course. And gate skiers wear helmets and face guards because they
are putting head and teeth in harm's way. The point of ski racing
is to ski on the edge of control, where losing that control is
always possible.
</P>
<P>
   That's the ski racer's game, but not the recreational skier's.
By assuming he cannot or will not control his own destiny on the
slopes, the skier is making an entirely new set of assumptions than
have been made throughout the history of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Protection, after all, is no substitute for mastery. Those who
confuse the two have lost much understanding of what it means to be
a skier.

SNOWBOARDING ISN'T WELCOMED EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Four ski areas do not want you.
</P>
<P>
   They do not want your money, your business, your fun-loving
approach to your new sport, your promise to become ever larger,
your obvious kinship with all outdoor winter (nonmotorized) sports.
</P>
<P>
   They do not want you, snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that without your growing presence the last decade,
skiing's growth numbers would be as dead as Marley.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the generation of the future is turning out in
huge numbers to snowboarding as opposed to skiing. These ski areas
do not want you, and may they not be so unlucky in the future as to
have their prayers answered.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mad River Glen (Vermont):  &LR; Vermont turns 50 this year. There'll
be parties, reenactments, a roll-back in ticket prices to the
original $3.50. Even a ceremony to honor one of the most painful
chairlifts in America _ the olde single. Miss Vermont and Governor
Dean will be present for the festivities, but he has been warned to
leave his board home, too.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Mad River _ all 1,300 of them _ are no closer to
budging on this issue than Betsy Pratt was eight years ago, when
she threw the shredders off after a bitter confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mad River spokesman Erik Friedman, who happens to
be a snowboarder and a shareholder in the mountain, there is some
physical justification for keeping snowboards off the hill. But for
the most part, they just don't fit with the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trails are very narrow,'' says Trina, another boarder who
works at Mad River and teaches boarding at Sugarbush, ``and the
movement of snowboards and skiers are just so different on those
trails they don't work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, but that's not how the dispute started back in 1991.
That's when, for technical reasons, boarders were restricted from
riding that old single chair that yields so much passion.
</P>
<P>
   The landing is so flat at the top that when the boarders pushed
themselves off (they don't carry poles, you know), the cable
sometimes got derailed, shutting down the lift. Then there was the
fear that a boarder might get stuck going around the bullwheel,
shutting down the rig.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Pratt declared the single off limits to boarders, though
they could ride on the double chair. Nevertheless, the boarders
became strident and protested, and Pratt pushed right back, banning
boards altogether on one of the first ski areas that had admitted
them many years before.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three years ago, Pratt sold the mountain to a coop of
3,000 shares. More than 1,768 have been purchased by 1,300
shareholders, who vote steadfastly not to overturn the 1991 ban.
</P>
<P>
   Shares are now up to $1,750 each (from $1,500) but even if a
coalition of riders could buy them all, they would fall short of a
majority and would be leaving the boards home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Aspen Mountain (Colorado):  &LR; This is the piece of ski land that
would not be subdued by waves of VW bus-riding ski bums (winter
hippies) in the '60s, Hunter S. Thompson in the '70s, a bunch of
Euro-crybaby racers in the '80s _ not to mention the paint-throwing
anti-fur zealots _ and it isn't about to succumb to the boarding
industry or its scat-talking practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen is the mountain that should have Lily Tomlin doing its TV
spots: ``We don't have to care. We're Aspen.''
</P>
<P>
   For quite a while Aspen has not been the best place in America
to go skiing. Not by a long shot. But more than ever it is the
place to be seen, either on camera or gawking around for a glimpse
of Hollywood glitterati who make it a point to be seen there.
</P>
<P>
   It is so much the culture (Land Rover limos and mink parkas)
from which the counter-culture boarders react, the friction would
seem inevitable. And so it was last season when Aspen threw
boarders a bone and sponsored a free event for them one weekend. It
went so badly that hundreds of riders were thrown off the hill by
the ski patrol, and Aspen redoubled its opposition to their
business.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Aspen will tell you that the snow on its delicate
steep is so fragile that even poor skiers making windshield wiper,
scraping turns damage it. Snowboards are even worse on the advanced
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   But people who know Aspen and know snowboarding suspect that the
twain just may never meet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deer Valley (Utah):  &LR; If Mad River is too cantankerous, Aspen
too lofty, then Deer Valley's reason for eschewing boards is
largely that it's too precious. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   The posh area is one beautiful place to ski, both in its terrain
and hotel/condo village at the base. In order to capture just the
right tone, they brought in ski legend _ and purist _ Stein Eriksen
as figurehead of the ski school.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen, who still maintains his perfection of tight-together
form, explains that while Deer Valley folks are not really against
snowboarding aesthetically (and some do sneak in via the
midmountain access), customers do not want them.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous reader surveys come back with the bad news for
boarders: skiers who pay enough to have ski valets following them
around do not want to see boarders, hear boarders, or put up with
them on Deer Valley's manicured terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The other argument from Deer Valley is that it is unique among
ski areas, and that boarders can find plenty of options in Utah
without desecrating the rarefied air of one of the top-rated ski
areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alta (Utah): &LR;  If Mad River has a western counterpart, this is
it. Alta, with its wealth and riches of natural terrain, of chutes
and high mountain bowls, has natural snow and little grooming. The
terrain is largely a snowscape of covered stumps and rocks, and
skiers find their way through, over, and around.
</P>
<P>
   Snowboarding, says Alta, would slash all the good snow away from
parts of the terrain that needs the coverage. Hence: leave the
boards home, or at least take them down to Snowbird, which is only
a mile away.

 &HT;    Thomasville knows how to throw a party
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOMASVILLE, Ga. _ Putting on a stylish holiday gathering comes
naturally to this gracious Southern town that refined the art of
hospitality more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   During the last three decades of the 19th century, the town 35
miles northeast of Tallahassee was a grand resort for wealthy
Northerners who arrived by train to winter in deluxe hotels. All
the latest technology _ electric lights, hot and cold running water
and telephone service _ provided for their comfort in a time when
few small towns enjoyed such amenities. Many of the winter visitors
were so enamored of their retreats that they built fine cottages
and grand plantations, many reincarnated as historic sites or
bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the richest people in America came here,'' says Tom
Hill, curator of the Thomas County Museum of History. ``We were the
Miami of the day from 1870 to 1906.''
</P>
<P>
   The rich and famous were royally entertained by such amusements
as parades, circuses, horse racing, golfing and appearances from
entertainers such as Annie Oakley, John Phillip Sousa and Gen. Tom
Thumb.
</P>
<P>
   These days, you don't have to be rich or famous to enjoy the
charms of this Victorian city that still knows how to party with
panache.
</P>
<P>
   And the holiday season is one of the best times to experience
the hospitality. ``Christmas in Thomasville'' rivals the
77-year-old Thomasville Rose Show &AMP; Festival held each April, the
Antiques Show and Sale in March and the Plantation Wildlife Arts
Festival in November.
</P>
<P>
   Victorian Christmas on Dec. 10 and 11 in the restored downtown
leads the parade of holiday doings. Call the Thomasville Welcome
Center at 1-800-704-2350 for details.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a glimpse at other upcoming events:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lapham-Patterson House: Lavishly decorated for the holidays,
the house is open for candlelight tours during Victorian Christmas
and for ``Pages From Christmas Ages,'' an evening of holiday
storytelling Dec. 12. Prosperous Chicago shoe merchant C.W. Lapham
built this cleverly designed Victorian home between 1884 and '85 as
a winter residence. Among its unusual architectural details are a
double-flue chimney with a walk-through stairway and cantilevered
balcony, door-sized windows and odd angles throughout (none the
usual 90 degrees). Now a state historic site, the goldenrod-hued
house with burgundy accents was owned by James G. Patterson from
1905 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pages'': 7:30-9:30 p.m. Dec. 12. $5; $2.50 ages 6-18; under 6
free. Regular tours: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Dec. 10-11. $3 adult; $1.50
children. 626 N. Dawson St. 912-225-4004.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pebble Hill Plantation: The irrepressible Elisabeth Ireland
Poe _ Pansy to her friends and family _ is recalled during a tour
of the main floor of the plantation home where the young girl who
loved horses blossomed into a woman and lived out her days. Miss
Pansy, as she was called in her later years, was a sportswoman,
patron of the arts, hostess and collector. And she was the last
heir of the Hanna family of Cleveland, which owned the estate. In
1983, five years after her death, the home was opened as a museum
as directed in her will. Vignettes from stages of Pansy's life are
portrayed by costumed actors as small tour groups move from room to
room on the main floor. Note that there's a Christmas tree in each
room that complements the decor. After the tour, guests are invited
to a lavish reception with champagne and hors d'oeuvres in the
stable complex and horse-drawn carriage rides around the grounds.
And be forewarned: This is always a sellout, so make reservations
early.
</P>
<P>
   Tours begin on the half-hour, 6:30-9:30 p.m. Dec. 11-12. $35,
includes tour and reception. Located five miles south of
Thomasville on U.S. 319 (Thomasville Road). 912-226-2344. Visit
Pebble Hill on the Web at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .webvista.com/tlh/sghtsee
</P>
<P>
   /pebble/
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Teacakes and Trousseaux, a Victorian Christmas Brunch and
Fashion Show'': This new event re-creates the ambience of the
Victorian era with an elegant brunch, music and models dressed in
reproductions of Victorian finery. Guests are encouraged to wear
Victorian-era costumes as well. Handmade Victorian Christmas
ornaments will be sold.
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m.-2 p.m. Dec. 12. $15, includes fashion show, brunch and a
favor. Thomasville Cultural Center, 600 E. Washington St.
912-226-0588.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Christmas in Lights: Flowers Industries, a Thomasville-based
bakery and food products company, gives a special gift to the town
_ an outdoor lighting display on the grounds of its headquarters.
The half-mile drive past lighted trees and images of deer, an
animated Santa, trumpeting angels, the Nativity and shepherds is
sure to dazzle kids of all ages. While it may not be on a scale as
grand as, say, Callaway Gardens' Fantasy in Lights, it is free.
</P>
<P>
   6-11 p.m. Tuesday through Dec. 31. 1919 Flowers Circle, off U.S.
19 South.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there:
</P>
<P>
   From Atlanta, take I-75 south to Tifton, where you follow U.S.
319 south for 56 miles to Thomasville. It's about a four-hour
drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Staying over: There are motels including Days Inn, Hampton Inn
and Holiday Inn, but to experience the allure of Thomasville's
bygone era, we chose the Evans House Bed and Breakfast at 725 S.
Hansell St. It faces Paradise Park and is a short walk to town. The
house, originally built in 1898 and rebuilt in 1907 after a fire,
is a transitional style between the asymmetry of the Victorian era
and the simple formality of the emerging neoclassical style. Rates
$75-$165. 1-800-344-4717. Other good choices include: Our Cottage
on the Park (801 S. Hansell St., next to the Evans House;
912-227-0404); 1884 Paxton House (445 Remington Ave; 912-226-5197),
the Grand Victorian Inn (817 S. Hansell St.; 912-226-7460); and
Serendipity Cottage (339 E. Jefferson St.; 1-800-383-7377). Another
option is staying in the lap of luxury at Melhana Grand Plantation
Resort (301 Showboat Lane, four miles south of town on U.S. 319;
1-888-920-3030).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dining: The hot new dinings spots downtown are Harrison's (119
Broad St.; 912-226-0074), Simply Delicious at the Neel House (502
Broad St.; 912-227-9428) and the Terrace by Moonlight at the Neel
House Patio Entrance (502 Broad St.; 912-227-9844). Also new is the
Tea Room at the Cottage, serving afternoon tea at the Serendipity
Cottage bed-and-breakfast (339 E. Jefferson St.; 912-226-8111).
Also new is the Restaurant in the Inn at Melhana, featuring gourmet
Southern cuisine at historic Melhana Plantation (301 Showboat Lane;
912-228-2290).

 &HT;    Five easy pieces take the guesswork out holidays
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dressing up for the holiday season can be a snap if you remember
to keep a simple outlook on fashion.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing a few stylish pieces, you can gracefully maneuver
the party circuit without breaking your holiday budget or dashing
your holiday spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Cyndie Washburn Nester, Casual Corner's fashion director,
suggests comfortable separates that do double duty _ going from the
boardroom to the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, a long black skirt is worthy of an evening out
with the simple addition of a beaded blouse,'' she says. ``Or,
combine a turtleneck sweater with a long satin skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   If your wardrobe needs a holiday jump-start, consider these
pieces: a silk skirt or silk pant; a sweater set; a sleeveless
chiffon top; and a cotton turtleneck.
</P>
<P>
   Since black remains a staple for eveningwear, we paired this
classic with one of the season's most popular colors: anything in
cream or white. Other colors that succeed as accents are: red,
gray, pink, brown and gold.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that any outfit can be dressed up or down with a change
of accessories, and best of all, the right accessories can be worn
long after the tinsel has been stashed away.
</P>
<P>
   The five pieces to ease into holiday dressing:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The skirt to count on: It's a full black silk circle that
looks '50s retro topped with a sweater set or paired with a beaded
tank. If you're not the swing skirt type, substitute a narrow,
midcalf-length black silk skirt.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Problem-solving pants: This slim-legged, black silk pant with
an elastic waist fits a variety of sizes, 2-14, because it softly
drapes the body. Give the pants a nightlife with a sleeveless
chiffon top with beads. Or give them a more casual bent with a
turtleneck.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Double-up dressing: A twin sweater set is this season's jacket
and the ultimate in casual luxury. Take a red or jet black set and
combine with a silk skirt or trousers. Each top can go solo as
well, even to the office, thus stretching your options.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Snappy turtle: If the invitation says casual dress, top those
silk trousers (or skirt) with a long-sleeve cotton turtleneck
striped in black and white. Add a red sash for an accent color.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tanked to go: A red beaded chiffon tank is an elegant topper
for black silk trousers, or it could unite with a full satin skirt.
For more mileage, wear it under a suit during the day. And don't
forget about wearing it on Valentine's Day.

 &HT;    Thomasville becomes magical place in annual return to Victorian
era
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOMASVILLE, Ga. _ Victorian Christmas brings out the past in
this genteel southwest Georgia city.
</P>
<P>
   A red-velvet-robed St. Nicholas sitting in a sleigh in the
middle of Broad Street lends an ear to wee ones whose eyes are
aglow with the promise of the season. A strolling choir sings ``God
Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen'' as a horse and buggy clip-clops down the
brick downtown streets. Jolly notes from a steam calliope bounce
through the chill night air, and a storyteller spins a yarn by the
light of a roaring bonfire. And above the festive din ring the
melodic bells of church handbell choirs and stalwart Salvation Army
kettle-keepers.
</P>
<P>
   Standing under an old-fashioned streetlight, taking in this
magical scene, you half expect Bob Cratchit, with Tiny Tim hoisted
upon his shoulders, to come around the corner _ or Mrs. Fezziwig to
emerge from one of the well-stocked shops.
</P>
<P>
   But grouchy old Ebenezer Scrooge is nowhere in sight as dusk
brings out the holiday merrymakers, many decked out in Victorian
finery. They look just like the rich and famous who traveled into
town by rail at the turn of the century and whiled away the winter
in the lap of luxury.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th annual Victorian Christmas, Dec. 10 and 11, ushers in
the city's holiday celebration. There's everything from ``Pages
From Christmas Ages'' to an evening of holiday stories from a
bygone era at the 1884 Lapham-Patterson House intown to the
yesteryear enchantment of the Pebble Hill Plantation Candlelight
Evening at the elegant 3,000-acre estate five miles south of town.
</P>
<P>
   Community spirit shines through as local churches and schools as
well as organizations such as the Dance Theater of Thomasville, the
Salvation Army Band and the Thomasville Drama Kids get in on the
act. There's also a live Nativity at the First Baptist Church a
block off Broad Street on Jefferson Street and a Civil War
Encampment on the lawn of the Genealogical Library on both
evenings. Kids line up for pony rides and pedal-powered kiddie cars
on Broad Street and giggle at the antics of jugglers and other
street performers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful time for dressing up: Feather-hatted ladies
tuck gloved hands in the arms of their Dapper Dans in top hats.
Even the Bradford pear trees that line the downtown sidewalks sport
sparkling necklaces of white lights.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody dresses like a character straight out of Dickens.
Somehow jeans seem just fine, too. For all the old-timey ambience,
Christmas present is just behind the Victorian veneer of the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest street snacks are not scones and hot wassail but
blooming onions cooked in bubbling vats of oil by _ incongruously
enough _ the Mennonite ladies, who also sell delectable baked
goods. The longest restaurant lines are at Old Mexico. Adorable
doggies dressed like elves walk around sporting signs over their
necks proclaiming ``Take Me Home, I May Be a Star Tomorrow'' or ``I
Will Love You for Food'' as the Humane Society attempts to find
them homes. And little girls doggedly search for Beanie Babies in
the shops.
</P>
<P>
   A gentle rain that begins to fall midway through one evening
during last year's Victorian Christmas sends people scurrying for
cover inside the shops _ or at least under the awnings. Too bad it
isn't snow flurries. Now, that would be a nice touch _ not to
mention a meteorological miracle on Broad Street.

 &HT;    Ghosts of Christmas past are friendly in these festivals
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOMASVILLE, Ga. _ Georgia's Thomasville isn't the only Southern
town that strives to put Dickens in Dixie. Scenes straight from ``A
Christmas Carol'' are played out every December in Victorian

will be held Dec. 12-13 in historic Franklin, where well-known
Dickens characters make their seasonal appearance in the restored
Victorian downtown. Visitors are surrounded by the traditional
sights, sounds and aromas of a Victorian holiday: Costumed
characters, ``living windows'' of artists and craftspeople,
strolling minstrels, street vendors, horse-drawn carriages, theater
performances, hot wassail and 19th-century dishes bring the bygone
era to life. The festival closes with a ``town sing'' of
traditional Christmas music. Franklin, 15 miles south of Nashville,
is a recipient of the ``Great American Main Street'' award.

Charles Dickens, Gerald Charles Dickens, is a busy fellow this time
of year. The 34-year-old actor from Tunbridge Wells, England, will
host ``Christmas With Dickens'' at the Peabody Hotel on Wednesday,
Dec.12. Dressed in Victorian apparel, Dickens will perform excerpts
from ``A Christmas Carol'' during two teas and a special dinner.
For the teas, Dickens will present 40-minute performances from the
Christmas tale as well as tidbits about his
great-great-grandfather's life and work. The four-course English
Christmas dinner begins with a Dickensian grace and proceeds with
readings from ``A Christmas Carol'' between courses. A Victorian
parlor game follows dessert.
</P>
<P>
   (Throughout the holidays Dickens is appearing at several
Historic Hotels of America across the country. He will give two
dinner performances Dec. 11 at the Jekyll Island Club Hotel in
Jekyll Island. $45; $19.95 under age 12. 912-635-2600. For other

Carol'' performed on the rooftops of shops along Main Avenue. Shops

with life-size Victorian Santas, children, angels and other figures
designed by local artist Jan Jones. Streets are open for driving

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ To appreciate the attention to detail of Rakesh
Gangwal, who was recently promoted to chief executive of US Airways
Group, consider this: While reviewing a training tape for flight
attendants, he was dismayed to see the person portraying a business
traveler lick her finger to turn a magazine page.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she was not trying to model behavior for the flight
attendants. But no matter: Gangwal said it should have been caught
and changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tape was about excellence, and we don't want to depict
that image, even to ourselves,'' he said. ``It slipped through the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just training videos he reviews. If there is any
menu alteration, or any change to the script for flight attendant
announcements, or any adjustment in the responsibilities of
maintenance foremen, Gangwal wants to know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating the details has long been the hallmark of US Airways'
chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, for whom Rakesh has worked at United
Airlines, Air France and US Airways, where the two executives took
charge early in 1996. And so it is not surprising that Gangwal
shares aspects of his management style.
</P>
<P>
   But with the appointment of Gangwal as chief executive _ Wolf
remains chairman _ Gangwal now moves over to the captain's seat.
His flight plan is ambitious: to expand the airline's route network
and its fleet, and to improve its profitability and key measures of
its service. Indeed, he and Wolf have made quick progress on all
these fronts, including sharp improvements in on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   But what intrigues many about Gangwal is his seemingly
contradictory management style. It is top-down, in that he reviews
decisions deep in the organization. But it is also bottom-up: He
has established dozens of task forces, involving employees in
addressing everything from inadvertent deployment of evacuation
chutes to the launch of Metrojet, the low-cost operation US Airways
established to better compete with Southwest Airlines and Delta
Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it when front-line employees come up with ideas,
because I know they are the things that generally work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His style, Gangwal acknowledged, can be difficult for division
heads to adjust to, since they must be able to accept direction not
only from Gangwal but also from lower-level employees. Yet those
executives are also expected to have strong ideas of their own and
make things happen quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 30 executives in jobs at the vice-president level
or above when Wolf and Gangwal arrived, about three-quarters have
been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do impose my views in setting direction and in what we are
trying to attain, but then I let the process take over,'' he said.
``It's a very fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Calcutta, Gangwal came to the United States to get
an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,
where he helped pay his tuition by teaching math and statistics to
fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   He first worked with United as a consultant with Booz-Allen &AMP;
Hamilton, then joined United in 1984 as manager for strategic
planning. It was shortly after he was put in charge of the
company's yield-management system _ an arcane science of maximizing
revenues _ that Wolf arrived to run United.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Gangwal said, he probably made an impression on
his new boss with his candor, explaining that he had just been
given his new assignment and that it would be a long time before he
understood it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm getting deep into this stuff, I find it exciting, and
we'll do a lot of creative things,'' Gangwal recalled quickly
adding at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He did that and more. Gangwal overhauled United's route
structure, including building up its Denver hub. And when Wolf left
the airline in 1994 in the wake of an employee buyout and began
consulting with Air France, he recruited his former lieutenant to
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Gangwal quickly introduced modern airline business practices to
Air France. The fact that he did not know French was a blessing in
disguise, he said, because he did not have to read lengthy reports
on pending decisions that, to him, were obvious.
</P>
<P>
   When Wolf was recruited to USAir (he renamed it US Airways), he
told the board he would not come without Gangwal. And now Wolf is
pulling back, confident that Gangwal is watching the details.
</P>
<P>
   That means long days for Gangwal. He is in the office here by 7
in the morning and heads home by 7 p.m. to spend some time with his
9-year-old daughter, including helping her with mathematics.
(``Math cleanses your mind for thinking clearly,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he puts in a couple more hours of work before bed. He likes
to travel, and _ before the current professional basketball strike
_ occasionally took in an NBA game. His heart is with United's
hometown Chicago Bulls, but he also likes the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he expects not to worry so much about details, but
it won't be soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has the amazing ability to let go when things are going
right,'' he said. ``That's something I definitely want to learn,
but at this stage I feel that there are too many things I want to
put my imprint on as we build this airline.''

TEXAN RETIRES FROM REPAIRING WINDMILLS OF HIS MIND 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPEARMAN, Texas _ J.B. Buchanan was 3 when he climbed his first
windmill, bringing his mother up the platform in a mad dash to haul
him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   He was 92 when he climbed his last one earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife got after me and made me quit the last time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the last one he admits to. An 89-year-old habit
is hard to break.
</P>
<P>
   And, even if Buchanan no longer scales the swaying timbers of
windmill platforms, he is the owner of 16 of the vintage machines,
two of which reside in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 14 stand in Buchanan's back yard, just south of
Spearman. They have been landmarks there for the past 30 years, a
cluster that rises conspicuously from the flat, West Texas horizon,
visible for miles on the west side of Texas 207.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar sight will soon be a thing of the past, however.
Buchanan has donated his collection to Spearman and, soon, they are
to be moved to a five-acre plot in town, where the city fathers
hope to achieve the title of ``Windmill City.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a logical move for Buchanan, who has been solely
responsible for the restoration and maintenance of the windmills
since he began collecting them 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's one that leaves him pensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss them,'' he said. ``All my life I've loved
windmills.''
</P>
<P>
   That fascination began when he was a toddler, manifesting itself
on the day his mother frantically clambered up the rough boards of
the Currie Windmill on their Oklahoma ranch to retrieve her
youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   It continued as a youth, when the family moved to West Texas and
Buchanan gladly took over the unpopular job of oiling windmills on
the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize it, looking at them from the ground, but
they all sway in the wind,'' he said. ``Standing up there on that
little platform you can move as much as two or three feet from side
to side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't mind. A windmill to me was just like a kite to
another boy. It was a source of life. It provided the only water we
had and it was the highest thing around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our lookout post when we were kids. My daddy didn't
want us riding his calves and, of course, we rode 'em every time he
went to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd post my sister up on the windmill to holler whenever she
saw him heading back.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's first restoration project came when he was 14 and
found a dilapidated windmill, half buried in a creek bank. He
retrieved it, restored the blades and installed it atop a pole at
the entrance to the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first the cows would just wander up and stare at it and
look around for the water trough that was supposed to be below
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when Buchanan was a wheat farmer, he looked out
across the uncluttered plain of the Texas Panhandle and realized he
was missing something.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just nothing on the horizon,'' he said. ``All the
windmills had been replaced by submersible electric pumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1968, he was browsing in a store in New Mexico when he
found something he couldn't resist _ a pristine Eclipse Windmill,
still in its shipping crate and never sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eclipse was to windmills what Stetson was to hats,'' said
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the mill (the first of his collection), built a
platform for it in his back yard and hoisted it to the top. Then,
he gazed with satisfaction as its blades spun in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Others followed. Whenever Buchanan would hear of an old
windmill, he would contact the owner and ask if he could have it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he amassed the state's largest collection. In addition to
the Eclipse, there were Star mills, Dempster Umbrella mills (a rare
design that folded in on itself and protected its blades whenever
the wind became too strong), and Curries, reminiscent of the ones
he had climbed as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Currie was the most common because it was the cheapest,''
said Buchanan. ``You could buy one for $14 when I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave the Eclipse and another similar mill to the Smithsonian
soon after their purchase, but he has maintained the others in his
back yard ever since.
</P>
<P>
   It was a varied collection, ranging from a tiny Star mill to a
massive Dempster, whose blades spanned 18 feet. All were functional
and all whirred in the incessant West Texas wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember staying out here in the summer when I was a kid,''
said Roger Buchanan, a grandson. ``We'd sleep with the windows open
and all night you could hear the whir and clack of all those mills.
It wasn't loud, just sort of peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Buchanan's finds required extensive restoration and he
became a competent carpenter and blacksmith in the process. In a
barn behind his house he hammered bent metal blades flat on an
anvil, shaped wheels from water-soaked oak and cut precise grooves
for the countless, wooden blades of the Dempsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed it,'' he said, ``but it's gotten to be too much.
I can't keep them in repair anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, members of the Spearman Chamber of Commerce,
including Buchanan's grandson and son, Burl, a former mayor of the
town, formed the Southwestern Pioneer Windmill Association and
dedicated the five-acre plot for the mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The businesses in town are each going to adopt one of the
windmills and assume the maintenance,'' said Roger Buchanan.
``We're getting some other windmills from around the state and we
hope to have about 30 eventually, with my grandfather's in one spot
and about 15 others scattered throughout the town.''
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as a mixed blessing to &UR;  &LR; Illa Mae Buchanan, J.B.
Buchanan's wife. Though fond of the windmills and their constant
hum, she has been admonishing her husband to stay off the platforms
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started telling him 10 years ago that he was too old to get
up on those things and oil them,'' she said. ``Then, last year, I
told him he absolutely had to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he'd quit, but I don't know if I can believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated nearby, watching though a window as the wind spun one of
the massive Dempsters, J.B. Buchanan quietly smiled. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last year, when Greta Carl, a 55-year-old lawyer in
Chicago, was told by her doctor that she was nearly 100 percent
clean from her bout with ovarian cancer, she grew her hair to her
shoulders for the first time in her life, and dyed her gray hair
Goldilocks blond. ``I love it,'' she said. ``It's flattering. It's
sexier. It's a way of shouting, `Hey, I'm alive!'''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Carl, releasing her inner blonde was an act of
fearlessness. ``I've always been the kind of person who wouldn't
want to be noticed,'' she said. Chemotherapy had left her bald. ``I
had a bloated, fat face, no eyebrows and eyelashes, and people
would not recognize me,'' she recalled. ``So, I bought my Shirley
MacLaine wig, short and red. That way I had an excuse for how my
appearance had changed.''
</P>
<P>
   When she got better, the hair grew back. Having tried red, she
had the courage to go blond. Men notice her more now than in her
gray days; her boyfriend, she said, ``loves to see me playing with
my hair in the mirror.'' She added, ``Confronting a
life-threatening illness forces you to use parts of your spirit and
your brain that you've never used before.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer survivors often go through radical life changes. They
switch jobs, spouses and friends. And for many women, radical
changes in their appearance _ a new hair color, figure or wardrobe
_ can also mark the transition. After radiation, chemotherapy or
surgery, beauty makeovers are often a form of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanity becomes a statement of survival, of living one's life
in the moment,'' said Michael States, the clinical program director
at the Santa Monica, Calif., chapter of the Wellness Community, a
national support group for cancer patients and their families.
``It's regaining control.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eugene Thiessen, an oncologist who in 1976 founded Share:
Self-Help for Women With Breast or Ovarian Cancer, an organization
in Manhattan, said he found that women who survive cancer often
have a new sense of urgency to look their best. ``Women come to
grips with the fact they are living one day at a time,'' he said.
``And they don't put off doing things that might enhance them _ a
makeover, hair, makeup, clothing. Whatever they feel is
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly true for Peri Wolfman, an owner of the
Wolfman-Gold and Good Company home-furnishings store in SoHo. Ten
years ago, she had double mastectomies (and breast reconstruction),
about the same time that her youngest son left home for college.
Her hair, rapidly turning white, was cut short and severe.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to remake her image from head to toe. Before her
illness, Ms. Wolfman had exercised only occasionally. ``I hate
flab,'' she said, ``and I wanted to make myself toned.'' She
started going to the gym and, with a personal trainer, lost 10
pounds. She let her hair grow so that it tumbled in wavy tendrils.
``It's tousled, messier hair,'' said Ms. Wolfman, who also dyed it
with black streaks, inspired by her new black-and-white Tibetan
terrier puppies.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Ms. Wolfman got in touch with a softer (although
trimmer) side, Ann Fonfa went in the opposite direction. After
breast cancer, Ms. Fonfa, the outreach coordinator at Share, forged
a look to match a tougher new self-image. Every inch of her _ short
hair, bare tank top, tattoos _ tells the story. For Ms. Fonfa, 50,
fashion is a form of autobiography. The tank top doesn't hide her
two mastectomies. (Her size 34D breasts are gone.) Before she got
sick, she had shielded her chest demurely in tailored suits and
blouses buttoned to her throat. She had long, full, wavy hair.
After chemotherapy, she kept her hair in a crew cut, giving her the
look of a middle-aged punk rocker. The effect is that of a militant
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable being around women with no hair, if
I had a full head of hair,'' said Ms. Fonfa, who on her left arm
wears a black elastic pressure sleeve, used by cancer patients to
prevent swelling after their lymph nodes have been removed. A
tattoo of a coral snake slithers down her shoulder. Beneath the
scar on her right breast, she has five more tattoos _ of a gold
ring and four pink rings _ emblems of each cancer-free year. ``A
lot of survivors have tattoos,'' Ms. Fonfa said, ``because they
tattoo you when they radiate you. They're measuring where the
radiation will be. I wanted to reclaim that.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Fonfa's look was an act of defiance, a way of
expressing her outrage about what she saw as a ``mutilated body.''
But her outlook changed one day last March when she was walking
down University Place, on her way back from the Union Square
Greenmarket. ``I was wearing a leather jacket, a white spandex tank
top,'' she recalled, ``and a gay guy came by and said, `Great bod!'
_ and that did it.'' She began to  &UR; like &LR;  her new look.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Rich, a senior editor at Allure magazine in Manhattan, had
a bone marrow transplant to treat her breast cancer. Afterward she
went to spas to ``thank my body for taking me through all that,''
she said. She went on a shopping spree for celebratory clothes.
``I'd been wearing really baggy clothes, loose overblouses and
leggings,'' said Ms. Rich, who is at work on a memoir, which
includes her battle with cancer, to be published next year by
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the transplant, I started wearing more tailored and
tighter-fitting clothes _ body-hugging sweaters, shorter skirts,''
she said. ``There's a sense when you go through this that you're so
sexless, and in every way, cancer takes away your gender.'' But the
new look was short-lived. ``I've returned to my original style,''
she said. ``There's a reason your original style  &UR; is &LR;  your style.
It's because it looks good on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some makeovers are health-related, said Dr. Deborah Axelrod, a
surgical oncologist who specializes in breast cancer at Beth Israel
Medical Center. ``You don't want to be heavy, because obesity plays
some role in post-menopausal breast cancer,'' Dr. Axelrod said. She
encourages her patients to practice yoga and to stretch and run,
and she tells them, ``You're not a pariah, you're not an outcast.''
</P>
<P>
   As for men, they seem to go in for far fewer post-cancer
makeovers than women; men change things like unsatisfying jobs more
readily than their looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have a sense that style reflects their lives, but men
don't have that,'' said Nick Ullett, 57, a survivor of
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an actor and an occasional commentator on
National Public Radio's ``All Things Considered.'' He identified
one external change that some men do make after cancer. ``Men who
go through radiation or chemotherapy lose their hair, and go around
with semishaven hair,'' he said. ``It's the remission crew cut.''
He sports one, himself.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by men or women, a makeover doesn't have to be an
overhaul. For some cancer survivors, even the smallest change in a
beauty ritual can be liberating. Joan Douglass, 70, of Marina Del
Rey, Calif., said, ``I was a dedicated smoker'' _ one and a half to
two packs a day since she was a teen-ager. In 1997, lung cancer was
diagnosed. After her operation, her granddaughter suggested that
she paint her fingernails blue. To celebrate the simple pleasure of
being able to walk (slowly) and breathe (slowly), she lacquered her
nails lavender to go with her favorite lavender clothes, as well as
silver, pale green and navy blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who on earth had to decree that nail polish had to be pink or
red?'' Ms. Douglass said. ``It's a trivial thing, but it pleases
me. It's pretty. It makes me happy to look at it, and I think
people who have had cancer want to have fun.''

   Wages and salaries may not be rising much at many companies, but
severance pay has grown so generous that even temporary employees
are sometimes paid to leave, according to a new survey of personnel
managers at more than 1,800 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary workers were eligible for severance pay at 7 percent
of the companies; 20 percent reported helping temporary workers
find jobs elsewhere.

   The survey, conducted by Lee Hecht Harrison, an outplacement
firm based in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., also found that severance
packages among all employees were more abundant than three years
ago, when the previous survey was done.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Kenny, chief operating officer of Lee Hecht Harrison,
said that the tight job market was encouraging more companies to
offer additional money and services to departing employees.
``Retaining employees is more important now than ever before,'' she
said. ``By providing these services, the remaining employees say,
`This company treats employees well.' It makes the company an
employer of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found the most munificent severance packages in the
food, beverage and tobacco industries, followed by transportation
and travel. The areas with the stingiest packages were professional
and business services as well as computer software and hardware
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly all the companies surveyed extend medical insurance for
a time after severance; about half continue life insurance. Both
figures are up sharply from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 3 companies in 10 said they now offered job placement
services to a wider range of employees than they did in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many companies can be talked into increasing severance
benefits in some circumstances. Just over half said they might be
willing to pay more cash, up from 40 percent three years ago; about
a third said they might leave insurance coverage in effect longer,
up from 25 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average range of severance for top-level employees was 11
to 39 weeks' pay; the average range for workers at the bottom of
the ladder was 5 to 27 weeks' pay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies have become a bit less indulgent of employees
dismissed for poor performance: 26 percent offered them severance
pay, down from one-third in 1995.

CASPIAN OIL PIPELINE SUFFERS A SETBACK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Prospects for quick construction of an
American-backed oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea were set back
further this week when a senior oil executive said the countries
supporting it do not seem willing to help pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the political importance of this route,'' said
the executive, John Leggate, who heads the consortium of oil
companies that is considering pipeline routes. ``Nevertheless, not
a single country supporting it has suggested it would participate
in financing the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Leggate did not name any countries, but the three through which
the pipeline would pass are Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are lobbying hard for the route
because it would favor American interests, but have concluded that
it is politically impossible for them to subsidize it. They want
Turkey to do so, and in recent weeks Turkey has offered concessions
on taxes and transit fees. But Leggate's comments suggested that
these concessions are far from enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the cheaper and the most expensive
options could be $500 million a year,'' he said Thursday at a news
conference in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, where the Caspian
Sea oil boom is centered. ``We will seek a route that will be
profitable even at very low oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The route favored by the United States would run from Baku to
Ceyhan, Turkey, on the Mediterranean. Leggate said a pipeline along
this route would cost $3.7 billion, compared with $1.8 billion for
a shorter route to Georgia. He said the companies are also
considering rebuilding an old but functioning pipeline to the
Russian port at Novorossisk, which he estimated would cost $2.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Reports last month that oil companies were unwilling to
recommend the Baku-Ceyhan route provoked a flurry of statements and
trips to the Caspian region by Clinton administration officials.
They insisted that the Baku-Ceyhan line is the best choice despite
its cost.
</P>
<P>
   The United States favors this route because it passes through
pro-American countries and would bind them closer to Western
interests. It would also avoid Russia and Iran, which are promoting
routes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But oil companies say they cannot build such an expensive
pipeline with their own resources.
</P>
<P>
   Leggate said the consortium would meet to consider various
routes on Dec. 4 but probably would not make a final choice. He
also said low oil prices had led the companies to delay at least
six months a project to develop a new Caspian field known as
Azeri-Chyrag-Guneshli.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was among executives who long for an end to
American sanctions on Iran so they can build their main export
pipeline there, Leggate said it was ``not appropriate'' for him to
reply. The consortium includes American companies, and therefore
cannot choose the Iran route as long as sanctions remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably Leggate's last public appearance for the
consortium, the Azerbaijan International Operating Co. The
consortium announced on Friday that he will be replaced on Jan. 1
by David Woodward, an engineer with British Petroleum, who is
currently stationed in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has staked much prestige on the
Baku-Ceyhan project, but Leggate's statements were only the latest
in a stream of warnings from executives and others that it does not
yet make financial sense. Leaders of countries in the region signed
a declaration last month pledging support for the project, but
their pledge included no financial commitments and has evidently
not altered the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of their backing, the project does seem rather
ill-starred,'' Jan R. Prins, a banker involved in financing large
energy projects, told oil executives this month in London.
``Additional capital contributions or price guarantees are needed
from those countries that attach such great political importance to
this particular export route.''

for Sunday, Nov. 27, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The problem with the $206 billion
tobacco settlement, say economists and legal experts (as opposed to
anti-smoking advocates), is that 99 percent of the $206 billion is
a disguised tax hike. Taxing cigarettes more heavily may be a good
idea, but labeling a tax on consumers as ``damages'' being paid by
Big Tobacco is fraudulent. The deal forces citizens of modest means
to subsidize well-heeled lawyers and wealthy owners of cigarette
companies. By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-REVIEW (Washington) _ The upcoming effort by Congress and
the Clinton administration to reform Social Security could as
easily end in partisan gridlock as in the historic achievement both
parties are hoping for. The debate encapsulates fundamental
tradeoffs: between individual and collective responsibility, market
forces and government, and maximizing rewards and minimizing risks.
By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-CARS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Once upon a time, 1998 was
going to be the year of the electric car. But now it seems an idea
whose time has been put on hold. The technology behind electric
cars improves yearly, but the cars themselves fail to attract
buyers. Experts say the reason is they are not as flexible as
gasoline cars, and policy-makers have become reconciled to gasoline
as engines have become cleaner and oil cheaper. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ At the height of its global
ascendancy, supposedly optimistic and youth-obsessed America is
also fixated on death. A sampling of recent books on death and
bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   RENO-COUNSELS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The independent counsel law,
enacted to keep politics out of high-level corruption cases, has
been a constant source of political trouble for Attorney General
Janet Reno, but it has probably helped her keep her job. By David
Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   EXPECTATIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Wherever a plan is hatched based
on rational expectations of other people's expectations, it rears
its head, decreeing that the very result that the plan is designed
to prevent will in fact come to pass, quickly and inevitably. Put
more scientifically, expectation of an expectation alters the
expected expectation. By David Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Moving in `i' category
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-MIDEAST-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Diplomats watching for
Saddam Hussein's next move sense something profoundly different in
the Iraqi air. Some Arab and Western experts now see signs that he
is more isolated in the region than at any time since his 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which drove fellow Arab nations into backing
the U.S.-led coalition in the Gulf war. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-GUILT-REVIEW (Berlin) _ A fierce debate has erupted
about the place of memory and the shame, if any, that young Germans
should feel for the crimes of their forebears. Germany has broached
such issues before; but in its scope, openness and vitriol, the
current discussion appears to be without precedent. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIANS-AID-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Monday's opening of a
U.S.-sponsored conference of international aid donors to the
Palestinians is a reminder of just how far they have to go before
achieving economic independence. By William A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-EUROPE-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ For generations, even for
centuries, Turks have debated how to relate to Europe and, by
extension, the Western world. In recent weeks the issue has been
brought to the fore again, this time by an extradition dispute over
a fugitive Kurdish rebel leader. By Stephen Kinzer.

FOR DIRT AND ARMCHAIR GARDENERS ALIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
(lb) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all of a gardener's tools require sharpening, oiling and
stowing for the winter. Some of them, in fact, get their heaviest
workout in the off-season: a gardener's books. Many a winter's
evening is happily spent leafing through the library when nothing
else is in leaf.
</P>
<P>
   A garden library has something in common with the garden. It
grows, sometimes uncontrollably. Mine has several hundred volumes
now, some purchased new but more picked up at used-book stores and
rummage sales.
</P>
<P>
   Some are businesslike books on plant diseases, insects and
propagation techniques. Some are collections of essays on gardening
by the likes of Henry Mitchell and Allen Lacy, cherished as much
for the quality of their prose as for their practical guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Some are historical in nature, although perhaps they weren't
intended to be. Consider ``How to Make a Vegetable Garden,'' a 1905
volume by Edith Loring Fullerton. An adventurous gardener who lived
in Medford and Wading River on Long Island, N.Y., Mrs. Fullerton
once sowed the seeds of a newly introduced salad green. Her seed
catalog called it roquette, as it is still known in Britain, but on
this side of the pond we usually call it arugula.
</P>
<P>
   To say that she didn't care for it is a sizable understatement.
``Do not, I beg of you, raise roquette in your garden,'' she wrote.
``It is not fit to associate with quiet, peaceful, dignified,
stately vegetables of the truly edible sort.''
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the accompanying photograph explains the problem.
Mrs. Fullerton's stunted and sad-looking arugula plants had bolted
to seed, a point at which the leaves would have been strongly
flavored enough to singe one's tonsils.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for modern gardeners, there are plenty of books
available on how to grow arugula and other specialty vegetables, so
no one need suffer Mrs. Fullerton's unpleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The most-used books in my collection are references, rather than
how-to books. I keep one at hand to cross-check catalog
descriptions. This has prevented a few catastrophes, as when a
plant is described in a catalog as an easy-care ground cover and in
a reference book as an invasive weed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my favorites are wildly out of date, like a reference
from the early 1960s that recommends killing earthworms to prevent
their ``unsightly castings'' from marring the lawn surface, but
these books are so full of useful information on how to grow a
particular plant that they earn their keep on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The most comprehensive is Hortus Third, by the staff of the
Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium at Cornell University. A wonderful
book it is, all 1,288 hefty pages of it, and it was a pricey
addition to the library. But it, too, is out of date. In the years
since its 1976 publication, the taxonomists have been busy
rearranging the classifications of many common garden plants.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the better catalogs are helpfully referring me
from Chrysanthemum to the new classifications, like Leucanthemum,
Dendranthema and Tanacetum, but one day the forwarding addresses
will be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   I need a new taxonomy guide, and there are two leading
contenders: ``The American Horticultural Society A-Z of Garden
Plants'' (DK Publishing, 1997, $80), and the ``Index of Garden
Plants: The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary,'' (Timber
Press, 1994, $60).
</P>
<P>
   The ``Index of Garden Plants'' is a pared-down version of the
Royal Horticultural Society's four-volume dictionary, which at $800
is a bit out of my price range. The one-volume version still lists
60,000 plants and includes growing information. The American
Horticultural Society's tome has fewer entries, but 15,000 listings
should cover most of what I need to know, and it has illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   During the gardening season, the most-thumbed books are how-tos.
I still use and love ``Crockett's Victory Garden'' (Little, Brown,
1977), by James Underwood Crockett, the first host of the popular
public television program. It is out of print but still turns up
occasionally in used-book stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden Way's Joy of Gardening'' (Storey Books, 1983) is also a
good general guide to vegetable gardening and is still available
for $20.
</P>
<P>
   I have beautiful garden books, many of them gifts, that are lush
with photographs of elaborate gardens that mere mortals can but
dream about. I have equally treasured books with broken spines and
shabby covers, found at yard sales by friends who feed my plant
passion whenever the opportunity presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   One such find is the smallest in my collection, 4 inches by 5
inches and a mere 60 pages long. It's the New Pronouncing
Dictionary of Plant Names (American Nurseryman Publishing Co.,
1989, $6).
</P>
<P>
   This tiny book keeps me from embarrassing myself by referring to
calendula as cal-en-DOO-la instead of cal-EN-doo-la, and it tells
me that ``calendula'' is the botanical name for pot marigold, which
is even easier to say. It tells me that if a species is named
``graveolens'' (pronounced gra-VEE-oh-lenz), it means heavily
scented, a useful bit of knowledge when I'm considering a new plant
for the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Fine tools, these books. They offer so much utility for so
little maintenance _ no sharpening, no oiling, no new spark plugs.
They do, of course, need occasional dusting.

   CONSUMER _ ATLANTA _Retailers just don't get it. Christmas is
the bread-and-butter of the industry, yet retailers (particularly
department stores) have a lot to learn about merchandising and
targeting shoppers, according to national experts who have studied
the metro Atlanta area. The most obvious things are overlooked _
children's apparel departments don't make room for strollers; toy
stores are made to appeal to kids, not the grandparents who have
the money to splurge. Will include observations from local malls as
well. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

pine forest, cotton and peanut fields. But to some of the richest

button-downed eccentrics as The Kahuna, The Brain and The Bond

Today, their religious headquarters draw millions of tourists. The
Tabernacle is home to the famed choir; The Beehive House was the
original residence of Brigham Young, built in 1854; and the
genealogical library is one of the finest in the world. But
visitors, who attend can attend concerts in beautifully landscaped
parks or stroll through the church museum needn't plan to enter the
temple. It's reserved for the most reverent, secret ceremonies of
the faith. Only members who have a special ``recommend'' from their
church leaders can cross its threshold. (White, Atlanta

a direct contrast,'' said Johnson, now 53 and a nurse who lives in
Jefferson Twp. with her husband. ``The music was beautiful and

   RICKY WILLIAMS BROKE NCAA RUSHING RECORD TODAY
</P>
<P>
   FBC-RICKY-MAIN _ Main story on Ricky Williams' run to glory.
(Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-RICKYBEST _ A story that puts into perspective just what
Ricky Williams has achieved in passing the previous NCAA rushing
record of 6,082 yards previously held by former Pittsburgh running
back Tony Dorsett of Pitt, who played professionally for the Dallas
Cowboys. How many other great running backs didn't reach that
number and how durable he had to be. Story will invclude comments
from Mack Brown, Darrell Royal and others. (Wangrin, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   w/FBC-HEISMAN _ Setting the NCAA rushing record almost assures
Williams of winning the Heisman Trophy. How could voters not give
it to the all-time rusher? Well, it used to happen. Lists of
winners. Some of the notable rushing leaders who did not win the
Heisman. (Maher, Austin American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS and LIST
</P>
<P>
   FBC-SENIOR _ Why did Williams decide to come back for his senior
year? He could have gone in the NFL draft last year and would have
been a first-round pick. He gambled that he wouldn't get hurt and
blow it all (except the Lloyd's of London policy) or have a
disappointing year and drop in the draft (which might have left him
playing for the Philadelphia Phillies). But Ricky guessed right and
this has worked out for him. He came back because he wanted the
Dorsett record and the Heisman. And he has checks coming in from
the Phillies now. Was it all about yardage? Or did he want to get
closer to a degree? (Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   FBC-DRAFT _ Cleveland TV stations are doing interviews with
Ricky. The Cleveland Browns are running the character checks. Looks
like they want to use their No. 1 pick in the draft on Ricky. How
much money would that mean? Do the Browns need his kind of running
back? When Tony Dorsett set the rushing record, the Cowboys didn't
have the No. 1 pick. But they traded to get him. Are there other
teams out there wanting Ricky badly enough to do some last-minute
war-room trading? We'll ask the experts. (Cantu, Austin
American-Statesman). WITH GRAPHIC (of all his records set, pending,
tied and yet to come).
</P>
<P>
   FBC-GATECH-UGA _ Georgia-Georgia Tech advance. There will be a
lot on the line for both Georgia and Georgia Tech in the
regular-season finale Saturday. The most important prize will be
bragging rights, which Georgia has owned for the last seven years.

 &HT;    Williams puts up guts, class, perserverance for record year
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The contents of the glass-covered, oak pseudo-locker
set off from the rest in the Texas Longhorns' dressing room include
a cardboard box filled with light fixtures, an electric power
strip, several plastic bags from Wal-Mart and a fine coating of
dust.
</P>
<P>
   That will soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Come early next year, it will hold a jersey, helmet and etched
bio of the most prolific running back in major-college history. It
will sit right next to one holding the No. 20 of Heisman Trophy
winner Earl Campbell, at the far right end of a cluster that also
include hermitically sealed shrines to Darrell Royal, Tommy Nobis,
Scott Appleton, Tony Degrate, Brad Shearer and Kenneth Sims.
</P>
<P>
   It will honor Ricky Williams, who will leave Texas as the most
decorated player in Longhorns history: likely with a pair of Doak
Walker Awards, two-time consensus All-American honors, a Maxwell
Award, a Heisman Trophy and 11 NCAA records.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago as he recited numbers, his numbers, with an
accountant's familiarity, an interviewer was struck with the notion
that maybe, just maybe, Williams was being less than sincere when a
half hour earlier he had professed to a cluster of media that he
didn't care about records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one,'' he replied simply.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's his.
</P>
<P>
   With a 60-yard touchdown run in the first quarter Friday in his
final game at Royal-Memoriasl Stadium, Williams passed former Pitt
star Tony Dorsett as the NCAA Division I-A all-time leading rusher.
Dorsett, whose perimeter speed was no match for the slow-footed
defenses of his era, ran for 6,082 yards for Pitt from 1973 to '76
and finished his career with a national title and Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   For 22 years the mark stood. The career passing record? Last
broken in '91 by Ty Detmer. Career receiving yards? Two years ago
by Marcus Harris of Wyoming. Scoring? Just this season by Williams.
But before that? In '91 by Houston kicker Roman Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   A jump ahead
</P>
<P>
   For all practical purpose, Dorsett was the Bob Beamon of the
NCAA record book. When Beamon long-jumped 29 feet, 2 1/2 inches at
the '68 Olympics in Mexico City, folks figured it would never be
broken. One sports biomechanist, examining the physics of Beamon's
quantum leap, calculated the force and torque needed to break it
would shred the ligaments and tear the tendons holding the
athlete's hip together. Bottom line? Hip _ breakable. Record _ not.
</P>
<P>
   As time went on, if seemed as if Dorsett's mark would be the
same rarefied air. It wasn't that the effort would destroy the
aspiring record-breaker, just that no one would even get close
enough to attempt that leap. Eight-man fronts? Try eight-figure
signing bonuses. Juniors couldn't resist. Three-and-out now took on
another meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Mike Powell jumped long enough to defy prophecies of
life with a walker _ leaping 29 feet, 4 1/2 inches at the '91 World
Championships in Tokyo _ Ricky Williams stuck around long enough to
defy prophecies of life without a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Dorsett were different runners. Dorsett, barely 5
feet 11 inches and weighing 175 pounds, relied on speed. Williams,
at 6 feet, 230, had outstanding speed but was just as willing to
take the direct route to where he was going.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett's coach, John Majors, was asked about his former star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Jim Brown, Tony was slow getting up,'' Majors said. ``He
checked all of his surroundings _ the defense, the scoreboard, the
chains. Those eyes were always in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I ever had to tell him anything twice. He had so
much pride, he never wanted you to have to tell him anything twice.
Even in practice, he ran the ball an extra 20 yards downfield. He
ran to score, every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Majors could just as easily have been talking about Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, in his second stint at Pitt, Majors coached against a
freshman fullback making only his second career start. ``I could
see he would be excellent, because of his power, speed and
open-field ability,'' Majors said of Williams. ``He was very
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   There are multitude backs with great physical skills. There's
only one who holds the record.
</P>
<P>
   What Williams has accomplished took more than 4.38 speed,
hydraulic thighs and a stiff arm that could probably fend off a
floored Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   It took durability. In four seasons, Williams has overcome a
badly sprained ankle, a stress fracture in his foot, fractured
ribs, a pulled thigh muscle, a stomach ulcer and a stomped-on shin.
</P>
<P>
   It took perseverance. In his first season and a half, Williams
had 20 or more carries in a game only once. Even without a passing
game to turn to last year, former coach John Mackovic gave Williams
the ball more than 19 times only once in the first four games. Then
he carried 40 times for 223 yards against Oklahoma, and it became
obvious to everybody that Williams was the Horns' only fearsome
threat. He never had fewer than 20 carries a game the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing? It saved him some pounding. Curse? Dorsett carried
1,074 times in his career. The play on which Williams broke
Dorsett's record was career carry No. 981. Marcus Allen had 403
touches in 1981, the year he set a then single-season record of
2,342 yards. Both played at least a decade in the NFL. Dorsett is
in the Hall of Fame; Allen may be. That begs the question: What
record would we be talking about if Williams had gotten more than
166 carries as a freshman, or 205 as a sophomore?
</P>
<P>
   It took a strong supporting cast. Williams has had James Brown
and Major Applewhite to throw the ball, Priest Holmes and Shon
Mitchell to provide alternative rushing threats, Mike Adams, Pat
Fitzgerald, Wane McGarity and Kwame Cavil to keep safeties honest,
Ricky Brown to lead him into the hole and a veteran offensive line
that included All-American Dan Neil, and three players who've
started the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It took timing. Last year NCAA Division I-A teams averaged 158.7
yards a game rushing, the lowest since 1966. Wither the run?
Hardly. Of the top eight single-season rushing totals in major
college history, five have occurred in the last half-decade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Byron Hanspard of Texas Tech ran for 2,084 yards,
fifth-best ever _ but only second-best that season. Teams may not
be running as well, but individuals are running better than ever.
Right time. Right place.
</P>
<P>
   It took explosiveness. You don't slog your way to 6,279 yards.
None of the top five rushers all-time averaged fewer than 5.29
yards a carry. All broke at least one run over 70 yards. Williams
has five longer than that, and three more of at least 60, four more
of at least 50 and a total of 17 at least 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It took color-blindness. Williams couldn't recognize the color
green. Three backs with better totals after their junior season _
Herschel Walker, Marshall Faulk and Hanspard _ couldn't resist,
leaving early for the riches of pro football. All mortgaged
potential collegiate immortality for more-or-less nondescript NFL
careers. Williams wanted it all. Projected as perhaps the top pick
in the April draft, if the new Cleveland Browns decide they want a
franchise runner instead of a franchise passer, he may get it.
</P>
<P>
   It took guts. The only numbers guaranteed about Williams' senior
year were the ones he wore on his jersey. Even a switch from 11 to
34, though, wouldn't keep teams from zeroing in him, stacking the
line of scrimmage and doing everything within their power to keep
him from beating them. Opponents have hit him late, stood him up
and taken their shots. One Baylor player stomped on his shin.
Another ripped off his helmet. Before the season, at the urging of
his family and advisors, he took out a $2.9 million insurance
policy in case of injury and then took forever to finish the
paperwork, saying, ``The only insurance policy I need is my
degree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Iowa State we had a senior back named Dwayne
Crutchfield,'' recalled Texas Coach Mack Brown. ``After one game,
an opposing coach came up to me and said, 'Since we don't have to
play against him again, I'll tell you _ you have tendencies with
Crutchfield.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Yeah, I'd say _ we ran him 49 times.'
Sometimes with great players, you have tendencies. ... The great
thing about Ricky is if you hand it to him enough, he'll get his
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis said: ``To put it in
perspective, in my 26 years of coaching, I've been around one
national record,'' said Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis.
``That includes Eric Zeier (at Georgia) leading the nation in
passing. Then I get here, and Ricky's breaking a new one every
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, in the lobby of a sparkling glass and steel structure at
111 South St. Joseph in South Bend, Ind., they'll find a suitable
place. There they'll hang a No. 34 jersey, next to the game ball
from the last game and newspaper clippings about college football's
newest record holder.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the College Football Hall of Fame, Ricky Williams.

 &HT;    Where everybody knows his name
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was mid-August in Austin. Two-a-day workouts
had just started, and on this particular morning, strength and
conditioning coach Jeff ``Mad Dog'' Madden lived up to his rabid
nickname when he ordered the University of Texas football players
to shed their shoulder pads and start running wind sprints.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Patmon was running alongside Ricky Williams, when he began
chiding his best friend. ``Glad you stayed now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, sweating from his brutal workout, huffed out a
distinctive ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has never wavered about his decision to pass on the NFL
draft after last season and stay for his senior year at Texas, even
during Mad Dog's conditioning drills. Even when his 43-yard game
against Kansas State temporarily knocked him from the Heisman
Trophy race and off course for the most impressive record in
Division I-A football history.
</P>
<P>
   He celebrated his decision recently, when he ran for 259 yards
to break Tony Dorsett's Division I-A career rushing record, meeting
one of the goals he set 11 months ago. Another goal _ the Heisman
Trophy _ most likely is soon to follow.
</P>
<P>
   All his life Williams has displayed a tendency to bull through
the obvious. The unexpected is expected from the 21-year-old from
San Diego, so his decision to stay was part of a quirky life trend
he started years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky likes to be different,'' Patmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' announcement last January that he would stay for his
senior season drew national headlines. The news was shocking
because only a handful of players with his earning power had ever
turned down the NFL to stay in college.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' closest friends and family members weren't
surprised when he uttered these words at his press conference:
``When I came here three years ago, I set a lot of personal and
team goals, to win a lot of games, maybe the Heisman, and get my
degree, and that's why I've decided to come back for another
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Patmon said Williams told him: ``I've been broke for the first
20 years of my life. There's no reason I can't be broke for the
first 21.'' Yet his friends and family also conceded that they
would not have been surprised if Williams had abruptly changed his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something different,'' said UT wide receiver Wane
McGarity, a close friend of Williams. ``He's a guy who likes
change. But it wouldn't have shocked me if he changed his mind.
Ricky's not an indecisive person. He just likes to change his
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Williams, Ricky's mother, said: ``I never know what he'll
do. I didn't know what he was going to do until his press
conference. All I had been hearing was `I'm staying,' or `I'm
leaving.'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had until Jan. 9 to petition the NFL for the draft. His
Boston-based attorney had filled out the needed paperwork, but
Williams never gave him the go-ahead to fax it to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Before his announcement Jan. 8, pro football insiders considered
Williams to be the best running back available for the draft. Early
mock drafts had him as high as the No. 4 pick, meaning Williams
probably put off a possible $20 million contract, including a $6
million signing bonus, to stay one more year.
</P>
<P>
   In case he suffered a career-ending injury this fall, he took
out a $2.9 million insurance policy through the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a decision that he started thinking about in October,''
said Bucky Godbolt, Williams' former running backs coach and close
confidant. ``He came here to win the Heisman. He listened to a lot
of people. A lot of people told him about all the money he could
make.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he liked it here. Austin is really similar to San Diego.
He felt comfortable here. And plus, he likes being liked. When
people cheer him, that makes him feel good. He's been through
minor-league baseball. He's been booed. He used to tell me there
was always one guy in the stands who would shout every day, `Why
don't you go play football.' So he's thinking, why not stay in a
place like Austin for another year?''
</P>
<P>
   Top 5 in the draft
</P>
<P>
   Early mock drafts list Williams as one of the top five picks in
the 1999 NFL draft. Barring a severe injury, his gamble of staying
an extra year in Austin has improved his NFL earning power.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Williams even made it to Austin was a testament to
his preference for the unexpected. Patmon said he and Williams
always drove up the San Diego Freeway to Los Angeles to watch
Southern Cal at the L.A. Coliseum or UCLA at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena. Yet Williams' first choice in schools, oddly enough, was
Texas A&AMP;M, which never recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   UT secondary coach Steve Bernstein had close ties to high school
coaches in San Diego and when he heard that Williams, then a senior
honor student in the gifted and talented program at Patrick Henry
High School, had an interest in Texas schools, he wasted no time
setting up a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Williams flew in to Austin for his recruiting trip while the
rest of the UT student body was on Christmas break and the football
team was preparing to play in the Sun Bowl against North Carolina,
coached at that time by current UT coach Mack Brown. Williams
committed to Texas the week after Christmas, six weeks before
national signing day.
</P>
<P>
   Patmon said the UT tradition and the fact that ``football is a
religion here'' swayed Williams from USC, his second choice.
</P>
<P>
   Before Williams got to Austin, he was selected in the eighth
round of major league baseball's draft by the Philadelphia
Phillies. He received a $50,000 signing bonus and another $25,000
payment after his freshman season at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His baseball agents have negotiated enough endorsements since
then to up the overall total to six figures. The Phillies also are
paying for Williams' scholarship, which includes living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Williams' mother, twin sister, Cassie, and
younger sister, Nisey, moved to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Williams said the vagabond lifestyle of a minor-league
baseball player helped keep her son in Austin for his senior
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved the college life,'' she said. ``He told me he wasn't
ready for pro football and he knew that because he had been through
pro baseball. He also wanted to set an example for young people and
spend more time with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of his junior season, he wavered about staying for
his senior year. McGarity said Williams especially didn't like the
criticism heaped on former UT coach John Mackovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never understood why people were saying the things about
Coach Mackovic because he had just won the Big 12 championship and
signed that big contract,'' McGarity said. ``But Ricky hasn't
mentioned (Mackovic's) name since.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was aware of Williams before he left North Carolina in
December to accept the UT job. But he initially assumed Williams
would turn pro, especially after he met with his new team for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky didn't stay and talk to me after the meeting,'' Brown
recalled. ``I asked `Was Ricky here?' Someone said `Yeah.' I didn't
think (not meeting Williams at that time) was a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The two eventually met three times to discuss Williams' plans.
Williams also called several of Brown's former players, including
Tar Heels cornerback Dre Bly, who decided to stay an extra year at
North Carolina despite being forecast as a first-round pick in the
1998 draft. Bly gave Brown a rave review.
</P>
<P>
   Williams eventually asked Brown if he wanted him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we'd be a better team if he stayed but that I
wasn't going to tell him what to do,'' Brown said. ``Each time I
met with him I felt like he was more interested in staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Williams laid down his demands, but they had nothing to
do with carries or playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he wanted to play for a team that had a chance to
win, which meant the team had to be disciplined,'' Brown said. ``He
wanted our team to play defense. I told Ricky he had to trust us,
that if he didn't, he should leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what he was going to do until 15 minutes before
his press conference. He told our staff meeting and we all
screamed.''

 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fireplace cast its homey glow as 15 friends at a
long wooden table clinked glasses. The women sipped Bellini
cocktails, while the men, in jeans and French-blue shirts, fell to
talking sports over ravioli alla salvia.
</P>
<P>
   Morgen Schick, the 28-year-old hostess, turned to make sure the
guests on her right were engaged in conversation, then turned to
the left to see that another friend was served dessert. She cast a
glance at her boyfriend, Drew DeMann, a sports chiropractor, to
check that he, too, was having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of 30 at her disposal, Ms. Schick, who is a model
with the Ford agency, felt carefree enough to seek the culprit who
had removed her plate, with its slice of a cake that she had bought
specially at the Cupcake Cafe. ``I wasn't finished!'' she
protested.
</P>
<P>
   She had pulled it off, this dinner party. Not bad for someone
who was in Portugal 12 hours earlier on a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   What made it all possible was that the party was not in her home
but at Serafina, an Italian restaurant on East 61st Street, where
private dinners for 6, 8, 10 or more are given almost every night.
These are not dinners tucked away in private rooms nor held for
business reasons. They are the intimate, private entertaining
normally associated with a dinner party at home _ but given in the
noisy din of a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where apartments are too tiny to accommodate a crowd,
where people are too busy to prepare a meal and where many a host
prefers the buzz to the quiet of home, restaurant dinner parties
are an increasingly popular feature of social life.
</P>
<P>
   They are given in restaurants as gilded as Le Cirque 2000 and as
populist as the family-style Carmine's on Broadway in the 90s. Some
cost as little as $20 a head, and others run to $5,000 for 20.
Hosts have been known to bring place cards, linens, special wines
and desserts and, in one case, centerpieces of topiary Labrador
retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have a good time at home,'' said Ms. Schick,
explaining why she gave her party at the crowded Serafina, which
recently changed its name from Sofia Fabulous Pizza. ``I'm always
nervous about everyone doing their job. Here I called 10 days ago.
I knew it would be a fun, cool atmosphere in a good location. I
give them a credit card ahead of time and I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   As the city's busiest month of socializing begins, many popular
restaurants are booked heavily for private dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have at least one dinner party going every night,'' said
Howard Stein, the owner of Gertrude's, a restaurant in a town house
next door to Serafina. ``My place is full of Europeans with
pied-a-terres.'' They fly into Manhattan, meet a group of friends
over pasta with caviar, then fly home _ as Prince Albert of Monaco
did a few weeks ago, when he gave a dinner for 12 at Serafina.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Negrotto, the general manager of Monzu, a
Sicilian-inspired restaurant in Soho, said: ``We see so many small
dinner parties now. People bring place cards, and sometimes they
ask me to get little gifts, little favors from the neighborhood for
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   David Edwards, an advertising copywriter, once had his
girlfriend, Solange Amar, cover a table at Monzu with rose petals
for a dinner party, which he gives in restaurants every three weeks
or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it to keep in contact with friends and to build a sort of
like-minded circle of people,'' said Edwards, 38. ``It seems to be
the New York thing to do. You have built-in atmosphere. People feel
immediately comfortable. It's awfully difficult to replicate that
in an apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Block, vice chairman of Blade Communications in Toledo,
Ohio, which publishes The Toledo Blade, visits Manhattan every
weekend and invariably gives a dinner for 8 to 10 at expensive
Upper East Side restaurants like Le Cirque 2000 and Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like people,'' said Block, 44, a bachelor who has an
apartment in the Ritz Tower. ``I don't like to be alone. The goal
is to meet people and to become friends. I don't consider myself
selective. It's a matter of who is available and who wants to go
out. I organize at the last second.''
</P>
<P>
   He has one prerequisite: ``They have to be people that want to
dress properly. I tend to go to places where males are dressed in
jacket and tie and women in dresses. If someone is going to dress
in jeans, they can't go.''
</P>
<P>
   In this very image-conscious city, where residents may not care
to be sized up by their furniture, their addresses or their
children, restaurant dinner parties allow hosts to entertain people
they don't know well enough to admit comfortably into their homes.
It is a safe middle ground, not as personal as home, more engaging
than a bar.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a meal in a trendy restaurant can also lure power
guests who might otherwise decline, so that restaurant entertaining
can be a means of social climbing. Or, it can be a social leveler,
letting the working magazine editor invite out the Park Avenue
doyenne. Across a restaurant table, all that matters is one's charm
and sense of style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of everything,'' DeMann said at Serafina,
looking around. At other tables sat Ivana Trump and actor Armand
Assante. ``Waiters are banging all around. People are giggling.
When there's a lull in conversation, there's enough ambient noise
to keep the party going.''
</P>
<P>
   Etiquette expert Letitia Baldrige vigorously disapproves of this
entertainment trend, which she views as a cop-out by those who have
recently attained affluence but lack the social graces to match.
``If you can afford to have a dinner party in a restaurant, you can
afford a nice apartment to entertain in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But for Manhattan's nouveaux riches _ Wall Street bonus babies
and Internet entrepreneurs _ ``it's too intimidating to entertain
at home,'' she said. ``They don't know how to handle the crowd,
they don't know how to present each other, and they don't want
ladies going into the boudoir, checking their medicine cabinets and
checking if they have Viagra pills.''
</P>
<P>
   She told of the time a maitre d'hotel pointed out to a neophyte
hostess that she had all the men sitting next to one another. ``The
woman didn't know how to seat!'' exclaimed Ms. Baldrige, who was
the White House social secretary to Jacqueline Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But such traditional niceties do not matter to a hostess like
Ms. Schick, who chose not to arrange the seating at her dinner at
Serafina. ``I don't want to be that controlling,'' she said. By the
end of the evening, most of the men at her party ended up talking
to one another, and one couple had placed themselves side by side.
(Etiquette books advise against seating couples together, because,
as Ms. Baldrige put it, ``You don't want pillow talk.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In New York, however, hostesses with impeccable credentials have
devised a new etiquette for the restaurant dinner party. Gale
Hayman, a cosmetics entrepreneur, who is married to William
Haseltine, the founder of Human Genome Sciences, a pharmaceuticals
company, gives dinner parties at their home in Washington, but
always entertains in restaurants in New York, the couple's second
home.
</P>
<P>
   She is as precise about the details of a restaurant party as one
in her home. ``I preorder everything if it's more then eight
people,'' she said. ``I ask the chef, What's fresh, what's good?
When people come, the wine is already on the table. The San
Pellegrino is on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The round table is my No. 1 choice,'' she added. ``I'm a
stickler. It allows everyone to talk. My husband is a scientist,
and we have lots of topics to chat about. Being seated elbow to
elbow is essential. You must be cozy and tight with people so they
can talk across.''
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant dinner party need not be fancy. Jeannie Bochette,
the marketing manager of business development at Steelcase, the
office-furniture maker, lives in Stuyvesant Town with her husband,
Louis Bochette. She gives dinner parties in local restaurants for
10 people almost every other month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it in a restaurant because I work full time, and I do not
have the time,'' Mrs. Bochette said. ``I always bring spring
flowers like impatiens or ivies. I buy them at the flower market
for about a dollar apiece. You wrap it in a tissue and put it where
you would normally put a place card.''
</P>
<P>
   At La Goulue, the clubby restaurant on Madison Avenue popular
with the lunch set, Francois Latapie, the owner, said he is
selective about the customers he allows to monopolize a big table
for a party. He wants to give one up only if the host is likely to
bring an attractive, social crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorites is Geoffrey Bradfield, a decorator, who
took over 60 seats at the coveted center tables in the spring for a
party for the Earl and Countess Bathurst. It was this party that
had the topiary Labrador retrievers, a nod to the pets of the
guests of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geoffrey knows the best people in town,'' Latapie said.
``Knowing him and the degree of finesse he has as a person, you
don't have to worry who he brings. Plus, he is organized. His party
is not going to get out of control. People are not going to run
around the restaurant or be on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradfield has raised the dinner party in a restaurant to an art
form. He sends engraved invitations, then a secretary calls to make
sure guests understand the dress code _ usually black tie in
winter. After the main course, Bradfield usually clinks his glass
and announces that all the men must move over two seats. After
dessert, he clinks again, and they move a second time.
</P>
<P>
   For a Russian-themed Christmas supper last year at L'Ermitage,
Bradfield leased huge candelabras, tied white stalks to them and
dusted fake snow. Many of the 50 guests, who included Chappy
Morris, Andrew Roosevelt, Tara Rockefeller and Billy Bancroft, are
still talking about the affair a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Someone like Marjorie Gubelmann, 29, a venture capitalist and
frequent restaurant-dinner-party guest, almost prefers these
parties to dinners in homes. ``I like the see-and-be-seen
atmosphere, the air-kissing everywhere,'' she said. ``The
schmoozing. The overpriced bistro food. It's a fabulous dining
experience.''

A FAKE TREE BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF REAL CHRISTMASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Nov. 29.)  
 (HLW)  
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new Hammacher Schlemmer catalog is selling
aluminum Christmas trees with rotating electric-light wheels that
change the color of the tree every seven seconds. The odd thing is
not that these gaudy inorganic trees are back in production, it's
that I desperately want one. After a decade of celebrating a
tasteful Christmas with freshly cut evergreens, I'm craving the
over-the-top holiday artifice of my youth.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the 1960s and early '70s, about 10 minutes from
Martha Stewart's home town of Nutley, N.J., I experienced Christmas
not in the understated, handmade style that the domestic goddess
espouses, but in the more-is-more, store-bought-is-better tradition
of our Italian-American household. Each year, we had three trees _
one green, one silver, one white _ set up in various rooms of our
house. But not once did a fragrant, natural tree ever pass through
the front door of that suburban bi-level.
</P>
<P>
   Real trees dropped needles that my mother said she would still
be vacuuming out of the carpet next Lent. Real trees dried out as
soon as you brought them inside, my parents explained, and all of
Nana's antique balls would fall off and break. Worst of all, real
trees caught fire when families like ours were at church, and
ruined their holidays. Certainly, I didn't want that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   So Christmas instead came in cardboard boxes, do-it-yourself
style. What would start as a dowel rod and some feathery bottle
washers would become, at my father's hand each year, a cone-shaped
Christmas tree in under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   We had a lot of good Christmases that way. But 10 years ago,
when I moved to New York, I vowed I would have only real trees,
simply decorated. No garlands. No satin-covered Styrofoam balls.
Just nature and blown glass. I had grown ashamed of my
less-than-tasteful Christmases past. So what had always been very
Marian _ my beautician mother, that is _ became very Martha. My
more minimalist trees over the years were quite lovely, if I say so
myself, particularly as my ornament collection began to grow with
exquisite additions _ of expensive decorations bought as
collectibles or thriftily purchased at half price on the day after
Christmas and saved until the following year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, I want to break with tradition again and go
artificial.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite sold on the Hammacher Schlemmer model, a couple of
friends and I began our search for a perfect fake tree last
weekend. In a vintage station wagon, we made the rounds of the
Christmas emporiums I had visited as a child, several lawn and
garden stores that every November metamorphose into replicas of the
North Pole. But the Christmas Ice Caverns at Fairfield Home and
Garden, and a store called Fountains of Wayne, a backyard-statues
place that shares its name with an alternative rock band, didn't
have exactly what I wanted. They sold only realistic-looking fake
trees. I wanted a fake tree that looked fake.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits. An Internet search the other day yielded
such oddities as the Wall A Tree, a $69.95 fake made of 100-percent
post-consumer recycled plastic that ``hangs like a picture'' and
fits ``any place there isn't space,'' and a second, tabletop tree
with ``fiber optic branch tips'' for about $65. One is too Castro
Convertibles. The other is too '70s head shop. Neither is what I
want. Ms. Stewart may have the answer again, however. In her Martha
by Mail catalog, the design guru is selling reproductions of
antique feather trees _ artificial Christmas trees made of real
feathers _ at prices ranging from $300 to $600, depending on size.
Decidedly fake without being tacky, they're patterned after German
originals first popular in the 19th century. There are white ones,
pale green ones and one three-foot silver model for $198, with
tinsel substituting for feathers, that would look great in my
Chelsea apartment. For once, I won't have to move any furniture to
accommodate it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I am nostalgic for artificial trees because we almost
lost my 79-year-old mother to heart failure last June. A tree like
we used to have would celebrate the past. Considering my suburban
heritage, the quiet evergreens that sprang up in my apartment over
the last 10 years seem more artificial than the obviously fake
tinsel tree I desire today. Somehow, an artificial Christmas tree
seems more modern, more inviting and more truthful. In its
artificiality, I hope to find a glimmer of the genuine wonder that
used to be there each year when the trees came down from the attic
and the tea kettle was put on the stove for some instant hot cocoa.

TEXAS MILLIONAIRE WORKING TO PROVE MOM ON DEATH ROW INNOCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanied by ROUTIER-INVESTIGATOR) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 
 &HT;    Editor's Note: It's been nearly two years since a Kerr County,
Texas, jury sentenced Darlie Routier to death for the murder of her
5-year-old son, Damon. And it's been nearly a year since Waco
millionaire Brian Pardo pledged his money to help prove Routier
innocent. Now, Pardo takes another step toward his goal: by hiring
two famed death-penalty veterans to fight for Routier's freedom.
This is one of two articles profiling the two. ___ 
 &HT;    By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Losch thrives on a good fight. At his first hearing on
behalf of Darlie Routier in October, Losch drew more attention than
the issue at hand, accusing a Dallas County prosecutor of
conducting a smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The local media took note _ after all, Losch could be the man
who frees one of Texas Death Row's most infamous resident. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Longview attorney, hired by millionaire Brian Pardo two
months ago, is leading the charge to determine the accuracy of the
Routier trial transcript. This is now Routier's most immediate hope
of freedom: The court reporter who recorded her trial has been
accused of producing an error-ridden transcript and lying under
oath about whether she tape-recorded trial proceedings. The entire
trial record has been called into question.
</P>
<P>
   And that may force the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to
reverse Routier's sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But Losch doesn't want to liberate his client on a technicality.
He wants to prove her innocent. He believes she is completely
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my best to convince the rest of the world that
I'm right,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the litigation, Routier has two chances to
plead her case before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the
state's highest criminal court. Stephen Cooper, Routier's
court-appointed Dallas attorney, will do most of the work on the
direct appeal, where arguments based on the trial transcript can be
raised. Losch will take primary responsibility for writing the writ
of habeas corpus brief, where he will have the opportunity to
introduce new evidence.
___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee when this case is over and done with, the picture
will be very different,'' Losch said during an interview with the
Star-Telegram. ``I already know things about this case that would
surprise people _ that I think would change public opinion about
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Losch distrusts several of the prosecution's arguments,
including the suggestion that Routier inflicted her own wounds, and
an expert witness's testimony regarding bloodstains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the weakest cases that I have ever seen ...
where the death sentence was imposed,'' Losch says. ``I have more
questions just from the face of the record about the client's guilt
than in any other case I've ever picked up. ... It shocked me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing that disturbed me was the smear of her
character,'' Losch adds, referring to trial testimony about
Routier's physical appearance and lifestyle, ``like the fact that
she had breast implants, or the fact that a small amount of
marijuana was found in the home. That's totally irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Losch contends that prosecutor Greg Davis' remarks to a group of
reporters during a recent conference on crimes against children
suggested that the Routier boys might have been victims of sexual
abuse. Davis, who prosecuted Routier, denied Losch's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, it really doesn't matter in the end if
Darlie was the kind of person Greg Davis would bring home to his
mother,'' Losch insists. ``What's going on here is much more
serious than that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Losch talks, he's Brooklyn all over. It's not just the
accent _ think ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' _ but the moxie. There's
more than a little bit of New York City PR guy left in him.
</P>
<P>
   Losch grew up in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn,
graduated from New York University and dived into a career managing
public relations for prizefighters. When client Gerry Cooney lost
to heavyweight champ Larry Holmes, Losch took the money he had
saved and started classes at the new public-interest law school at
the City University of New York. He was already in his mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of New York City, Losch assumed his first Texas case
through the NAACP Legal Defense Fund-Capital Punishment Project.
Other cases followed, referred to him by the Texas Resource Center,
a now-defunct nonprofit agency that provided legal assistance to
Death Row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   During Losch's defense of Ron Shamburger _ convicted of killing
Texas A&AMP;M student Lori Ann Baker in 1994 _ he met the best friend
of Shamburger's mother, a woman from Longview. They married two
years ago. ``So I decided to hang my shingle up here,'' says Losch,
whose private practice accepts only death-penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Shamburger's trial is one of several prominent cases Losch has
been associated with in Texas, including the bizarre saga of Dr.
Ralph Erdmann.
</P>
<P>
   Losch was defending Douglas Palmer of Amarillo, charged with
capital murder in the beating death of a Canyon man, when he began
to question the victim's autopsy. The resulting investigation of
the pathologist, Erdmann, found that the doctor had falsified or
botched several autopsies (though hundreds more were considered
suspect). The story turned up on ``60 Minutes'' and as a book
titled ``Substantial Evidence.'' Because of Losch's tenacity,
Palmer received a life sentence instead of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the course of my career, there's somewhere between 20 and
30 guys who would be dead now if it wasn't for me,'' Losch says.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo, who has taken on Routier's case as a personal cause,
first hired Losch to analyze Routier's chances of a successful
appeal. After taking eight weeks to read through the 53-volume
transcript, Losch came back with a what Pardo called a stunning
60-page document that picked apart the case point by point. In
September, Pardo hired Losch as one of Routier's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo's pocketbook could end up making all the difference in
Darlie Routier's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 10 years, and the big problem of
course, in this work, is money,'' says Losch, because Death Row
inmates often cannot afford to pay for legal representation. ``A
lawyer's dream is to have some millionaire drop out of the sky and
pay his fee in a case that he could not possibly do for nothing.
What Brian's done is a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Without investigator Richard Reyna and Losch, Routier probably
would not have near the chance she now has to see her conviction
reversed, says Austin attorney Raoul Schonemann, who, like Losch,
specializes in capital cases in his private practice. Schonemann
calls Pardo's financial commitment ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To a very large extent, this whole process works like a big
roulette game,'' he adds. ``Darlie is fortunate she has Steve
Losch, who is one of the best in the state, representing her.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardo takes that belief several steps further, professing
extreme confidence in the defense team he has organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' he says, ``it's going to be the difference between
life and death for Darlie Routier.''

ONE OF ROUTIER'S DEFENDERS ONCE DEALT WITH PURPORTED McVEIGH(Accompanies DEFENDERS-ROUTIER) 
(EDS: One of two reports dealing with death penalty opponents hired
to try to free Darlier Routier, convicted two years ago of
murdering her 5-year-old son in suburban Dallas) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Reyna doesn't make it a practice to talk to the media.
He's been burned before, in a very high-profile controversy
concerning a very high-profile client: Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   Working as a defense investigator, Reyna was accused of
falsifying a purported confession by McVeigh, which the Dallas
Morning News reported amid much controversy. McVeigh's attorney
claimed the confession was phony; Reyna claims he's a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty or not, Reyna ended up the fall guy.
</P>
<P>
   He had quit the case (out of disgust at the way it was being
handled, he says) and was traveling in Europe when the accusation
surfaced. He flew back to the United States, ``showed up at some
radio and television stations, and I challenged them (his accusers)
to appear with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to hide,'' Reyna says. ``But the damage had been
done.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough damage to prevent Waco millionaire Brian Pardo
from hiring Reyna to find proof that Darlie Routier did not kill
her children. Since late summer, the reclusive investigator has
been searching for new information to assist court-appointed
attorney Stephen Cooper and Longview death-penalty lawyer Steven
Losch in the case of the suburban Dallas woman convicted of killing
one of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna's investigative career began in 1983, he says, after
nearly a decade as a police officer. He built a reputation as a
dogged fact-finder and says he has worked cases for famous Houston
defense attorney Percy Foreman and Foreman's protege, Dick
DeGuerin.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, Reyna became affiliated with Jim McCloskey and
Centurion Ministries, a New Jersey-based investigative agency.
McCloskey, a former management consultant-turned minister-turned
detective, crisscrossed the country aiding inmates whom he believed
to be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna worked with McCloskey on two Texas cases that made
national headlines: those of Joyce Ann Brown and Clarence Brandley,
whose stories both appeared on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Conroe police charged Brandley, a janitor at Conroe
High School, with raping and killing a teen-age girl in a school
lavatory. The other janitors had provided one another with alibis,
and Brandley was convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna says he uncovered information that led to a stay of
execution for Brandley just five days before he would have been put
to death. He was freed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a 32-year-old fur-store employee when she was convicted,
spent 91/2 years behind bars in a robbery and killing she insisted
she did not commit. More than a dozen witnesses testified to her
whereabouts at the time of the crime, but Brown was unable to
account for seven minutes. She was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, Brown says, found the woman who committed the robbery and
murder. She was already in jail in another state for a similar
crime _ and looked a lot like Joyce Ann Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked and talked with the air of a person that says, `This
is my job, I know what I'm doing, and I'm good at what I do,' ''
says Brown, now the executive assistant to Dallas County
Commissioner John Wiley Price. ``Richard didn't leave a stone
unturned in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon her release in 1989, Brown founded an organization to aid
prisoners who may have been unjustly convicted. _ including
28-year-old Darlie Routier.] When Brown heard Routier's story, she
immediately called Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the proof is out there, Richard is going to find it,'' she
says, ``whichever way it turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's organization could not afford to hire Reyna, but she put
him in touch with the Routier family. Reyna met with Darlie Kee,
Routier's mother, and Darin Routier, Routier's husband, in suburban
Dallas; he visited Routier at the women's Death Row facility in
Gatesville; and reviewed the police investigation of the murders.
Late in the summer, he agreed to take the case, and Pardo, who is
subsidizing Routier's appeal, agreed to pay his fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darlie had been asking me all along to hire Richard Reyna,''
Pardo says. ``I pretty much ignored that because our investigation
was moving along very well.'' But after Darin failed a polygraph
test in May, both Routier and Pardo decided that they needed a
neutral third party to proceed with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she'd only believe (Darin lied on the polygraph) if
she heard it from Richard Reyna,'' Pardo acknowledges, stressing
that he has given Reyna free rein to come to his own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Reyna found Routier's story compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt there was some truth to her innocence,'' says Reyna, a
former Harris County (Houston) cop and prior to that a free-lance
photographer in Europe who did work at U.S. military installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe for a minute because a police officer conducted
an investigation that it's an honest investigation. It's no longer
like that,'' Reyna asserts. ``See, nobody cares about justice
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Routier case, Reyna will only reveal that he has devised
his own theory about the boys' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important rules in an investigation like this
one, he says, ``is to keep everything close to your chest.
Otherwise you advertise to the opposition what you're looking for,
and they quickly begin to, as they say, surround the wagons.''

BOOKS ABOUT MUSIC CAN BE A BIG HIT ON YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas plus music equals, for a lot of people, the new Celine
Dion or Babyface CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't have to be that way.
Some of the best Christmas gifts you can give your favorite music
lover aren't music at all, but rather books about music.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true in 1998, which saw the publication of a
number of underpublicized books about, variously, swing music in
Texas; zydeco and its place in Louisiana culture; an obscure jazz
musician with an incredible secret; and a well-regarded but never
riotously popular English band.
</P>
<P>
   To start, Duncan McLean's ``Lone Star Swing'' (W.W. Norton &AMP;
Company; $14) is easily the best book about music published this
year, and one of the best books ever about Texas music. The
Scottish novelist came to Texas with dreams of writing a scholarly
tome on his musical love, western swing.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the subject and the state were too big, he just
traveled around. The result is a hilarious and touching account of
a man encountering Texas (fried catfish, the Marfa lights and a LOT
of weird people) as well as a ton of old western swing stalwarts. A
fantastic book, whether you like the music or not.
</P>
<P>
   Very different, but just as interesting in its look at the music
of a particular region, is Michael Tisserand's ``The Kingdom of
Zydeco'' (Arcade Publishing; $29.95) The book is fascinating as
both a history of the music and as individual portraits of its
leading lights, from Canray Fontenot to Clifton Chenier to Boozoo
Chavis to youngsters such as Keith Frank. Cleanly told, and with a
wealth of photos, ``Kingdom'' is a well-done and all too rare look
at one of the South's finest musical genres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land of a Thousand Dances: Chicano Rock 'n' Roll from Southern
California'' (University of New Mexico Press; $18.95) is also
concerned, obviously, with one part of the country _ but in
contrast to ``Kingdom'' this book shows how many different types of
music can intermingle and play off one another.
</P>
<P>
   Authors David Reyes and Tom Waldman trace the development of
Hispanic pop in California, from the doo-wop craze of the '50s to
the hundreds of Beatles-influenced bands of the '60s to the
emergence of Los Lobos in the '80s. And though not completely up to
date (there's little about anything after Los Lobos), it is,
nonetheless, a great look at a subject that has been too long
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``XTC: Song Stories'' (Hyperion; $14.95), an
account of the famous (and criminally underappreciated) English
band told by the band itself and author Neville Farmer. XTC, you'll
recall, has made sublime pop music since the '70s, but they rarely
perform because of leader Andy Partridge's stage fright and his
on-tour breakdown in California in 1982. After that, they devoted
more time to crafting studio CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book's narrative hinges on band members talking
about individual songs. This doesn't sound like it would work, but
it does. Along the way, an interesting portrait of a unique band is
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the odd, compelling story of jazz musician
Billy Tipton. Born in Oklahoma City in 1914 as Dorothy Tipton,
Tipton lived as a man from age 19 until his death in Washington
state at age 74. That means, yes, marriages (five of 'em);
fatherhood (he helped raise several adopted children); and
thousands of gigs that he played dressed as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, in the '20s and '30s, female musicians were severely
discriminated against, so Dorothy Tipton simply chose to build a
career as Billy Tipton, piano player and band leader. Diane Wood
Middlebrook's ``Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton'' is an
engrossing biography of a man who was revealed to be a woman (even
to close friends and family) only after death.
</P>
<P>
   Well-written and impeccably researched, ``Suits'' is an almost
unbelievable account of one woman's double life, and just how full
a life it was.

   TEXAS-BREAKOUT _ HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ A death row inmate escaped

   2STRIKES _ ATLANTA _ Despite a state law that demands mandatory
prison time for the type of crime probationer Timothy Carl Dawson
committed in 1995, a judge ordered probation. Dawson is now
suspected of killing five people _ four of them in hotel rooms. And
there are at least another 49 like him, probationers who would be
in jail but somehow have avoided the 10-year prison term demanded
by the Georgia Sentencing Reform Act, better known as the state's
``two-strikes-and-you're out'' law. ``I simply cannot understand
why any judge, who is sworn to uphold the law, won't follow it when
it's plainly written in black and white,'' said Gov. Zell Miller,

   COLOMBIA-KIDNAPPED _ MIAMI _ Nearly six years after the

whom some government officials have written off as dead, there's
fresh hope that they might still be alive. Mark Rich, Dave Mankins,
and Rick Tenenoff were kidnapped on Jan. 31, 1993, from a Panama

get wholesale permission to travel through Israel to their lands in
The Gaza Strip and the West Bank. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). WITH

HONG KONG ECONOMY SHRINKS 7 PERCENT IN 3RD QUARTER

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Posting the worst performance since the keeping of
records began nearly four decades ago, Hong Kong said Friday that
its economy shrank by an estimated 7 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But officials here said the territory might have hit bottom _
with agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund forecasting that economic output would rebound in the second
half of 1999. Still, a report Friday by the Asian Development Bank
predicted that for all of 1999, Hong Kong's economy would contract
by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's economy has been shrinking at an accelerating rate
since the first quarter of this year, as the Asian financial crisis
has pummeled retail sales, exports, tourism and domestic
consumption. Friday's announcement was a new low.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were quite depressing figures,'' said Sir Donald Tsang,
the financial secretary of Hong Kong, at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Tsang expressed some optimism. He said the Hong Kong
government expected a full-year decline of 5 percent in the
economy. That implies Hong Kong's gross domestic product, the
broadest measure of economic growth, would decline by less than 7
percent in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go through what I call a psychological barrier,''
Tsang said, noting that Hong Kong probably faced two more quarters
of negative performance before the trend reversed.
</P>
<P>
   For all the horrendous numbers, Hong Kong's stock market barely
wavered Friday, with the Hang Seng index edging down 37 points, or
three-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 10,732. As they have for
nearly two months, investors disregarded Hong Kong's fundamentals,
preferring to focus on recent cuts in interest rates here and in
the United States, which they believe will reinvigorate consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday we had a historic low in export figures and the
market went up; today we had a historic low in economic output, and
the market barely moved,'' said Dong Tao, the senior regional
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston here. ``The market is
simply ignoring all the bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate prices have rebounded even more sharply than the
stock market. An index that tracks the shares of Hong Kong's
leading property developers has risen 90.7 percent in the last two
months _ the sharpest increase ever in that period, according to a
report by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the growing disparity between the markets and
the underlying economy means. Some forecasters say the improved
sentiment will pull up the economy, since Hong Kong has always been
fueled by intangible factors like consumer confidence. Some say the
rising property and share prices merely delay what will be a
painful economic adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is on a placebo therapy,'' Tao said. ``The improved
sentiment is a good thing. But placebos are just sugar pills.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the buoyant markets prevent Hong Kong from reducing
its costs, which are the highest in Asia and put it at a
competitive disadvantage. Singapore, vying with Hong Kong to be the
financial hub of East Asia, adopted a package of wage and pension
reductions earlier this week that will carve $6.5 billion in costs
out of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recovery in Hong Kong will be the slowest in the region
simply because the price levels haven't fully adjusted,'' said Marc
Faber, the chairman of Marc Faber Ltd., an investment advisory firm
here.
</P>
<P>
   Faber said Hong Kong's high costs were already affecting areas
like shipping. He said container traffic in Shenzhen, a mainland
Chinese city across the border from Hong Kong, had increased 90
percent so far this year, while traffic in Hong Kong's port was up
only marginally.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are signs that Hong Kong is beginning to confront its
costs. On Thursday, Hong Kong Telecom reached an agreement with its
employees to tie their bonuses to the company's financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Telecom had earlier announced an across-the-board
salary cut of 10 percent. But it was forced to retreat after
employees protested and it came under criticism from Hong Kong's
chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond cutting costs, analysts said there was little Hong Kong
could do to hasten its recovery. With an economy heavily reliant on
trade, Hong Kong's future depended very much, they said, on the
health of its trading partners, primarily China and, to a lesser
extent, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a situation where Japan and the rest of Asia stayed
lackluster, the U.S. and Europe slowed to 2 percent growth, and
China slipped to 6 percent, next year could be pretty bleak,'' said
Ian Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   There was scarcely a hint of boom times in the statistics
released this week. Retail sales declined 20 percent in the third
quarter, while exports fell 17.5 percent in October. And tourist
arrivals declined 11 percent in the first 10 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's consumer price index rose just one-tenth of 1
percent in October _ the smallest increase ever _ prompting some
analysts to declare that Hong Kong had entered a deflationary
spiral. But Friday, a government economist took issue with that,
noting that in a genuine deflation, property and share prices would
have to fall as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are real estate and stocks the only things going up. While
the number of people visiting Hong Kong has declined over the year
so far, tourist arrivals rose two-tenths of 1 percent in October.
And the Hong Kong Monetary Authority reported that its foreign
reserves rose slightly last month, to $88.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   More important, analysts said fears that China would become the
next casualty of the Asian crisis have receded a bit. China's
economy expanded 7.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with
the corresponding quarter last year. That is an increase from 6.6
percent expansion in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the Chinese economy is crucial to Hong Kong,
because much of its trade consists of exports that flow from the
mainland into Hong Kong, where they are repackaged and shipped
elsewhere.

   NEW YORK _ News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy
patch, were in merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that
corporate marriages are back in vogue. Even before that combination
came to light, deal-making was fast and furious. On Monday alone,
$40.4 billion in corporate acquisitions were either announced or
declared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the resurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market, the
recognition by major corporations that it is getting harder to
increase revenues internally and growing confidence among market
players that the economy will not plunge into a recession next
year.
</P>
<P>
   There are also industry-specific issues, like low crude-oil
prices that are driving oil giants into one another's arms.
</P>
<P>
   But for investors, mega-marriages are not where the real money
is to be made. Rather, it is among smaller companies, whose
still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with
stocks that again are near their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   If Exxon buys Mobil at close to current prices, deals this month
will have a total value of more than $140 billion _ off from
April's peak of $244 billion but three times the volume in
September, when the stock market was falling.
</P>
<P>
   Which industries are likely to witness the most mergers? Tom
Burnett, director of Merger Insight, an institutional investment
advisory firm in New York, says more deals are a certainty in
energy, which is suffering from low crude-oil prices. Burnett also
says health care executives are finding it tougher than ever to
lift earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But smaller companies may be a better way to play the takeover
game. Charles LaLoggia, editor of the Special Situation Investor
newsletter in Potomac, Md., said: ``Some of the premiums in
high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore. The values are in
small-cap stocks.'' Another reason is that deals involving
smaller-cap candidates are less likely to incur the wrath of
antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   LaLoggia reckons that the odds of picking takeover winners
increase if an investor focuses on companies already partially
owned by another. In the energy sector, Houston Exploration
qualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by
Keyspan Energy.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes more deals are imminent among drug chains and
supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says, remain
acquisition candidates, though neither is controlled by another
concern.
</P>
<P>
   In supermarkets, LaLoggia likes the Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea
Co., 55 percent owned by Tengelmann Group of Germany. Another pick
is Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style stores that is
55 percent owned by the U.S. subsidiary of Groupe Casino, France's
largest supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final are trading at just about book
value,'' LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur above book value.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, a maker of
housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading near $39,
close to its low for the year. The company has $30 a share in cash
on its balance sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent.
After last month's announced acquisition of Rubbermaid by the
Newell Co., LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find itself in an
acquirer's cross-hairs.

 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Howard Moss enrolled at the University of Liverpool
in 1966, the Beatles had left town, moving out into the big wide
world.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Moss, manager of the $1.23-billion Harbor
International Growth fund, eventually did too _ alas, without ever
seeing the band perform. (His student residence was on Penny Lane,
the title of his favorite Beatles tune, and he calls himself ``a
huge fan.'') Today, he works from an office in Fort Myers, Fla.,
for Jennison Capital Associates, a New York money manager that is
subadviser of the fund for Harbor Capital Advisors of Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a relatively small world these days for Moss, 50.
About the only place he finds the sort of stocks he likes to buy is
in Europe, where about 95 percent of the fund's assets are
invested. The fund is also concentrated in its number of stocks _
just 24 in the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Using a bottom-up approach to investing based on corporate
fundamentals, he likes well-managed mid- to large-capitalization
companies with long-term annual earnings growth of at least 15
percent and forward price-to-earnings ratios below that rate. That
kind of growth is hard to find in rocky economic landscapes like
Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   His circumspect view may well have sharpened Moss' performance
this year. The fund has achieved a return of 14.3 percent through
Nov. 20 _ notably north of the 8.4 percent for its better-known,
value-oriented sister fund, Harbor International, and the 8.3
percent average for its peer group of foreign stock funds,
according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
Over three years, Harbor International Growth has tallied an
average annual return of 18.5 percent vs. 16.2 percent for the
sister fund and 9.2 percent for the peer group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as much as 14 percent of the portfolio was in Hong Kong
real estate and bank stocks. Moss reduced those holdings to zero by
last summer, though he acknowledged that the Asian crisis still
hurt the fund's otherwise stellar returns.
</P>
<P>
   Asian companies outside Hong Kong don't tempt him. ``With the
debacle of currency devaluations and falls in the stock market, the
companies we used to follow in places like the Philippines and
Thailand, specifically, are no longer viable, in that their market
capitalizations are too low for us to become interested,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Japan, companies like Sony, Matsushita Electric
Industrial and Hitachi ``have unfortunately become cyclical,'' in
part because of slowing consumer spending there, he said. ``They
are no longer secular growth companies on which one can rely'' for
consistent earnings growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how is Moss playing Europe? While he doesn't see a recession
there, he expects economic growth to slow to 1.5 to 2 percent
annually over the next 12 to 18 months, from his estimate of 2.3 to
3 percent for this year. As a result, earnings in cyclical sectors
like chemicals, steel and automaking are likely to slump, while
well-managed noncyclicals _ the kind he prefers, in any case _
should do much better. That points to drug, telephone and bank
companies as outperformers. He expects European economic growth
``to pick up from the middle of 2000 going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For companies that can expand, he said, the elimination of
economic borders in the European Union offers huge opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the individual company point of view, this will become
the United States of Europe,'' he said. ``So you will see the
growth of new, pan-European companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that many of those companies would be based in
southern Europe, where, after decades of high inflation and high
interest rates, governments have adopted many of the disciplined
economic policies of their northern neighbors. About one-third of
his fund's assets are invested in southern Europe, mainly in banks
and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's biggest holding, at 6.4 percent of assets, is
Unicredito Italiano, a Milan-based bank previously named Credito
Italiano. Its chief executive, Alessandro Profumo, is expanding the
company, trimming costs and making it ``very
shareholder-friendly,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   He said earnings were likely to compound at more than 20 percent
a year, and that the share price could double by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Another big position in southern Europe, at about 5 percent of
the fund's assets, is Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish telephone
company, which has about 85 percent of the conventional, fixed-line
business in Spain and 71 percent of the cellular market. Telefonica
also has major stakes in phone companies in Latin America, where
stock prices tumbled recently. But Moss said the growth potential
of the Latin American telephone industry made those holdings a good
long-term asset. He predicts earnings growth of 15 percent to 20
percent over the next four to five years and said share prices
would tend to rise at the same rate.
</P>
<P>
   One of International Growth's newest holdings is Sanofi, a
French pharmaceutical company, which Moss began buying in
September. Sanofi has two new cardiovascular drugs _ Plavix, a
blood thinner, and Avapro, which treats high blood pressure _ that
it is marketing worldwide with Bristol-Myers Squibb. ``The sales
have literally exploded,'' Moss said. He forecasts earnings growth
of up to 25 percent annually for the next five years.

FINDING THE PROFITS (AND FUN) IN MERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.H., N.Y.)   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29.)  
 (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1968, L. Dennis Kozlowski walked out of Seton Hall
University with a bachelor's degree in finance and a certainty that
numbers were the game to play and conglomerates the place to play
them. So, he joined the ill-starred SCM Corp. as a financial
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quickly learned two things,'' Kozlowski recalled. ``First, a
conglomerate can become a real mess if it's just a bureaucratic
holding company, and second, operations are a lot more fun than
accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kozlowski is busily building a conglomerate that he thinks
will be fun to run. Last week Tyco International, the company he
has headed since 1992, crowned an 18-month, $11 billion buying
spree by agreeing to acquire AMP, a maker of electronic connectors.
The deal will rescue AMP from a hostile takeover attempt by Allied
Signal.
</P>
<P>
   His is a process fraught with do's and don'ts _ mostly don'ts.
``We don't do hostile takeovers, we don't overpay, we don't buy
anything that doesn't add to earnings right away, we don't buy
anything that doesn't add value to the businesses we already
have,'' he said. ``And we don't buy anything that isn't worth at
least twice what we could get by buying back our stock.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty stringent list of criteria, but apparently, lots
of companies meet it. Tyco, primarily through acquisitions, has
grown into a highly profitable company comprising four different
businesses: fire and security services, disposable medical
products, valves and pipes, and electrical parts. Counting AMP,
Tyco's revenues will be more than $22 billion in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   But the acquisitive Kozlowski says he is far from satisfied. He
expects Tyco to grow 10 percent a year without further acquisitions
_ and even he laughs at the idea that Tyco will stop buying
companies. After all, its fire protection business is still thinly
represented in some countries, and its medical business needs to
round out its product line. ``We're not negotiating with anyone
yet,'' he said, ``but we've always got an active list of companies
to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the kind of company that investors, who have long
preferred pure-play stocks to conglomerates, would hate. But Tyco
stock, which closed at $68.00 on Friday, consistently sells for
about 24 times earnings, a multiple nearly as high as that of
General Electric, a conglomerate investors love.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, a diversified company that understands its own
core strengths really can be successful,'' said Brian K.
Langenberg, a conglomerate analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco has structured itself to run the acquisition marathon. Its
headquarters are in Exeter, N.H., but it switched its legal home to
Bermuda when it merged with ADT, the security alarm company it
bought in July 1997. The move cut its tax rate to 25 percent from
34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Tyco's four businesses is a separate fief, which means
the company need not fully digest every acquisition before
swallowing the next. So what if the medical devices segment is
still incorporating United States Surgical, the medical-supply
maker Tyco bought in May? That won't hinder the electrical division
from absorbing AMP.
</P>
<P>
   And, because it does stick to just four businesses _ ``we will
not add a fifth leg to this mix,'' Kozlowski said emphatically _
Tyco can easily spot where potential acquisitions might fit. For
example, AMP makes connectors that other Tyco divisions have been
spending $500 million a year to buy. Tyco also expects to save $45
million a year through combined buying power.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, Kozlowski and his team have proved
to be adept cost-cutters. Each of the four business chiefs came up
through operations and knows how to sharpen a cost-cutting knife.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Wall Street assumes they can make the numbers
work on AMP. Tyco is paying $11.3 billion, or $51 a share, for AMP,
considerably more than the $44.50 a share Allied Signal was
offering in its hostile bid. It's a pretty big premium, and
Lawrence A. Bossidy, Allied's chief, has publicly hinted that he
thinks Tyco overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   But Kozlowski has promised that he can cut enough costs, and
find enough synergies, to justify the price, and analysts are ready
to take his word on faith. ``You see a company beat its own goals
again and again, and you learn to believe it can do anything it
says,'' said Michael Jaffe, an equity analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tyco skeptics wax eloquent about Kozlowski. ``This guy is
Babe Ruth,'' said John A. Modzelewski, a conglomerate analyst at
Paine Webber. Though he does not suspect the kinds of accounting
shenanigans that sidelined Cendant, another rapid acquirer with a
celebrated chief executive, Modzelewski wonders whether clever
(although legal) ways of accounting for reserves and
post-acquisition cash flows might be behind some of Tyco's
consistently high earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So he has given Tyco's stock a relatively tepid ``attractive''
rating. Still, he knows his is the minority view. ``Dennis is the
stuff that legends are made of,'' he said, ``And Tyco has a cult
following.''

 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Prewitt, the new director of the Census
Bureau, certainly talks like an intellectual, sprinkling his speech
with Britishisms like ``full stop,'' when dramatically ending a
thought.
</P>
<P>
   He has the lifestyle of an intellectual, living in New York's
SoHo section with his wife, Susan Vogel, a collector of African art
who last year took an eight-week boat trip up the River Niger,
where Prewitt caught up with her on Christmas Eve in Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; The &LR;  Timbuktu?'' asked an impressed aide, who heard the story
for the first time recently. `` &UR; The &LR;  Timbuktu,'' Prewitt assured
him.
</P>
<P>
   But as Prewitt, who was confirmed last month on the day the
Senate broke for recess, wanders into the fracas over whether the
2000 census will use sampling, he has sought to put the partisan
denizens of Washington's political world on notice that he is not
some pointy-headed milquetoast from academia that they can push
around.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Census Monitoring Board, a panel set up by
Congress and the administration to keep tabs on preparations for
the 2000 census, Prewitt, 52, complained that his staff was being
hamstrung by the constant and often redundant requests for
information by myriad overseers, including the House Subcommittee
on the Census, the monitoring board and the General Accounting
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we need a hearing on oversight and monitoring
responsibilities and relationships,'' Prewitt suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The message was politely delivered, but unmistakable: Leave us
alone and let us do our job. Get the partisan politics out of the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Given the importance that Republicans and Democrats have placed
on how to conduct the census, which is crucial to congressional
redistricting and may help determine the makeup of the House, the
notion of politics being removed from the census may be impossible.
But friends say Prewitt, who has moved to Washington and commutes
home on weekends, is at least trying to bolster the morale of the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Bradburn, a professor of political science at the
University of Chicago who has been a close friend of Prewitt for
more than 30 years, said, ``I think he's trying to reassert the
professional competence of the bureau, and the bureau director, and
to establish some sense that these are professionals who know what
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt's full-throated cry for respect and independence for his
agency did not come as a surprise to his friends and family.
Prewitt, a former college professor, vice president of the
Rockefeller Foundation and director of the Social Science Research
Council, which seeks to promote new research in the social
sciences, is well versed in the often-ferocious politics of the
academic and foundation worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel, his wife, said: ``Many people have commented on the
intense politicking in academic institutions. The joke is that the
politicking is so intense because the stakes are so small. But
there it is. It's not something he hasn't done before.''
</P>
<P>
   And friends say that beneath his bespectacled and slight frame
is a man who is not averse to risk.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is a man who every three weeks gets together
with his buddies and plays ``pot limit'' poker, meaning that the
whole pot can be bet on any one hand. Pots can range as high as
$400.
</P>
<P>
   And while he is steeped in the world of statistics, he is also a
man who lived for years in East Africa, where he would fly his own
plane to places so desolate that should one develop engine trouble
and go down, chances of rescue were two standard deviations on the
wrong side of slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly has never been afraid of hard things,'' Ms. Vogel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his adult life, Prewitt, who has two grown children
from his first marriage, also has assiduously tried to find the
middle ground, including carving out compromises between his own
inner impulses toward social activism and scholarly contemplation.
As a young man, he attended Harvard's Divinity School. At the same
time, he worked on the weekends at a settlement house in
Somerville, Mass., a working-class suburb of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it difficult,'' he said, ``to go from the realities of
the kids and their lives and that neighborhood on the weekends and
then go next to theoretical discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   He forged a compromise. He quit divinity school. But rather than
becoming an advocate, he turned to studying political structures
and how they could be made to improve the lives of real people.
</P>
<P>
   That interest led to teaching in the mid-1960s and early 1970s
at the University of Nairobi in Kenya and the University of East
Africa in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said this experience taught him the value that
high-quality, apolitical statistical data could provide to
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have watched countries struggle with trying to put in place
the capacity to guide their policies without good data,'' he said.
``The colonial powers did not bequeath the African nations the
capacity to understand their own societies. And I've watched
countries be crippled by the absence of reasonable intelligence
about demography and economics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During that period he was also a professor of political science
at the University of Chicago, where he became involved in the civil
rights movement and participated in teach-ins against the war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In one of life's ironies, his antiwar activities in Chicago
placed him in political opposition to the city's mayor, Richard J.
Daley. Now, 30 years later, he is working for a son of the mayor,
William Daley, who as secretary of commerce, oversees the Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Prewitt became the director of the university's
National Opinion Research Center, a leading survey research
organization that had suffered from directors who were concerned
more with research than with management.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt's colleagues figured that he would end up being the
president of a college or university. Instead, he surprised them by
taking a position as president of the New York-based Social Science
Research Council, then as senior vice president of the Rockefeller
Foundation and then once again as the head of the Social Science
Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an academic, a scholar, a well-established political
scientist with good administrative skills and a sort of broad view
about the development of different fields of study and
institutions,'' Bradburn said. ``Anybody in the academic world who
has those kinds of skills usually will become dean, work their way
up to be provost and then to president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Prewitt felt that was not for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sensing that a large part of a university presidency and
university administration has ceased being what I wanted,'' Prewitt
said. ``It was all money raising. The jobs I took at SSRC and
Rockefeller were closer to the research world.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the Census Bureau squarely in the research world _ and
out of politics _ is now the challenge Prewitt faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will do as well as possible under the circumstances,''
Bradburn said. ``It may be that the political circumstances will
not allow the Census Bureau to do the best job that it could. If
he's able to bring it off, people will say he did a brilliant job.
If he doesn't, of course, he will be blamed.''

KABILA HUMAN-RIGHTS DEBATE, AS AFRICAN LEADERS MEET FOR SUMMIT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As 34 African chiefs of state began a French-African
summit meeting here on Friday, prosecutors turned down requests by
two French human rights groups to begin criminal proceedings
against President Laurent-Desire Kabila of Congo on torture
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, whose forces took power last year in what used to be
called Zaire, arrived on Thursday from Belgium, where authorities
had assured him that his office gave him diplomatic immunity from
prosecution or extradition on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Charles Josselin, the French minister in charge of
relations with African countries, was asked by reporters why
Augusto Pinochet, a former Chilean dictator, could be held in
Britain for possible extradition to Spain on charges of murder for
crimes committed under his rule, but Kabila and other African
strongmen invited here could enjoy impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was invited as the chief of state of Democratic Congo,''
Josselin said. ``In this capacity, he benefits from the immunity
accorded to chiefs of state while in office, a big difference with
General Pinochet, who no longer was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues and the
French League for the Defense of Human Rights had asked Paris
prosecutors to begin an investigation of massacres allegedly
committed by Kabila's forces in violation of a 1984 convention
against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading actions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Paris prosecutor's office said that the
convention did not clearly apply to heads of state and that the
complaints by the two groups had not named any individual victims
of torture whose cases could be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, who opened the conference in the
Louvre Museum on Friday afternoon, greeted Kabila perfunctorily,
but planned to meet with him in the Elysee Palace on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac renewed France's call for an international conference,
under U.N. auspices, on peace, security and stability in the Great
Lakes region, where both Rwanda and Uganda are supporting rebels in
eastern Congo against Kabila's rule. Angola, Namibia, Chad and
Zimbabwe are backing Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he might see the Ugandan and Rwandan leaders while
he was here, Kabila said: ``A meeting with the aggressors is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac also said that he planned to meet with all the leaders
involved in the Congo crisis while they were here.
</P>
<P>
   He told the African leaders on Friday morning that they needed a
collective security system of their own for resolving conflicts
like those that a quarter of all sub-Saharan countries had been
involved in this year. He said that France was prepared to play a
peacekeeping role if international authorities wished.
</P>
<P>
   But France has cut back its forces in its former colonies in
Africa to about 6,000 soldiers from 7,860 over the past two years
and intends to lower that number to about 5,000 as part of its plan
to reduce and professionalize the entire French military.

   Chirac, a neo-Gaullist conservative, and his socialist prime
minister, Lionel Jospin, have told African leaders that the old
days when France used to send in troops and the Foreign Legion to
prop up friendly dictators are gone forever. ``The period of
outside interference is over,'' Chirac said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a necessity for African countries and that is to
inspire confidence, for without confidence there is no economic
development. To inspire confidence in the world today, countries
have to appear respectful of the principles of democracy,'' he
said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip
abroad Friday to reconsider the Israeli army's long occupation of
southern Lebanon after the killing of seven Israeli soldiers there
in the last week and a half.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a cyclical nature to the debate here on Lebanon
policy, the spate of recent casualties has increased pressure on
the Israeli government to contemplate a unilateral withdrawal of
its troops from southern Lebanon after 20 years there.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a day of fierce battle between Israeli soldiers
and guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah or Party of God, two
young soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb blew up their
armored vehicle on Thursday night. Netanyahu, who was in London,
canceled a weekend trip to Spain, issuing fighting words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now under murderous attack by Hezbollah, who are
attempting to shock us into leaving Lebanon without fulfilling our
purpose there,'' Netanyahu said from London, before returning for
an afternoon of strategy meetings. ``Our soldiers are heroically
standing up to the attack, and I say that we will not put our tail
between our legs and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Netanyahu added that he was willing to consider a
proposal from Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that some have found
surprising. The hawkish Sharon, who as defense minister led the
ill-fated Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 after a series of
assaults on Israel by militant Islamic guerrillas based there, now
sides with Israeli doves on this issue. He favors a withdrawal of
troops, although he suggests a gradual one, accompanied by a threat
of harsh retaliation for any guerrilla incursions into northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Beersheba on Friday, thousands poured into the military
cemetery for the funeral of Eyal Cohen hours after the 20-year-old
soldier was killed on Thursday night. Hundreds of soldiers came
directly from the Lebanese front, backpacks and machine guns slung
over their shoulders. Mourners built a hill of flower bouquets,
still covered in cellophane, atop the fresh grave.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier's brother-in-law, a former fighter in Lebanon
himself, delivered the eulogy. ``The river of Lebanon is soaked
with blood,'' he said. ``The government has to decide whether it
crosses to the river bank of peace or the river bank of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,200 Israeli troops are assigned to a strip of southern
Lebanon to counter what Israel calls a guerrilla war waged by the
Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militants. Israeli opponents argue
that at this point it is the Israeli army's presence that sustains
the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began in the 1970s when the Palestine Liberation
Organization of Yasser Arafat, now based in Gaza, was exiled in
southern Lebanon, staging incursions on Israel with assistance from
Hezbollah and others.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops, under Sharon, eventually marched over the border
almost all the way to Beirut and shelled Palestinian refugee camps
and military installations. They drew international condemnation,
but chased the Palestinians into Tunisia. The Israelis eventually
withdrew into a southern band of Lebanon and focused on preventing
Hezbollah from shelling settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Israel has maintained a presence there, even after
the settlers in northern Israel, tired of the conflict, began to
favor their withdrawal. The military opposes any move.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With each year that the low-level war in southern Lebanon has
continued, the Israeli public has grown less tolerant of the
occupation. A poll in the newspaper Maariv on Friday showed 40
percent support for a unilateral withdrawal, up from 22 percent
last March, and 16 percent in February 1997. The poll was taken on
Wednesday, after three of the seven were killed.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a week of televised funerals, the public's
weariness with the fighting in Lebanon grew palpable. When a
loudspeaker aboard a bus announced Cohen's death on Thursday night,
a boisterous group of Israelis traveling from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv
was sobered to a hush. Some cried out, ``No!'' or ``Not again!''
and some wept.
</P>
<P>
   Heart-rending images appeared ceaselessly on Israeli television.
One news program presented a home video made last weekend by a
soldier killed on Wednesday. It showed the soldier, Uriel Peretz,
22, proud in a crisply ironed uniform, begging his mother to join
him in front of the camera. ``Mom doesn't want to have her picture
taken because she is afraid,'' he told the camera. ``Nothing will
happen to me. Don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers ran front-page calls for an end to the conflict.
``Mr. Netanyahu, take the initiative,'' the daily Yediot Ahronot
said. ``South Lebanon is not the land of our patriarchs, Mr. Prime
Minister. It is a foreign one, drenched in blood, hopeless and
unneeded.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven deaths bring to 22 the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in Lebanon this year. Last year, 39 were killed, an increase
after years averaging 25 deaths. Israeli army officials were hoping
that this year's toll would be low and thus quiet the pressure that
built last year for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians have told us in meetings that 20 soldiers a year
is not a high price to pay,'' said Shrilly Kantor, 28, who
protested in front of the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army's chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said
Friday: ``Anyone who is looking for easy solutions should remember
that there are no magical ones. So long as we are in the security
zone and fighting against the Hezbollah, there will be a price. But
any other alternative seems to us to be worse, more dangerous and
likely to increase the number of soldiers and civilians in the
north who get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   From Netanyahu's Cabinet, the range of suggested responses
covers the strategic map.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon favors a staged withdrawal because the current approach
clearly does little more than contain the conflict. Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is pressing for an international
agreement that would enable the Israelis to pull out and be
replaced by an international force. And Avigdor Kahalani, the
public security minister, suggested bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every soldier killed there, there must be darkness in
Beirut,'' he told the Israeli radio Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Netanyahu, in meetings that are to
continue on Sunday, will push hard beyond a reconsideration of
military tactics to rethink his Lebanon policy. In the past, he has
said a withdrawal from Lebanon must be based on some kind of an
agreement with Syria, through whose borders the weapons flow to
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is opposed to a unilateral Israeli withdrawal because it
wants to use its control of Lebanon _ and of Hezbollah's battle _
to force Israel into negotiations for the return of the Golan
Heights.

MAN CONVICTED IN MURDER OF IRISH JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ A Dublin drug dealer was convicted Friday by a
three-judge panel in the 1996 murder of Veronica Guerin, a
prominent journalist known for her aggressive reporting on Dublin
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Paul Ward, 34, denied helping to kill Ms. Guerin but
admitted that he knew drug dealers who planned to do it. He
acknowledged during the trial that he also dealt in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was sentenced to life in prison. Normally there is no
parole before 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   There was no jury because the case was tried in the Special
Criminal Court, established out of fear that criminals and
terrorists could intimidate jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guerin, 37, was shot five times in the chest on June 26,
1996, as she sat in her car at a traffic light on the outskirts of
Dublin. The killers rode a motorcycle and used a Magnum .357
pistol. Ward was accused of disposing of the gun and the
motorcycle. He was the first of several suspects to be tried in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The men accused of the actual shooting and of driving the
motorcycle have been arrested and face trials in the spring.
Another suspect, the head of the drug gang, is in England fighting
an extradition order. The names of the three are widely known;
though the court has forbidden journalists to report them public,
some have ignored the order.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's girlfriend, Vanessa Meehan, is the sister of one of the
men in jail, Brian Meehan, according to police, who have also
identified the suspected gunman as Eugene Holland.
</P>
<P>
   The chief government witness against Ward was Charles Bowden,
who testified that he and Ward made about $500,000 each selling
cannabis in a two-year period. Bowden, who was placed in a witness
protection program, said Ward was intimately involved with the
planning and execution of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision, read Friday morning by Justice Robert Barr,
first attacked as unproven the police assertions that Ward had
confessed to getting rid of the gun and motorcycle. The judges said
that police had violated his rights by putting unjust psychological
pressure on him, and that there was evidence they had beat him
around the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Police acknowledged that they had failed to videotape or record
any confession, and said they had lost the notes of its details.
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. Guerin's husband, Graham Turley, and other family
members sitting in the small courtroom during the two-hour
presentation of the verdict, Barr initially seemed on the verge of
acquitting Ward.
</P>
<P>
   But he went on to say that Bowden, though a liar and criminal,
now in prison on a six-year drug and weapons sentence, should be
believed in his testimony on Ward's involvement. He said that
Bowden was trying ``to extricate himself when cornered by the
police,'' but that his testimony was not influenced by an offer of
immunity from prosecution in the killing and placement in the
witness protection program, which he will enter when he finishes
his drug sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at high risk of being convicted of the murder and his
bargaining position would have been reduced to zero,'' the justice
continued. Asking rhetorically if there was any reason to believe
Bowden was lying about Ward, Barr said, ``The court can find
nothing in evidence that raises such suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts here had said that such uncorroborated allegations
rarely lead to convictions.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate statement that Ward would appeal the
decision.

THINGS ARE GETTING CURIOUSER (AND ALSO FURIOUSER) 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Curious George'' is a best-selling children's book series.
Furious George is a struggling punk rock band. You wouldn't
necessarily confuse the two. George in the books is a monkey.
George in the band is a person. But then again, maybe you might.
The ``Curious George'' books have bright yellow covers with red
lettering and pictures of George the monkey. The Furious George
albums are bright yellow with red lettering and also likenesses of
George the monkey _ in leather and sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   To the band, it's a parody. To Houghton Mifflin Co., publishers
of ``Curious George'' since 1941, it's trademark infringement.
</P>
<P>
   The civil contest is being waged before the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office Trial and Appeal Board in Washington. But it is
also being discussed on the Internet and in the pages of New York
Press, a free weekly newspaper, where George Tabb, the George of
Furious George, writes about himself and popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is George and I'm furious,'' said the 36-year-old
Tabb, a guitarist and composer whose first full-length CD, called
``Furious George Gets a Record,'' depicts a George-like monkey in
mug shot front and side views with a police arrest number. The
monkey also adorned the band's three early vinyl releases,
including one called ``Furious George Goes Ape!''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we can't sing songs like `Monkey in a Man Suit,'
`Prozac Defense' and `I Gotta Gun' because it might confuse the
little kids who like Curious George,'' Tabb wrote on a fan's
Furious George web page. ``Everyone who is not blind knows the
difference and everyone knows that if it came down to it, our
monkey could kick that monkey's butt, any day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that went, too, for George's handler, the Man in the
Yellow Hat, who in the book captures George in Africa to bring him
back to a zoo and becomes his best friend. ``A dead man,'' warned
Tabb, whose earlier punk rock bands include ``Roach Motel,''
``False Prophets,'' ``Iron Prostate'' and ``The Gynecologists.'' He
also plays a punk rocker in a forthcoming Spike Lee movie, ``Summer
of Sam,'' in which he performs a song partly composed by the jailed
murderer David Berkowitz, ``Hello From the Gutters of New York
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin's trademark lawyer, Mary Donovan, dismissed
Tabb's cry of censorship as absurd. ``Obviously, nobody is trying
to stop the man from performing,'' she said in an interview.
Rather, she said in her filings for Houghton Mifflin, Tabb's use of
the publisher's characters and design was ``a blatant theft'' going
far beyond the purposes of parody and likely to confuse the public.
</P>
<P>
   Although trademark disputes are common, the outlaw ethos of punk
rock, which cherishes provocation, all but insures that the
cultural clash will not be limited to legalism.
</P>
<P>
   To the company, its winsome little troublemaker is an asset well
worth protecting. Created in Paris more than 60 years ago by the
husband and wife team of Margaret Rey and Hans Alfonso Rey, Germans
who fled the Nazis, ``Curious George'' has since become a
mini-industry, with six more titles by the Reys and 28 others by
subsequent licensees. The books have sold more than 20 million
copies in 12 languages worldwide and have spawned a variety of
licensed products, including CD-ROMS, compact disks, key chains and
T-shirts, which brought in more than $5 million in sales last year
alone. In addition, a new ``Curious George'' movie, directed by Ron
Howard and blending animated characters and live actors, is
scheduled for release next year, Ms. Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute was set off by Tabb's filing of a trademark for his
year-old band, Furious George, in early 1996. He had heard, he
said, that other bands were using the name and he wanted to secure
its exclusivity. ``Of course it's irony,'' he said. ``Punk rock is
full of irony.'' But, he added, ``I registered the name not the
monkey.'' He also said he was not behind any sales or licensing of
Furious George memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   After the filing was routinely published in the trademark
office's weekly gazette, Houghton Mifflin filed as an ``opposer''
to the application, seeking summary judgment to have Tabb's
application rejected. Tabb, through his lawyer, Andrew Krents,
filed in opposition to the opposer and the fight was on. A decision
may come by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin argued that the similarity of names invited
confusion: ``Both marks employ the word `George' and, with the
exception of the first letter of the first word of both marks, the
words `Curious' and `Furious' sound virtually the same. Indeed, the
aural similarity is reinforced by the similar arrangement of the
words.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tabb translated it, ``They want to own the letter `F.'''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to fight the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.
``This is a battle between two monkeys, for God's sake,'' he said.

REVENUE STREAMS FROM AN OLD SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Mass.)   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
 (af)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ROWE, Mass. _ In a cavern cut deep into the granite bedrock of
the Berkshires, two huge turbines spin, powered by two million
gallons of water plunging 740 feet a minute through huge pipes from
one reservoir on the Deerfield River to another.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the turbines of the Bear Swamp hydroelectric
plant produce up to 600 megawatts of electricity, enough to serve a
small city.
</P>
<P>
   But nighttime is a different story. The turbines are idle, and
the plant reverses its work, using cheap off-peak power produced
elsewhere to pump water back up to the upper reservoir, so it can
be used again.
</P>
<P>
   Pump-storage hydropower plants like this one are becoming the
hottest commodity in the power business. They offer two unmatched
advantages to anyone who wants to compete in the developing spot
market for wholesale power: They can be turned on and off rapidly,
and they can, in effect, store power (in the form of water in the
uphill reservoir) for use in peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go from a dead stop to a full load in 10 minutes,''
said Bill Dodenhoff, a hydro-operations specialist for Bear Swamp's
operator, the U.S. Generating Co., a unit of the PG&AMP;E Corp., which
also owns California's largest utility.
</P>
<P>
   States across the country are deregulating the electricity
business, requiring utilities to sell or spin off their power
plants and buy power in the open market. Independent producers and
utilities from out of state now bid competitively to supply power
to local utilities, which at times of peak demand turn to the
volatile spot market to meet their customers' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Because most kinds of power plants take hours to start up or
shut down, demand for power can vary much faster than supply. So
producers around the country want the flexibility offered by
hydroelectric plants and are paying a big premium to get them.
</P>
<P>
   The Bear Swamp plant, built in the 1970s by the New England
Electric System, was among the largest of the 15 hydroelectric
plants that New England Electric sold to PG&AMP;E in September in a
$1.59 billion deal that also included three plants of other types.
At 1,100 megawatts of capacity, the hydropower portion of the deal
is the biggest single such purchase to date.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the nation's hydroelectric power is produced by
government-owned operations like the Hoover and Grand Coulee dams.
But there are hundreds of privately owned plants as well, many of
them small and in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Under deregulation, utilities like New England Electric and
Central Maine Power have had to sell off all their generating
plants, and the hydropower plants are fetching particularly high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   John E. Hanson, who follows the utility industry as a manager at
Metzler &AMP; Associates, a consulting firm in Deerfield, Ill., said
that in some cases hydropower plants have changed hands for half
again what a coal-fired plant of similar capacity commands.
</P>
<P>
   Even as PG&AMP;E is buying plants in other states, for regulatory
reasons it will probably have to sell or spin off the extensive
hydropower system it owns in California, which analysts say is
worth much more than its $1.6 billion book value.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility of the wholesale power market was sharply
illustrated on June 25, in the middle of a heat wave in the
Midwest. An unusual disruption of power plants and transmission
lines briefly sent wholesale prices in the region to $7,000 a
megawatt hour from the usual $20 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a pump storage unit that day, you could have taken
advantage of the volatility'' and made big profits, Hanson said. If
spikes like that develop in New England, Bear Swamp's output could
be profitably traded on a new regional power exchange being set up
in Holyoke, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hydropower also has a retail advantage. Given a choice of power
suppliers, consumers have shown a willingness to pay up to 20
percent more for ``green'' power _ energy from renewable sources
produced in environmentally benign ways, mostly hydropower.
California residential customers pay an average $10 extra on a
typical $50 monthly bill for heavily promoted green power.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a potential that buyers of hydro are looking at,''
said Jim Mahoney, senior vice president for asset management at
U.S. Generating.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers are doing more than just looking. In recent months PP&AMP;L
Resources, parent of Pennsylvania Power and Light, bought 11
hydroelectric plants with 557 megawatts of capacity from Montana
Power, and FPL Group, parent of Florida Power and Light, acquired
27 hydroelectric plants with 373 megawatts of capacity from Central
Maine Power.
</P>
<P>
   Both deals also included other kinds of plants, but analysts say
hydropower was the centerpiece in each case.
</P>
<P>
   Utility executives see various advantages in having hydropower
in their generating plant portfolios. Hydroelectric plants consume
no fuel, produce no pollution, require little staffing or
maintenance and are generally built to last.
</P>
<P>
   But new ones are rare these days, because they cannot be built
just anywhere, and the permits-and-approvals process can be
excruciating. With some environmentalists campaigning to dismantle
existing dams for the sake of the rivers they block, there is a
chance that the number of plants may actually decline. Hydropower
now makes up about 12 percent of the nation's generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Even old warhorses from the 1920s can become gold mines. Further
up the Deerfield River from Bear Swamp is the Harriman Station,
built in 1924 during a surge of dam construction, with an elaborate
Italianate brick facade featuring gargoyles flanking a huge paneled
bronze door.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil fuel-fired plants from that era that survive today are
generally dirty, high-maintenance headaches, but the Harriman
Station's three 15-megawatt turbines are as efficient today as the
day they were built, Dodenhoff said proudly.

VIAG OF GERMANY ACQUIRES ALGROUP OF SWITZERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The reshuffling of corporate Europe lurched a step
forward Friday as Viag AG, Germany's third-largest utility,
announced it was acquiring Algroup AG of Switzerland in a stock
swap worth $8.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At news conferences in Munich, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland,
company executives said they would form a group with $31 billion in
annual sales that would have major interests in energy,
telecommunications, aluminum, chemicals and packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the merger would enable them to achieve
savings of about $334 million a year, in part by shedding about
2,500 jobs, or 2 percent of the combined work force of 127,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, Viag shareholders, who will control 65
percent of the new company, will receive 10 new shares for every
Viag share, while Algroup shareholders will get 21.7 shares for
every Algroup share.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announcement came only days after Daimler-Benz of
Germany concluded its takeover of Chrysler to form DaimlerChrysler,
the world's fourth-biggest automobile group. Also this month,
Clariant AG and Ciba Specialty Chemicals, both of Switzerland,
agreed to combine in an $8 billion merger to create the world's No.
1 specialty chemicals company.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm Simson, Viag's chief executive, who will have the same
job at the combined company, citing the example of DaimlerChrysler,
said the merger would be a ``booster rocket'' for the combined
companies' industrial activities.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Viag announced plans to sell companies with
about $9 billion in revenues and 13,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rogers, who follows Viag at Commerzbank Global Equities in
London, said Friday's deal appeared inconsistent with such
pronouncements. ``Strategically, I don't see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also said he could not see how trimming $334 million a
year would translate into the kind of increased profitability the
companies were predicting, saying that was based on ``fairly
bullish assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism about the deal was reflected in the stock market.
Viag shares fell by as much as 27 marks, or $15.83, to 1,058 marks
in Frankfurt, bringing the slump in the share price to 11 percent
since the companies acknowledged last week that they were in talks.
</P>
<P>
   Others defended what they called the deal's strategic wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Sami Chakroun of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, agreed with the
merger decision, saying it ``makes sense to come together.'' But he
questioned whether Algroup shareholders would receive a sufficient
premium, given Viag's risks in the highly competitive
telecommunications and utilities businesses, which Algroup does not
share. With progressive European deregulation, those sectors face
increasing competition.
</P>
<P>
   The premium for Algroup's shareholders partly reflected the
greater profitability of the Swiss group. Since 1994, Algroup's
operating margin, its operating profit as a percentage of sales,
averaged 8.4 percent, against 5.5 percent at Viag.
</P>
<P>
   In the German phone business, Viag has joined up with British
Telecom and Telenor, the dominant carrier in Norway, to invest more
than $7 billion in a full-service network that will challenge the
market leader, Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Though the companies called the deal a ``merger of equals,'' it
was tantamount to a takeover by Viag, which will control much of
senior management.
</P>
<P>
   The combined group, which has yet to be named, will have its
headquarters in Munich, where it will locate its telecommunications
and utilities activities; the aluminum, chemicals and packaging
divisions will be run from Zurich.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sergio Marchionne, Algroup's chief executive, said the combined
company would achieve annual chemical sales of about $5.6 billion,
making it one of the world's five biggest specialty chemicals
companies. Algroup specializes in chemicals for the pharmaceutical
industry; Viag's SKW Trostberg unit is the world's No. 1 maker of
chemicals for the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   In packaging, the combined company will become the world's
leading manufacturer of packaging materials for products like
cigarettes and pharmaceuticals, with total annual sales of $8.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will be the world's biggest maker of
aluminum auto parts. Aluminum has been gaining favor among global
carmakers, given demands from governments and consumers for lighter
vehicles with lower fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, General Motors signed a 10-year agreement to
buy aluminum from Alcan Aluminium, with a complex arrangement to
shield itself from the volatile price of aluminum. Viag's VAW
Aluminum subsidiary supplies full aluminum chassis to Audi, a
Volkswagen subsidiary. But aluminum companies have been scrambling
to get costs down because of a drop in global aluminum prices.

POPE EXPANDS RELIGIOUS INDULGENCES FOR MILLENNIUM OBSERVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By Alessandra Stanley    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ For Roman Catholics, the year 2000 offers early
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II announced Friday that throughout the
millennium celebration, penitents who do a charitable deed or give
up cigarettes or alcohol for a day can earn an ``indulgence'' that
will eliminate time in purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences are an ancient form of church-granted amnesty that
releases penitents from certain forms of punishment in this life or
the next.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval church sold indulgences, a practice that drove
Martin Luther to rebel, leading to the Reformation. They remain a
source of theological debate between Protestants and Catholics, and
since Vatican II, the Roman Catholic Church has played down their
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal Catholics are embarrassed by a practice that seems
to offer such a simplistic shortcut to salvation. But church
officials emphasize that indulgences are linked to a sincere
repentance and are not a one-day expedient.
</P>
<P>
   By restoring indulgences to so prominent a position, the pope is
making penitence a theme of the millennium celebration. He is also
reassuring conservatives in the church. But by broadening the ways
believers can earn an indulgence, the pope is also trying to imbue
indulgences with some of the ecumenical spirit he wants to give the
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In a papal bull titled ``Incarnationis Mysterium'' (The Mystery
of the Incarnation) that will be formally issued on Sunday, John
Paul formally proclaimed the year 2000 a Holy Year, and issued
edicts that in many ways serve as a practical guide to spiritual
salvation during the period. He decreed that the jubilee would
begin on Christmas Day 1999 and end on the Feast of the Epiphany,
Jan. 6, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the papal document dealt with collective penitence. The
pope asked Catholics to seek forgiveness for past historical errors
during the Jubilee. He also asked rich nations to ease or
substantially eliminate Third World debt.
</P>
<P>
   The pope said individual sinners would be granted ``plenary
indulgences,'' a full pardon for sins as opposed to a shortening of
the time spent in purgatory. In Catholic theology, souls in
purgatory are purifying themselves before their entry into heaven.
He included personal acts of penitence or local charity work as a
way of earning an indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the period, believers will be offered a wider
selection of ways to receive a plenary indulgence. They may follow
tradition and attend a mass in one of several designated churches
and perform such devotions as the rosary or the stations of the
cross. Or, an appendix to the pope's letter explains, they may
visit the sick, the imprisoned or the handicapped, or give to the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may choose an act of private sacrifice. As the appendix,
signed by Cardinal William Baum, a top Vatican official, explained,
``This would include abstaining for at least one whole day from
unnecessary consumption (e.g from smoking, or alcohol, or fasting).
The text points out that sinners must also fulfill the ``usual
spiritual and sacramental conditions'' and say the ``usual
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Crescenzio Sepe, a top official in the Vatican's
committee of the Great Jubilee of the year 2000, said, ``One could
be tempted to think `today I won't smoke or I won't drink wine.
I'll get a plenary indulgence and go to paradise.' '' That, he said
would be wrong. ``That would not be the spirit of an indulgence,
that would be off-beam, like returning to the thinking of the
Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences are not one-day expedients, Sepe said, but he did
not make light of brief sacrifices. ``It's not so easy for some to
give up smoking for a day,'' he said pensively. ``It might be
easier to visit a prison inmate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pope's decision to expand the use of indulgences during the
millennium celebration is not entirely surprising. In 1985, the
pope revealed his respect for the practice by allowing Catholics to
receive indulgences via television.
</P>
<P>
   Believers who followed a church service where an indulgence was
granted on television or radio could be included _ as long as they
fulfilled the same conditions as those physically present for the
service, including confession, communion and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But indulgences, which began in early Christian times, have not
always been viewed favorably. In the 16th century, Pope Julius II
offered indulgences in exchange for contributions to build St.
Peter's Basilica in Rome. Martin Luther protested, and was
excommunicated in 1521.
</P>
<P>
   The Church later banned the sale of indulgences, but the Vatican
reaffirmed their religious importance at the Council of Trent in
1563. In 1968, Pope Paul VI also elaborated on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Including indulgences in the 2000 Jubilee ``could not be
avoided,'' said the Rev. Jared Wicks, a theologian at the Gregorian
University in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative Catholics would find it intolerable that, for
ecumenical considerations, the Church put into the closet a
practice affirmed by the Council of Trent.'' Wicks added with a
laugh, ``And John Paul II is not one to do anything like that.''

NOT JUST GOVERNMENTS MAKE WAR OR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once history's stage was peopled with kings and princes. Now it
seems that almost anyone with letterhead stationary and a tax
identification number can crowd on as well. Private organizations
increasingly play roles once considered the preserve of
governments, from drafting peace treaties to waging war.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jodi Williams, an American disarmament enthusiast,
and the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which she
founded, jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize for persuading 122
governments to sign a treaty outlawing antipersonnel mines.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, the government of Papua
New Guinea was paying $36 million to Sandline International, a
British company selling arms and military advice, to prepare its
forces for an assault against the secessionist island of
Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the growing role of private companies and
nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs as they are known, in
foreign policy marks a jaw-dropping transformation in the world's
political structure. ``The steady concentration of power in the
hands of states, which began in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia,
is over, at least for a while,'' said Jessica Mathews of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   That shift is a result of the growing complexity of the
international agenda, of a communications revolution that has
enabled NGOs to mobilize public opinion and of the reduced
ambitions of governments everywhere since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``As governments downsize and new challenges crowd the
international agenda,'' P.J. Simmons of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace wrote in the fall issue of Foreign Policy
magazine, ``NGOs fill the breach.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scholars are skeptical of such far-reaching claims. ``Of
course they have increased power, but there has been no decrease in
states' sovereignty,'' said Allan Gerson of the Council on Foreign
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Harris, editor of The National Interest, a quarterly
journal of current affairs, agrees: ``NGOs are successful only to
the extent they can influence the decisions of governments. They
have not supplanted them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the skeptics concede that the balance of power
between NGOs and governments has changed. Since 1948 the number of
NGOs accredited by the United Nations has risen from 41 to more
than 1,500; according to the Yearbook of International
Organizations the total number in existence now exceeds 5,000.
Environmental groups like Friends of the Earth dragged governments
to the Rio Earth Summit in 1992; human rights groups like Amnesty
International pushed them into creating the International Criminal
Court earlier this year; relief and development organizations like
Oxfam International channeled some $10 billion last year. Whether
the increasing influence of NGOs is a good or bad development,
however, is the subject of intense debate.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors argue that such groups are undemocratic, often
ineffective and may pursue narrow agendas; promoters believe they
help resolve issues that transcend national borders. Some people
argue that they do both. In a recent study of cooperation between
NGOs and United Nations agencies in humanitarian emergencies,
Thomas Weiss, the director of the research program on global
security at Brown University, concluded that NGOs are ``more
flexible, forthcoming, responsive and cost-effective than United
Nations institutions,'' but he added that they can be confused,
naive and prone to ``miss opportunities for cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, NGOs have chalked up their share of successes. In 1991,
for instance, when the United Nations was negotiating a settlement
of El Salvador's long civil war, the Ford Foundation ended up
financing the peace initiative. ``I needed money for secret trips
to see the parties, even to pay their hotel rooms when they finally
came together,'' recalls Alvaro de Soto, the United Nations
mediator in that conflict, ``but we had no cash to spare.''
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Comunita di Sant'Egidio, an Italian
organization with links to the Vatican, negotiated an end to
Mozambique's long civil war, ``the first intergovernmental
agreement ever negotiated by a nongovernmental body,'' said Andrea
Bartoli, Sant'Egidio's New York representative.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups have focused on building links between adversaries.
The Search for Common Ground, for example, took a U.S. wrestling
team to Tehran, Iran, in February and is now planning an exchange
of museum exhibitions. The Consensus Building Institute specializes
in overcoming mistrust between environmental NGOs and government
ministers by bringing them together informally.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such efforts do not always work. Sant'Egidio tried to
broker limited settlements in Algeria, Guatemala, Kosovo, Burundi
and Albania, but those soon fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, such private peacemaking is partly offset by the
recent rise of private war-making, in the form of ``military
companies'' selling arms and military assistance. In a study
published earlier this year, David Shearer of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London, concluded, ``In the past
decade, the increasing inability of weak governments to counter
internal violence has created a ready market for private military
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The best known are Executive Outcome of South Africa, Sandline
International in Britain and a U.S. company, Military Professional
Resources Inc. of Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of these three organizations published last year by
the Center for Defense Information, David Isenberg, a senior
research analyst, said that Executive Outcome had some 2,000
contract soldiers on call and its own fleet of aircraft and
helicopters. The Angolan government hired it between 1993 and 1996
to train and arm its forces at a cost of some $40 million a year.
And in 1995 and 1996 the company also helped the Sierra Leone
government subdue the rebel Revolutionary United Front at a cost of
$35 million, one-third of the country's defense budget, and
recapture vital diamond-mining areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sandline International told Isenberg that its purpose was to
``fill a void in the post-Cold War era'' by offering governments
``specialized military expertise at a time when Western nations'
desire and, in some instances, capacity to provide support has
waned.''
</P>
<P>
   Shearer said that both the U.S. and the British governments had
little incentive to curb the activities of such military companies
because they were either ``carrying out foreign policy directly or
at least working within acceptable boundaries.'' They also provide
useful intelligence, he said, and encourage clients to purchase
their home countries' weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Western governments have also discovered a downside.
Executive Outcome, for example, became the subject of a British
government inquiry earlier this year over allegations that it had
broken a Security Council arms embargo against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Military intervention isn't the only problem posed by the
nongovernmental groups. Stephen Kobrin of the Lauder Institute of
Management and International Studies wrote in Foreign Policy this
fall how a little-known NGO called the Preamble Collaborative
mobilized some 600 other private organizations against a planned
agreement among 29 industrialized governments to facilitate foreign
investment around the world. Kobrin said that the projections
underlying the Preamble's charge _ that the agreement gave business
too much power _ were ``barely credible worse-case scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weisbrot, the Preamble's research director, maintains that
``the agreement would have given foreign investors new rights
against governments without imposing any additional obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a number of Western governments, led by Britain,
complained that a number of NGOs caring for refugees had failed to
provide any adequate accounting for some $370 million of government
money given them by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
Meanwhile, nations like India, Malaysia and Brazil have complained
about being lectured to by private organizations about their record
on human rights or forest depletion.
</P>
<P>
   For Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of Foreign Affairs magazine,
such complaints point to ``a troubling aspect'' of the rise of
nonstate actors in international affairs, namely that they lack the
democratic accountability expected of the governments whose
traditional functions they usurp.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts counter, however, that NGOs and other nonstate
actors must still persuade the public at large, foundations and
even governments to reach into their pockets to provide the money
they need to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mathews worries that in the short run at least the rise of
NGOs may ``weaken rather than bolster the world's capacity to solve
its problems'' by encouraging governments to underfinance
established international organizations like the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan disclosed last year
that even he considered contracting out the delicate job of
removing soldiers from refugee camps in Goma, Congo, during the
1994 Rwandan civil war to a private military company. In the end he
decided not to, saying, ``The world may not be ready to privatize
peace.''

 &HT;    Shoppers tolerant of crowds, not `spatial crowding'
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As strollers, carts and people pack stores this
weekend in the retail version of an I-285 traffic jam, some might
find it hard to understand the mind-set of the hard-core shopper.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just courage that moves people to plunge into the
Thanksgiving fray, experts say. For some shoppers, the bigger the
crowd, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have widely different perceptions of crowding, both
individually and by store type,'' said Karen Machleit, marketing
professor at the University of Cincinnati's College of Business
Administration. ``Shoppers are drawn to crowds in a discount store,
for example, because that signals a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Machleit and Georgia State University Professor Sevgin Eroglu
have been studying how shoppers feel about crowds for 10 years.
They've found that shoppers are much more tolerant of crowds of
people than ``spatial crowding,'' or stores piled with merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human crowding doesn't seem to have a strong affect on
consumer satisfaction, although spatial crowding does,'' Malchleit
said. Although the current trend is to pack the sales floor in
order to offer a bigger selection, that's beginning to backfire.
Department stores are recognized as some of the worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some children's apparel sections are so crowded that you can't
push a stroller through. That's sort of a no-brainer,'' said space
designing consultant Paco Underhill, who founded New York-based
Envirosell more than 20 years ago to help retailers lay out
everything from gas stations to department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Underhill interviews and videotapes shoppers, then scrutinizes
their every move. Last year, he studied holiday retail activity in
metro Atlanta and found that shoppers here face the same dilemmas
that they do elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The selling floor during Christmas is basically a disaster,''
Underhill said. ``Years ago, the big retailers used 65 percent of
their space for selling and the rest for storage. Today, many
stores are operating at 90 percent, so they're basically putting
the entire inventory out on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   And as every shopper knows, that means it's not only harder to
navigate the stores, but it can also be tough to find sizes and
styles as items are misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the popularity of discount stores and
warehouse-style stores, experts say, is that shoppers have room to
move. Still, retailers continue to struggle with finding the right
format and size. For example, ``big box'' retailers like Home Depot
and Wal-Mart helped foster the trend toward bigger formats, but now
the same companies are going in the other direction, experimenting
with convenience-oriented layouts for the customer who wants a
smaller setting.
</P>
<P>
   But crowding is mainly a matter of perception, so that means
it's tough to please the majority. ``If shoppers are pressed for
time when buying something, they'll think the store is more crowded
than it actually is,'' said Machleit. ``And the same goes if
there's a lot of financial or social risk associated with the
purchase. If they have to make a big decision, they'll tend to
think there's more people and activity around them.

 &HT;    Grand Cherokee rugged as ever
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just in case anyone has escaped the massive print,
broadcast and outdoor advertising campaign, the 1999 Jeep Grand
Cherokee Limited is almost as all-new as its parent company,
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there are some things that recall the World War II-born Jeep
that was little more than a topless two-door with engine,
transmission and steering wheel. The '99 Grand Cherokee retains the
menacing grille with seven vertical slots and the big
tire-accommodating trapezoidal wheel openings. But most everything
else _ notably the interior _ has been reworked to make it more
appealing visually and more comfortable physically.
</P>
<P>
   The two-ton, four-door Grand Cherokee drives and rides much the
same as in the past, on and off the road, meaning the ride's not
crisp and there is body roll. But it's got more muscle with six-
and eight-cylinder engines that grunt and go _ too noisily for some
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Key changes, though, have to do with comfort, convenience and
being competitive in a market invaded by cushy sport-utilities
wearing Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac, Lexus, Lincoln and even Oldsmobile
badging.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into the deep red sienna test vehicle, which carried a
base price of $33,890 and a final cost of $36,855, made two
positive changes immediately noticeable: The instrumentation and
controls on the dash are more compactly packaged, and the spare
tire has vanished, now hidden under the rear cargo floor. Previous
spares rode as impediments to maximum use of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of previous Grand Cherokees will notice other changes
that won't mean as much to first-time buyers. Fold down the seats
to boost cargo space from 39 cubic feet to 72.3 cubic feet, and
it's no longer necessary to wrestle with the rear headrests. They
fold automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanical changes aren't as noticeable, except when the
weather turns nasty or the Grand Cherokee goes off-road, at which
it remains adept. A high-tech four-speed automatic transmission now
has two second gears, one for improved acceleration during takeoffs
and another for smoother moves during kick-downs or downshifts.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler claims the Grand Cherokee's ability to divert
power to the wheel with the most traction has been improved, but
the reality is that's a difference few drivers can fully
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   What's easier to identify is the extra cabin room provided by
stretching the Grand Cherokee's body 3-plus inches to 181.5 inches
in order to hide the spare under the cargo floor. Three adults can
sit in the rear, and while they might find the seat bottoms a bit
short, there's plenty of knee room even with the front seats all
the way back. Headroom is not a concern for average adults.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, the seating is akin to swaddling, reminiscent of some
front seats in the old Chrysler sedans. The controls, too, are
intended to make travel pleasant and simple, although it's
difficult to not marvel at an overhead console-programmable system
that enables drivers to dictate the automatic behavior of the
locks, horn, wipers and headlamps in various situations.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited four-door,
four-wheel drive sport-utility
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $36,855 (base: $33,890)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, power anti-lock disc
brakes, side-impact beams, height-adjustable shoulder belts
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: optional 4.7 liter V-8 engine (235 horsepower,
$960), four-speed automatic transmission with high/low settings and
overdrive lockout
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: power sunroof, $800; upgraded
stereo with cassette player and 10-disc CD changer, $300; tinted
paint, $200; full-size spare tire, $160; ashtray and lighter, $20
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 15 mpg regular unleaded city, 19 mpg highway

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a swath of energetic jet-stream winds, with speeds up
to 195 mph, merged with the western flank of an upper-level
low-pressure system off the California coast. As a result, the
strengthened low will be a formidable system on Saturday as it
moves into the southwest states.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will move across southern
California early in the day as the cold core of the upper-level low
moves overhead. Heavy snow is possible in the mountains east of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms, a few with small hail, will spread
east into Arizona as the upper-level low advances. Rain could be
moderate to heavy in some places as tropical moisture carried by a
jet stream originating east of Hawaii is drawn into the low's
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will likely be heaviest on mountains, where lifting of
moist air is amplified by the sloping terrain. Snow will fall at
elevations above 6,000 feet. Mountain snows and valley showers and
thunderstorms will also develop in parts of southern Nevada and
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonable warmth will continue to build from the Front Range
of the Rockies to the Plains, except for North Dakota and northern
Minnesota, where chilly Canadian air makes inroads.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather will also cover almost the entire eastern third of
the nation. Vestiges of cold weather will be found in western
Maine, where 3 to 5 inches of snow fell in the mountains late
Thursday. Winds from the west-northwest averaging 15 to 25 mph will
detract from the mildness of the air across southern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Foggy Name
</P>
<P>
   Very dense fog shrouded the Texas coast early Friday.
Meteorologists, who name fogs by the process by which they form,
call such a mist an ``advection-radiation fog.'' Initially, moist
air flows gently onshore from the Gulf of Mexico. In technical
terms, moisture is ``advected'' or carried inland by weak onshore
winds. Once inland, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico cools after
sunset while in contact with cooling ground, setting the stage for
water vapor to condense into fog. The ground cools because it loses
more infrared radiation than it receives from a cloudless,
nighttime atmosphere.

COMMENTARY: KEVORKIAN BROADCAST DID NOT DIG DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Sunday, ``60 Minutes'' broadcast a step-by-step, close-up
videotape of a killing and gave the killer, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a
national platform to explain his act as a humane deed rather than a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, that broadcast ignited a new round of debate
about the ethics of euthanasia, the ethics of the news media and
the intersection of the two. With Kevorkian charged with
first-degree murder in the case, that debate becomes all the more
important.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape showed Kevorkian, in what he has called a
deliberate effort to provoke a courtroom test of euthanasia,
injecting lethal drugs into Thomas Youk, who was afflicted with Lou
Gehrig's disease and who said on the tape that he wanted to die.
Youk, 52, dies on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Was this, as some critics asserted, degrading sensationalism?
Was it thinly disguised advocacy journalism? Or was it, as CBS and
its defenders said, a newsworthy event that had the merit of
advancing a discussion the nation must inevitably confront?
</P>
<P>
   Both critics and defenders could test their principles by
imagining a videotaping of the procedure that opponents call
partial-birth abortion, with its suctioning of the brain from a
nearly full-term fetus and its collapsing of the skull. Would ``60
Minutes'' broadcast it? Would many of those now denouncing ``60
Minutes'' as sensationalistic or praising it for advancing the
discussion reverse their positions?
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the ``60 Minutes'' report advanced the
discussion of dying in one sense. It illustrated what many
opponents of doctor-assisted suicide, and also some of its
supporters, including Kevorkian, have been arguing: that the moral
and legal line between assisting a suicide and directly ending a
life can be unclear.
</P>
<P>
   It also illustrated the difficulty of trying to limit such
recourse, as many proposals for legalizing assisted suicide have
done, to those within six months of dying. The broadcast made no
mention of whether Youk would have met that restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it is fair to ask what was really learned from the
Kevorkian video. In the most literal sense, it put a face on a
victim of a debilitating and ultimately fatal disease, and the
faces on his closest family members. But what else? The program
gave viewers the scantiest sense of him as a person (he led an
active life and raced cars); it told nothing of his medical
condition or prognosis except what Kevorkian reported; and while
movingly portraying his family's anguish (``We were at the end of
our rope. We didn't have any options''), the report offered no
specifics about what medical care and resources were available to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations of sensationalism would be easier to rebut if
the broadcast had been more balanced. Mark Siegler, an opponent of
both doctor-assisted suicide and euthanasia, had less than 100
seconds to express his dismay. Except for one vague and quickly
abandoned question about ``abuses,'' Mike Wallace asked Kevorkian
nothing about the social consequences or philosophical implications
of his actions. Perhaps it only reflects a celebrity culture that
Wallace's confrontational questions all focused on Kevorkian's
motives, personality and public image.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson in all this that goes beyond a single report
by ``60 Minutes'' and may be especially pertinent if Kevorkian goes
on trial. A few months ago, The Journal of Criminal Law and
Criminology, which is sponsored by the Northwestern University
School of Law, published an article by Yale Kamisar, the Clarence
Darrow Distinguished University Professor at the University of
Michigan Law School. Titled ``Physician-Assisted Suicide: The
Problems Presented by the Compelling, Heart-Wrenching Case,'' the
article is a long and nuanced discussion of hard cases like that of
Youk.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, however, the article offers a warning to the news
media: ``All too often, a reporter believes that the way to provide
an in-depth treatment of the subject is to set forth a detailed
account of a particular individual begging for assistance in
committing suicide _ a detailed, poignant account that blots out
what might be called societal or public policy considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamisar is not trying to evade the hard cases. Indeed, his
article is an effort to confront them from the perspective of a
nonreligious, utilitarian opponent of assisted suicide and
euthanasia. But his warning is a reminder that a lot more than hard
cases may be at stake in this debate.
</P>
<P>
   The legalization of assisted suicide and its next-door neighbor,
euthanasia, may profoundly affect _ for better or worse _ the
routine practice of medicine for the aged and debilitated, the
expectations and sense of obligation assumed by dying and disabled
individuals, the relations between them and family members _ and a
host of other attitudes and practices well beyond the ranks of the
hard cases or even those usually cited as potential victims of
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   For the news media, the real ethical challenge may be to keep
the obvious power of heart-wrenching instances and courtroom drama
from eclipsing these less clear-cut but ultimately more
far-reaching stakes.

INMATE ESCAPES FROM TEXAS DEATH ROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For the first time since Dust Bowl days, when
fedora-topped G-men battled backroads bandits like Bonnie &AMP; Clyde,
a condemned inmate has escaped from Texas' Death Row prison.
</P>
<P>
   Martin E. Gurule's daring scheme involved dummies and a
desperate sprint through a hail of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, 29, became the first Death Row inmate to ever make it
completely out of the vast prison complex in Huntsville and into
the surrounding piney woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the others who got out of Death Row were caught
somewhere else inside the complex,'' said Larry Fitzgerald, a
spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``He's the
first to get all the way outside.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, hundreds of police officers and tracking
dogs were picking their way through the rough, marshy woods east
and north of Huntsville, hoping to catch the trail of Gurule, who
was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1992 murder of a
Corpus Christi restaurant owner and a cook during a robbery.
Helicopters equipped with infrared telescopes were buzzing over the
Walker County treetops near the Trinity River, which runs along the
prison's east side.
</P>
<P>
   Texas correction officials said that Gurule and six other Death
Row inmates at the Ellis Unit northeast of Huntsville cut through a
fence surrounding an outdoor recreation yard and were able to
clamber to a rooftop before the other prisoners were taken back to
their cells at 8:15 Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   Prison guards did not notice the men were missing because they
had transformed pillows and sheets into makeshift dummies, making
it appear they were asleep in their bunks, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   A guard noticed the men dropping off the rooftop at around 12:20
a.m. Friday and immediately sounded the alarm and began firing as
many as 20 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting began, the other six inmates gave themselves
up, Fitzgerald said, but Gurule kept running and made his way over
an exterior fence and into the nearby woods. The guard said he saw
Gurule fall to the ground briefly after he shot at him, but
officials found no evidence of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fitzgerald said prison officials were confident
that the fugitive remained somewhere in the surrounding woods,
which he said were so thick and soggy and unforgiving that Gurule
would have been unable to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   By early Friday, officials had the countryside surrounded at an
eight-mile perimeter, which they believed was well beyond the range
that Gurule could have run in that time. Police officers stood
side-by-side along all of the roads leading into the Ellis Unit,
making it difficult for Gurule to cross out of the dense woods.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials described Gurule as very dangerous, but said
they had no reason to believe that he was armed.
</P>
<P>
   The unit is one of several that make up the vast Huntsville
prison complex. Executions take place at the Wall Unit, closer to
the center of Huntsville, which is an hour's drive north of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has the busiest Death Row in the nation. Officials said
there have been 17 executions this year at Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule was convicted of murder in the shooting of Mike Piperis,
46, co-owner of the U&AMP;I Restaurant in Corpus Christi, and Anthony
Staton, 31, one of the restaurant's cooks, on Oct. 12, 1992. Also
convicted was Malisa Smith, Gurule's girlfriend at the time, who
had worked at the restaurant. She received a 25-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule contended during his trial that he had not gone to the
restaurant intending to rob it, but because he had been summoned by
Piperis, who feared that Gurule intended to turn him in to federal
tax officials. The shootings occurred during a struggle over the
gun when Gurule said he feared for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule's story didn't convince the court, largely because both
of the men had been shot in the head, execution-style, and because
money and receipts were found in Ms. Smith's apartment. Police
estimated that the couple made off with $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said that the search would continue into the night
and until some sign was found of Gurule's path of flight. Officials
were confident it would not take long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often when something like this happens, they make all sorts of
plans for what might happen inside the prison,'' Fitzgerald said.
``But then they find themselves standing outside in the woods and
wonder what they should do next.''

   Soak it, sleep in it, leave it out in a storm: Nothing seems to
shrink or even much wrinkle the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product posted a healthy 3.9 percent annual
growth rate in the third quarter, confounding widespread warnings
that the continuing economic crisis in Asia and Russia and the
resulting turmoil in financial markets would slow down the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Durable-goods orders slipped 1.7 percent in October, more than
expected, but consumer confidence rose sharply in the November
survey, personal income and spending both posted the expected
modest gains in October, and existing-home sales were strong.
</P>
<P>
   Economists continue to warn that the stream of positive
indicators could dry up any time; many still tentatively forecast a
slowdown sometime in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The view through the crystal ball at the holiday shopping season
is none too clear, either: On Wednesday, a news report headlined
``Poll: One-Quarter of Americans Plan to Cut Holiday Spending'' was
transmitted on Associated Press news wires within two minutes of an
article sent by AP's rival, Reuters, entitled ``Buoyant U.S.
Consumers Set to Shop Heartily.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japan's woes take center stage in most mind's-eye views of Asian
economic troubles. And not unjustly, considering the country's
economic weight and the stubbornness of its recession. The latest
batch of indicators _ industrial production contracted 1.2 percent
in October, retail sales plummeted 5.5 percent and unemployment
remained stuck at a postwar high _ were as gloomy as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an economy that few count among the crisis' direst
casualties was doubling over. Hong Kong reported that its gross
domestic product was 7 percent smaller in the third quarter of 1998
than in the quarter a year earlier, the steepest year-to-year fall
on record.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal report followed declines of 2.7 percent in the first
quarter and 5.2 percent in the second; the government hopes 1998
will wrap up with only a 5 percent decline for the year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   If you've grown a good bit bigger lately on account of heroic
feats of ingestion, well, you might just be a corporation. The red
button has not yet popped up on two big deals in the oven,
Exxon-Mobil and Deutsche Bank-Bankers Trust, but last week yielded
plenty of other done-to-a-turn merger and acquisition
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Among the $1 billion-plus highlights of the merger parade were
these:
</P>
<P>
   America Online agreed to buy Netscape Communications for $4.2
billion, creating a company that, through a separate but related
alliance with Sun Microsystems, might just become the first real
threat to Microsoft in many a moon. International Paper said it
would buy Union Camp for $5 billion in stock. AMP escaped a $9.7
billion hostile offer from Allied-Signal when Tyco International
rode in as a white knight to buy AMP for $11.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Two big disability insurers, Provident and UNUM, agreed to merge
in a $4.8 billion deal. B.F. Goodrich said it would acquire Coltec,
a leading aircraft-parts maker, for $2.2 billion. Lowe's, the No. 2
home improvement retailer, behind Home Depot, said it would buy
Eagle Hardware and Garden in a $1 billion stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Siebe said it would acquire BTR, descendant of the
old British Tire and Rubber, for $6.13 billion; the combined
company would be the largest maker of industrial controls. Viag AG,
Germany's No. 3 utility, agreed to buy Algroup, a diversified Swiss
manufacturer, in a stock swap worth $8.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For all the headlines, though, the statistics say it wasn't an
unusual week for total merger activity. Securities Data Co. tallies
showed 106 deals involving merger or acquisition of an American
public company announced last week; the typical recent week has
seen 150 or so. &QL; 
 &QL;

   SO TO SPEAK
</P>
<P>
   Low Wattage &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can make a mistake, of course, but most try not to do
so when the world is watching. Fear of embarrassment is a strong
motive for most business people to double-check carefully anything
they write or say for public consumption, like an advertisement or
a product announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Once, human proofreaders were common in the publishing,
advertising and public relations businesses for just this purpose.
But all too often today, a desktop computer's spell checker is the
only line of defense against errors in documents.
</P>
<P>
   When BLI International sent a news release to automotive
journalists promoting a device for protecting car batteries from
accidental draining, something more than a simple spell checker was
needed for sentences like these:
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Larry E. Hayslett, president of BLI International,
reports that, they now feature new gear drive system, handles 1000
amps, vibration proof and are water resistant and have been tested
and approved for required ISO, USCG, and SAE standards and
certifications. ``We are exited to now be offering the standard
units with a three (3) year limited warranty as opposed to the one
(1) year previously extended. ``(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A paragraph later comes the company's slogan, ``When the Battery
Is Dead _ Nothing Works!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the trouble. &QL;

A '70S ACCESSORY WHOSE TIME HAS COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
(lb) 
 By DAVID COLMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a truism that trends don't seem to exist until
they're given a label that gains wide acceptance. Think of Seattle
grunge, New York minimalism or winter white.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the biggest obstacle to American men's adopting
the European tradition of carrying a small shoulder, underarm or
hand-held bag _ perfect for housing all of one's microscopic
communications hardware, from cell phones to CD players _ is that
there's nothing appropriate to call these accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The bags don't lack for style, their sleek, sporty look bringing
to mind Roger Vadim, circa 1966, en route to meet a curvaceous
blonde starlet. Maybe the Etienne Aigner bag found at a flea market
for $10 once even graced the wrist of the French director, or at
least one of his fans.
</P>
<P>
   But still, what to call the darn thing?
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to this accessory in the United States may well
have been sealed by one of the more common terms for it in the
early '70s: the ``manbag.'' I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   But other names are not much better: Man-purse, wrist purse,
wrist bag, clutch case, shoulder bag.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you reach for a nice, simple briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   The prickly nomenclature issue is somewhat helped by the fact
that there are so many shapes and sizes of small, oh, let's just
call them carry-cases, on the market today. An equally formidable
source of resistance is that many men are convinced that carrying
such a bag isn't masculine. But in this era of '70s-influenced,
unisex clothing, the time is right for a reappraisal.
</P>
<P>
   The Florentine company Il Bisonte, which has been making leather
goods with a Continental flair since 1968, offers a cornucopia of
the bags at its SoHo boutique, as well as at Bloomingdale's. There
are small and large shoulder satchels ($198 and $315) reminiscent
of a manly conductor's bag, and snap-closure leather envelopes
($148), one of which is toted by Bill Cosby. Anyone want to call
Cos a wimp?
</P>
<P>
   Prada has taken a page from the Il Bisonte book lately, offering
a variety of unisex-style shoulder bags. The most discreet, a small
nylon bag, $220, just big enough for a cell phone or other
hand-held hardware, could even be worn underneath a blazer, the
shoulder strap making for that always chic crossing-guard look.
</P>
<P>
   More rugged is a bag that is in essence half a backpack. Made of
nylon, costing $420, it gets slung over the shoulder like a
mountaineer's coil of rope but is perhaps better suited to scaling
the social heights.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want the designer initial of the minute, Fendi has
a small unisex shoulder bag with two pockets adorned with an ``F,''
for $529.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Gucci to get the Vadimesque wrist case down pat. At
$340, Gucci's case comes in black polished calf with the initial
``G'' stitched into the side. Bergdorf Goodman offers a simple
small travel case by Tanner Krolle, for $525, for the man who
really wants to invest in the look.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Vuitton offers hand-held cases in leather or monogrammed
canvas, ranging in price from $355 to $615. Unfortunately, the
powers that be at Louis Vuitton have dubbed this model the
frilly-sounding ``pochette.'' But you can ignore the name and think
of it as, say, a megawallet, a grenade case or something similarly
imposing.
</P>

MY HEART BELONGS TO DUANE (READE, THAT IS)

   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)

   NEW YORK _ I had to be the happiest consumer in New York when I
heard that the Duane Reade drug and cosmetics chain had plans to
open 30 new stores by the end of this year. At around 2:30 a.m. on
certain fidgety nights, I entertain the thought of boarding the A
train from my apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, to go shopping at
the 24-hour Duane Reade store on the corner of 57th Street and
Broadway. Just knowing I have this option provides a level of
comfort otherwise missing from the life of an insomniac with a day
job.
</P>
<P>
   I first became a disciple of Duane Nation in the mid-1980s, when
I would escape an entry-level job to spend lunch hours at a branch
of the chain. I loved the concept of finding happiness for $20 one
day and 20 cents the next. I was enthralled by the chaotic nature
of it all: watching a yuppie with a basket full of Slim-Fast inhale
a bag of Munchos behind a Chia Pet display; finding a jar of
Fluffernutter next to a jar of Tucks medicated pads.
</P>
<P>
   Could I find a bar of soap in Brooklyn at 3 a.m? Moot point.
Even if I lived next door to a CVS Pharmacy (bor-ring) or a
Rite-Aid (bland), I would still be headed toward Duane's _ the
uberstore for the toiletry-obsessed. It is the only place in New
York that I feel perfectly comfortable asking, ``Can I put this bag
of Cheetos on my bank card?''
</P>
<P>
   For this and many, many more reasons, including the double-ply
shopping bags and an impressive selection of K-Tel cassette tapes,
you will find me purchasing something at a Duane Reade every day of
the week. I may never save enough money for a down payment on a
co-op, but I will have 18 different bottles of Sally Hansen Hard as
Nails and six different brands of depilatories _ and really, what's
more important?
</P>
<P>
   Often during my lunch hour, I go on these intense Duane benders,
where I troll the aisles with one purpose: to need it all. The
heavier my basket gets, the more I feel myself developing the
symptoms described on the back of all the boxes _ headaches (pain
relievers and sinus masks), heartburn (antacids), infections
(triple antibiotic ointments). I'm a hypochondriac in a candy
store. Other times I drop by just for a quick glance at the 99-cent
pantyhose in orangesque shades that haven't surfaced since the
mid-'60s. Either way, it is always a life-affirming experience.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the presence of a new Duane Reade store at 89th Street
and Madison Avenue has had residents of the Carnegie Hill
neighborhood crying foul over the big, bold red-and-blue sign
outside. But I say, step inside and see the show. You don't know
what you're missing. You'll thank me the next time you run out of
Final Net.
</P>
<P>
   Sure I could shop at Ricky's or Broadway Love's, with their
floor-to-ceiling selection of unpronounceable hair products. But
their club-kid salesclerks just sneer you down when you resist
their attempts to saddle you with a $90 bottle of shampoo. That
type of attitude would never go down at Duane's, where Prell
Concentrate is still a very beautiful thing.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it is written into the training manuals that no
Duane Reade employee is ever to speak directly to a customer, only
to other employees, often in a language I don't understand, while
the checkout line snakes eight-deep out the front door. Occasional
pointing in the general direction of an aisle is acceptable, but
even that's pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, I have learned to depend on Duane Reade's presence as
a constant in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Its jam-packed aisles of eclectic merchandise coming at me from
every possible angle gives me that warm ``welcome home, Barbara,
where've you been?'' feeling I get from my own jam-packed, eclectic
home. When you're shopping at 3 in the morning, a store should
really feel like home. Thus I find it a sign of acceptance, not
suspicion, that the security officer at the front of the store
still gives me that knowing ``if you're a customer, you're a
shoplifter'' glance when I come through the door.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything right now, I love how Duane Reade has
managed to rise above the whole generic vibe of chain retailing.
How it is highly unlikely that I will ever see a custom CD called
``The Music of Duane Reade'' for sale at the registers. How I'll
never have to worry, the way I do with Old Navy and Gap purchases,
that I'll show up for work on a casual Friday wearing the same
sweater as two of my colleagues. After all, who's going to stop me
in the elevator and go, ``Oh my, is that Arrid X-tra Dry? It's
perfect for my new sweater!'' or ``That conditioner _ to die for.''
</P>
<P>
   If they did, then I'd invite them on my next Duane bender.
Although it's a safe bet they'll be asleep when I'm shopping.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ You can call him director, writer, actor, filmmaker,
photographer, professor or doctor. But call Jonathan Miller
polymath or Renaissance man and he will gag. Ask him for the common
thread running through his varied interests, and he will reply that
if he knew, he would be in desperate trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is directing the Metropolitan Opera's current production
of Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro.'' He paused during a recent
rehearsal to assess New York City's opera fans and opera critics:
The fans are ``obsessed with celebrity.'' They ``like to applaud
Pavarotti.'' The critics are provincial pedants.
</P>
<P>
   But in mid-rant, Miller could not resist calling on Darwin, one
of his many intellectual heroes, for backup. ``I'm an
evolutionist,'' he said. Despite what fans and critics believe,
there is no one, true version of an opera. Every opera evolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not evolving toward a terminus; it's just that at a
certain point you frame the thing.'' That's the performance. (This
is not to say that one framing is as good as another. Witness
Miller's disgust over Cecilia Bartoli's insistence on singing two
alternative showy arias during a few taped performances of
``Figaro.'')
</P>
<P>
   If you were to frame Miller now, you would see a 64-year-old,
6-foot-3-inch, gray-haired, frisky, irascible Englishman. In
addition to directing ``Figaro,'' he is the curator of an
exhibition titled ``On Reflection'' at the National Gallery in
London, the author of a book of the same title and a photographer
of what he calls ``neglected things'': torn posters, garbage,
castoffs. In December he will direct a reading of Robert Lowell's
poem ``Benito Cereno'' at the 92nd Street Y. And these are just his
recent doings.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Wolfe Miller, the son of Emmanuel, a psychiatrist, and
Betty Bergson, a writer, was going to be just one thing, a doctor.
But in 1960, after studying natural science and linguistic
philosophy at Cambridge and getting his medical degree, he was
knocked off course by comedy. He calls it his ``fall from grace.''
He teamed up with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett in
``Beyond the Fringe,'' a satiric review that started a comedic
revolution. When the show went from Edinburgh to London to
Broadway, the unsolicited invitations poured in _ to direct, to
write, to narrate, to produce. And Miller was unable to resist any
of them, much to his regret. (He thinks he could have been a great
neurologist.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he became the editor of a BBC arts program. He made
films of Plato's ``Symposium'' and Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' He went back to medicine briefly in the early 1970s
as a research fellow at University College, London, but soon
returned to the theater. In 1973, he began directing opera, even
though he does not read music. In 1978, he wrote and narrated ``The
Body in Question,'' a medical series for PBS, then directed a
Shakespeare series for the BBC. He was the artistic director of the
Old Vic Theater in London in the late 1980s, then a research fellow
in neuropsychology at the University of Sussex. Oh yes, and in his
spare time, he wrote books: ``Darwin for Beginners,'' ``Subsequent
Performances'' and biographies of Freud and Marshall McLuhan.
</P>
<P>
   Miller applies everything he knows to everything he does. His
book and show ``On Reflection'' is a mix of cognitive science,
perceptual theory and art history. For the opera at hand, he
consults Noam Chomsky's linguistics for dramatic coaching, Erving
Goffman's sociological theories for plotting, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon
Chardin's paintings for staging and neuropsychology for comic
technique.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent rehearsal Miller was in a curatorial state of mind,
busy describing his ``Figaro'' as a series of frames. He beamed at
the set, a simple white room with shelves full of tools for
wig-making, boot-cleaning, cooking, washing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the details of domestic reality _ I pored over pictures
for days,'' and read Fernand Braudel, the French historian of
everyday life, he said. And this, he declared, is what life looked
like in 18th-century France just before the revolution. ``When did
people work? And how often? What was it like getting up in the
morning? How often did they bathe?'' Miller stopped once more to
admire the set. ``Isn't that great looking? It's a real house!''
</P>
<P>
   During the first act Miller pointed out a clever allusion in his
staging: Figaro's Susanna, played by Ms. Bartoli, was about to
strike a pose straight out of a painting by Chardin. Bartoli leaned
on a table. Then she approached a copper cistern to get a drink.
Miller was bursting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the Chardin moment,'' he said. ``Chardin has what I
want. The details of 18th-century life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the small details, the most imperceptible things that
matter most,'' he continued. Then he paraphrased one of his
favorite philosophers, J.L. Austin: ``We don't want to talk about
the good and the beautiful. We must consider first the dainty and
the dumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he promised, there would be another quotation from art
history onstage: Susanna would look like the Virgin Mary fainting
at the foot of the cross with St. John the Evangelist holding her
up and Mary Magdalene looking on. He explained that countless
15th-century Flemish paintings had this arrangement of bodies.
``But wait till she faints,'' he commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a vast plenitude of microscopic comic detail,'' Miller
said approvingly. ``When you get that right, opera looks right.''
James Levine, the artistic director of the Met, chimed in: ``He
does great detail work. He suits it to the specifics. One Miller
opera doesn't look like another.''
</P>
<P>
   But how does Miller square his desire to catch the details of
18th-century life with his efforts to get Susanna to faint like a
15th-century Virgin?
</P>
<P>
   To explain, he cited Erving Goffman, a sociologist who analyzed
human behavior as play-acting. People are constantly imitating
things they have seen before. For example, the hysterics in
19th-century France treated by Jean-Martin Charcot, Miller said,
conformed their hysteria to the standards of theater. So isn't it
possible that Susanna would have ``deliberately fainted based on
what she had seen in paintings''?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the arts,'' he said, ``people are constantly looting the
rubbish heaps of history. The more educated you are, the more you
get.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   During a break someone walked by Miller's seat, coughed
theatrically and dropped something at his feet. It was a bag of
caramel apple pops, which he sucked throughout the rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   As the next act began, Miller was tickled that the second Levine
said ``Shhh!'' the theater went quiet. ``Look at the speed with
which everyone shut up.'' The set was the Countess' sunny white
room. Outside, you could see a woman sweeping. ``There's always a
world outside,'' said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Opera, Miller suggested, can be seen as a series of frames.
First there are the frames within the plot. In Figaro, Susanna is
between two frames, betrothal and marriage. ``The Count hopes he
can exert the right of the feudal baron to have access to her on
her wedding night.'' He wants to catch her between frames.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the fictional frame around every piece of theater.
Renee Fleming and Bryn Terfel are singing. That's a fact. But from
the audience's point of view, it is the Countess and Figaro and
they are talking, not singing. That's the fictional frame, and
everyone understands the difference. For example, he said, if
Othello throttles Desdemona in the play, that's fine; if the actor
throttles the actress in actuality, he has clearly made ``a
category mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller kept taking different seats in the theater, slouching and
smiling. He watched as the Countess tied a blindfold around the
eyes of Cherubino, played by Susanne Mentzer, then he identified
the reference: Titian's painting ``Venus Blinding Cupid.'' He
watched Susanna and the Countess do a late-20th-century high-five
when they deceived the Count. He walked up to the stage to
scrutinize the drunk gardener, Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got it!'' Miller crowed: ``That thing that drunks do _
intensely, seriously addressing an audience that is not in front of
him.'' Miller ticked off the three traits of a drunk: ``You walk
like you're on a cross-channel steamer and attribute your movement
to the steamer rather than to yourself.'' He demonstrated in the
aisle. ``You have an inability to distinguish the animate from the
inanimate,'' he said, touching the chair and the reporter with
equal pressure, ``and you talk to the knot of the other person's
tie.'' There was no tie to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a passion for minute behaviors. There is a whole
fluster of stuff, subintentional behavior, which lies between the
things people claim as their own (like bringing a glass to their
lips) and the things they don't (like gastrointestinal
movements).'' For example, he said, ``I move my tongue around the
bottom of my mouth.'' And Rachel, he said, pointing toward his wife
of 42 years, who was a doctor herself, ``twists her ear lobe when
she's talking.'' He patted her head affectionately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the job of a director is reminding people of things
they've known all along and getting them to forget the things they
should never have known _ namely operatic kitsch,'' he said. ``Too
many opera directors are like puppet masters.'' They try to govern
the actors' every move.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to Noam Chomsky's generative grammar for help. ``A
child has the innate ability to detect which sounds are
linguistic.'' It's the same with acting. ``I give some suggestions,
but it should be filled with spontaneity.''
</P>
<P>
   During the third act, Miller watched from the sixth row,
mimicking Susanna's hand gestures and trying, as if he were a
puppeteer after all, to make her move the way he wanted. And when
the Count, played by Dwayne Croft, kneeled by Susanna's chair,
Miller got down on his knees and whispered, ``Get your hand up
there. Get your hand up there,'' meaning up her dress. At last, the
Count complied.
</P>
<P>
   That taken care of, Miller glanced at the edge of the stage. He
was watching a neglected servant eavesdropping outside the door,
beyond the main action. ``I love the edges of things. I love
frames, doorways, apertures,'' he said, finally pinpointing
something that linked his off-center humor, his attraction to
mirrors and reflections, his fascination with minute movements, and
his interest in a minor character no one else was watching:
``There's no real center to life. It's all where you see it from.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Sticking to Britain's official hands-off policy in the
Augusto Pinochet case, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday that
he did not even expect to be consulted about it, and Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook assured his Chilean counterpart that any
decisions would be made free of political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw, the British law enforcement minister
responsible for deciding whether or not to go forward with a
Spanish petition seeking the former Chilean dictator's extradition,
obtained the extra time Friday that he had sought to make his
decision. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham
Parkinson postponed the hearing nine days until Dec. 11 and said he
expected Pinochet to appear in court then.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish courts are seeking the extradition of the 83-year-old
general to Madrid to stand trial on charges of genocide, terrorism
and torture in the murders and ``disappearances'' of 3,178 people.
He was arrested in London on Oct. 16 and later lost a legal effort
in the House of Lords, England's highest court, to be declared
immune to arrest because of his status as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said Jose Miguel Insulza, Chile's foreign minister, had
communicated his government's ``strong view'' that Pinochet should
be permitted to return home immediately. Cook said he had replied
that the British government could not possibly interfere in what
was a purely judicial matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that the next stage of the extradition process
involved a decision by the home secretary acting independently and
that this was not a matter for collective ministerial decision,''
Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said the one-hour meeting had been friendly and that he
assured the Chilean that ``neither the original arrest nor
subsequent steps had been politically motivated.'' Later Insulza
visited 10 Downing Street where he met officials, but not the prime
minister, and left a letter that a spokesman said would be passed
on to the Home Office.
</P>
<P>
   Straw has said he would not be seeing any national delegations
or representatives of interest groups in deciding whether or not to
issue the so-called authority to proceed, but that he would
consider arguments in writing. He has made no comment on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, 10 Downing Street confirmed that neither Blair
nor other Cabinet colleagues would be involved in the decision by
Straw, who is acting in a ``quasijudicial'' capacity. The spokesman
for Blair said Straw ``will not be seeking the views of Cabinet
colleagues,'' and added, ``The prime minister does not expect to be
consulted on this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is at Grovelands Priory Hospital in North London
recovering from spinal surgery seven weeks ago. His doctors have
said he is able to leave the hospital and he is expected to be
moved into a house being rented by friends in days.
</P>
<P>
   Insulza flew here Friday amid growing expressions of concern
from public figures and businessmen that the Pinochet case could
damage British-Chilean relations and trade and destabilize
democracy in Chile. The vice chairman of the British-Chilean
Chamber of Commerce in Santiago wrote a letter to The Times of
London, published Friday, that said the British government should
be ``pragmatic in its relationships with its trading partners.'' He
concluded, ``The government does not have a mandate to play Robin
Hood to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Figures issued by the British-Chilean Chamber of Commerce based
here show that Chile earns nearly twice as much as Britain _ $656
million compared with $351 million _ from trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Fears have been expressed about consumer boycotts of British
goods in Chile, and there has already been one snub in the area of
military purchases, which often brought Pinochet to Britain in
recent years. After his arrest, two Chilean admirals canceled their
procurement visit connected to a multimillion dollar deal involving
the purchase of three navy frigates.
</P>
<P>
   Greater possibilities for business reprisals exist between Chile
and Spain, which invested $1.8 billion in Chile last year in power
sector takeovers, bank acquisitions and large construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
   There is anger among Pinochet supporters in Chile against Spain
because it was a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, who started the
extradition case against the ex-dictator. Garzon has been
conducting an inquiry into atrocities committed in the so-called
``dirty wars'' of the 1970s and 1980s in Latin America.

WHAT'S BEHIND THE GUSH OF DEALS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Mass.)   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Times are tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggles the mind to
accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to
either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to
do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed by low
petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration. Given
the exotic locales of the most promising, untapped fields, it seems
unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And with West Texas
crude trading at around $12 a barrel, it seems a safe bet oil that
won't be selling for $100 a barrel by the turn of the century _ a
price some analysts in the early 1980s were predicting it would
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly
and a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, Mass.,
consulting firm, spent some time late last week talking about
Mobil, Exxon and the changing dynamics of the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)There is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of
an Exxon-Mobil deal. Do you see any problems?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let me say right off that I don't think this is a done deal.
I think it is far from that. But if it were to happen, I don't see
many problems.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is
little or no overlap with the company you are merging with.
Exxon-Mobil comes close.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue is competition in local markets. The only
possible problem area there is on the West Coast, but both
companies are pretty small players there.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention, it
will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly
toward either the Clinton administration's or the European Union's
positions on global warming. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why are you skeptical about the deal?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, Mobil has been trying to get bigger. They had talks
with Amoco. They wanted to buy Conoco.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief
executive, fits into this. That could be an impediment to an
agreement, because in a merger I don't think he has a place, and he
has been a very strong leader.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Mobil is the country's second-biggest oil company,
behind Exxon. Why do they need to get bigger?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the first decade of the next century, the really big
exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only
companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the
game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. Companies of Mobil's size
are probably marginal players. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon
by the downturn in prices.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration and production
expenditures rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. But Mobil's
expenditures were much more sensitive to price elasticities of oil
than Exxon's. They were pushing the envelope, and when prices fell
they had to cut back. Exxon has tried to build a very large
presence systematically, without paying much attention to
month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices.
They are brutally efficient. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil
prices would stay soft for nearly a decade. Do you agree?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You know, every time I see forecasts that go out that far I
want to go out and buy stock in oil companies. I think we are going
to see low oil prices for six months to a year. It is conceivable
we could go into the next century with oil at $5 a barrel,
depending on what happens to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction
in investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction
in supply coming out of non-OPEC countries. That will strengthen
the hands of the OPEC countries. And when the Asian economies start
growing again that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices, say
$20 a barrel, in the next 18 months. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)The number of oil companies is going to shrink in
coming years, regardless, isn't it?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We are probably heading toward a world in which there are no
more than five or six big oil companies, possibly eight. There is
really no precedent for having as many big players as we have in
the oil business in this modern society. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you think oil stocks are a good investment?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but
it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money
over the next 9 to 12 months. And it is an area where investors
need to be careful, because in that period there will be a good
deal of consolidation among smaller companies.

<P>
   ROME _ For Roman Catholics, the year 2000 offers early
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II announced Friday that throughout the
millennium celebration, penitents who do a charitable deed or give
up cigarettes or alcohol for a day can earn an ``indulgence'' that
will eliminate time in purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences are an ancient form of church-granted amnesty that
releases penitents from certain forms of punishment in this life or
the next.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval church sold indulgences, a practice that drove
Martin Luther to rebel, leading to the Reformation. They remain a
source of theological debate between Protestants and Catholics, and
since Vatican II, the Roman Catholic Church has played down their
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal Catholics are embarrassed by a practice that seems
to offer such a simplistic shortcut to salvation. But church
officials emphasize that indulgences are linked to a sincere
repentance and are not a one-day expedient.
</P>
<P>
   By restoring indulgences to so prominent a position, the pope is
making penitence a theme of the millennium celebration. He is also
reassuring conservatives in the church. But by broadening the ways
believers can earn an indulgence, the pope is also trying to imbue
indulgences with some of the ecumenical spirit he wants to give the
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In a papal bull titled ``Incarnationis Mysterium'' (The Mystery
of the Incarnation) that will be formally issued on Sunday, John
Paul formally proclaimed the year 2000 a Holy Year, and issued
edicts that in many ways serve as a practical guide to spiritual
salvation during the period. He decreed that the jubilee would
begin on Christmas Day 1999 and end on the Feast of the Epiphany,
Jan. 6, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the papal document dealt with collective penitence. The
pope asked Catholics to seek forgiveness for past historical errors
during the Jubilee. He also asked rich nations to ease or
substantially eliminate Third World debt.
</P>
<P>
   The pope said individual sinners would be granted ``plenary
indulgences,'' a full pardon for sins as opposed to a shortening of
the time spent in purgatory. In Catholic theology, souls in
purgatory are purifying themselves before their entry into heaven.
He included personal acts of penitence or local charity work as a
way of earning an indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the period, believers will be offered a wider
selection of ways to receive a plenary indulgence. They may follow
tradition and attend a mass in one of several designated churches
and perform such devotions as the rosary or the stations of the
cross. Or, an appendix to the pope's letter explains, they may
visit the sick, the imprisoned or the handicapped, or give to the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may choose an act of private sacrifice. As the appendix,
signed by Cardinal William Baum, a top Vatican official, explained,
``This would include abstaining for at least one whole day from
unnecessary consumption (e.g. from smoking, or alcohol, or
fasting.'') The text points out that sinners must also fulfill the
``usual spiritual and sacramental conditions'' and say the ``usual
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Crescenzio Sepe, a top official in the Vatican's
committee of the Great Jubilee of the year 2000, said, ``One could
be tempted to think `today I won't smoke or I won't drink wine.
I'll get a plenary indulgence and go to paradise.' '' That, he said
would be wrong. ``That would not be the spirit of an indulgence,
that would be off-beam, like returning to the thinking of the
Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences are not one-day expedients, Sepe said, but he did
not make light of brief sacrifices. ``It's not so easy for some to
give up smoking for a day,'' he said pensively. ``It might be
easier to visit a prison inmate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pope's decision to expand the use of indulgences during the
millennium celebration is not entirely surprising. In 1985, the
pope revealed his respect for the practice by allowing Catholics to
receive indulgences via television.
</P>
<P>
   Believers who followed a church service where an indulgence was
granted on television or radio could be included _ as long as they
fulfilled the same conditions as those physically present for the
service, including confession, communion and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But indulgences, which began in early Christian times, have not
always been viewed favorably. In the 16th century, Pope Julius II
offered indulgences in exchange for contributions to build St.
Peter's Basilica in Rome. Martin Luther protested, and was
excommunicated in 1521.
</P>
<P>
   The Church later banned the sale of indulgences, but the Vatican
reaffirmed their religious importance at the Council of Trent in
1563. In 1968, Pope Paul VI also elaborated on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Including indulgences in the 2000 Jubilee ``could not be
avoided,'' said the Rev. Jared Wicks, a theologian at the Gregorian
University in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative Catholics would find it intolerable that, for
ecumenical considerations, the Church put into the closet a
practice affirmed by the Council of Trent.'' Wicks added with a
laugh, ``And John Paul II is not one to do anything like that.''

GROWTH FUND MANAGER CONCENTRATING ON EUROPE

 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Howard Moss enrolled at the University of Liverpool
in 1966, the Beatles had left town, moving out into the big wide
world.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Moss, manager of the $1.23-billion Harbor
International Growth fund, eventually did too _ alas, without ever
seeing the band perform. (His student residence was on Penny Lane,
the title of his favorite Beatles tune, and he calls himself ``a
huge fan.'') Today, he works from an office in Fort Myers, Fla.,
for Jennison Capital Associates, a New York money manager that is
subadviser of the fund for Harbor Capital Advisors of Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a relatively small world these days for Moss, 50.
About the only place he finds the sort of stocks he likes to buy is
in Europe, where about 95 percent of the fund's assets are
invested. The fund is also concentrated in its number of stocks _
just 24 in the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Using a bottom-up approach to investing based on corporate
fundamentals, he likes well-managed mid- to large-capitalization
companies with long-term annual earnings growth of at least 15
percent and forward price-to-earnings ratios below that rate. That
kind of growth is hard to find in rocky economic landscapes like
Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   His circumspect view may well have sharpened Moss' performance
this year. The fund has achieved a return of 14.3 percent through
Nov. 20 _ notably north of the 8.4 percent for its better-known,
value-oriented sister fund, Harbor International, and the 8.3
percent average for its peer group of foreign stock funds,
according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
Over three years, Harbor International Growth has tallied an
average annual return of 18.5 percent vs. 16.2 percent for the
sister fund and 9.2 percent for the peer group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as much as 14 percent of the portfolio was in Hong Kong
real estate and bank stocks. Moss reduced those holdings to zero by
last summer, though he acknowledged that the Asian crisis still
hurt the fund's otherwise stellar returns.
</P>
<P>
   Asian companies outside Hong Kong don't tempt him. ``With the
debacle of currency devaluations and falls in the stock market, the
companies we used to follow in places like the Philippines and
Thailand, specifically, are no longer viable, in that their market
capitalizations are too low for us to become interested,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Japan, companies like Sony, Matsushita Electric
Industrial and Hitachi ``have unfortunately become cyclical,'' in
part because of slowing consumer spending there, he said. ``They
are no longer secular growth companies on which one can rely'' for
consistent earnings growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how is Moss playing Europe? While he doesn't see a recession
there, he expects economic growth to slow to 1.5 to 2 percent
annually over the next 12 to 18 months, from his estimate of 2.3 to
3 percent for this year. As a result, earnings in cyclical sectors
like chemicals, steel and automaking are likely to slump, while
well-managed noncyclicals _ the kind he prefers, in any case _
should do much better. That points to drug, telephone and bank
companies as outperformers. He expects European economic growth
``to pick up from the middle of 2000 going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For companies that can expand, he said, the elimination of
economic borders in the European Union offers huge opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the individual company point of view, this will become
the United States of Europe,'' he said. ``So you will see the
growth of new, pan-European companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that many of those companies would be based in
southern Europe, where, after decades of high inflation and high
interest rates, governments have adopted many of the disciplined
economic policies of their northern neighbors. About one-third of
his fund's assets are invested in southern Europe, mainly in banks
and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's biggest holding, at 6.4 percent of assets, is
Unicredito Italiano, a Milan-based bank previously named Credito
Italiano. Its chief executive, Alessandro Profumo, is expanding the
company, trimming costs and making it ``very
shareholder-friendly,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   He said earnings were likely to compound at more than 20 percent
a year, and that the share price, 9,597 lire on Friday, could
double by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   He started buying the stock last year at 3,400 lire.
</P>
<P>
   Another big position in southern Europe, at about 5 percent of
the fund's assets, is Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish telephone
company, which has about 85 percent of the conventional, fixed-line
business in Spain and 71 percent of the cellular market. Telefonica
also has major stakes in phone companies in Latin America, where
stock prices tumbled recently. But Moss said the growth potential
of the Latin American telephone industry made those holdings a good
long-term asset. He first bought Telefonica shares in 1994 at about
2,400 pesetas; they closed on Friday at 6,930 pesetas. He predicts
earnings growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next four to
five years and said share prices would tend to rise at the same
rate.
</P>
<P>
   One of International Growth's newest holdings is Sanofi, a
French pharmaceutical company, which Moss began buying at about 780
francs a share in late September. Last week, it closed at 1,049
francs. Sanofi has two new cardiovascular drugs _ Plavix, a blood
thinner, and Avapro, which treats high blood pressure _ that it is
marketing worldwide with Bristol-Myers Squibb. ``The sales have
literally exploded,'' Moss said. He forecasts earnings growth of up
to 25 percent annually for the next five years.

 &HT;    `Sport of Christmas' sets Atlantans on their mark
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No self-respecting shopper would stay at home today to
recuperate after Friday's spree. For the true marathoners, the
day-after Thanksgiving commotion was like a starting gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sport of Christmas,'' said Toni Cox, who was up at
3:30 a.m. Friday to start her retail relay, hitting Wal-Mart first,
then Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse and Sears. By 8 a.m., the
perky suburban Atlanta resident was well into her Southlake Mall
trip. ``If I can't find what I want today, I'll be back out
tomorrow and the day after that.''
</P>
<P>
   All over metro Atlanta, early-bird shoppers were on the hunt for
deals and one-time offerings. Donna Jones was at Southlake's Disney
Store at 5:20 a.m. to get a limited edition Winnie the Pooh Beanie
Baby. The first in a line of 200, Jones waited more than two hours
for the doors to open. ``This was my main mission today. It was
worth it,'' said Jones of her $6 purchase.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it by watching shoppers at Toys R Us run
across the parking lot before sunrise to snag doorbuster sales, but
analysts are predicting glum results for the ``big box'' toy
retailers this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very competitive this year,'' said John
Konarski, vice president of research for the International Council
of Shopping Centers, which released a sales trend report Friday
based on a survey of three dozen retail analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, analysts were more optimistic than last year about
holiday retail sales, Konarski said, but only 15 percent expected
individual toy retailers to have a strong year, partly because of
increased competition in the category from specialty retailers like
Zany Brainy and FAO Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discounters, in particular, are going to give the rest of
the stores a run for their money,'' said Konarski. Overall, the
surveyed analysts forecast a 4 percent increase in holiday sales
over last year. Computer and electronic retailers will have the
strongest sales, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   This year, department stores started their promotions earlier to
stretch out the selling season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales were better before Thanksgiving,'' confirmed Amy
Morgan, who was shopping at Cumberland Mall. Morgan said she used
to wait until the day after Thanksgiving to start her Christmas
shopping, but started earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said sales at factory outlets also will slide.
Nonetheless, some shoppers at Tanger Outlet Center in Locust Grove
on Friday said they preferred the less-hectic atmosphere. ``We've
been doing this the last couple of years,'' said Alice Wallace.
``We don't go to the mall. We come here because it's not as
crowded,'' said Wallace, who was helping her daughter, Shannon
Davis, arrange a trunk full of purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you were looking for this year's hot toys, braving the
crowds was necessary. Mall retailer Kay-Bee Toys had a brisk start
all over metro Atlanta as shoppers tried to get a shot at Furby,
the electronic, interactive animal-bird hybrid that's shaping up as
the craze toy of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at Kay-Bee in Gwinnett Place mall snapped up the
store's inventory of 80 Furbys moments after it opened at 6 a.m.
Shawn Caballero waited with sister-in-law Holly Judge for 90
minutes in a checkout line, Furby-less, to pay for consolation
toys. ``I'm glad I'm done, but I'll never do it again,'' Caballero
said.

TEXT OF PRESIDENT'S RESPONSES TO HOUSE JUDICIARY PANEL'S
QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDITORS NOTE: Some of the questions and answers below are slightly
out of order because President Clinton chose to cover several
questions with one response. This has been indicated where
appropriate.)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are President Clinton's answers to the 81
questions put to him by the House Judiciary Committee as part of
its impeachment investigation, as made public Friday by the White
House:
</P>
<P>
   Set forth below are answers to the questions that you have asked
me.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to repeat, at the outset, something that I have
said before about my approach to these proceedings. I have asked my
attorneys to participate actively, but the fact that there is a
legal defense to the various allegations cannot obscure the hard
truth, as I have said repeatedly, that my conduct was wrong. It was
also wrong to mislead people about what happened, and I deeply
regret that.
</P>
<P>
   For me, this long ago ceased to be primarily a legal or
political issue and became instead a painful personal one,
demanding atonement and daily work toward reconciliation and
restoration of trust with my family, my friends, my Administration
and the American people. I hope these answers will contribute to a
speedy and fair resolution of this matter.
</P>
<P>
   1. Do you admit or deny that you are the chief law-enforcement
officer of the United States of America?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The President is frequently referred to as the chief
law-enforcement officer, although nothing in the Constitution
specifically designates the President as such. Article II, Section
1 of the United States Constitution states that ``(t)he executive
power shall be vested in a President of the United States of
America,'' and the law-enforcement function is a component of the
executive power.
</P>
<P>
   2. Do you admit or deny that upon taking your oath of office
that you swore you would faithfully execute the office of President
of the United States, and would to the best of your ability,
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 2:
</P>
<P>
   At my Inaugurations in 1993 and 1997, I took the following oath:
``I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of
President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Do you admit or deny that, pursuant to Article II, Section 2
of the Constitution, you have a duty to ``take care that the laws
be faithfully executed?''
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Article II, Section 3 (not Section 2), of the Constitution
states that the President ``shall take care that the Laws be
faithfully executed,'' and that is a Presidential obligation.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you admit or deny that you are a member of the bar and
officer of the court of a state of the United States, subject to
the rules of professional responsibility and ethics applicable to
the bar of that state?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 4:
</P>
<P>
   I have an active license to practice law (inactive for
continuing legal education purposes) issued by the Supreme Court of
Arkansas. The license, No. 73017, was issued in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   5. Do you admit or deny that you took an oath in which you swore
or affirmed to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, in a deposition conducted as part of a judicial proceeding
in the case of Jones v. Clinton on January 17, 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 5:
</P>
<P>
   I took an oath to tell the truth on January 17, 1998, before my
deposition in the Jones v. Clinton case. While I do not recall the
precise wording of that oath, as I previously stated in my grand
jury testimony on August 17, 1998, in taking the oath ``I believed
then that I had to answer the questions truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Do you admit or deny that you took an oath in which you swore
or affirmed to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, before a grand jury empanelled as part of a judicial
proceeding by the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia Circuit on August 17, 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 6:
</P>
<P>
   As the August 17, 1998, videotape reflects, I was asked ``Do you
solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in this
matter will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?,'' and I answered, ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 7, 1997, you
received a letter composed by Monica Lewinsky in which she
expressed dissatisfaction with her search for a job in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 7:
</P>
<P>
   At some point I learned of Ms. Lewinsky's decision to seek
suitable employment in New York. I do not recall receiving a letter
in which she expressed dissatisfaction about her New York job
search. I understand Ms. Lewinsky has stated that she sent a note
indicating her decision to seek employment in New York, but I do
not believe she has said the note expressed dissatisfaction about
her search for a job there. App. at 822-23 (grand jury testimony of
Ms. Lewinsky).
</P>
<P>
   8. Do you admit or deny that you telephoned Monica Lewinsky
early in the morning on October 10, 1997, and offered to assist her
in finding a job in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 8:
</P>
<P>
   I understand that Ms. Lewinsky testified that I called her on
the 9th of October, 1997. App. at 823 (grand jury testimony of Ms.
Lewinsky). I do not recall that particular telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   9. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997, you
met with Monica Lewinsky in or about the Oval Office dining room?
</P>
<P>
   10. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997,
Monica Lewinsky furnished to you, in or about the Oval Office
dining room, a list of jobs in New York in which she was
interested?
</P>
<P>
   11. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997, you
suggested to Monica Lewinsky that Vernon Jordan may be able to
assist her in her job search?
</P>
<P>
   12. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997,
after meeting with Monica Lewinsky and discussing her search for a
job in New York, you telephoned Vernon Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 9. 10, 11 and 12:
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Ms. Lewinsky either discussed with me or gave me
a list of the kinds of jobs she was interested in, although I do
not know whether it was on Saturday, October 11, 1997. Records
included in the O.I.C. Referral indicate that Ms. Lewinsky visited
the White House on October 11, 1997, and I may have seen her on
that day.
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe I suggested to Ms. Lewinsky that Mr. Jordan
might be able to assist her in her job search, and I understand
that Ms. Lewinsky has stated that she asked me if Mr. Jordan could
assist her in finding a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   I speak to Mr. Jordan often, and I understand that records
included in the O.I.C. Referral indicate that he telephoned me
shortly after Ms. Lewinsky left the White House complex. I
understand that Mr. Jordan testified that he and I did not discuss
Ms. Lewinsky during that call.
</P>
<P>
   13. Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky
prior to December 17, 1997, a plan in which she would pretend to
bring you papers with a work-related purpose, when in fact such
papers had no work-related purpose, in order to conceal your
relationship?
</P>
<P>
   14. Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky
prior to December 17, 1997, that Betty Currie should be the one to
clear Ms. Lewinsky in to see you so that Ms. Lewinsky could say
that she was visiting with Ms. Currie instead of with you?
</P>
<P>
   15. Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky
prior to December 17, 1997, that if either of you were questioned
about the existence of your relationship you would deny its
existence?
</P>
<P>
   19. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 17, 1997, you
suggested to Monica Lewinsky that she could say to anyone inquiring
about her relationship with you that her visits to the Oval Office
were for the purpose of visiting with Betty Currie or to deliver
papers to you?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 13, 14, 15, and 19:
</P>
<P>
   I was asked essentially these same questions by O.I.C. lawyers.
I testified that Ms. Lewinsky and I ``may have talked about what to
do in a nonlegal context at some point in the past, but I have no
specific memory of that conversation.'' That continues to be my
recollection today _ that is, any such conversation was not in
connection with her status as a witness in the Jones v. Clinton
case.
</P>
<P>
   16. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 6, 1997, you
learned that Monica Lewinsky's name was on a witness list in the
case of Jones v. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 16:
</P>
<P>
   As I stated in my August 17th grand jury testimony, I believe
that I found out that Ms. Lewinsky's name was on a witness list in
the Jones v. Clinton case late in the afternoon on the 6th of
December, 1997. App, at 535.
</P>
<P>
   17. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 17, 1997, you
told Monica Lewinsky that her name was on the witness list in the
case of Jones v. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   18. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 17, 1997, you
suggested to Monica Lewinsky that the submission of an affidavit in
the case of Jones v. Clinton might suffice to prevent her from
having to testify personally in that case?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Requests Nos. 17 and 18:
</P>
<P>
   As I previously testified, I recall telephoning Ms. Lewinsky to
tell her Ms. Currie's brother had died, and that call was in the
middle of December. I do not recall other particulars of such a
call, including whether we discussed the fact that her name was on
the Jones v. Clinton witness list. As I stated in my August 17th
grand jury testimony in response to essentially the same questions,
it is quite possible that that happened. . . . I don't have any
memory of it, but I certainly wouldn't dispute that I might have
said that (she was on the witness list).''
</P>
<P>
   I recall that Ms. Lewinsky asked me at some time in December
whether she might be able to get out of testifying in the Jones v.
Clinton case because she knew nothing about Ms. Jones or the case.
I told her I believed other witnesses had executed affidavits, and
there was a chance they would not have to testify. As I stated in
my August 17th grand jury testimony, ``I felt strongly that... (Ms.
Lewinsky) could execute an affidavit that would be factually
truthful, that might get her out of having to testify.'' I never
asked or encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie in her affidavit, as Ms.
Lewinsky herself has confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   19. For the Response to Request No. 19, see Response to Request
No. 13 et al., supra.
</P>
<P>
   20. Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading
testimony under oath when you stated during your deposition in the
case of Jones v. Clinton on January 17, 1998, that you did not know
if Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in that case?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 20:
</P>
<P>
   It is evident from my testimony on pages 69 to 70 of the
deposition that I did know on January 17, 1998, that Ms. Lewinsky
had been subpoenaed in the Jones v. Clinton case. Ms. Jones'
lawyer's question, ``Did you talk to Mr. Lindsey about what action,
if any, should be taken as a result of her being served with a
subpoena?'', and my response, ``No,'' j. at 70, reflected my
understanding that Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed. That testimony
was not false and misleading.
</P>
<P>
   21. Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading
testimony under oath when you stated before the grand jury on
August 17, 1998, that you did know prior to January 17, 1998, that
Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in the case of Jones
v. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 21:
</P>
<P>
   As my testimony on January 17 reflected, and as I testified on
August 17, 1998, I knew prior to January 17, 1998, that Ms.
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in Jones v. Clinton. App.
at 487. That testimony was not false and misleading.
</P>
<P>
   22. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you
had a discussion with Monica Lewinsky at the White House regarding
her moving to New York?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 22:
</P>
<P>
   When I met with Ms. Lewinsky on December 28, 1997, I knew she
was planning to move to New York, and we discussed her move.
</P>
<P>
   23. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you
had a discussion with Monica Lewinsky at the White House in which
you suggested to her that she move to New York soon because by
moving to New York, the lawyers representing Paula Jones in the
case of Jones v. Clinton may not contact her?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky had decided to move to New York well before the end
of December 1997. By December 28, Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed.
I did not suggest that she could avoid testifying in the Jones v.
Clinton case by moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
   24. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you
had a discussion with Monica Lewinsky at the White House regarding
gifts you had given to Ms. Lewinsky that were subpoenaed in the
case of Jones v. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   25. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you
expressed concern to Monica Lewinsky about a hatpin you had given
to her as a gift which had been subpoenaed in the case of Jones v.
Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 24 and 25:
</P>
<P>
   As I told the grand jury, ``Ms. Lewinsky said something to me
like, what if they ask me about the gifts you've given me,'' but I
do not know whether that conversation occurred on December 28,
1997, or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever this conversation occurred, I testified, I told her
``that if they asked her for gifts, she'd have to give them
whatever she had. ...'' I simply was not concerned about the fact
that I had given her gifts. Indeed, I gave her additional gifts on
December 28, 1997. I also told the grand jury that I do not recall
Ms. Lewinsky telling me that the subpoena specifically called for a
hat pin that I had given her.
</P>
<P>
   26. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you
discussed with Betty Currie gifts previously given by you to Monica
Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   27. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1998, you
requested, instructed, suggested to or otherwise discussed with
Betty Currie that she take possession of gifts previously given to
Monica Lewinsky by you?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 26 and 27:
</P>
<P>
   I do not recall any conversation with Ms. Currie on or about
December 28, 1997, about gifts I had previously given to Ms.
Lewinsky. I never told Ms. Currie to take possession of gifts I had
given Ms. Lewinsky; I understand Ms. Currie has stated that Ms.
Lewinsky called Ms. Currie to ask her to hold a box.
</P>
<P>
   28. Do you admit or deny that you had a telephone conversation
on January 6, 1998, with Vernon Jordan during which you discussed
Monica Lewinsky's affidavit, yet to be filed, in the case of Jones
v. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 28:
</P>
<P>
   White House records included in the O.I.C. Referral reflect that
I spoke to Mr. Jordan on January 6, 1998. I do not recall whether
we discussed Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit during a telephone call on
that date.
</P>
<P>
   29. Do you admit or deny that you had knowledge of the fact that
Monica Lewinsky executed for filing an affidavit in the case of
Jones v. Clinton on January 7, 1998?
</P>
<P>
   30. Do you admit or deny that on or about January 7, 1998, you
had a discussion with Vernon Jordan in which he mentioned that
Monica Lewinsky executed for filing an affidavit in the case of
Jones v. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 29 and 30:
</P>
<P>
   As I testified to the grand jury, ``I believe that (Mr. Jordan)
did notify us when she signed her affidavit. While I do not recall
the timing, as I told the grand jury, I have no reason to doubt Mr.
Jordan's statement that he notified me about the affidavit around
January 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   31. Do you admit or deny that on or about January 7, 1998, you
had a discussion with Vernon Jordan in which he mentioned that he
was assisting Monica Lewinsky in finding a job in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 31:
</P>
<P>
   I told the grand jury that I was aware that Mr. Jordan was
assisting Ms. Lewinsky in her job search in connection with her
move to New York. I have no recollection as to whether Mr. Jordan
discussed it with me on or about January 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   32. Do you admit or deny that you viewed a copy of the affidavit
executed by Monica Lewinsky on January 7, 1998, in the case of
Jones v. Clinton, prior to your deposition in that case?
</P>
<P>
   33. Do you admit or deny that you had knowledge that your
counsel viewed a copy of the affidavit executed by Monica Lewinsky
on January 7, 1998, in the case of Jones v. Clinton, prior to your
deposition in that case?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 32 and 33:
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe I saw this affidavit before my deposition,
although I cannot be absolutely sure. The record indicates that my
counsel had seen the affidavit at some time prior to the
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   34. Do you admit or deny that you had knowledge that any facts
or assertions contained in the affidavit executed by Monica
Lewinsky on January 7, 1998, in the case of Jones v. Clinton were
not true?
</P>
<P>
   40. Do you admit or deny that during your deposition in the case
of Jones v. Clinton on January 17, 1998, you affirmed that the
facts or assertions stated in the affidavit executed by Monica
Lewinsky on January 7, 1998, were true?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 34 and 40:
</P>
<P>
   I was asked at my deposition in January about two paragraphs of
Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit. With respect to Paragraph 6, 1 explained
the extent to which I was able to attest to its accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to Paragraph 8, I stated in my deposition that it
was true. In my August 17th grand jury testimony, I sought to
explain the basis for that deposition answer: ``I believe at the
time that she filled out this affidavit, if she believed that the
definition of sexual relationship was two people having
intercourse, then this is accurate.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   35. Do you admit or deny that you viewed a copy of the affidavit
executed by Monica Lewinsky on January 7, 1998, in the case of
Jones v. Clinton, at your deposition in that case on January 17,
1998?
</P>
<P>
   36. Do you admit or deny that you had knowledge that your
counsel viewed a copy of the affidavit executed by Monica Lewinsky
on January 7, 1998, in the case of Jones v. Clinton, at your
deposition in that case on January 17, 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 35 and 36:
</P>
<P>
   I know that Mr. Bennett saw Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit during the
deposition because he read portions of it aloud at the deposition.
I do not recall whether I saw a copy of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit
during the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   37. Do you admit or deny that on or about January 9, 1998, you
received a message from Vernon Jordan indicating that Monica
Lewinsky had received a job offer in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 37:
</P>
<P>
   At some time, I learned that Ms. Lewinsky had received a job
offer in New York. However, I do not recall whether I first learned
it in a message from Mr. Jordan or whether I learned it on that
date.
</P>
<P>
   38. Do you admit or deny that between January 9, 1998, and
January 15, 1998, you had a conversation with Erskine Bowles in the
Oval Office in which you stated that Monica Lewinsky received a job
offer and had listed John Hilley as a reference?
</P>
<P>
   39. Do you admit or deny that you asked Erskine Bowles if he
would ask John Hilley to give Ms. Lewinsky a positive job
recommendation?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request Nos. 38 and 39:
</P>
<P>
   As I testified to the grand jury, I recall at some point talking
to Mr. Bowles ``about whether Monica Lewinsky could get a
recommendation that was not negative from the Legislative Affairs
Office,'' or that ``was at least neutral,'' although I am not
certain of the date of the conversation. To suggest that I told Mr.
Bowles that Ms. Lewinsky had received a job offer and had listed
John Hilley as a reference is, as I testified, a ``little bit''
inconsistent with my memory. It is possible, as I also indicated,
that she had identified Mr. Hilley as her supervisor on her resume
and in that respect had already listed him as a reference.

<P>
   40. For the Response to Request No. 40, see Response to Request
No. 34, et al., supra.

gifts to Monica Lewinsky at any time in the past?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   b. A hatpin
</P>
<P>
   c. A large ``Black Dog'' canvas bag
</P>
<P>
   d. A large ``Rockettes'' blanket
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   k. A shamrock pin
</P>
<P>
   l. An Annie Lennox compact disc
</P>
<P>
   m. Davidoff cigars
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 41:
</P>
<P>
   In my deposition in the Jones case, I testified that I
``certainly ... could have'' given Ms. Lewinsky a hat pin and that
I gave her ``something'' from the Black Dog. In my grand jury
testimony, I indicated that in late December 1997, I gave Ms.
Lewinsky a Canadian marble bear's head carving, a Rockettes
blanket, some kind of pin, and a bag (perhaps from the Black Dog)
to hold these objects. I also stated that I might have given her
such gifts as a box of candy and sunglasses, although I did not
recall doing so, and I specifically testified that I had given Ms.
Lewinsky gifts on other occasions. I do not remember giving her the
other gifts listed in Question 41, although I might have. As I have
previously testified, I receive a very large number of gifts from
many different people, sometimes several at a time. I also give a
very large number of gifts. I gave Ms. Lewinsky gifts, some of
which I remember and some of which I do not.
</P>
<P>
   42. Do you admit or deny that when asked on January 17, 1998, in
your deposition in the case of Jones v. Clinton if you had ever
given gifts to Monica Lewinsky, you stated that you did not recall,
even though you actually had knowledge of giving her gifts in
addition to gifts from the ``Black Dog?''
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 42:
</P>
<P>
   In my grand jury testimony, I was asked about this same
statement. I explained that my full response was ``I don't recall.
Do you know what they were?'' By that answer, I did not mean to
suggest that I did not recall giving gifts; rather, I meant that I
did not recall what the gifts were, and I asked for reminders.
</P>
<P>
   43. Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading
testimony under oath in your deposition in the case of Jones v.
Clinton when you responded ``once or twice'' to the question ``has
Monica Lewinsky ever given you any gifts?''
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 43:
</P>
<P>
   My testimony was not false and misleading. As I have testified
previously, I give and receive numerous gifts. Before my January
17, 1998, deposition, I had not focused on the precise number of
gifts Ms. Lewinsky had given me. My deposition testimony made clear
that Ms. Lewinsky had given me gifts; at the deposition, I recalled
``a book or two'' and a tie. At the time, those were the gifts I
recalled. In response to O.I.C. inquiries, after I had had a chance
to search my memory and refresh my recollection, I was able to be
more responsive. However, as my counsel have informed the O.I.C.,
in light of the very large number of gifts I receive, there might
still be gifts from Ms. Lewinsky that I have not identified.
</P>
<P>
   44. Do you admit or deny that on January 17, 1998, at or about
5:38 P.M., after the conclusion of your deposition in the case of
Jones v. Clinton, you telephoned Vernon Jordan at his home?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 44:
</P>
<P>
   I speak to Mr. Jordan frequently, so I cannot remember specific
times and dates. According to White House records included in the
O.I.C. Referral, I telephoned Mr. Jordan's residence on January 17,
1998, at or about 5:38 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   45. Do you admit or deny that on January 17, 1998, at or about

   According to White House records included in the O.I.C.
Referral, I placed a telephone call to Ms. Currie at her residence
at 7:02 P.M. and spoke to her at or about 7:13 P.M. I recall that

the following day. According to White House records included in the
O.I.C. Referral, I telephoned Mr. Jordan's office on January 17,
1998, at or about 7:02 P.M.

   48. Do you admit or deny that on January 18, 1998, at or about
6:11 A.M., you learned of the existence of tapes of conversations
between Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp recorded by Linda Tripp?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 48:
</P>
<P>
   I did not know on January 18, 1998 that tapes existed of
conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp recorded by Ms.
Tripp. At some point on Sunday, January 18, 1998, I knew about the
Drudge Report. I understand that, while the report talked about
tapes of phone conversations, it did not identify Ms. Lewinsky by
name and did not mention Ms. Tripp at all. The report did not state
who the parties to the conversations were or who taped the
conversations.

   Response to Request No. 52:
</P>
<P>
   When I met with Ms. Currie, I believe that I asked her certain
questions, in an effort to get as much information as quickly as I
could, and made certain statements, although I do not remember
exactly what I said. See App. at 508.
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, I learned that the Office of Independent
Counsel was involved and that Ms. Currie was going to have to
testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   After learning this, I stated in my grand jury testimony, I told
Ms. Currie, ``Just relax, go in there and tell the truth.'' App. at
591.

<P>
   53. Do you admit or deny that you had a conversation with Betty
Currie within several days of January 18, 1998, in which you made

   I previously told the grand jury that, ``I don't know that I''
had another conversation with Ms. Currie within several days of
January 18, 1998, in which I made statements similar to those
quoted above. ``I remember having this (conversation) one time.''
App. at 592. I further explained, ``I do not remember how many
times I talked to Betty Currie or when. I don't. I can't possibly
remember that. I do remember, when I first heard about this story
breaking, trying to ascertain what the facts were, trying to
ascertain what Betty's perception was. I remember that I was highly
agitated, understandably. I think.'' App. at 593.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that Ms. Currie has said a second conversation
occurred the next day that I was in the White House (when she was),
Supp. at 535-36, which would have been Tuesday, January 20, before

   Responses to Requests Nos. 62-68:
</P>
<P>
   As I have previously acknowledged, I did not want my family,
friends, or colleagues to know the full nature of my relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. In the days following the January 21, 1998,
Washington Post article, I misled people about this relationship. I
have repeatedly apologized for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   69. Do you admit or deny that on or about January 21, 1998, you
and Richard (Dick) Morris discussed the possibility of
commissioning a poll to determine public opinion following The
Washington Post story regarding the Monica Lewinsky matter?
</P>
<P>
   70. Do you admit or deny that you had a later conversation with
Richard (Dick) Morris in which he stated that the polling results
regarding the Monica Lewinsky matter suggested that the American
people would forgive you for adultery but not for perjury or
obstruction of justice?
</P>
<P>
   71. Do you admit or deny that you responded to Richard (Dick)
Morris's explanation of these polling results by making a statement
similar to the following: ``(w)ell, we just have to win, then''?

   Response to Request Nos. 69, 70 and 71:
</P>
<P>
   At some point after the O.I.C. investigation became public, Dick
Morris volunteered to conduct a poll on the charges reported in the
press. He later called back. What I recall is that he said the
public was most concerned about obstruction of justice or
subornation of perjury. I do not recall saying, ``Well, we just
have to win then.''

you are or could be involved?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 72:
</P>
<P>
   I cannot respond to this inquiry because of the vagueness of its
terms (``indirect,'' ``potential,'' ``could be involved''). To the
extent it may be interpreted to apply to individuals assisting
counsel, please see my responses to Request Nos. 73-75. To the
extent the inquiry addresses specific individuals, as in Request
Nos. 73-75, I have responded and stand ready to respond to any
other specific inquiries.

contacted or employed to make contact with or gather information
about witnesses or potential witnesses in any judicial proceeding
related to any matter in which you are or could be involved?

   Response to Request No. 73:
</P>
<P>
   My counsel stated publicly on February 24, 1998, that Mr. Terry
Lenzner and his firm have been retained since April 1994 by two
private law firms that represent me. It is commonplace for legal
counsel to retain such firms to perform legal and appropriate tasks
to assist in the defense of clients. See also Response to No. 72.

   74. Do you admit or deny having knowledge that Jack Palladino
was contacted or employed to make contact with or gather
information about witnesses or potential witnesses in any judicial
proceeding related to any matter in which you are or could be
involved?
</P>
<P>
   My understanding is that during the 1992 Presidential campaign,
Mr. Jack Palladino was retained to assist legal counsel for me and
the campaign on a variety of matters arising during the campaign.
See Response to No. 72.
</P>
<P>
   75. Do you admit or deny having knowledge that Betsy Wright was
contacted or employed to make contact with or gather information
about witnesses or potential witnesses in any judicial proceeding
related to any matter in which you are or could be involved?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 75:
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betsey Wright was my longtime chief of staff when I was
Governor of Arkansas, and she remains a good friend and trusted
adviser. Because of her great knowledge of Arkansas, from time to
time my legal counsel and I have consulted with her on a wide range
of matters. See also Response to No. 72.
</P>
<P>
   76. Do you admit or deny that you made false and misleading
public statements in response to questions asked on or about
January 21, 1998, in an interview with ``Roll Call,'' when you
stated ``Well, let me say, the relationship was not improper, and I
think that's important enough to say. But because the investigation
is going on and because I don't know what is out _ what's going to
be asked of me, I think I need to cooperate, answer the questions,
but I think it's important for me to make it clear what is not. And
then, at the appropriate time, I'll try to answer what is. But let
me answer _ it is not an improper relationship and I know what the
word means.''?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 76:
</P>
<P>
   The tape of this interview reflects that in fact I said: ``Well,
let me say the relationship's not improper and I think that's
important enough to say. . . .'' With that revision, the quoted
words accurately reflect my remarks. As I stated in Response to
Request Nos. 62 to 68, in the days following the January 21, 1998,
disclosures, I misled people about this relationship, for which I
have apologized.
</P>
<P>
   77. Do you admit or deny that you made false and misleading
public statements in response to questions asked on or about
January 21, 1998, in the Oval Office during a photo opportunity,
when you stated: ``Now, there are a lot of other questions that
are, I think, very legitimate. You have a right to ask them; you
and the American people have a right to get answers. We are working
very hard to comply and get all the requests for information up
here, and we will give you as many answers as we can, as soon as we
can, at the appropriate time, consistent with our obligation to
also cooperate with the investigations. And that's not a dodge,
that's really (what) I've _ I've talked with (our) people. I want
to do that. I'd like for you to have more rather than less, sooner
rather than later. So we'll work through it as quickly as we can
and get all those questions out there to you.''?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 77:
</P>
<P>
   I made this statement (as corrected), according to a transcript
of a January 22, 1998 photo opportunity in the Oval Office. This
statement was not false and misleading. It accurately represented
my thinking.
</P>
<P>
   78. Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Harry
Thomasson, prior to making public statements in response to
questions asked by the press in January, 1998, relating to your
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, what such statements should be
or how they should be communicated?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 78:
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Thomasson was a guest at the White House in January 1998,
and I recall his encouraging me to state my denial forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   79. Do you admit or deny that you made a false and misleading
public statement in response to a question asked on or about
January 26, 1998, when you stated ``But I want to say one thing to
the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say
this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky''?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 79:
</P>
<P>
   I made this statement on January 26, 1998, although not in
response to any question. In referring to ``sexual relations'', I
was referring to sexual intercourse. As I stated in Response to
Request Nos. 62 to 68, in the days following the January 21, 1998,
disclosures, answers like this misled people about this
relationship, for which I have apologized.
</P>
<P>
   80. Do you admit or deny that you made a false and misleading
public statement in response to a question asked on or about
January 26, 1998, when you stated ``I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time. Never?''
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 80:
</P>
<P>
   This statement was truthful: I did not tell Ms. Lewinsky to lie,
and I did not tell anybody to lie about my relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. I understand that Ms. Lewinsky also has stated that I
never asked or encouraged her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   81. Do you admit or deny that you directed or instructed Bruce
Lindsey, Sidney Blumenthal, Nancy Hernreich and Lanny Breuer to
invoke executive privilege before a grand jury empanelled as part
of a judicial proceeding by the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia Circuit in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Response to Request No. 81:
</P>
<P>
   On the recommendation of Charles Ruff, Counsel to the President,
I authorized Mr. Ruff to assert the Presidential communications
privilege (which is one aspect of executive privilege) with respect
to questions that might be asked of witnesses called to testify
before the grand jury to the extent that those questions sought
disclosure of matters protected by that privilege. Thereafter, I
understand that the Presidential communications privilege was
asserted as to certain questions asked of Sidney Blumenthal and
Nancy Hernreich. Further, I understand that, as to Mr. Blumenthal
and Ms. Hernreich, all claims of official privilege were
subsequently withdrawn and they testified fully on several
occasions before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Breuer testified at length before the grand
jury about a wide range of matters, but declined, on the advice of
the White House counsel, to answer certain questions that sought
disclosure of discussions that they had with me and my senior
advisers concerning, among other things, their legal advice as to
the assertion of executive privilege. White House counsel advised
Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Breuer that these communications were protected
by the attorney-client privilege, as well as executive privilege.
Mr. Lindsey also asserted my personal attorney-client privilege as
to certain questions relating to his role as an intermediary
between me and my personal counsel in the Jones v. Clinton case, a
privilege that was upheld by the Federal appeals court in the
District of Columbia.

MERGER EUPHORIA MOVES STOCKS UP IN LIGHT TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was new highs again for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes Friday as anticipation of a
new wave of mergers and a general rush by investors to join the
equity rebound pushed stocks up.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of
continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would
create the world's largest oil company. Internet and computer
stocks also rallied, helped in part by the announcement on Tuesday
of America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications in a
three-way deal involving Sun Microsystems. At the same time,
Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are scheduled to formally
announce their merger on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the merger euphoria is the
headline,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the
First Albany Corp. ``But the flow into mutual funds is also
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon rose 1 11/16, to 74], while Mobil jumped 7|, to 86.
Chevron, reflecting the bounce that other oil companies got from
the merger news, climbed 5\, to 85|.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Chevron, along with IBM, which rose 3\, to 170, were
the main drivers of the Dow Jones industrial average. It climbed
18.80 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,333.08. It now
stands just 41 points short of the record it set Monday and up 1.9
percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil, along with Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rose
3 13/16, to 128 1/16, were the power behind the S &AMP; P. It climbed
5.46 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,192.33, a new high,
the second of the week. It jumped 2.5 percent in the last five
trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, up 2 15/16, to 80; MCI Worldcom, up 1 11/16, to
62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, up 4|, to 80], and Microsoft pushed the
Nasdaq index to its first new high since July 20. The
technology-heavy index finished 31.23 points, or 1.57 percent,
higher, at 2,016.44. It was up 4.6 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Friday's gains will stick will not be known before
Monday. It was a shortened trading session, with the New York Stock
Exchange closing at 1 p.m., and trading volume, at 257 million
shares, made it the lightest day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, which also closed early because of the
Thanksgiving weekend, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose
11/32, to 101 12/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, fell to 5.16 percent from 5.18 percent on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term and short-term yields all slipped lower this week
despite new economic data that indicated the economy was stronger
in the third quarter than expected and seems to be moving along at
a good pace in the current quarter. This small recovery in the face
of stronger growth is probably because new inflation numbers show
that prices are in check and analysts are still forecasting that
the economy will begin to slow down next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts have noted during the eight-week stock market
rally, in which the Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, that
investors were buying again even though major financial problems
around the world _ including a slumping Asia, a weakening Latin
America and a troubled Russia _ have not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he thought that investors, inspired by the Federal
Reserve's three interest rate cuts in two months and by the new
stimulus package in Japan, assume that these problems will be
solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are looking over the valley and they like what they
see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he worries that the financial crisis, which began in
Thailand in July 1997 and was intensified by the effective default
of Russia in August, will not go away quickly. ``It seems that in
every financial crisis, everybody gets the impression that the
storm has passed,'' Johnson said. ``But it is never that easy.''

COMMENTARY: MY TURKEY PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now there is truly something to be thankful for: We have all
survived Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, my family, at least, has survived Thanksgiving
with no casualties, except for the turkey. And even the turkey is,
in its indefatigable way, very much still with us. It languishes in
the refrigerator, headless, legless, wingless _ a true American
symbol, kind of like a bald eagle in triage. It is now midway
through its afterlife as sandwiches before its final leftovers are
plowed into the earth to help fertilize future Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   Only 27 days till Christmas _ but who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   I confess to having a problem with holidays. The problem began
early, when The Saturday Evening Post was still around, favoring
its subscribers with Norman Rockwell paintings of smiling, freshly
scrubbed families sitting around the table all expectantly focused
on Pops, or Grandpops (but never a potentially castrating aunt),
lifting a knife to carve the glowing Butterball. These pictures
were so alien to my childhood experience that I at first mistook
them for satirical cartoons, like the cover drawings of The New
Yorker and Mad.
</P>
<P>
   From my point of view, there were several things wrong with
these Rockwell pictures. First, neither I nor any of the kids in my
family were ever freshly scrubbed at the dinner table, unless
forced to be so, in which case we certainly wouldn't be smiling.
Second, the carving of a turkey was always an invitation to high
anxiety, not gustatory joy, since carving a huge bird was as
foreign a talent to the Jews of my parents' generation as playing
polo or buying retail. Whatever patriarch was entrusted with the
task would quickly make a hash of it, thus opening himself up to
the sniping of the many backseat carvers around the table of both
sexes. In my family's uncertain hands, even the invention that
promised deliverance from this yearly debacle _ the electric knife
_ did little but increase the volume of the bickering, which now
had to rise a decibel level or two to be heard over the buzz-saw
roar.
</P>
<P>
   An even graver holiday problem was that I did not belong to what
is now called an ``intact'' family. This meant that there were
usually dueling Thanksgivings: Mom's Thanksgiving, and Dad's, and
sometimes each of their parents' Thanksgivings, and sometimes even
my new stepparents' parents' Thanksgivings. Since my marital record
is no better than that of my parents, my own poor children have an
almost uncountable number of options at every holiday, scattered
over much of the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   This syndrome is sufficiently common that USA Today this week
convened a ``Baby Boomer Panel'' to discuss Thanksgiving in the
post-intact-family age. Somehow this panel had no trouble finding
families that have risen above their divisions, with ex-spouses and
new ones all Rockwell smiles as they pitch in to celebrate the
holiday season together. I am clearly living in another country _
perhaps the one that turned up elsewhere in USA Today, where the
National Rifle Association placed a giant ad celebrating
``law-abiding gun owners'' on ``this uniquely American holiday.''
The NRA's decision to decorate its ad with an illustration of a
straw cornucopia full of nature's autumnal bounty, as opposed to an
assault weapon that might end up in the hands of a malevolent ex,
was an especially touching seasonal gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, as my father once again lamented a less than 100
percent turnout from his various families for the festivities of
Father's Day (I was a slacker), I tried to explain to him that I
always hated holidays because they exacerbated family tensions, and
that it was impossible to have a conversation with any relatives
you really wanted to talk to anyway, since they were all talking at
once when they were not passing the white meat or the dark meat.
</P>
<P>
   My father looked at me with utter bafflement, and only some days
later did I realize why I was missing the whole point. To be at
table with all your relatives without being able to carry on more
than a glancing conversation with any of them may be just what the
depressive Abraham Lincoln, husband of Mary Todd, had in mind when
he officially proclaimed Thanksgiving a holiday 135 years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Those snap, crackle and pop folks have been asleep at the
breakfast table.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg Co.'s cereal business is in trouble, upstaged by bagels,
breakfast bars, bran muffins and, right on the next shelf, no-name
cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, time-starved consumers who once started their day
splashing milk over a bowl of wheat flakes prefer to nosh a bagel
in the car or nibble a breakfast bar on the way to school. And
prices for brand-name cereals have gotten so high that shoppers
think nothing of trading down to generic brands or steering clear
of the breakfast aisle altogether.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes at a time when Kellogg is also increasing its
spending on new products and promotions _ just this week it added a
new ad agency _ all of which puts an added squeeze on profits.
</P>
<P>
   The staleness of its growth, meanwhile, has led to speculation
about a management shake-up at the top. Carlos Gutierrez, who was
named president and chief operating officer in June and was thought
to be the most likely successor to Arnold Langbo, Kellogg's chief
executive, might have a chance to step up his role sooner rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, as speculation grew about an imminent change or
a reduction in Langbo's role, Wall Street signaled its approval by
driving the company's shares up.
</P>
<P>
   All this has put the maker of Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies
in a quandary: How can it freshen up its cereal business?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Kellogg, which is far more dependent on cereal
than its rivals are, will try to tune in to today's tastes by
selling more noncereal foods and pitching its cereal as a
nutritional part of a healthy diet. Beyond that, it simply hopes to
run a tighter ship.
</P>
<P>
   The company, said a spokesman, Joseph Stewart, plans to increase
its investment in research and development and marketing
innovation, expand lines like Eggo frozen waffles, Nutri-Grain bars
and other alternative breakfast foods and cut costs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made management changes, announced that job cuts
are coming at its headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich., and, most
visibly, has come out with advertising that stresses nutrition
instead of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   One new ad campaign uses the tag line ``A healthier life is
within your reach'' and tries to link the nutritional benefits of
certain ingredients in cereal with a lower risk of birth defects,
heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg, in fact, is taking the nutrition angle a step further
by introducing a product line next year called Ensemble _ foods it
will promote as being healthy. The line is expected to be rolled
out in Midwestern markets by the spring and should be on store
shelves nationwide by the fall of 1999. It includes frozen entrees,
cookies and muffins that contain grain or whole oats, which studies
have shown can help lower cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg, of course, is not abandoning cereal, but it is trying
some new tricks to sell it. For one, while the company will not say
whether it plans to lower prices further, which would almost
certainly set off a price war, it is in effect doing so through
heavy use of coupons and other promotions.
</P>
<P>
   It recently introduced Breakfast Mates, a packaged combination
of cereal, milk and a spoon sold in the dairy case. And more change
is in the works. ``We are just at the beginning of this,'' Stewart
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that consumers _ and investors _ may not bite.
The trend toward low-fat, healthy food seems to have peaked. And
while packaging cereal with a spoon is certainly a novel idea, it
may still be tough to get today's frenetic masses to sit still long
enough to add the milk. And even for those consumers still focused
on health, convincing them to buy Frosted Mini-Wheats for the fiber
instead of the frosting may be a bit of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't feel particularly encouraged by any of the moves that
have been announced lately,'' said Peter Schofield, an analyst with
John Hancock Sovereign Investors Fund, which owns about 250,000
shares in General Mills, the No. 2 cereal maker, but has steered
clear of Kellogg. ``I think that because they've been on a slide in
terms of market share they have a lot of making up to do now and
they are not playing from a position of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, analysts and portfolio managers say, Kellogg's new
marketing initiatives are at least a year too late, product
innovation has been slow and spotty, and the company is still
struggling to find the right pricing mix. Compounding those
problems, they say, is that Kellogg's management has been stingy on
details of its turnaround plan and sensitive to criticism of its
missteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like saying their daughter is ugly,'' said John
McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. He rates the
company's stock a hold, concluding that for investors ``it's too
late to sell and too early to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has fallen more than 28 percent this year,
closing Friday at $35.8125.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Kellogg is not alone in its suffering. Other cereal
makers, like General Mills Inc., maker of Cheerios, Wheaties and
Lucky Charms, have faced many of the same pressures in a shrinking
market.
</P>
<P>
   Children, the biggest consumers of cereal, have cut their demand
about 3 percent in the last two years, according to NPD Group, a
market research organization, while adults have pared cereal
consumption by about 5 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, sales in the nation's cereal business
have declined by $1 billion, to $7.134 billion. Kellogg has lost
the most ground over that period, with its share dropping to 32
percent from 35.5 percent, according to Information Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The share of the market held by makers of private-label cereals,
like Malt-O-Meal Co., meanwhile, has risen to 7.5 percent from 5.4
percent as they have aggressively rolled out cheaper alternatives
to the name brands.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the struggle to fend off private-label companies and
to get people to eat more cereal is not confined to Kellogg, the
company has been the hardest hit because more of its sales and
profits are dependent on cereal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the category leader and this is their core business,
so they are going to benefit more in good times and be hurt more in
bad times,'' said Timothy Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at
Dreyfus Corp., which sold its 540,000 shares of Kellogg months ago.
``At this point they are a bit stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company reported a 32 percent drop in
third-quarter profits, to $141.9 million, or 35 cents a diluted
share. Kellogg has also warned that profits for the full year will
be disappointing, possibly falling as much as 20 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It has also not helped Kellogg's performance, analysts and fund
managers say, that the company has tended to have a cliquish
corporate culture in which all the ideas come from the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply stated, there was no creativity,'' said Steven
Galbraith, a money manager at Pzena Investment Management and a
former food-industry analyst. ``They relied on what used to work in
a dramatically changing consumer environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, there is a sense that Kellogg is finally taking
a different approach. The company has ordered all executives at its
headquarters to justify their jobs, and may announce the outcome of
the review as early as next week. In September, it announced the
departures of two top executives, Thomas Knowlton, head of the
North American division, and Donald Fritz, president of the
European division.
</P>
<P>
   And in September, in one of his first major moves as president,
Gutierrez announced with Langbo a three-month review of Kellogg's
overall administrative structure. The goal is to shave $100 million
in costs, in part to free more money for promotional spending.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the Martin Agency this week to its roster of
three ad agencies for ready-to-eat cereal in the United States was
seen as an effort to bolster slowing sales and to stem eroding
market share.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg has reduced costs and promised big savings before,
though, leaving Wall Street less than impressed this time. And even
attempts to take on new competitors have not always added
significantly to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, Kellogg realized that bagels had became the
breakfast of choice in many kitchens, cars and cafeterias, it did
get in on the action by buying the Lender's frozen-bagel business
in 1996. But by then, many consumers were nibbling fresh bagels
with yuppified ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes and pesto. Bagel
shops were popping up everywhere, and even supermarket bakeries
were selling fresh bagels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid like $400 million two years ago to buy a
frozen-bagel business that was kind of yesterday's news,'' said
McMillin of Prudential. He estimates that Lender, whose numbers
Kellogg does not break out from its overall results, has had
double-digit volume declines since Kellogg bought it. ``To buy a
frozen product when clearly the movement of consumers was to
fresh,'' he said, ``didn't make much sense to me then and it
doesn't now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Lender's line, however, Kellogg says it sees
other ways to grow, particularly with international expansion of
convenience foods and cereals. But recent economic turmoil in
international markets has hit many American consumer-product makers
hard and underscores the pitfalls that Kellogg may face as it
expands abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the challenges, though, Kellogg still has a solid
lead in the cereal business and the expertise and resources to
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all their current problems,'' McMillin said, ``Kellogg is
still an enviable franchise that controls 45 percent of the global
cereal industry. This is a franchise that is still very valuable
and I think has the potential to grow.''

   Joshua Cohen, a senior at the University of Michigan, has a
dozen folders in his file cabinet that are crammed with financial
reports and news clippings about companies he is pursuing for a
job. He bought a cellular phone so he would be available to
recruiters 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, an English major who has already had internships at
Salomon Smith Barney and Bear Stearns, said job hunting was ``like
taking an extra class,'' but it might well add up to even more than
that. Companies are on campus nearly every day, and Cohen sometimes
spends several hours with a recruiter; once, he skipped a class for
one such meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With only six months until graduation, the class of '99 is
prepping for entry into the real world. While many seniors will not
begin job-hunting until next semester, a growing band of students
seeking jobs on Wall Street and in consulting have already begun a
recruiting game that just keeps getting more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, with the markets roaring, the appetite for new blood
was huge. As students scrambled to win entry-level jobs at top
companies, companies were racing to snare the top students. The
cream of the class emerged with multiple offers and five-figure
bonuses for jobs that typically encompass the grunt work of basic
research and support.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the markets' tumultuous summer and fall bringing
cutbacks on Wall Street, the competition among the students has
heated up further. To land jobs, the class of '99 is leaving no
angle unexamined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I should put it on bond as opposed to linen,''
a senior at Cornell University said recently to her two roommates.
It was almost 1 a.m. the night before a campus job fair, and she
was talking earnestly about her resume. ``I read that you don't
want to stand out, so linen paper is definitely out,'' she said
anxiously, declining to be identified for fear that her comments
might affect her chances of landing a certain consulting job. ``And
I have to print it on white paper, not cream.''
</P>
<P>
   For students, the angst is heavy with deja vu. Just four short
years after agonizing over SATs and college applications, they are
again polishing cover letters _ in some cases still ghost-written
by parents, and now almost always edited by professors and career
counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Glorified descriptions of internships and extracurricular
activities may pepper the resumes _ laser-printed, of course, on
fancy paper. Calls go out to family members and friends in search
of a ``connection.'' Even those SAT scores cannot be forgotten:
some consulting firms ask for them, along with college transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   While graduating seniors have long faced this trying process, by
many accounts the intensity of the job hunt has stepped up
recently. ``The last couple of years has really stretched rational
thinking,'' said David Reed, director of global recruiting at
Andersen Consulting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Though this is clearly a buyers' market, top employers have not
eased up. Partly, no doubt, this is because they still want the
best people, even if there are fewer jobs to fill. But, perhaps
too, the recruiting frenzy has taken on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   So with some Wall Street firms offering starting salaries in
excess of $50,000 for undergraduates with nothing more than a B.A.,
the competition _ on both sides _ can reach fever pitch. ``A lot of
employers really ratcheted up starting salaries, and bonuses have
become much more prevalent,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure has created a new breed of ultra-informed,
sometimes overzealous students who come to the recruiting process
with broad knowledge _ and sometimes experience _ in a given
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just so much more sophisticated,'' said Peter
Kiernan, a partner on the recruiting committee at Goldman, Sachs.
``If I were to look at the students today compared with the
students even two years ago or five years ago, their state of
awareness of investment banking or sales and trading is
dramatically higher.''
</P>
<P>
   And the process starts earlier. Some students begin jockeying
for interviews as juniors or even sophomores, vying for internships
that might help them clinch a full-time, permanent job later.
</P>
<P>
   Valentina Chamorro, a senior at Harvard, had an internship last
summer at J.P. Morgan, which has already offered her a
post-graduation job. ``I wanted to get a feel for what you do day
to day,'' said Ms. Chamorro, a government major. ``The people at
J.P. Morgan were amazing and really took their time to teach me
about banking and how to do research and how to be analytical.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's internships have not landed him a job yet, but he still
says he has the best chance at companies that already know him.
``They know my work ethic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internships have become especially important for students who
are not finance or economics majors. ``As an English major, having
Bear Stearns on the top of my resume has definitely helped,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a path not taken can be a plus. Cohen was offered an
internship with BT Alex. Brown last summer. He rejected it to go to
Bear Stearns, but the offer alone helped him go directly to the
final interview round at Alex. Brown this fall.
</P>
<P>
   An Ephemeral Prize
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chamorro, with a job offer in hand, is one of the lucky few.
Come spring, as most students well know, the pickings will be slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, we will be seeing some real cutbacks in hiring,''
said Steve Pollack, co-founder of Wet Feet Press, a San Francisco
company that tracks the recruiting process. But he hesitated to say
that the cuts would be deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that a lot of these banks are announcing big
layoffs, they still need these pools of talent to come in.'' And
new graduates, he added, ``are still relatively cheap labor.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who was not called back to a second round of interviews
with Bain &AMP; Co. and Andersen Consulting, said he had already
expanded his job hunt to include commercial banks. ``I guess you
could call that hitting the panic button,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got an offer today, even if it's not my top choice,'' he
added, ``I'd consider taking the job, just to have something in the
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Students seek out careers in investment banking or management
consulting because in many ways it is the quintessential
transitional job. Most enter the field as analysts and stay only
two to three years, after which many pursue an M.B.A. or change
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many situations, the M.B.A. is the ticket for admission,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduate school, it is common for them to return to their
original employer, which might well have paid their business school
tuitions. Yet most companies are keen to stress that while they are
great places to start out, the chances are slim that a new hire
will stay even five years. McKinsey &AMP; Co., widely regarded as one
of the most successful campus recruiters, tells students that only
25 percent of those hired in 1996 still worked for the company in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Three-Act Ritual
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, campus recruiting has changed dramatically.
Most Wall Street firms used to stop only at a few Ivy League
schools _ perpetuating, some recruiters now say, the idea of an
old-boy network. But when demand surged, Wall Street cast its nets
much wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good news, because at any school you hit diminishing
returns,'' Kiernan said. ``But it means that firms have to involve
more people and go to more schools and spend more time _ and
frankly, it's more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Campus recruiting today is often a three-act ritual: a career
fair, followed by information sessions and the infamous interview
process.
</P>
<P>
   The career fair, traditionally early in the school year, keeps
creeping closer to the first week of classes. These
convention-style events _ ``live meat markets,'' one
PricewaterhouseCoopers recruiter called them _ usually last a day
or two, and are held in athletic field houses, with hundreds of
companies erecting fancy booths. Joining Wall Street firms might be
recruiters from consumer products companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble
and S.C. Johnson or technology giants like Microsoft, Intel and
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to chatting up prospective employees, almost every
company gives away hundreds of logo-adorned goodies. T-shirts and
pens used to be the hot items, but this year, possibly in a
commentary on the times, everyone has been giving away stress balls
_ those squishy, rubbery things you squeeze to relieve tension.
</P>
<P>
   Stress balls may not be enough. ``I feel like I'm selling my
soul for the next 20 years to the most interesting offer I get,''
said Tamara Nedjar, a Cornell senior, as she left one of the
hundreds of booths at this year's fair.
</P>
<P>
   More and more students flock to these events in business attire,
resumes in hand, hoping to pose some memorable question to a
recruiter. An exceptional comment _ particularly to a partner _ can
get a student ``fast tracked'' through an otherwise cumbersome
process. At day's end, some big firms make ``on-campus callbacks''
_ sometimes by e-mail _ setting up interviews or arranging an
informal lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Most efforts to be noticed, though, are futile. Recruiters are
generally low-level people, often recent hires or alumni of the
host school. Their job is to sell the company to the students, not
vice versa. Many recruiters who have worked the fairs say they can
do little to help any specific student.
</P>
<P>
   The fairs give rise to some disorienting transformations. ``I
ran into two friends wearing suits the other day,'' said Daniel
Richenthal, a senior economics major at Amherst College. ``It's
sort of like, wait a second, it seems like yesterday I was living
in the same hallway with you and we were up at 3 in the morning
playing music way too loud and acting stupid. All of a sudden
you're wearing a suit, holding this leather legal pad on the way to
an interview. It's all very surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simulations
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after a fair, most companies return to campus to
put on a dog-and-pony show called an ``information session.'' These
can run several hours, and they almost always include a promotional
video with the requisite images of Wall Street signs and spaceships
rocketing off into the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been to one, you've been to them all,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, though, are trying hip, more stylized videos.
This year, Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, produced a
short video called ``Road Show Rules,'' a parody of MTV's ``Road
Rules'' program, replete with rock-and-roll background music. The
15-minute video follows a couple of analysts documentary style
through an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed. ``Is the video portraying what you're
going to be really doing?'' Richenthal asked. ``If you get the job,
you are going to be at the bottom of the totem pole. I don't know
if a video with fast music and smiling people walking around the
globe is going to be you when you are sitting in your cubicle.''
</P>
<P>
   When Goldman, Sachs came to Cornell last month for its
information session, it brought almost 50 employees to answer
questions from a packed room of young people dressed in their most
conservative garb.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us, `We want you,''' Richenthal said. ``But if you
look around the room there are 100 other people just like you _ and
they can't want all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some information sessions migrate to a local bar, where the
alcohol flows freely and the tab is picked up by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the dreaded interview process _ if a student is
picked. ``The resume is the most important aspect in terms of
getting in the door,'' said Mariam Naficy, author of ``The Fast
Track'' (Broadway Books, 1997), an insider's account of how to land
a job at an investment bank or consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Naficy, who just received an M.B.A. from Stanford Business
School, previously worked as an analyst at Goldman, Sachs and as a
consultant at Gemini Management Consulting. ``After you get invited
to an interview,'' she said, ``your personality and what you say
will dramatically impact the decision.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When a fresh college graduate lands a job at an investment bank
or a consulting firm, the drying ink on the business cards usually
says ``analyst.'' It's a bit cryptic, but it sounds better than
``cannon fodder.''
</P>
<P>
   In this context, analysts are support workers for senior-level
staff. They do research legwork, draft reports, create and update
spreadsheets, assemble presentations and gather information from
clients. At consulting firms, analysts are often traveling,
spending up to four days a week visiting clients. At investment
banks, analysts tend to burn the midnight oil in the home office
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst positions in both industries are intended to last only
for two or three years. After that, a small number of analysts are
promoted directly to more senior posts. The rest go back to school
for an M.B.A. or find another career path, while their desks,
laptops and phone extensions are recycled to a new analyst crop.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29)  
 (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the surprises in the mutual fund numbers from this year's
selloff is that investors acted differently than they did during
the swoon in 1997, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged
7.2 percent on a single day in October. This summer, investors were
more willing to flee, or, put another way, less willing to tough
out the market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean small investors have fundamentally changed their
thinking about the stock market? Will they remain less willing to
take the pain of sharp declines like those that have dotted the
generously bullish landscape? The answers matter, because it is the
steadfast Main Street investor who has powered the stock market for
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 weeks through Oct. 14 _ the day before the Federal
Reserve cut interest rates for the second time _ $3.2 billion was
taken out of small-company stock funds, according to AMG Data
Services, which tracks mutual fund flows. That was a decline of 2.4
percent. Investors also pulled $1.4 billion, or 1.1 percent, out of
international funds. The popular index funds favored by many 401(k)
investors had net inflows.
</P>
<P>
   According to AMG's data for all funds that report results
weekly, covering about half the total assets of all mutual funds,
$4 billion was taken out of equity funds over all. That was about
0.3 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Fund families that report to AMG monthly, including Fidelity and
Vanguard, showed outflows from July through early November of $2
billion from small-company funds and $3.2 billion from
international funds.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, the story was different, as investors held their
ground. The net new cash flow into all equity funds was $37.5
billion from the week ended Aug. 8, 1997, through the week ended
Nov. 19. By then, investors had ample time to contemplate their
future in a market that had seen the Dow drop almost 900 points, or
11 percent, in four days and then bounce back 563 points, or 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, the net inflow to small-company stock funds
was $8 billion, while $1.3 billion was moved into international
funds.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the change this year is that this summer's
decline was the worst since this phase of the bull market began in
1990, with the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 dropping 19.3 percent from peak
to trough and the NASDAQ plummeting 29.5 percent. A 20 percent
decline is a bear market to most analysts, and this was too close
for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the time of volatility, people act,'' said Avi
Nachmany, the head of research at Strategic Insight, an adviser to
mutual fund companies. ``People overcome their sense of inertia. It
really has to be bad for people to act.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his monitor of mutual fund flows showed that $1 of every
$200 was moved out of stock funds for defensive purposes during
each month of the latest decline. But he considered that a
``negligible'' and ``minuscule'' reaction by investors. And he
argued that it was a mistake to conclude that investors are now
more likely to bail out when the market falls.
</P>
<P>
   Preston G. Athey, president of the T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value
fund, put it another way: ``I don't see this as a change in
behavior, because I look at longer-term investor behavior, and they
tend to go with what is hot, not with what is cold.'' And it did
not take much to convince investors that small caps were cold.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the July selloff of the big indexes, the Russell
index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks had already fallen more than
11 percent from its April high for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The surge back into equities since early October shows that
investors think stocks are hot again. Over all, $13 billion has
poured into equity funds, with $2.4 billion going into small stocks
and $1.4 billion into international funds, based on AMG's weekly
data through Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Investment Company Institute, which reports monthly for the
entire industry, shows a flow of $8.7 billion back into equity
funds in September and October. And mutual fund companies report
that the inflows have been faster in November.
</P>
<P>
   Brian F. Stack, portfolio manager of the MFS New Discovery fund,
said one difference from 1997 is that this year, investors had time
to pay attention to bad news. A global financial crisis had been in
the air since October 1997. Other declines, he argued, ``have come
and gone before the average retail investor woke up and knew what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, a wave of merger activity, including talk of a union
between Exxon and Mobil, had helped push both the S&AMP;P 500 and
NASDAQ indexes to new highs, while the Dow finished just 41 points
off its record. And it seems likely that this quick rebound will
convince many investors that they were wrong to get out.
</P>
<P>
   That means they may hold out longer in the next downdraft _ the
right move, so long as the stock market manages to snap back
miraculously once again. Some time, it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are back and that is great news for investors. But the
rebound in the marquee indexes does not tell the full story, as
many mutual fund investors will discover when they compare their
own portfolios with the Dow, which is up 23 percent from its August
low. As a group, fund investors still have a way to go to recover
this summer's equity losses.
</P>
<P>
   According to AMG, the assets of equity mutual funds, including
domestic and international and small- and big-company stocks, are
still around $175 billion _ or about 7 percent to 9 percent below
their levels when the Dow peaked in July. This is largely because a
lot of stocks have not rallied as much as the new index highs might
make one think.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney calculates that as of Wednesday, the
average stock on the New York Stock Exchange was still down 28.5
percent from its 52-week high. The average NASDAQ stock was off
39.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey M. Warantz, a vice president at Salomon, also notes that
while the rally from the summer lows began from a broad base,
including small and big stocks alike, it narrowed after Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   So it was just the big-name stocks that carried the indexes the
final lap to their new highs. Of the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500, 40
percent are still down 20 percent or more from their 52-week highs.

EXXON AND MOBIL BOARDS ARE SAID TO PLAN TUESDAY MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are
expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement
that would form the world's largest oil company, a source close to
the negotiations said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ``the
prospects were good'' for completing an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil confirmed Friday that they were discussing ways
to combine. They cautioned, however, that no agreement had been
reached and there was no assurance they would reach one.
</P>
<P>
   The statement sent the stock of both companies surging,
suggesting investors believe the companies will combine. Shares of
Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, rose $1.6875, or 2.3 percent,
to $74.375. Shares of Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose
$7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $86.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that if the two giants reached an agreement,
it was likely to be in the form of a takeover by Exxon of Mobil.
Exxon is far larger and financially stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predicted that there would be huge cuts in duplicate
staff from both companies, which employ 122,700 people. Adam
Sieminski, an oil analyst for BT Alex. Brown, said that the
companies would probably make cuts to save about $3 billion to $5
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sieminski and other analysts said Exxon would have to offer a
premium of about 15 to 20 percent over its price prior to Monday,
when serious speculation of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first
circulated and sent Mobil shares up sharply. They said the
transaction would probably be an exchange of Mobil shares for Exxon
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of
the company would be worth about $70 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly
severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief
executive of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and
to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in
crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most intelligent chief executives in the
business and a man of considerable ability but he inherited some
serious structural problems in his company,'' said J. Robin West,
the chairman of Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting group to the
energy industry based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Mobil's prime assets include the Arun natural gas
field in Indonesia, one of the largest in the world, which has
contributed up to one-third of Mobil's profits for years but is
beginning to run down. The field, in production since 1977,
supplies liquefied natural gas to Japan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mobil under Noto has moved quickly to cut costs and
muscle its way into promising new areas such as Kazakhstan, where
it is a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz oil
field, the payoff from such ventures is many years away.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies face similar strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to replace their crown jewels and grow in an
increasingly competitive environment,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Noto has not been shy about sitting down with other companies
such as British Petroleum and Amoco this year to see if a
combination made sense.
</P>
<P>
   Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads a much stronger and
bigger company than Mobil, he has not been immune to the strains on
the global petroleum business. Those strains intensified this year
when Russia's economic collapse raised the risks of Exxon's
extensive exploration venture in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon has also been more of a follower than a leader in huge
projects in the deep offshore fields, where major finds have been
made near West Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The Clinton administration has presented
NATO with a far-reaching program seeking to define what the
alliance has become since the Cold War ended and setting out its
goals for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But European opposition to American proposals on a number of
issues threatens to undermine a 50th-anniversary NATO summit
meeting planned in Washington next year.
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats said the agenda for the April meeting is designed
partly to convince Congress that NATO is still central to American
security, but that agenda has raised European concerns that the
United States is trying to turn NATO into a freewheeling global
vehicle for its own interests.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the differences lies the American conviction that
NATO should now be seen as ``an alliance of interests'' as much as
one dedicated to the defense of a specific territory.
</P>
<P>
   Washington believes that those interests may in some instances
push NATO into far-flung activities, including, for example,
working to counter chemical and biological weapons, to stem the
spread of nuclear weapons or to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course when America talks of the defense of interests, and
not just territories, it leads to continued suspicions that the
United States is seeking to globalize NATO,'' said a senior
official who asked not to be identified. ``NATO is still
Euro-Atlantic, but we should not artificially exclude what we might
use NATO for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington meeting amounts to a critical moment for NATO. It
is intended to define NATO's new ``strategic concept'' after almost
a decade of largely improvised adaptations to the post-Cold-War
world. It will also set out a doctrine that takes the allies a very
long way beyond the commitment to mutual self-defense that lay at
the core of the Washington Treaty of 1949 that set up NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But after a summer and fall largely consumed by the crisis in
Kosovo, and in the light of a bold American agenda clearly designed
to represent President Clinton's legacy for the alliance, there is
widespread concern at NATO headquarters that agreement is far from
assured before the Washington meeting is held.
</P>
<P>
   A European official said the need to adapt NATO and formalize
the changes that have taken place since 1989 was not in dispute.
But he said several European countries were concerned that
Washington wanted to push the alliance too far beyond its core
European commitments and might be exaggerating threats to justify
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans have put a program on the table that calls for
NATO to play a major role in controlling and countering weapons of
mass destruction _ nuclear, biological and chemical,'' he said.
``But we worry that America may be creating a new threat perception
that will scare our populations with visions of anthrax and
gangrene while allowing NATO to become a global organization.''
</P>
<P>
   France, always concerned with what it sometimes calls ``American
hegemony'' and keen to develop Europe's own defense abilities, and
Germany, whose new coalition of Social Democrats and
environmentalist Greens has a broadly anti-militarist bent, are
among the countries wary of giving NATO too sweeping a mission,
officials said. Russia, of course, is also deeply concerned.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, officials said, a sharp conflict exists over
America's determination to include in NATO's new ``mission'' or
``vision'' statement (the precise term is under discussion) a
stipulation that the alliance may, in exceptional circumstances,
act without a specific mandate from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of this margin for maneuver, American officials
contend, NATO would effectively be placing itself at the mercy of a
Russian or Chinese veto in the Security Council for any mission it
wished to undertake, even in the event of an overwhelming
humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson of Kosovo is that we need a modicum of
flexibility,'' said a NATO diplomat. ``A Security Council mandate
is highly desirable, but we should not tie our hands in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Kosovo crisis, despite Russian opposition and the
absence of a specific Security Council mandate, NATO authorized
possible military action against Yugoslavia. American officials,
including the special envoy to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, said
this decision amounted to an important precedent, but European
officials generally argued that none had been set.

 BRUSSELS: had been set.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, Germany's foreign minister and a Green Party
member, is among those who have argued passionately that the rule
of law would be threatened and competing regional security blocs
encouraged if NATO arrogates to itself even the limited right to
act without explicit Security Council mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at language that would say something like NATO
will act under the authority of the United Nations, with an
appropriate legal basis and, as far as is possible, a U.N. Security
Council resolution,'' one official said. ``But this is a difficult
issue that is certain to involve painful discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other difficulties center on a separate program introduced by
the United States and known as NATO's defense capability
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   This program is designed to take full, if somewhat belated,
account of the Cold War's end by pushing through a radical
transformation described this month by Defense Secretary William
Cohen as one from a ``fixed, positional defense to a flexible,
mobile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the United States wants to be sure that NATO can now
project power _ if necessary far afield _ engage it effectively,
sustain it over long periods and maintain it even against chemical,
biological or electronic attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need advanced, mobile communications, helicopters, lift,
and sustainability,'' one official said. ``But a lot of armies in
Europe, including the German, are still configured for a European
land war with tanks so heavy you can't move them.''
</P>
<P>
   While European governments broadly agree that the need for these
changes has been demonstrated by missions like the one in Bosnia,
they are concerned by the high cost. Their budgets are strictly
curtailed by European Union agreements. They also fear that the
program may be a thinly-veiled invitation to buy weapons and
equipment in America.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by Britain, the European Union is looking at ways to
make its sprawling defense industry more cost effective. Annual
European military spending is two-thirds that of the United States,
but because of duplication the spending is much less cost
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Reform of European military procurement, however, is likely to
be slow, and any American quest for budgetary commitments _ like
the 3 percent annual increase in military spending pledged by
European governments during the Jimmy Carter years _ would
certainly fall on deaf ears. American officials have estimated that
Europe needs to spend 10 percent more on defense every year just to
maintain existing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   While Europe's first post-Cold-War ambitions to develop its own
military arm have eroded, and a broad accord exists that
``separable but not separate'' European units should develop within
NATO, some tensions persist over what should be said about Europe's
defense identity in the new alliance doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO ``extraction force'' manned entirely by Europeans and
under a French commander, but dependent on American intelligence
and logistics, is about to deploy in Macedonia to help protect
Western monitors in Kosovo. This European deployment amounts to a
first for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats said France appeared to want to give priority for
statements on this mission and Europe's military future to a
European Union meeting in Cologne that will follow the Washington
summit meeting. But the United States was adamant that the issue be
addressed primarily in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One issue on which there appears to be broad agreement is that
there should be a period of consolidation after the formal
admission to NATO at the Washington meeting of Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic. It is highly unlikely that further, specific
invitations to join will be issued in April, alliance officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision, however couched, is almost certain to anger
several candidates for NATO membership, including Romania and
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of NATO's nuclear forces, it also appears clear
that consolidation rather than innovative change will prevail.
While the broad aim of balanced nuclear disarmament exists, a
majority of allies regard the nuclear threat, including its
potential first use, as central to security. Already, Germany has
had to swallow its misgivings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that we now give the public and Congress an
understanding of why NATO is as essential, or more essential, as
during the Cold War,'' said a NATO diplomat who did not want his
name used. ``At the same time we need to keep Russia involved in a
security partnership and the Europeans on board. There are real
differences, and there will be histrionics, but I think the
Europeans also know we have to update NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   What is already clear is that the balance of power within NATO
has not been changed by the Cold War's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing that while Europeans are always saying we must
do more to develop our own defense policy, 95 percent of the
propositions on the table are American _ that is the reality,''
said Arnaud Jacomet, a senior official at the Western European
Union, Europe's largely dormant defense arm.

CLINTON TO SPEAK AT HISTORIC SESSION OF PALESTINIAN COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to
address Palestinian leaders, the White House said Friday. He is to
speak at what the Palestinians are describing as a historic meeting
to formally revoke anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 Palestinian
charter.
</P>
<P>
   Israel demanded revocation of the clauses at U.S.-brokered
negotiations last month that led to the latest land-for-peace deal
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that settlement, reached at Wye, Md., Clinton agreed
to travel to territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority to
speak at the meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the de
facto parliament.
</P>
<P>
   According to a schedule released Friday by the White House,
Clinton will visit Gaza, the West Bank and Israel during a four-day
trip that will begin on Dec. 12. He is to meet with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, before returning to Washington on Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the White House had not
yet decided whether Clinton would fly to the newly opened Gaza
International Airport aboard Air Force One, given the symbolism of
the president's jet landing on Palestinian soil with the trappings
of a state visit.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the White House was fearful of upsetting Israeli
leaders who are worried that the president's planned visit to Gaza
appears to be a step toward American recognition of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the president would ``speak to the Israeli
and Palestinian people about the importance of the Wye agreement
and the need to continue to support the Middle East peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Gaza on Dec. 14 is bound to be contentious, given
that many prominent Palestinians have charged that the Wye
agreement allows the Israeli government to backtrack on promises
made to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have insisted that they have already revoked
clauses in the 1964 charter that called for Israel's destruction.
In January, Arafat wrote to the White House, listing the
anti-Israel provisions that he said had been annulled.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter did not satisfy the Israelis. And during the
talks in Maryland last month, Arafat agreed to call a meeting of
the national council to ``reaffirm'' the decision to revoke the
clauses.
</P>
<P>
   In order to guarantee passage of a motion to annul the
provisions, Arafat is being allowed under an agreement with the
Israelis and the United States to pack the council meeting in Gaza
with his loyalists, and to conduct the vote by a show of hands
instead of a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview with Israeli television, Clinton
brushed aside concerns that his visit to Gaza might be seen as a
step toward U.S. recognition of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not what I'm doing in going there,'' he said. ``I have
tried strictly to adhere to the position of the United States that
we would not take a position on any final status issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was traveling to Gaza at the recommendation of, among
others, Netanyahu. ``The prime minister wanted me to go there and
wanted us all to make this pitch,'' he said, adding that he would
ask the Palestinian National Council ``to support the peace and to
renounce the idea of animosity toward and opposition to the
existence of the state of Israel, and instead embrace the path not
only of peace but of cooperation.''

   Jim Rogers, the former hedge-fund manager and author of
``Investment Biker'' is going for another long drive, this time in
an odd-looking yellow car. Rogers, 56, will drive around the world
in a concoction dubbed the Millennium Project that consists of a
Mercedes SLK, a two-seater with a retractable top, attached to the
chassis of a Mercedes Galaendawagen sport utility vehicle (not
widely available in the United States).

   He will start his three-year journey in Iceland on Jan. 1 to
commemorate Leif Ericsson's voyage to North America. Then it's on
to Europe, Turkey, Iran, China, South Korea and Japan in 1999;
Africa, India and Australia in 2000, and South and North America in
2001. He figures he'll cover 100,000 miles, more than the 65,000 he
traveled on a motorcycle in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   As the new millennium approaches, he says, ``I want to document
the state of the world.'' His fiancee, Paige Parker, 30, will be
going along for the ride. The two plan to marry on Jan. 1, 2000. He
wants to take the plunge in Timbuktu, Mali, but ``Paige says not on

   It might seem irrational, what with the ignominy suffered by two
famous economic professors who put their Nobel-winning knowledge to
work trying to make billions at Long-Term Capital Management, the
hedge fund that nearly collapsed in September.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not stopping Richard H. Thaler, a University of
Chicago economics professor, from forming a money-management firm
with his friend Russell J. Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   Both are proponents of behavioral economics _ an approach that
recognizes that human behavior patterns do play a major role in
markets and the economy. Both men believe that money can be made in
stocks precisely because investors often act irrationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole coherent explanation for value investing is a
behavioral one,'' Thaler said. For example, he says, many investors
underestimate a company's future earnings because they focus on
lower past earnings _ a trait he calls anchoring.
</P>
<P>
   Thaler was on the board of Fuller's RJF Asset Management in San
Mateo, Calif., which manages $365 million, and received cases of
wine in payment for his advice. The new company will be named
Fuller &AMP; Thaler Asset Management. Its slogan: ``The Behavioral

it with bonds from the Motown producing-songwriting hit machine of
Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland, authors of ``Baby
Love'' and ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg,'' and from other songwriters
with enough royalties to package and sell.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pullman, with Barnumesque brio, is about to announce a
similar deal, which he says will be in ``eight figures,'' for the
hits of Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, including ``Ain't No
Mountain High Enough'' and ``Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's

   People are still talking about his 1990 paycheck of $78.2
million. But if his widow hasn't exercised the options he left her,
Steven J. Ross, the creator of Time Warner Inc., has `earned far
more money since he died'' than he did while chairman and chief
executive of Warner Communications, says the compensation expert
Graef Crystal.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Sale Ross, who married Ross in 1982, declined to
comment on Crystal's ruminations. But with Time Warner stock
soaring this year, the 7.2 million options her husband received
when Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. merged in 1990 would
be worth about $500.4 million today. That compares with the $275
million that Ross earned as head of Warner Communications from 1973
to 1989. With an exercise price of $37.50, the options drifted
under water when he died of prostate cancer in 1992.

FDA ISSUES RULES ON TESTING DRUGS IN CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By Robert Pear    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government Friday issued new rules that require
drug companies to conduct much wider testing of drugs in children,
so the companies can write labels that provide detailed information
to doctors and parents about the proper use of medications by
children.
</P>
<P>
   The final rules, issued by the Food and Drug Administration,
were a top priority for President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton, but met with strenuous objections from many drug
companies, which said they were impractical and burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians and patients' groups praised the rules. Paul
Glaser, chairman of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which finances
AIDS research, said, ``These rules mean that children can finally
share in the research progress against disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that drug companies rarely did the studies
needed to assess the safety and proper dosage of drugs widely used
to treat childhood illnesses. Instead, many drugs prescribed for
children were tested only in adults, with an assumption that the
drugs' effects on children would be very similar. About 20 percent
of the drugs marketed in the United States have been tested and
labeled specifically for children.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies said they shared Clinton's goal of discovering
better medicines for children. But they said the new tests would be
costly and could be unethical, because they might put thousands of
children at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules issued Friday, pharmaceutical companies must
generally study the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines
in children ``if the product is likely to be used in a substantial
number of pediatric patients,'' or if it provides a ``meaningful
therapeutic benefit'' over existing treatments for children in the
same age group.
</P>
<P>
   To gain FDA approval for their products, drug companies will
ordinarily have to submit data showing their ``safety and
effectiveness and benefits and risks'' in children.
</P>
<P>
   Prior efforts by the government to encourage voluntary testing
in children have largely failed, and it is treacherous to
extrapolate data from adults to children, the FDA said, noting that
children were not simply little adults.
</P>
<P>
   Despite commitments by drug companies to do more studies in
children, ``the percentage of new products entering the marketplace
with adequate pediatric safety and effectiveness information has
not increased in the last decade,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The final rules are, in some ways, more flexible than the
proposals issued by the Clinton administration in August 1997.
Under the final rules, for example, the FDA may allow a company to
defer testing in children until clinical trials suggest that a new
drug is safe and effective in adults. Indeed, the agency said, in
some cases, pediatric testing will occur after a new drug has been
approved for use by adults.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview, William Schultz, a deputy commissioner of the
FDA, said: ``We do not expect to hold up the approval of new drugs
for adults even if the study in children was inadequate. Instead,
we'll approve the drug for adults and then require studies in
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than impose a rigid, uniform rule for all new drugs, the
government said that the timing of pediatric studies would depend
on various factors.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, a new drug is urgently needed to treat a
life-threatening disease in children and if there is no adequate
therapy on the market, the government may insist that the
manufacturer immediately begin tests in children, before full data
on adults are available. But pediatric studies could begin later if
similar medications were already available for children.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Bello, executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association for the
industry, said Friday, ``We haven't seen the final rules and won't
be able to comment today.''
</P>
<P>
   In written comments on the proposed rules, drug companies
including Merck, Glaxo Wellcome, Novartis and Wyeth-Ayerst said
they wanted to discover better medicines for children, but found
the details of Clinton's proposal extremely impractical and
burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the companies said that children injured in drug tests
might file lawsuits years later, after they grow up, even though
parents gave consent for the tests. The companies said they could
not obtain informed consent from children as they do from adults.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Clinton administration said that children need
not be exposed to ``inappropriate risks'' because drug companies
could defer pediatric testing until new drugs were shown to be safe
and effective for adults. In addition, the drug agency said it
would ``seek advice from a panel of pediatric experts on whether
additional protections are necessary'' for children involved in
drug research.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Westmoreland, a health policy expert at Georgetown
University Law Center who supports the new rules, said, ``It is
much more unethical to expose children to drugs of unknown safety
than to put the children into carefully controlled clinical
trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the new rules ``will make prescribing
medication for children safer and may also lessen the number of
side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules will be published next week in the Federal Register
and will take effect, with the force of law, on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that if a company violated the new rules,
they would seek a federal court injunction requiring the company to
assess the safety and effectiveness of its products in children. If
the company flouted the injunction, it could be held in contempt of
court and fined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except possibly in rare circumstances,'' the FDA said, it does
not intend to disapprove or withdraw approval for a drug whose
manufacturer violates the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The rules also include these provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ The government may order drug companies to develop special
``pediatric formulations'' of any medicines that provide meaningful
advantages over existing drugs for children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drug companies may be required to conduct separate studies in
children of different ages, including babies in the first month of
life, infants in the first year of life, and adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   A drug company may be exempted from the requirement to study a
particular drug in children if it can show that such studies would
be ``impossible or highly impractical,'' or would pose ``undue
risks to pediatric patients.'' A company might get a waiver if, for
example, there was a very small number of patients with the
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA noted that some illnesses and conditions rarely occurred
in children. For these conditions, it said, testing in children
will be unnecessary. The government listed 20 such conditions,
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, breast cancer,
prostate cancer and lung cancer.

Christmas gift. Of course, it was for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Tamasy, 32, a travel agent from Brookline, Mass., went in for
the kill at Filene's Basement in Boston, an off-price store. His
find was a velvet shirt-style jacket, listed originally at $500,
marked down to $81.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it's kind of like a hunter when he bags a deer,'' he
said, reflecting on his prize. ``I mean, I would have strapped that
thing to the hood of my car if I could have.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not so long ago that the day after Thanksgiving was when
American shoppers raced to the stores to beat each other out of the
most popular items, willingly paying full price and rarely
expecting to unearth a bargain. But the 1990s have transformed the
holiday shopping experience into one giant national hunt for deals,
with retailers forced to court shoppers with promises of low prices
rather than rare goods.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind the change? A tough economy in the early part of
the decade impelled retailers to slash prices. From then on,
consumers resisted any effort on the part of retailers to return to
full-price, even in more prosperous years. Meanwhile, pretty much
the same merchandise was readily available in a variety of stores
across the country, forcing merchants to differentiate themselves
with price tags.
</P>
<P>
   And do not forget the mood of plain old thriftiness that has
become a badge of honor even among affluent shoppers who love to
say they got their Donna Karan cashmere jacket at a sample sale for
half price.
</P>
<P>
   The kick off to the 1998 holiday season was much the same last
year, only more so, as dozens of chains opened their doors at the
crack of the dawn, some as early as 5 a.m., offering heavily
promoted early-bird specials.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers formed lines outside discount stores, and retailers
like Bloomingdale's used giant, red sale signs as their principal
form of holiday decoration.
</P>
<P>
   While there will be some exceptions _ the apparently
irresistible Furby dolls, for instance _ that will sell out early
and at full price, plenty of merchandise could already be had for
at least 10 percent off Friday. And many shoppers, spooked by the
inexplicable movements of the stock market, said they would watch
their pennies this year a little more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautious about the economy,'' said Carol Cooper, 61, who
was shopping in Manhattan's Soho district Friday with her daughter,
Sandy. ``It's a little too good to be true, I'm waiting for the
other shoe to drop.''
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Monica, Calif., Cherie Hankal, a 38-year-old assistant
television director, sat sipping coffee Friday at the Third Street
Promenade, a pedestrian mall. She had no plans to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my job this year, so I'm not doing a lot of shopping,''
she said. ``I'm going to bake. That's the nice thing to do for
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But low prices could be the lure for others. Still, while all
the sales come-ons _ some department stores even had them in their
trim-a-tree departments _ might be great for shoppers, it can be
risky business for retailers looking to turn a profit in the busy
season. ``I'm worried about my companies,'' said Susan Silverstein,
an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``In the last
months, the level of ads and coupons has been pretty aggressive. It
seems to be getting earlier and earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Friday, as the day after Thanksgiving has been known _
retailers have counted on the day to turn red ink into black for
the year _ has become less popular in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still a frenetic day, people tend to buy even
more in the final few days leading up to Christmas and in the
super-bargain days after. Last year, for instance, retailers had a
mediocre holiday selling season, but ended the year on an upbeat
note with sales made from Dec. 24 through the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   To entice shoppers to buy more now, merchants have combined
price slashing with early hours, offering special deals for those
who are willing to come out at dawn for sweaters and coffee makers.
Stores from Best Buy to Zale jewelers to Macy's _ like
Bloomingdale's a unit of Federated Department Stores _ offered
lower prices for those willing to shop roughly between 7 a.m. and
11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, the strategy appeared to pay off. By 7:30 a.m., there
was a line of several hundred people outside a Best Buy store in
Westminster, one of the city's western suburbs. ``To save $20 I
waited in line for two hours,'' said Nancy McCarthy, 45, an
insurance company employee. ``No sale is worth it or that good.''
</P>
<P>
   By 5:30 a.m. at the Newport Mall in Jersey City, N.J., dozens of
shoppers were outside the Kay-Bee Toy store, a unit of Consolidated
Stores ``One guy lined up at 2 a.m.,'' said John Konarski, vice
president of the International Council of Shopping Centers. ``Who
does that?''
</P>
<P>
   A Christmas theme for several years had been the Phoenix-like
rise of the discount stores, once left for dead because of a
reputation for tackiness but currently attracting shoppers from all
walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   In Boise, Idaho, for instance, shoppers waited at 7 a.m. Friday
for the doors to open at the Target store, a unit of Dayton Hudson.
By 7:30 a.m., the parking lot was jammed. Lynn Jones, 41, of Boise
woke up a 3 a.m., finished her job of delivering 300 newspapers and
then picked up her friend, Shelly Draper, to hit the discount
stores. They bought several Raggedy Ann dolls, Hot Wheels cars and
children's clothes. They were the 700th and 701st people to arrive
at the store, so they got their Hot Wheels cars free.
</P>
<P>
   Retail analysts and economists will probably keep a sharp eye on
the luxury shops for insights into the well-being of the normally
free-spending wealthy. In recent months, business has been a little
shaky, with women's high-end clothes and men's expensive suits
selling poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Streeters, despite the big rebound in the market, appear
cautious. ``I've survived so far, but this Christmas, I think I
will take it easy,'' said Alex Ryshawuy, who works for an
investment bank, as he looked over some ties at Barneys New York.
``I feel a little bit nervous. I'll still buy luxury items this
year, just probably fewer, select items.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And many shoppers around the country are thinking similar
thoughts. ``This is the first year we've created a budget,'' said
Beth Knight, 33, of Jacksonville, Fla. After her family's stock
portfolio took a heavy blow this summer, she and her husband sold
some stocks before they rebounded. ``We acted a little prematurely,
we panicked,'' she said. ``Maybe next year will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Very few red-hot items stood out Friday, and it was too early to
tell whether digital video disks _ DVD _ will bail out electronic
retailers, who have been waiting in vain for another breakthrough
product like the VCR. But as usual, at least one toy managed to
create some hysteria and resentment among adults who were going
crazy to get their hands on it. It was Furby, the doll manufactured
by the Tiger Electronics unit of Hasbro.It speaks an imaginary
language called ``Furbish.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Jenkins, a cashier who also lives in Jacksonville, said
she arrived at a Wal-Mart Stores outlet at 6 a.m. because the store
advertised a stock of Furby that would be sold on a first-come
basis. She found 70 people in line already, most of them holding
tickets to purchase Furby. ``I was disgusted,'' she said, before
trooping off to Target.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, retailers have also been forced to compete for
holiday spending dollars. Some of the diverted cash is easily
traced. The travel industry is booming, for example, as many people
choose to take trips rather than buy gifts. ``We're not really
shopping,'' said Kurt Hotto, 41, a software designer from Denver
even though he was sitting in the middle of a mall. ``We're taking
the kids to Mexico, and it's a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Other things are harder to trace, like $150 a man might spend to
give his wife an English gardening magazine, or the $500 tennis
lessons a woman may chose to give her boyfriend rather than a new
suit. Stephanie Gray, who was browsing Bloomingdale's in Manhattan
on Friday, said she was giving her husband's car a spiffy detail
job as one gift. She also said she liked to take her daughters for
a ``spa day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do more things like that than we used to,'' said Ms. Gray,
50. ``Sometimes it is neat to give things that are not from
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   But retailers profess not to be worried. ``Everybody is really
up this year,'' said Konarski, the shopping centers' executive.
``Our sales-for-the- year index is up 3.1 percent. In 1997, at this
time, it was up only 0.9 percent. People just feel like they have
more money. Inflation is flat, and job growth is strong. The fact
that things aren't getting worse may be good enough.''

CARGO JETS FACE REPAIRS ON THEIR SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration issued an
emergency order on Friday requiring eight cargo airlines to change
the way cargo doors are attached to old Boeing 727s that had been
converted to freighter use.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agency originally ordered the changes in 1991 after
discovering that the 727 aircraft skin could develop hidden cracks
at the point of attachment, but the FAA says the airlines ignored
the request.
</P>
<P>
   It had given the airlines six years to do the work. Now the FAA
has demanded that the cargo planes be inspected within the next 60
flights, and that repairs be done within 120 days or 250 flights.
Most cargo jets make only one or two flights a day.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks in the skin can make a plane depressurize at high
altitudes or even break up in flight, and aging aircraft bodies
have become a growing concern as the jet era advances into its
fifth decade, with many of the original planes still flying.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency order applies to 160 of the Boeing 727s, which
began flying commercially in 1963. The repairs are expected to cost
about $78,000 per plane and include replacing the rivets with
stronger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Some passenger planes have suffered damage in flight because of
cracks, but no cargo-plane accidents have been linked to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo doors swing up like the back gate on a minivan. The
FAA found in 1991 that airlines were installing them by fastening a
metal plate in the area as a reinforcement, a procedure that
sometimes hid cracks and allowed them to grow. Some airlines put
fabric between the plate and the skin, thus allowing moisture to
collect and encouraging corrosion, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   But its inspectors only recently discovered that cargo airlines
did not make the repairs on passenger 727s that were converted to
cargo use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an odd one,'' said Diane Spitalieri, an agency
spokeswoman. ``We're still investigating to see why everybody
seemed to be noncompliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Faquin, a spokeswoman for one of the cargo airlines,
Fedex, said it had not ignored the 1991 order but had sought and
received permission for a repair that did not include removing the
metal plate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Faquin said, it appeared that the permission was being
rescinded. She said Fedex ``has the utmost confidence in the safety
of our 727 fleet of cargo aircraft.'' She said the FAA would meet
with Fedex and other cargo airlines next week to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Phone messages left at several other cargo airlines went
unanswered Friday. But an official at one airline, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said the airlines had recently been meeting
with the FAA and discussing what steps would constitute compliance
with the 1991 order.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said its order applied to Fedex, a unit of FDX Corp.;
American International Airways; DHL Airways, a unit of DHL
Worldwide Express; Evergreen International Aviation; Express One
International; Kitty Hawk Air Cargo; Northern Air Cargo, and Ryan
International Airlines.

AN OLD PRAGMATIST IS IN AS NEW SPENDING CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal., Fla., N.C.)  (js) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. C.W. Bill Young of Florida, the new chairman
of the House Appropriations Committee, need not map strategy for
protecting his turf from empire-building Republican leaders. The
outgoing chairman did the job for him.
</P>
<P>
   In a 15-point manifesto delivered to the speaker of the house,
Young's predecessor demanded total control of the appropriations
process ``without being subject to the dictates of any other member
of Congress.'' The chairman, he declared, must be the final
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The author of that letter was Robert Livingston of Louisiana,
now the GOP choice for speaker, who, like Luther nailing his theses
to the church door, faxed his demands to Newt Gingrich's office.
Livingston quickly rescinded his ultimatum, but Gingrich stepped
down a few hours after receiving the letter.
</P>
<P>
   As Livingston's successor, Young said he held on to a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his letter was right on target,'' Young said,
deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Young, who turns 68 next month and has kept a low
profile in his 28 years in Congress, does not intend to hold
Livingston to his own petition. But he does not believe he will
need to.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston will not allow the breakdown in the appropriations
process that occurred this year, Young said. The outcome was an
end-of-the-session pile-up that resulted in a $520 billion omnibus
budget measure negotiated by a handful of people, read by few
lawmakers and disdained by Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has had that experience and he is not going to let that
happen to me,'' Young said. ``It was a terrible process. I will try
to avoid that.'' Young said he hoped to complete House spending
bills as early as June.
</P>
<P>
   Young's selection as chairman reflects the desire of Republican
House members to restore order in the post-Gingrich era. Though
senior to Livingston, Young was passed over for the helm of the
committee after the Republicans captured the majority in 1994.
Critics dismissed him as too steeped in the old-guard mentality of
the committee, where senior members of both parties got together to
protect their pet projects and parcel out money. He was seen as not
having enough Republican revolutionary fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Now those same attributes of bipartisanship, collegiality and
consensus-building are seen as desirable as Republicans try to get
the machinery of the House running smoothly in the wake of their
election losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Young is a first-class guy,'' said Rep. W.G. Hefner,
D-N.C., who served alongside Young on the panel for decades. ``And
I am just glad to see the crazies didn't take over and let somebody
else be chairman. He is deserving and is an honest broker.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a self-described conservative, Young has a reputation for
working well with Democrats. He noted that in his tenure as
chairman of the subcommittee that finances defense and
intelligence, the panel never voted on its bill but instead worked
out disagreements and passed it by mutual consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill reaches across the aisle and that is awfully important
when you are dealing with tough subject areas,'' said Rep. Jerry
Lewis, R-Cal., who will succeed Young as defense subcommittee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Young came by his ability to work with the opposition from years
of being in the minority party. When he was elected to the Florida
Senate in 1960 after a few years as an aide to a Republican
congressman, Young was the sole Republican in the chamber. Sent to
Washington in 1971, he was one of just three Republican congressmen
from the heavily Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are the only Republican state senator for quite a
while, you know you have to get along with the other side,'' said
Young, who eventually became minority leader in the Florida Senate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Because he never sought the media spotlight and concentrated for
years on defense and intelligence _ two policy areas often
considered in secret _ Young is not a well-known figure in the
House. He is probably best recognized for his imposing pompadour,
which has thinned since his early days on Capitol Hill but is still
conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   He is also something of a throwback in an institution dominated
by lawyers, businessmen, academics and other highly educated
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the hardscrabble coal country of Western Pennsylvania,
he dropped out of high school to support his family. In his office,
he keeps a photograph of the converted toolshed his family lived in
behind his grandmother's house until a flood washed the shed down
the Allegheny River.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever get to feeling, `Hey, I really am something, I am
chairman of the Appropriations Committee,' I glance at that little
house and realize I'm not anything any different from anybody
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young does not consider himself an old-school pork barreler,
despite his longevity on a committee famous for funneling money to
the districts of its members. He said he had some success keeping
his defense bill free of pure pork _ projects without sound
justification or a direct relationship to national defense or
intelligence _ but was occasionally overruled by his leaders or the
Senate. He also opposes the politically tinged riders on spending
bills that contributed to the appropriations meltdown this year.
</P>
<P>
   He makes no apologies for his determination to go after money he
thinks his state or district, St. Petersburg, deserves. Beginning
in 1986, he designated millions of dollars for a bone-marrow-donor
registry he started after a young leukemia victim from his district
died when no match could be found. When the National Institutes of
Health was cool to the idea, Young had the Navy do it.
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Young promised to vigorously seek money for the
costly plan to revitalize the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Young is far removed from the social whirl of Washington and
lives about 30 miles south of the capital, where he devotes his
dwindling free time to coaching his 11- and 14-year-old sons in
sports. A third son is in the Air Force. He said politics cost him
a first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big mistakes that people in political life get to
is they ignore the home part of it, they ignore the family part of
it,'' he said, recounting his own experience. ``I am determined not
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's ascension is symbolic of Republican gains made in
Florida, which, with 15 members, now has the second-largest
Republican delegation in the House behind California's. Other
Florida lawmakers are also moving into influential Republican
leadership positions. Rep. Tillie Fowler of Jacksonville, for
example, is the new vice chairwoman of the Republican Conference
and the highest-ranking woman in leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a turnaround for Young, who once thought he might be
the member of a permanent minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for many, many years wondering if I would ever, ever
get to serve in the majority, and probably had convinced myself
that I wouldn't'' he said. ``Now just a few years later I'm
chairman of the Appropriations Committee and that is quite a
change, I have to tell you.''

DECISIONS ON LAYOFFS, FINANCING AWAITED IN MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG prepared to
announce its $9.67 billion acquisition of the Bankers Trust Corp.
on Monday in Frankfurt, employees and investors awaited word on
several important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these issues is how many employees will be laid off
as part of the transaction. Executives involved in the merger
negotiations said administrative staff would be cut back to reduce
overlapping back office functions. At the managerial and executive
level, there are expected to be layoffs among Bankers Trust
employees in Europe and Deutsche employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Financing also remains unclear. In a statement earlier in the
week, Deutsche and Bankers said the purchase would be in cash, but
it was not clear whether Deutsche would dip into its own ample
reserves to buy Bankers or seek other ways of raising the money.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank said Wednesday that it was not planning to sell
its 12 percent ownership stake in DaimlerChrysler, the new company
created by the merger of Daimler-Benz AG and the Chrysler Corp., to
raise cash. Lawyers in the United States who are experts in
American banking law said that the DaimlerChrysler holding would
not pose regulatory problems for Deutsche in this country.
</P>
<P>
   While it is also known that a Deutsche executive, Josef
Ackermann, and Bankers Trust's chairman, Frank Newman, will jointly
oversee the new investment banking unit created by the merger, the
structure and locations of the rest of the business are not yet
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' boards have given preliminary approval to the
merger. On Sunday the boards are expected to sign off on tax and
legal issues that were resolved during the week. After the Bankers
board votes on Sunday, Newman will fly to Frankfurt for the
Deutsche board's vote.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is the largest acquisition of an American
financial institution by a foreign bank.

JAVIER GARCIA PANIAGUA, 61, HARDLINE MEXICAN OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Javier Garcia Paniagua, a former senior Mexican
official whose hardline views exemplified those of a group within
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party known as the
``dinosaurs,'' died of a heart attack on Tuesday in Guadalajara. He
was 61.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a defense minister, Garcia held many of Mexico's most
important posts during the 1976-82 government of Jose Lopez
Portillo, an era marked by anti-guerrilla campaigns,
ultranationalist foreign policies and state-dominated protectionist
economics.
</P>
<P>
   Under the traditional Mexican system in which presidents pick
their successors, Garcia was one of Lopez Portillo's two final
choices to become the governing party's presidential candidate in
1982. The president's eventual selection of Miguel de la Madrid, an
economist educated at Harvard, marked a watershed in Mexican
politics, dividing the PRI into two camps and ushering in an era in
which foreign-trained technocrats have dominated the Mexican
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   De la Madrid was succeeded in 1988 by Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
a Harvard-trained economist, who was in turn succeeded by Ernesto
Zedillo, a Yale-trained economist, in 1994. All of them have been
leaders of the technocrat wing of the PRI, which has faced constant
opposition from the party's traditional politicians, who are
schooled in populist politics and pork-barrel methods of government
and who are called dinosaurs because they have resisted party
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was born on Feb. 13, 1937, the son of Marcelino Garcia
Barragan, an army general who became Mexico's defense minister
during the 1960s. Perhaps because of his long-standing ties to the
armed forces, Zedillo sent Gen. Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, the
current defense minister, to carry his condolences to Garcia's
family in Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's first public post, during the late 1960s, was as
manager of a state-run agricultural bank. His family ties to power
allowed him to rise quickly, and the PRI installed him in the
Senate in 1970 when he was only 33 years old, ignoring a
constitutional requirement that senators be at least 35.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the president named Garcia to head the Federal Security
Directorate, the powerful plainclothes police agency. In that post,
he directed a violent counterinsurgency campaign that virtually
wiped out several leftist guerrilla groups. During the last three
years of Lopez Portillo's presidency, he rose to serve as a deputy
interior minister, agrarian reform secretary and president of the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   A year before Lopez Portillo finally selected his candidate,
many newspapers were already suggesting that Garcia would be the
choice, and he made clear in public statements that he expected to
be named. But plunging world oil prices in 1982 sank Mexico into a
lengthy debt crisis, and Lopez Portillo picked de la Madrid because
he wanted a candidate with good relations in the international
banking community.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that he had been passed over, Garcia barely
contained his fury, and after a three-month stint as labor
minister, retired from public life. In 1990, he returned to serve
as Mexico City's police chief and then to head the national
lottery, but only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   He lived his last years in retirement in Mexico City, in
Guadalajara and at his ranch in Jalisco state.
</P>

49ERS' SO-CALLED INCONSISTENCIES HAVE FASSEL WORRIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As part of his preparation, Jim Fassel,
like any other coach in the National Football League, peruses the
newspapers from the city of his upcoming opponent. When he thumbed
through this week's stories from San Francisco, it stopped his
leisurely breakfast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a weakness in the 49ers, he found stories deriding
the team's inconsistencies, and a questioning tone, even from
within the team, that it is the same offensive power it has been
for years. Jerry Rice was voicing dissatisfaction with the number
of times he gets the ball, even though he has 61 catches.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel did not have to compare the stories to his own notes that
show the 49ers (8-3) with the leading offense in the NFL to know
that it could be a long Monday night at 3Com Park for the New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``You get the clips and they're
talking about their offense and inconsistencies. I'm going, `You
guys are No. 1 in the NFL. Where does that put everybody else?'
People are talking about their offense and can they do it. Are they
still the same? Yeah, they're pretty good. They're real good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This season's model of the 49ers has differed little from 49ers
teams of the past, averaging a league-best 422.2 yards per game.
The 49ers are on pace to finish the season with 6,754 yards, just
182 shy of the NFL record. Steve Young has guided the offense with
27 touchdown passes and Garrison Hearst needs just 61 yards to
record his second straight 1,000-yard rushing season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Giants (4-7) bring an offense that went 11
quarters without a touchdown before finally breaking through in the
second half against the Philadelphia Eagles last week. And the
Giants have not scored a touchdown in their last four games in San
Francisco. The last time the Giants reached the end zone in San
Francisco was Nov. 27, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to offensively score more points than we have been
lately,'' Fassel said. ``Part of the process is having more
consistency on offense, which is going to mean moving the football
on the ground, converting third downs, the turnover ratio good, and
we're going to need to win some field position on special teams.
Don't ever give them the short field because they can score quick
enough on the long field. Also, that has to result in some points,
then our defense has to play well.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short of controlling the ball from the opening kickoff right
through the end of the game, the Giants may have trouble keeping up
offensively with the 49ers. While Kent Graham is still finding his
way in his new role as the starting quarterback for the Giants, the
49ers are in a comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can read each others' thoughts,'' Giants safety Percy
Ellsworth said. ``You watch them play on film and you know half the
things that happen weren't even designed. It's not luck. It's years
of working together.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phillippi Sparks said: ``They have their own plays that have
nothing to do with the game plan. I'll give you one. If Rice gets
behind the guy on him _ regardless of the route called _ he throws
his arm up over his head and regardless of the route called, Young
throws the ball to him immediately. That's their signal. Jerry
says, `I'm open.' Steve says, `Here's the ball.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had experienced that queasy feeling of seeing the
hand go up and the ball soar over his head, Sparks said that it had
never happened to him. But good or bad, he does not want to dwell
on the Giants' history of troubles in San Francisco. He is focused
on trying to contain Rice and the 49ers' other receivers, J.J.
Stokes and Terrell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like going back to the past,'' Sparks said. ``That
doesn't matter to me. What actually matters is your next game, your
next play. That's the only thing I can think of. I was there when
they beat us bad there, but I also remember when we beat them bad
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are powerful. I'm not going to be up here being silly.
They are very powerful offensively. We're going to have to play a
great game defensively and make sure, no big plays.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have faced other versions of the West Coast offense
this season with varying success. Against the Green Bay Packers,
the Giants were roughed up for 37 points. Against the Eagles, the
Giants posted their first shutout in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have teams in the league that run the exact same
offense,'' Sparks said. ``I just think the personnel make the
offense. You can put different players in, but when you have a
Stokes, Owens, Rice, all three can start for any team in the league
and they run the same exact stuff that everybody else does, but
they do it a little bit quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giants' MICHAEL STRAHAN sat out for the second consecutive
day with stiffness in his back, but Coach JIM FASSEL said it was
cautionary and he expected Strahan to play Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ CARLTON GRAY, who signed with the Giants after being waived by
the Colts, said that he was not frustrated with his role, despite
being removed from his spot in the nickel defense. ``I want to
contribute,'' said Gray, who injured his right ankle slightly late
in practice Friday when he caught a cleat in the grass. ``Everybody
wants to play. But I understand it. I understood it when I came
here. Even though JASON SEHORN is hurt, CONRAD HAMILTON has played
well.''

 &HT;    Tech is Dog tired
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the excitement of last week's 63-35 pounding of
Wake Forest, the ACC co-championship and a Gator Bowl invitation,
Georgia Tech junior running back Phillip Rogers declared: ``Georgia
Tech football is back.''
</P>
<P>
   In every way but one, maybe. That will have to be settled today
in the 93rd meeting of Georgia Tech and Georgia, in a game
nationally televised on CBS from Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   One more Bulldogs win will give Georgia eight in a row, matching
the longest streak in the series, by Tech over Georgia, 1949-1956.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has dominated the 1990s with seven consecutive
victories, but the wins have gotten tougher year by year. The
Yellow Jackets find little consolation in that trend but figure
that a win today turns an otherwise good season into an excellent
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest game of the year, and everybody knows
that,'' Rogers said. ``We've got to give it everything we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech players were not supposed to talk about the Georgia game
before this week, but they've been thinking about it ever since
last year's 24-21 loss to Georgia on the Mike Bobo-to-Corey Allen
touchdown with eight seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this year the teams, both 8-2, are both nationally
ranked for the first time since Bobby Dodd's last season as Tech
coach, 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and then there's the matter of former Georgia Tech signee
Quincy Carter, the quarterback who first picked professional
baseball over Tech and then, worse, chose the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be real excited to play him,'' Rogers said,
leaving it at that.
</P>
<P>
   As for the streak, senior tailback Charlie Rogers said, ``We've
lost to them since I've been here. I'm tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past few years, Tech's bowl trip is set, meaning that
the game is stripped to its essence, from the Yellow Jacket
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any distractions,'' Charlie Rogers said. ``It's
a pride thing now. When you've got a bully beating you up all the
time, it's time to step up and take the challenge.

 &HT;    Georgia, Georgia Tech meet with the teams' best records since
1966
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ When Georgia last hosted Georgia Tech, in 1996,
the two coaches were working overtime just to get themselves and
their programs noticed. What a difference two years _ and winning _
makes.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, 1996, Georgia's Jim Donnan was in the process of
posting a 5-6 record in his first year as a Division I-A head
coach. But after a 10-2 season in 1997 and an 8-2 record this year,
Donnan has turned down one coaching offer (North Carolina) and is
flirting with another (Oklahoma).
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Georgia Tech's George O'Leary saw his team finish 5-6
after a 19-10 loss to Georgia. But after two consecutive bowl teams
and a share of the 1998 ACC title with Florida State, O'Leary
earned a call from Auburn when it started looking for a coach.
</P>
<P>
   The two coaches have their programs on the rise when No. 12
Georgia (8-2) meets No. 17 Georgia Tech (8-2) at noon today in
Sanford Stadium. The two teams haven't been this good at this point
of the season since 1966 when 8-1 Georgia beat 9-0 Georgia Tech
23-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good for football in our state, no matter how you
slice it,'' Donnan said. ``Two good teams playing in a great
rivalry. I'm going to be surprised if it's not a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech has accepted an invitation to the Gator Bowl, and
Georgia apparently is headed to either the Citrus Bowl or the
Outback Bowl. So the postseason is set. But a lot remains at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech will be trying to snap a seven-game losing streak
to Georgia, including last year's 27-24 heartbreaker, in which the
Bulldogs won with eight seconds left. Georgia has won the last
three games by a total of 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has a chance to win 10 games for the second season in a
row for the first time since 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the intangibles: pride, recruiting, bragging
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pride is very important,'' O'Leary said. ``We want to keep the
rivalry in the game, but it's not a rivalry if one team is winning
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other games today are important:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Nashville, No. 1 Tennessee (10-0) has a chance to close out
a perfect regular season at Vanderbilt (2-8). The Volunteers play
Mississippi State next Saturday in Atlanta for the SEC
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 9 Notre Dame (9-1) travels to Southern California (7-4),
where a win probably would put the Irish in the Sugar Bowl or the
Orange Bowl. However, they will be without injured quarterback
Jarious Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 19 Miami (7-2) visits No. 21 Syracuse (7-3) for the Big
East title. The winner probably lands in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Blacksburg, Va., Virginia (8-2), which will play in the
Peach Bowl, closes out its regular season against No. 20 Virginia
Tech (8-2).

 &HT;    Jackets need victory to keep rivalry interesting
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ There is heartbreak and there is what Georgia Tech
has experienced against Georgia the past three years:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1995 in Atlanta, Georgia Tech led 17-7 after Dave Frakes
kicked a 30-yard field goal with 13:11 left in the game. Georgia
scored a touchdown and a two-point conversion with 8:51 remaining,
then drove from its 10-yard line to get a 34-yard field goal from
Kanon Parkman with 47 seconds left to win 18-17.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, Tech jumped out to a 7-0 lead in Sanford Stadium and
trailed 13-10 at halftime. But the Yellow Jackets were shut out in
the second half and lost 19-10.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, the Jackets seemingly had the game won when Charles
Wiley scored on a 3-yard run to give them a 24-21 lead with 48
seconds left. But after Georgia Tech put the ensuing kickoff out of
bounds, the Bulldogs drove the length of the field, aided by a
controversial pass-interference call, and scored with eight seconds
left to win 27-24.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make even the heartiest Yellow Jacket cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played several tough, tight games with Georgia but
that's not good enough,'' Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary said.
``We've got to find a way to win one of these close ones.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the good things about rivalries in college football is
that there's always next year. It's one of the countless things
that make the college game superior to the pros. Today, Georgia
Tech marches into Sanford Stadium with an opportunity to reverse
the heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the picks:
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 Georgia Tech (8-2) at No. 12 Georgia (8-2), Noon, CBS:
Georgia Tech has a healthy Joe Hamilton at quarterback and a
superior kicking game with punter Rodney Williams and return man
Charlie Rogers. The game comes down to whether the Tech defense can
handle Georgia's big playmakers: QB Quincy Carter and receivers
Champ Bailey and Tony Small. One of them is going to decide the
game in favor of the Bulldogs. Georgia 28, Georgia Tech 24.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Tennessee (10-0) at Vanderbilt (2-8), 3:30 p.m., JPT
(WATL): The question is not how, but how much. The Vols need to put
up a big number to make sure there is no slippage in the polls.
They will succeed. Tennessee 56, Vanderbilt 3.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 Notre Dame (9-1) at Southern California (7-4), 8 p.m.,
ABC: The Irish will rely heavily on running back Autry Denson now
that QB Jarious Jackson is out because of an injury. Logic says
Notre Dame loses. But logic does not include the luck of the Irish.
Notre Dame 17, Southern California 14.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Michigan (8-3) at Hawaii (0-11), 9:30 p.m., ESPN2: A nice
trip for the Wolverines, who lost their chance at the Rose Bowl
last week. But it won't be much of a game. Michigan 45, Hawaii 7.
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 Virginia (8-2) at No. 20 Virginia Tech (8-2), noon, ESPN:
It's been a weird year for Virginia Tech, which lost at home to
Temple and at the buzzer to Syracuse. The Hokies are hard to beat
in Blacksburg. Virginia Tech 21, Virginia 14.
</P>
<P>
   No. 19 Miami (7-2) at Syracuse (7-3), 3:30 p.m., CBS: The Big
East championship is on the line. Syracuse quarterback Donovan
McNabb needs this win to cement his legacy. But Miami has the most
balanced offense in the conference with quarterback Scott Covington
and running back Edgerrin James. Miami 31, Syracuse 28.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (6-5) at No. 23 Penn State (7-3), 1 p.m.:
Michigan State has been the giant-killer, as the only team to beat
Notre Dame and Ohio State. Penn State has been pounded 79-12 in
losses to Wisconsin, Ohio State and Michigan. The Spartans can run
but not well enough to win at Happy Valley. Penn State 24, Michigan
State 20.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (5-5) vs. North Carolina State (7-3) at
Charlotte, 1 p.m.: N.C. State already has accepted an invitation to
the Micron Bowl, while the Tar Heels are trying to get bowl
eligible. It was been a tough week for N.C. State after three
players were arrested in connection with the shooting death of a
fellow student. North Carolina 17, N.C. State 10.
</P>
<P>
   Last week: 15-5
</P>
<P>
   This season: 181-56 (76.4 percent)

 &HT;    Dronett tackling art world

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shane Dronett does not look like an artist, or even
someone who would appreciate art. But looks deceive, and the
Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle has his own gallery to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to his two-month-old store in Duluth won't find any
works by Picasso or Monet, or maybe anybody known at all, but they
will recognize a lot of what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sports Canvas'' is one of a handful of galleries in the
U.S. dedicated solely to sports art, and most of the athletes
portrayed on the walls of the 2,800-square-foot galary are
instantly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Local artist Lee Bivens has a large acrylic of Atlanta boxer and
world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield landing a punch on the
chin of Mike Tyson. On other walls are charcoal, oil, pencil and
watercolor paintings of Mickey Mantle, Muhammad Ali, Arnold Palmer,
Emmitt Smith, Tiger Woods, Yogi Berra, Michael Jordan and many
other sports heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of pieces depict the exploits of Falcons, Braves, Hawks,
Georgia Tech and Georgia athletes. Many of the 175 or so pieces are
remarkable. For example, sweat on the face of former Yankee pitcher
Whitey Ford looks as if it was literally sprayed on the large
black-and-white Intoy Ginez pencil drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett, in the middle of a career year with 59 tackles, six
sacks and 18 quarterback pressures, started sketching when he was
in high school in Bridge City, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have any works on display, but when childhood friend
Ty Gipson suggested the concept for the gallery earlier this year,
Dronett bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a new industry,'' he said. ''It's kind of taking
hold like the sports-card industry did, and people are just now
starting to accept it as fine art rather than a bunch of sports
posters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gipson was working in sports promotion in the early 1990s before
he ended up working at The Ballpark in Arlington in what some
consider the first full-time, all-sports art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggested it to Shane,'' said Gipson, who manages the
gallery, ``and told him I thought the whole sports-art world was
getting bigger and bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivens painted a mural in the entrance to give the place the
feel of an old-time ballpark, and track lighting illuminates much
of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The name of Leroy Neiman may be the most recognizable name in
sports art. While there are no Neiman originals at The Sports
Canvas, Gipson can get them sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bivens and Jay Stewart are the only two local artists on
display, except for Falcons rookie tackle Jose Portilla, whose
outdoor portraits dominate one corner.
</P>
<P>
   Artworks range from original paintings to limited-edition
prints, sculptures and hand-sized figurines of many stadiums.
Prices range from $10,000-$17,000.

 &HT;    Reeves: Chandler `close to out'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barring a ``miracle,'' Atlanta Falcons quarterback
Chris Chandler will not play Sunday at St. Louis, as a sprained
ankle kept him out of practice again on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's about as close to being (declared) out as you can be,''
coach Dan Reeves said. ``I can't see any way. I've seen miracles
before, and that's what it would take.''
</P>
<P>
   It might take a miracle to get Reeves to name his starter for
Sunday's game against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   He's not tipping his hand, although second-year player Tony
Graziani continued to draw compliments Friday from Reeves. Graziani
was sharp in directing the Falcons' No. 1 offense.
</P>
<P>
   The former seventh-round draft choice from Oregon met with
disaster in his only other pro start, at Carolina last season. He
completed 4-of-18 passes for 24 yards and two interceptions, and
was replaced in the second half by Billy Joe Tolliver. The Panthers
won 20-12.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, who completed 7-of-14 passes for 87 yards and an
interception in a reserve role against the New York Jets last
month, appears to have added arm strength since last season through
weight training. He's also a little quicker to read defenses and
make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice (Friday) helped Tony in particular because he
normally doesn't take any plays (with the No. 1 offense),'' said
Reeves. ``He's not as far along as he would be if he were, say,
(Arizona second-year QB) Jake Plummer, who's played every game and
experienced things. But he's learned the best he can.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 208-pound Graziani said it's about time to win a
game without Chandler. Atlanta is 14-4 when Chandler starts and
finishes, but 2-7 in the nine games he's been injured in or missed
altogether. The Falcons lost both games Chandler missed last year,
and lost 28-3 this year when he missed the Jets game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all tired of hearing about it, and Chris is, too. He
wants to play, but he can't,'' Graziani said. ``So we have to get
it done. (The Rams are) going to come after me, I know that ... but
I was wet behind the ears (when he made his first start), and now
I'm only a little wet behind the ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg is the Falcons' other reserve QB.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was the only Falcon who didn't practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   WR/RB Tim Dwight, who has missed four straight games with a
strained knee, didn't practice Thursday with an infection in the
knee, but was out there Friday. The knee is red and swollen, and
Dwight is taking antibiotics. But while Reeves said Dwight's bursa
sac may have to be drained, he expects the rookie to return punts
and kickoffs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This game has been circled on Dwight's calendar for a long time.
He has a virtual busload of family and friends trekking to St.
Louis from his hometown of Iowa City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Early inactives
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons Friday de-activated LB Ben Talley, CB Darren
Anderson, DT Shawn Swayda, and OL Dave Widell. ... The Rams
de-activated WR Isaac Bruce (hamstring), S Toby Wright (knees), LB
and former Falcon Lorenzo Styles (dislocated shoulder, first
injured against Atlanta Nov. 1), and G Mike Verstegen.
</P>
<P>
   High voltage
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won't have to concern themselves with Bruce, the
dangerous-but-chronically hamstrung WR who torched them for 10
catches, 233 yards and two touchdowns last year in Atlanta. He
missed the game four weeks ago with a strained hamstring, and will
miss this one with the same injury _ to the other leg.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will have no such luck with running back Amp Lee, who
missed the first game against the Falcons with a broken thumb.
He'll play, and that could be trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing two games and catching no passes in the game in
which he was injured, Lee is tied with WR Ricky Proehl for the team
lead in receptions (40), and is third in yards with 422. That's
second in the NFC and fourth in the NFL in receptions by a RB, and
second in the NFC in receiving yards by a RB.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lee led all NFL backs with 61 catches and 825 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He provides a matchup problem for the Falcons, who will cover
him with a combination of SLB Henri Crockett, WLB Cornelius
Bennett, and safeties Eugene Robinson, Devin Bush and William
White.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also will face more CB coverage than a RB would normally
get, as he'll draw special attention in nickel and dime situations.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Season ticket holders will have first priority on playoff
tickets if the Falcons qualify with a win Sunday, and then fans who
pay a deposit on season tickets for next year will have next
priority. Remaining tickets would go on sale to the public in
December.

`THE WOMEN OF ORLEANS': PROVIDING A PHYSICAL FORM FOR THE
EMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kristin Marting probably won't care for this analogy,
but ``The Women of Orleans'' made me think of ``Ally McBeal.'' Ms.
Marting's play, set in New Orleans in the first half of the 19th
century, is far more elegant than the Fox television series about
an anxiety-plagued Boston lawyer in short skirts, but both works
take unorthodox approaches to conveying their characters' emotions
physically.
</P>
<P>
   When Ally finds herself enamored, a big cartoonish heart appears
and beats loudly outside her chest. When characters in ``The Women
of Orleans'' feel a little off balance, they literally tip over.
When one is trying to control another, the man brings out an actual
chain and ties it around the woman's waist.
</P>
<P>
   One character, Micaela Pontalba (Gretchen Lee Krich), spends
much of this odd but enchanting one-act play with her hands at her
neck, demonstrating the sensation of being choked.
</P>
<P>
   The real Micaela, the future Baroness de Pontalba, had good
reason to feel that way. Her marriage turned into nothing more than
decades of legal battles over dowries and inheritance. Her
father-in-law, here called Agricola Pontalba (Richard Toth),
finally took matters into his own hands and shot her several times
with his dueling pistols. But she was 40 and tough by then, and she
survived.
</P>
<P>
   In the theatrical version, which Ms. Marting directed,
choreographed and adapted (with Celise Kalke) from Kate Chopin's
novel ``The Awakening'' and George Washington Cable's
``Grandissimes,'' as well as newspaper accounts and a biography of
the baroness, this scandalous event takes place amid a swirl of
love affairs, voodoo spells and racial-cultural conflict inside and
outside the family.
</P>
<P>
   Some might consider ``The Women of Orleans'' a dance work rather
than theater. At times the vocabulary of gestures does look like
interpretive dance. But it's the combination of those gestures
(which don't always involve the feet), the pronouncements that act
as dialogue (``Fortunately, most of us do not love hard enough to
be killed by it''; ``I have never known a Negro I hated'') and
Matthew Pierce's haunting music, performed by a five-piece
orchestra, that adds up to a memorable reverie. And there is not a
weak link in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Women of Orleans'' continues through Dec. 20 at Here,
whose theater is a little too small for this production. It's
difficult to keep an eye on all eight characters at the same time.
Certainly, the choreography can be appreciated one character at a
time, but it's clear that there's an overall pattern onstage that
needs to be appreciated from farther back than the third or fourth
row.
</P>

JETS' FABINI AND PANTHERS' GREENE PREPARE TO SQUARE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ One is old and one is young. One has a
reputation as the most flamboyant pass rusher in pro football, and
one is ... well, an offensive lineman. One is an elite player who
does celebrity cameos in the ring; the other is ... well, a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   All week, Kevin Greene of the Carolina Panthers and Jason Fabini
of the New York Jets have been circling each other from different
cities, different perspectives, different sides.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini said of Greene: ``He rushes the passer _ that's his
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said of Fabini: ``I understand he's a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabini and Greene square off Sunday when the teams meet at the
New Jersey Meadowlands in the start of a season-ending five-game
stretch for the Jets. If the Jets sweep, they will capture the the
team's first division title since 1969. First up is the Carolina
game, where Fabini's assignment is to stop Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched him wrestle a few times,'' Fabini said Friday.
Hulk Hogan is a good friend of Greene's, and Greene has been seen
on television throwing people around the arena.
</P>
<P>
   But until this week, Fabini had never focused on Greene in a
football way. He got an eyeful: Greene's 14 sacks are unsurpassed
in the National Football League this year, equaled only by the
Packers' Reggie White. Greene's 147 career sacks lead all
linebackers in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never studied the guy in depth,'' Fabini said, ``but
obviously, he leads the NFL in sacks. He's a very smart guy. Very
strong, very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The matchup is intriguing. The 36-year-old Greene, in his 14th
year, is the Panthers' designated pass rusher from his left outside
linebacker position. More than almost any other linebacker in the
league, Greene tussles with offensive tackles. His is a dual role,
however, because Carolina has problems defending against the pass.
Thus he will drop back into coverage as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini, meanwhile, has been such a quick study at right tackle
that coach Bill Parcells comes close to gushing over him. The coach
talks of Fabini's intelligence, his understanding of the game. Now
the club's only rookie starter, Fabini caught the eye of the Jets'
management early on.
</P>
<P>
   When Jets player personnel director Dick Haley watched Fabini
play for the University of Cincinnati last year, Haley came back
the next morning and said: ``I finally saw a football player
Friday. Forget all the talk about athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Jets' coaches were calling him a throwback
who plays simply for the love of the game. At the time, Fabini was
merely a fourth-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, Fabini was penalized for false starts in
five straight games. And he recalls giving up a few sacks, but his
transition to the pro trenches has been remarkably smooth. ``He
hasn't really struggled as a rookie,'' said Kevin Mawae, the Jets'
veteran center. ``And if he did, Bill Parcells would let him know
it. He makes his blocks, and that's the hardest thing to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabini, who is 6 feet 7 inches and weighs 310 pounds, will have
a size advantage against Greene, who is 6-3 and weighs 245. But the
rookie will need speed as well as strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabini's going to have his hands full,'' Parcells said. ``He
has to make sure Greene doesn't cut around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene has a history of interesting moves off the field, too.
Back in 1996, on the Tuesday before his Steelers were to face the
49ers in the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Greene flew to Las Vegas for a
ringside appointment with the dirty-dealing Ric Flair. Greene did
not actually wrestle, but he did engage in a pre-match tussle with
Flair.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Greene went to Carolina as a free agent, spent one
season there, got into a salary dispute with general manager Bill
Polian and left as a free agent for the 49ers. That lasted a year,
too, and this season Greene returned to Carolina, while Polian has
moved on to become the president of the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   But Greene might be streamlining his act. Three weeks ago, he
cut his shoulder-length hair. ``My 1-year-old was calling me
Mommy,'' he said. ``I knew it was time to cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, Greene was a captain and tank commander in the
Army Reserves. He boasts a pin with paratrooper's wings. But with a
young family, Greene decided he wanted to spend more time at home,
or at least close to football. He says he is in bed by 8:30 p.m.
and is in the weight room by 8 a.m. five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Quarterback GLENN FOLEY saw Thursday's controversial overtime
coin flip in the Steelers-Lions game and described it as deja vu.
Foley described the situation against New England on Oct. 19 this
way: ``I said tails, the ref said the call is heads. It wasn't as
big a deal because it was the beginning of the game.'' The Patriots
did not score on their opening drive. Foley said he was on the
sideline ``telling people I called tails, but nobody believed me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ CURTIS MARTIN needs 71 yards to became the fourth Jet to gain
1,000 rushing yards in a season. JOHN RIGGINS was the first,
followed by FREEMAN McNEIL and ADRIAN MURRELL.

FOR LIVENT, BANKRUPTCY IS PROVING TO BE SEVERE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Md., N.Y., Ill., Mass., Colo., Minn., Wash., Canada)  (mk) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On one level, Livent's filing for bankruptcy protection last
week seemed to resolve many questions that had been swirling in the
theater world about the financial condition of Broadway's public
production company. But over the last few days, additional grim
developments suggest how severe bankruptcy will be for the
Canada-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Productions have been canceled in theaters Livent owns or
manages in Toronto, and the Ford Center there has urged patrons to
stop buying tickets because of concerns about refunds; the
``Showboat'' tour is expected to close on Dec. 6 in Providence,
R.I., instead of continuing to New Orleans and Baltimore; the
``Ragtime'' tour hangs in the balance; creditors are wondering
whether their bills will ever be paid.
</P>
<P>
   John Breglio, an entertainment lawyer who represents several
artists and licensers who are owed money by Livent, said he had
been besieged with calls from nonclients seeking advice. ``Never
has this industry faced anything of this magnitude,'' Breglio said.
``There is no frame of reference for the people who deal in the
theatrical industry. These are small businesses. They worked on
trust with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Livent is desperately trying to find long-term
financing by the end of the month to cover the costs of
reorganization. The company got a temporary reprieve on Nov. 19,
one day after filing for bankruptcy protection, when some of the
company's wealthy board members came to the rescue with a $5
million loan to cover operating expenses for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Livent says that its outlook is optimistic and insists that its
productions of ``Ragtime'' in New York and Chicago are not in
jeopardy. Indeed, in New York it is playing to virtually full
houses, and its grosses are second only to those of ``The Lion
King.'' And Livent's new projects are so far proceeding as planned.
They are ``Parade,'' which the company produced with Lincoln Center
and which is in previews, and ``Fosse: A Celebration of Song and
Dance,'' which is to open on Broadway in January. But judging from
the events of this week, the ripple effect of its financial
difficulties has continued.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, performances at several of Livent's Toronto venues
were canceled, including ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk''
and ``Peter Pan'' at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, which
Livent manages, and concerts of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra
with Wynton Marsalis at the Pantages Theater, which the company
owns. But the North York Performing Arts Center, the corporate arm
that oversees the Ford Center, has reinstated 22 of 67 canceled
concerts. In lieu of refunds, Livent is offering tickets to
``Phantom of the Opera'' in Toronto in exchange for tickets to
canceled events.
</P>
<P>
   Pace Theatrical Group Inc., the nation's biggest tour organizer,
has petitioned the bankruptcy court for the right to produce the
Seattle engagement of ``Ragtime,'' which Livent canceled last week,
taking over the costs and liabilities of the production. Pace had
already been scheduled to present the Seattle engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Pace may also try to revive the Boston production of
``Ragtime,'' which it was scheduled to present as the final stop on
Livent's tour after Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed in federal Bankruptcy Court on Monday in
support of Pace's petition, Daniel Brambilla, Livent's executive
vice president, said: ``In light of the critical timing issues,
Pace has already undertaken significant expense by beginning to
take over responsibility for the Seattle production of `Ragtime'
(including, for example, paying moving expenses).''
</P>
<P>
   According to Brambilla's affidavit, Livent's touring company of
``Ragtime'' was unprofitable in Washington and Denver and broke
even in Minneapolis, where it was canceled last week. Livent
``could lose as much as nearly $1 million if it were to take
`Ragtime' to its next scheduled stop in Seattle,'' Brambilla said
in his court papers. ``The debtors are now facing a critical
liquidity crisis which renders them unable to sustain the losses
consequent to taking `Ragtime' to Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that national road companies now account for two-thirds of
attendance and grosses for Broadway shows, the plight of the
``Ragtime'' company points up the potential pitfalls of mounting
multiple lavish productions. Because of elaborate scenery, large
casts and long engagements, the expense of moving, installing and
running Livent productions was unusually high for the road, theater
veterans say. Indeed, sources at Livent who refused to be
identified said the company had been planning to scale down its
touring productions before the bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to court documents, the weekly payroll of
Livent's ``Ragtime'' and ``Showboat'' tours _ $240,000 and
$230,000, respectively _ was higher than that of the New York
production, $219,000. Usually, road companies cost considerably
less than Broadway productions.
</P>
<P>
   Extravagant productions and costly promotions are also usually
cited when explaining Livent's financial plight. But it also tried
to redefine itself as a corporate impresario by containing all
producing functions, including raising capital, within the company.
The effort greatly increased the risks of an already risky
business.
</P>
<P>
   When the company's new managers, Michael Ovitz and Roy Furman,
took over last spring and discovered financial irregularities, they
suspended Garth Drabinsky, the company's former creative director,
and his co-founder, Myron Gottlieb. Last week, both officers were
dismissed, and they have filed a countersuit against Livent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At this point, it appears that people who have done business
with Livent still don't know quite how to react.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Livent's top 30 unsecured creditors
include everything from law firms to set-building companies. The
Toronto office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, for
example, is owed $704,000 (all figures in U.S. dollars); Echo
Advertising and Marketing in Toronto is owed $1.6 million; Lincoln
Center Theater, which is jointly producing ``Parade'' with Livent,
is owed $248,000; the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization is owed
$132,000.
</P>
<P>
   Livent owes its own public relations firm, Robinson, Lerer &AMP;
Montgomery, $151,000, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   F&AMP;D Scene Changes Ltd. in Calgary, which said it is owed
$104,000 _ mostly for sets for ``Parade'' _ said it was supposed to
start building a new ``Ragtime'' tour and a new ``Phantom of the
Opera'' _ both of which have been canceled. ``Once the dust settles
from all of this, we'll see whether those are going ahead or
whether there's a Livent left,'' said Leyton Morris, president of
F&AMP;D.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Morris said, he saw it coming. Usually F&AMP;D
insists on payment within 30 days; Livent often took 60 to 90 days.
But Livent was also a prized client and the company took its
chances. ``We gave them a pretty long leash,'' Morris said. ``They
were our biggest customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Livent, meanwhile, continues to try to sell tickets. As a
result, the board of the Ford Center in Toronto, which was managed
and operated by Livent, has urged patrons to hold off buying
tickets and threatened legal action if Ticketmaster continues to
sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the city of Toronto _ which owns the Ford Center
there _ canceled its management contract with Livent, and Toronto's
mayor, Mel Lastman, told The Toronto Star that he was looking for
someone to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, under an unusual arrangement with Livent,
the money Ticketmaster collects from credit card orders is
immediately put into Livent accounts. Those accounts have been
frozen by Livent's major Canadian creditor, CIBC, meaning refunds
cannot be made.
</P>
<P>
   As to what will happen to Livent's theaters, the possible buyers
include the Shubert Organization, the Nederlander Organization,
Jujamcyn Theaters, Walt Disney Co. and Cablevision Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an interest,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the
Shubert Organization, ``but beyond that, we have nothing to
evaluate.''

MARKET INSIGHT: WHAT'S BEHIND THE GUSH OF OIL DEALS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Times are tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggles the mind to
accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to
either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to
do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies of all stripes are getting squeezed by low
petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration. Given
the exotic locales of the most promising untapped fields, it seems
unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And with West Texas
crude trading at around $12 a barrel, it seems a safe bet that oil
won't be selling for $100 a barrel by the turn of the century _
something analysts were predicting during the oil price run-up of
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly
and a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, Mass.,
consulting firm, spent some time late last week talking about
Mobil, Exxon and the changing dynamics of the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. There is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an
Exxon-Mobil deal. Do you see any problems?
</P>
<P>
   A. Let me say right off that I don't think this is a done deal.
I think it is far from that. But if it were to happen, I don't see
many problems.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is
little or no overlap with the company you are merging with.
Exxon-Mobil comes close.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue is competition in local markets. The only
possible problem area there is on the West Coast, but both
companies are pretty small players there.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention, it
will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly
toward either the Clinton administration's or the European Union's
positions on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are you skeptical about the deal?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, Mobil has been trying to get bigger. They had talks
with Amoco. They wanted to buy Conoco.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief
executive, fits into this. That could be an impediment to an
agreement, because in a merger I don't think he has a place, and he
has been a very strong leader.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mobil is the country's second-biggest oil company, behind
Exxon. Why do they need to get bigger?
</P>
<P>
   A. In the first decade of the next century, the really big
exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only
companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the
game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. Companies of Mobil's size
are probably marginal players.
</P>
<P>
   Q. That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the
downturn in prices.
</P>
<P>
   A. From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration and production
expenditures rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. But Mobil's
expenditures were much more sensitive to the price elasticities of
oil than Exxon's. They were pushing the envelope, and when prices
fell they had to cut back. Exxon has tried to build a very large
presence systematically, without paying much attention to
month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices.
They are brutally efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil prices
would stay soft for nearly a decade. Do you agree?
</P>
<P>
   A. You know, every time I see forecasts that go out that far I
want to go out and buy stock in oil companies. I think we are going
to see low oil prices for six months to a year. It is conceivable
we could go into the next century with oil at $5 a barrel,
depending on what happens to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction
in investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction
in supply coming out of non-OPEC countries. That will strengthen
the hands of the OPEC countries. And when the Asian economies start
growing again, that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices, say
$20 a barrel, in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The number of oil companies is going to shrink in coming
years, regardless, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   A. We are probably heading toward a world in which there are no
more than five or six big oil companies, possibly eight. There is
really no precedent for having as many big players as we have in
the oil business in this modern society.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think oil stocks are a good investment? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but
it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money
over the next 9 to 12 months. And it is an area where investors
need to be careful, because in that period there will be a good
deal of consolidation among smaller companies.

PRISONER MAKES FIRST TEXAS DEATH ROW ESCAPE SINCE DAYS OF BONNIE
AND CLYDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
And BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ |A Death Row inmate leaped from his hiding
place atop a two-story building, scaled two 12-foot, razor
wire-topped fences and fled into the darkness early yesterday as
prison guards fired automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first successful Death Row escape by a condemned
Texas prisoner since three inmates _ one of them a cohort of Bonnie
Parker and Clyde Barrow _ broke out of the old lockup in downtown
Huntsville 64 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said up to 500 officers, using helicopters and
at least 120 tracking dogs, searched throughout yesterday in the
river bottoms and pine forests surrounding the Ellis I Unit for
Martin E. Gurule, 29, who was sentenced to die for a 1992 double
slaying and robbery in Corpus Christi. Gurule was not believed to
be armed, but prison officials said they consider him dangerous and
with little to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Death Row inmates involved in the daring escape
attempt surrendered when guards opened fire from watch towers
spaced along the prison perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The escape plan had all the elements of a movie drama:
</P>
<P>
   After their longer-than-usual meal for Thanksgiving, the inmates
put dummies in their bunks to conceal their absence, peeled back a
fence in an exercise yard, climbed to the top of a two-story
building, then shortly after midnight leaped to the ground and
tried to scale the fences about 70 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Some took off their white uniforms and used felt-tipped markers
to darken their underwear, in which they were captured. Prison
officials said Gurule inked his pullover top and trousers to a
grayish tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something broke down and allowed this to happen,'' prison
spokesman Larry Fitzgerald, told The Associated Press. A ``serious
incident'' investigation team was appointed to determine what
caused the security lapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule might already have been on a perimeter fence when two
guards in a watch tower spotted the group and fired 18 to 20 rounds
from automatic rifles, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know if we hit him,'' Fitzgerald said. There was no
trace of blood at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   He said the seven men involved in the escape attempt were among
a larger group of Death Row inmates who were considered ``work
eligible,'' and were permitted to leave their work as janitors and
uniform tailors and use the exercise yard.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for the exercise yard at 8:45 p.m. Thursday, they
used clothing and bedding to craft dummies in their bunks,
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently hid for several hours on the two-story
building's flat roof. At 20 minutes past midnight, they jumped to
the ground from a wing containing the unit's chapel. Guards spotted
the inmates in the ``no man's land'' between the building and the
first of two perimeter fences about 70 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule scaled the two fences, about 10 to 20 feet apart, and
somehow got through or over the rolled razor wire atop them, prison
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 500 searchers yesterday were prison guards, state
troopers and Walker County sheriff's deputies and constables,
Fitzgerald said. Highway patrol officers were posted every tenth of
a mile along nearby U.S. 190 and Farm Road 980 leading to the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Ellis I Unit is bounded by thick pine forests on two sides.
The Trinity River runs along the rear of the sprawling, red-brick
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule, once a high school honors student, killed the owner and
a cook at a Corpus Christi restaurant during a robbery in 1992. He
and girlfriend Malisa Smith, a former employee of the restaurant,
were convicted in 1993 for the slayings. Smith was sentenced to 25
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   No date had been set for Gurule's execution. Of the 74
executions in the nation last year, exactly were in Texas. There
have been 17 executions at Huntsville in 1998, and six more are
scheduled in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although a security lapse might have permitted the inmates to go
undetected for hours and then to reach the perimeter fence, a
Huntsville historian said the prison system's record has not been
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's 60 years between escapes, that's pretty good
considering how many people who have been on Death Row,'' said
Mitchel Roth, a professor of criminal justice history at Sam
Houston State University in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   More than 450 people in Texas are under death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The only previous Texas Death Row escape was July 22, 1934. Joe
Palmer, Blackie Thompson and Raymond Hamilton, who was Clyde
Barrow's cousin and bank robbing accomplice, joined with three
general population prisoners to attempt a breakout, said Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Guards opened fire, killing one of the general population
inmates and recapturing the other two, but the three Death Row
prisoners managed to flee, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was killed by police in Amarillo. Palmer and Hamilton
were recaptured and executed on the same day in January 1935.

EDITORIAL: EDUCATION'S GENDER GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 28:
</P>
<P>
   One of the most damaging consequences of the world's economic
troubles is that parents are pulling their children out of school.
Girls are the first casualty. In most poor and even middle-income
countries, many girls stay home while their brothers go to primary
school. Countries are now recognizing the harm caused by this
educational gender gap, however, and some are trying new ideas to
get girls into school and keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Even in some countries where primary school is free, parents
must pay for uniforms, shoes, supplies and transportation. Families
also lose the economic contribution the child can make. Since girls
are likely to care for siblings and help with housework, parents
tend to need their labor at a younger age than boys'.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the developing world, moreover, girls have lower
status, and a long walk to school may be unsafe for them.
Especially in places where the quality of instruction is poor, many
families think of girls' education as a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in sub-Saharan Africa, where only half the children
age 6 to 11 go to school, 68 girls are enrolled in primary school
for every 100 boys. The gap is just as bad in many South Asian and
Middle Eastern nations. In Latin America, rural areas are the
problem. In rural Guatemala, for example, two-thirds of the girls
who start first grade drop out before third grade. As a
consequence, 60 percent of women in Guatemala cannot read.
</P>
<P>
   Rural zones worldwide are also home to the most traditional
families and people who may not speak the language of instruction.
More important, rural families are poorer than those in cities, and
their schools are both worse and more sparse.
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 years have seen new attention given to the
consequence of keeping girls out of school, spurred by several U.N.
conferences on population and women's issues. Studies show that
attention to girls' education directly affects a nation's progress.
</P>
<P>
   While educated men have more children than their unschooled
counterparts, education encourages women to marry later and have
fewer and healthier children. Educating women increases the chances
that a family will spend its income on the children. A focus on
keeping its girls in school also changes social attitudes, which
has improved school attendance for boys.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that many of the programs to keep girls in
school have been successful. Malawi doubled girls' school
attendance from 1990 to 1996 by eliminating school fees and
uniforms and adding 22,000 new teachers, so students are more apt
to find a school nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarships, some just $5 a month, compensate families for the
loss of girls' income in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Guatemala. In
some Mexican schools, children can bring the young siblings in
their care, which also gives the babies a more stimulating
environment. Many countries have increased girls' attendance simply
by improving the quality of schools and teaching.
</P>
<P>
   These pilot programs have not spread very far. Traditional
societies can be suspicious of focusing on girls. The World Bank
and regional development banks embrace girls' schooling, but the
programs needed are huge and expensive. Educating girls, however,
is a good investment, producing lower birth rates, healthier
children and a better-schooled and richer population all around.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 28:
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, Raymond Horton has served as an
indispensable nuisance for successive mayors, governors, lawmakers
and labor leaders in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   That was not his official title, of course. Horton's job has
been president of the Citizens Budget Commission and author of
countless critiques of New York City and state budget practices. He
retires Monday after a career of angering more people for more of
the right reasons for longer than almost anyone else in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Only this year, New York City officials attempted to get
corporate donors to withdraw support from the Budget Commission,
which under Horton had the audacity to question the city's fiscal
practices and labor agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The commission then held one of its most successful fund-raisers
ever. That is because outsiders have come to depend on its
analyses, and elected officials, whether they realize it or not,
have been able to use Horton's suggestions to push for better
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Horton has been more than a number cruncher. He rejects the idea
that budget gaps need to be closed by cuts in welfare, aid to the
poor or vital city services. Instead he and the commission have
shown how savings can be made by improving productivity, work rules
and sloppy management practices. Above all, Horton and the
commission have played a major role in making the city's budget
practices more open than those of most governments.
</P>
<P>
   Horton returns to writing and teaching at the Columbia School of
Business. New Yorkers will miss him.

EXXON AND MOBIL CONFIRM MERGER TALKS; ANTITRUST ISSUES RAISED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EXXON-MOBIL.) 
(htv) 
 By Stephen Labaton    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil
companies, confirmed Friday that they were discussing a possible
merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government
officials predicted that any deal would require the sale of
important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Those divestitures would further reshape an industry already
undergoing a broad transformation because of the low price of oil.
But the mergers and other corporate combinations are also beginning
to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust officials, one
that may prove particularly challenging to Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   Although the companies only confirmed that they were discussing
the possibility of a merger, a person close to the discussions said
the boards of both Exxon and Mobil were expected to meet Tuesday to
consider an agreement. Shares of both surged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily
present antitrust problems in an Exxon-Mobil merger because
competition in those areas is brisk.
</P>
<P>
   But in retailing and marketing operations, an Exxon-Mobil
combination would be ``like Ford merging with General Motors,
Macy's with Gimbels,'' said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust lawyer in
New York who represented Texaco in its acquisition of Getty more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the deal would come under the purview of
the Federal Trade Commission, which under the Clinton
administration has examined large corporate mergers with a vigor
not seen since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has blocked a number of proposed mergers, such as the
$4 billion combination of Staples and Office Depot, the two largest
office supply discounters, and two deals involving the four largest
drug wholesalers. On the other hand it has approved other big
mergers, such as Boeing's $14 billion acquisition of McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's analysis of an Exxon-Mobil combination, a senior
official said Friday, will turn on how it might resemble John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust before it was dismantled by the
Supreme Court in 1911.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The big antitrust issue is whether, by a merger or alliance,
they will be able to get the competition of one another off their
backs, particularly against the background of BP-Amoco and
Shell-Texaco,'' said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York
University School of Law and an antitrust expert. ``It may be that
we are looking at a consolidation on the world level that looked
like the consolidation on the national level 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission recently approved a significant
joint venture between Shell and Texaco after the venture agreed to
sell a refinery and divest some retailing operations in Hawaii and
California. It is also considering the proposed $54 billion merger
of British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have to re-examine that
combination in light of the new talks between Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, when there have been two mergers involving the
same industry, the government has considered them together in
deciding how to deal with them,'' said Terry Calvani, a former
commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission whose clients now
include Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   But coming in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco
deals, a combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly
overlapping retail and refinery businesses in the United States and
Europe, poses questions that antitrust officials have not
confronted since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real test case,'' said Frederick Leuffer, a senior
energy analyst at Bear Stearns. ``If the FTC let this one go
through without major divesting, then everything would be fair
game. Why couldn't GM merge with Ford?''
</P>
<P>
   While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil is viewed by Washington
officials and industry executives as ancient history, Exxon and
Mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing and
refining markets, and in the production of lubricants and
petrochemicals. Leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in
this case ``could be so large that they are deal-breakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts and lawyers, while disagreeing that the required
divestitures could kill the deal, said the companies would
nonetheless have to shed significant operations and that they
expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum of
constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not absolute obstacles,'' said John Hervey, an
analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when two big oil companies have merged, aggressive
attorneys general from the states have almost always become
involved in raising questions because of the high visibility of the
local gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a state attorney general drives by and sees four stations
on a corner and two of them are Mobil and Exxon, they are certain
to raise questions,'' Axinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations of retailing and
marketing concerns in the Northeast, the Southwest and the West
Coast, where they also have big refining operations.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two companies are involved in everything from
exploration and shipping to refining and retailing, the meaning of
the deal for consumers will take months for the regulators to sort
out.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators examining such a transaction would dissect each
business, determine whether its market is global, national or more
local, and determine whether the combined entity has too high a
concentration of the business in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to permit
Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production
businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and a
merger would not result in higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Hervey said those markets are already so fragmented that the
combined market share of major American and European oil companies
is only 17 percent.

   Earlier in this decade, on workdays, Krzysztof Oliwa did not see
much sunlight. Learning to repair machinery in the coal mines in
Poland, he woke up at 4:30 a.m., boarded a train at 5:07 a.m., went
underground at 6 a.m. and came up at 3:30 p.m. to go back and
practice hockey. ``Dirty job,'' Oliwa said of his mining career.
</P>
<P>
   ``One mistake and people can get killed,'' he said. ``Lots of
gases down there. I never got hurt, but I hit my head several
times. You get so low you have to walk on your knees almost. My
friends got hurt, they got hurt bad. They lost their fingers
because somebody made a stupid mistake. They were repairing a
machine and then somebody plugged it in and then cut off their
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 25, Oliwa still works hard with his hands, but in a
different profession. A second-year left wing with the New Jersey
Devils, Oliwa is one of only two National Hockey League players
born in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   He led the NHL in fights last season with 33 and is among the
early leaders this year with 9 in 16 games to go along with 57
penalty minutes. At 6 feet 5 inches and 235 pounds, his size and
toughness have earned him more room to work on the ice, which is
leading to more playing time and more chances to show his other
skills. On Nov. 11, Oliwa scored his first goal of the season in a
3-0 victory over Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent games, Oliwa has not dressed, partly because the
Devils have been playing talented, strong skating teams like Dallas
and Phoenix. But against teams that have some nastiness in their
game, Oliwa becomes valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Turning stereotypes inside out, he is the NHL's first
European-born enforcer, a role usually filled by English-speaking
Canadians. Oliwa also is another rarity: a professional athlete
without an agent. Though he was unable to speak English a few years
ago, his words now come in torrents, with thoughts tumbling over
each other. Unable to write a bank check until his wife taught him,
he now manages his financial investments with a computer he built.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes home from work, late in the evening, Oliwa cannot
always fall asleep. So he takes his telescope into his backyard,
even on chilly nights, and gazes into the sky, counting his
blessings and contemplating his place in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the stars and, wow, what a great thing,'' Oliwa
said. ``The distances are so great, it is hard to imagine. And
don't tell me we are alone. In the universe, we are nothing. I am
so happy I am alive. I play hockey in the NHL, I am a United States
citizen, I have a great family, my beautiful wife and my beautiful
daughter. When you look through the telescope and see the sky, all
the problems, you put them behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had a few problems in his quarter-century on this planet.
Born Krzysztof Grabowski in a town called Tychy, his mother was
divorced when he was 9. She then moved through various jobs. ``We
were poor,'' said Oliwa. He also did not skate until he was 10, and
that was not on ice, but on frozen snow in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   After his mother remarried and he was adopted by his stepfather,
he began to work in the mine and play organized hockey. But he said
he never dreamed of the NHL and had hoped to play professionally in
Germany. Urged by a scout to try out in Canada, he arrived alone in
Welland, Ontario, to play for a Junior B team in the 1992-93
season.
</P>
<P>
   Rooming with a local family, ``he slept in a basement on a cot
by a water heater,'' said his wife, Dawn. When the family had
guests for Christmas, they told Oliwa to spend the day somewhere
else. So he walked the streets, feeling a little sorry for himself.
Not knowing much English, he was a stranger in a strange land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad feeling,'' Oliwa said, ``but I said, `Hey, it
can't be that bad. I'm in Canada now and my friends back in Poland
are going to work every day in a mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   To learn English, he attended classes with high school students
five years younger than he was. ``It was the worst feeling,'' he
said, ``but they were nice. I would stay after classes and the
students would help you to read and understand. I could speak so
much better from a day-to-day basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Drafted from a level that produces few NHL players, Oliwa went
to Albany in the American Hockey League, the top circuit for
prospects. The results were mixed. He spent the next four years
playing in the AHL, as well as in the East Coast Hockey League and
the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to give up,'' said Dawn Oliwa, who met her
husband when he held the door for her at a restaurant where she
worked. ``I made him go back.'' Recalling the early years with his
wife, Oliwa said, ``She was there to help me out when I was on the
very bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Every NHL team employs one or two top fighters, so Oliwa decided
to learn the art. Not having fought in Europe, he was clumsy,
losing his balance and most of his battles.
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa took boxing lessons in one off season, karate training in
another. By the 1996-97 season, Dawn had given birth to Skylar,
their daughter, and Krzysztof was called up to the Devils for one
game, during which he got a major penalty for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   He spent all of last season with the Devils, tallying 2 goals, 3
assists and 295 penalty minutes. No one on the Devils earns less
this season than Oliwa's $325,000, but his importance is
appreciating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing a pretty good job,'' Devils coach Robbie
Ftorek said after the Montreal game Nov. 11. ``He had a good scrap.
He went to the net really well. He's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa finished the game with three shots on goal and several
hard hits. He even got a short shift on the power play. Early in
the game, Oliwa dropped the gloves to battle Turner Stevenson, but
Ftorek did not use him later, when several nasty fights broke out.
Watching from the bench, Oliwa took notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were running around, hitting our best players, and they
are getting away with it,'' Oliwa said. ``Certain things can't
happen. We're not going to allow this to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with a cool look in his blue eyes, his face
expressionless, his voice steady, his brown hair wet, curls down
the back of his neck. His is a face with strong, wide features.
When Oliwa smiles, deep creases form in his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   One person able to provoke this expression is Skylar, now 2
years old, who plays hockey with a plastic stick and puck in the
corridor while waiting for her father to leave the locker room for
the trip home. Dawn Oliwa says Krzysztof is ``a good father'' who
feeds the baby, changes diapers, gives baths and ``spoils her.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa seems to take well to nurturing roles. David Conte, the
Devils' director of scouting, said that several current junior
players in Canada who are from Poland have asked to speak with
Oliwa and that Oliwa generously counsels them. Conte said that when
Oliwa was chosen 65th over all in the 1993 draft, he probably had
played fewer games in his life than most North American prospects
play in one year, so he had a lot to learn. ``In a day and age of
instant gratification, he has a great appreciation for what has
come his way,'' Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding that he usually does not like discussing players with
reporters, Conte says he makes an exception in Oliwa's case because
he admires his perseverance and dedication. ``We haven't seen the
best yet of Krzysztof Oliwa,'' Conte said. ``In 20 years, whenever
he retires, I'll be pleased to say I know him. He is a good person.
He is refreshing.''

CLINTON YIELDS NO GROUND IN RESPONSES TO HYDE QUERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-TEXT, CLINTON-IMPEACH-PERJURY.) 
(js) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton insisted once again Friday that
he did not lie under oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, in
terse, formal responses to 81 questions submitted by the House
Judiciary Committee. But he reiterated that he had misled his
family, his aides and the nation about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shed little new light on issues surrounding the
impeachment inquiry, a goal his lawyers set when they received the
committee's questionnaire on Nov. 5. Many of his replies are spare
and unyielding, simply denying that he lied in earlier testimony,
referring to previous statements or to the grand jury testimony of
other major witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He is asked repeatedly whether he lied to friends and advisers
about Ms. Lewinsky; three times he admits that he misled people but
says he has already apologized for it.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement accompanying his responses, Clinton said that, at
least for him, the Lewinsky affair ``long ago ceased to be
primarily a legal or political issue.'' He said he would continue
to fight against impeachment as he continued to seek forgiveness
from his family and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is drawing up three possible articles of
impeachment against the president while the White House and its
allies are seeking to negotiate some lesser form of punishment,
like a congressional resolution of censure. The articles under
consideration would allege perjury, obstruction of justice and
witness tampering, and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the committee's questions suggested an attempt to elict
answers at variance with those in Clinton's previous sworn
testimony to help build a perjury case against him.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and his lawyers did not fall for the trap. Clinton
does not acknowledge any inconsistencies or falsehoods in his
testimony and if the committee wants to find perjury, they will
have to do it without his help, one of Clinton's advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't no perjury here,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, offered
no substantive response Friday evening to Clinton's submission.
``The committee will now carefully review those responses,'' he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Clinton acknowledged Friday that he had
discussed how to handle the Lewinsky matter with Dick Morris, a
political adviser who himself had been embroiled in a sex scandal
during the 1996 presidential campaign, just hours after the
president's affair became public on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the committee's questions, the president said he
was aware that Morris had conducted a poll on public attitudes
about the Lewinsky revelations to gauge whether the president
should publicly admit the affair to defuse the scandal. But Clinton
said he did not recall telling Morris ``we just have to win, then''
when told that the public would not tolerate admissions by the
president of obstruction of justice or subornation of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton also admitted for the first time that his lawyers
and his re-election campaign had hired two well-known private
investigators, Terry Lenzner and Jack Palladino. But Clinton
provided only a vague description of their duties, saying they were
engaged for ``legal and appropriate tasks'' and ``a variety of
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he also had consulted with Betsey
Wright, his former chief of staff and scandal control officer when
he was governor of Arkansas, ``on a wide range of matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, in grand jury testimony in August, described Lenzner,
Palladino and Ms. Wright as part of a ``White House Secret Police
Operation'' used to dig up dirt on the president's political
opponents. White House officials have denied the existence of such
a unit and said that the private detectives and Ms. Wright were
used only for legitimate investigative jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee sought answers to numerous questions
that arose from the lengthy referral of Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, to help determine whether Clinton is guilty of
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was hoping to secure concise factual responses from
the president to questions that gave rise to Starr's accusations
that Clinton committed perjury, obstruction of justice, witness
tampering and abuse of power in his efforts to conceal his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the president and his lawyers frustrated the committee's
effort with a series of terse answers that for the most part
repeated Clinton's prior assertions and offered little new insight
on a matter that has produced thousands of hours of testimony and
tens of thousands of pages of commentary. One White House adviser,
speaking on condition on anonymity, said that the answers to most
of the questions were already in the public record. ``I don't think
the ball has been moved much by this exercise,'' this adviser said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's lead private lawyer, said that the
president's 24-page response to the committee was made ``in good
faith'' and in an effort to provide ``as much information as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall, in a letter accompanying the president's replies,
stated emphatically, ``the president did NOT commit or suborn
perjury, tamper with witnesses, obstruct justice or abuse power.''
He referred to earlier reports to the panel in which the president
acknowledged an improper personal relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
but asserted that none of his actions warranted impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   James Jordan, spokesman for Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee, called the panel's questionnaire ``a silly, redundant
and wholly partisan political exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Clearly, the committee majority is interested less
in shedding new light on the allegations against the president than
in playing frivolous semantical games.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief introduction to Friday's reply to the committee's
questionnaire, Clinton said that he intends to vigorously contest
the impeachment inquiry now before the committee. However, the
president added, ``the fact that there is a legal defense to the
various allegations cannot obscure the hard truth, as I have said
repeatedly, that my conduct was wrong. It was also wrong to mislead
people about what happened, and I deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also told the panel that the impeachment inquiry
``long ago ceased to be primarily a legal or political issue and
became instead a painful personal one, demanding atonement and
daily work toward reconciliation and restoration of trust with my
family, my friends, my administration and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's document, Clinton repeatedly stated that the answers
he gave in his deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit and in his grand jury testimony in the Lewinsky
investigation were not ``false and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   He also claimed a faulty memory on many of the central charges
in the investigation, including the subject of numerous telephone
conversations he had with Ms. Lewinsky and with his close friend,
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job. He says
that he does not believe he saw an affidavit Ms. Lewinsky signed
for the Jones case denying a sexual relationship, ``although I
cannot be absolutely sure.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a number of questions _ about the affidavit,
about Jordan's job search on Ms. Lewinsky's part, about gifts they
exchanged _ Clinton repeatedly said, ``I do not recall'' or ``I do
not remember.''
</P>
<P>
   And he resorted again to the verbal gymnastics that Starr and
many in Congress consider to be at best disingenuous and at worst
perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked whether he had affirmed that Ms. Lewinsky's
affidavit denying a sexual relationship was true. He referred the
committee to his January deposition and his August grand jury
testimony. ``I believe at the time that she filled out this
affidavit, if she believed that the definition of sexual
relationship was two people having intercourse, then this is
accurate,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee asked the president a number of
questions about one of the central aspects of the Lewinsky
investigation, a meeting Clinton had with his personal secretary,
Betty Currie, the day after he was questioned by the Jones lawyers
during his deposition in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged calling her into work on a Sunday and
asking her certain questions about what she knew about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said in his report that the questions _ such as ``Monica
came on to me and I never touched her, right?'' and ``You were
always there when she was there, right?'' _ were evidence of an
illegal effort to tamper with a potential witness in the Jones
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's reply to the committee, Clinton said, ``I believe
that I asked her certain questions, in an effort to get as much
information as quickly as I could, and made certain statements,
although I do not remember exactly what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also asserted that he never encouraged Mrs. Currie to lie
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that, in the immediate aftermath of the
revelation of the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, he had told
numerous friends and senior advisers that he had not had a sexual
affair with the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have previously acknowledged, I did not want my family,
friends, or colleagues to know the full nature of my relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky,'' Clinton said in Friday's response. ``I misled
people about this relationship. I have repeatedly apologized for
doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr characterized these misleading comments, which White House
aides repeated in public in the president's defense, as an abuse of
presidential power, one of the 11 possible grounds for impeachment
cited in his report to Congress.

EDITORIAL: SORTING OUT THE SUBWAY SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and rapid-transit advocates have issued wish lists
imploring New York City Transit to spend most, if not all, of its
1998 surplus, now more than $170 million and rising, on improving
subway and bus service.
</P>
<P>
   They are surely right that running more subways and buses,
cleaning trains and stations more frequently and trying new
experiments with Metrocard fare discounts deserve top spots on the
transit system's priority list.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be foolish to treat this expanding pot of money as
though New Yorkers have collectively stumbled across sunken
treasure. The modest surplus can help improve service but is hardly
enough to make major progress in meeting riders' needs.
</P>
<P>
   What many blithely define as the transit system's ``surplus'' is
simply the amount by which actual revenues are exceeding a
conservative revenue forecast that could finance only a subpar
level of transit service to begin with. During the two rush hours,
for example, just half the 20 lines have intervals between trains
of five minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surplus, the system will continue to rely on
subsidies, including various forms of state aid, which makes
``surplus'' something of a misnomer. Still, it can only be a cause
for joy that an unanticipated surge of hundreds of thousands of new
riders, lured by new Metrocard fare discounts, free transfers and a
decent economy, has generated larger than expected revenues.
</P>
<P>
   That should give managers the ability to at least triple the $50
million in service improvements already promised. Every straphanger
who stands during rush hour, for example, is entitled to 3 square
feet of room under the system's own guidelines. On many lines such
space is as scarce as a seat. More trains should be added, both to
cut intervals between trains and to relieve overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   But transforming rapid transit into a reliable, pleasant service
worthy of New York's residents and visitors is a capital-intensive
endeavor. It will entail upgrading signal systems, acquiring more
subway cars, rebuilding stations and even expanding the subway
network.
</P>
<P>
   The next five-year capital plan should be much more ambitious
than the $11.9 billion one that expires Dec. 31, 1999. It is
important to use the system's unanticipated operating revenue
wisely. But that should only be a dress rehearsal for developing an
ambitious capital plan.

EDITORIAL: BANKS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The global financial market can move trillions of dollars around
the world within minutes, but the major players are usually viewed
as being from one country or another. Even those companies that
operate in many countries, such as Citigroup or Merrill Lynch, are
still seen as basically American.
</P>
<P>
   Now Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank and the second-biggest
in Europe, proposes to buy Bankers Trust, the seventh-largest
American bank, for $9.7 billion in cash. If approved by regulators
and shareholders, the merger would create the world's largest
financial institution and, perhaps, the first multinational
financial juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it would create the world's most powerful financial
institution is another matter. Both Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust
have had problems in recent years and have seen their stocks
perform worse than shares of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, like other big German banks, engages in both
commercial and investment banking. But its efforts to establish an
international presence in investment banking have been largely
frustrated. It bought Morgan Grenfell, the British investment bank
founded by the father of J.P. Morgan that played a major role in
financing France in the Franco-Prussian war, but eventually killed
the brand name after a reorganization sent many bankers fleeing. It
has found it difficult to merge the cultures of commercial and
investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, which decided to get out of retail banking _ that
is, banking aimed at individuals as opposed to large corporations _
about two decades ago, seems to have done a better job of moving
into investment banking through its acquisitions of Alex Brown in
the United States and of Natwest Markets in Britain. But there have
been grumblings of discontent at Alex Brown, and Bankers Trust's
image has not completely recovered from its derivatives debacle of
a few years ago, when it was fined by the Securities and Exchange
Commission for deceiving a corporate customer.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank will have to scramble to raise the money needed to
close this deal, and regulators should watch closely to be sure
that it maintains adequate capital for the far-flung operations it
is taking on. Assuming that is done and the deal is completed,
Deutsche Bank will face the daunting task of operating what will be
the closest thing yet to a genuinely multinational financial giant.

CONNECTICUT LAWMAKERS QUESTIONING PATRIOTS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Facing heavy pressure to approve an agreement
to bring the New England Patriots to Hartford but boggled by the
potential cost, Connecticut lawmakers are frantically searching for
ways to trim the deal's many generous provisions without driving
the team away.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure, Gov. John Rowland says he thinks there
might be wiggle room in the contract, but the team continues to
insist that any change will be a deal buster.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and the owner of the Patriots, Robert Kraft, dickered
for months over an 18-page agreement that is to be considered by
the Legislature in a special session on Dec. 15. Rowland is a
Republican, and Democrats control both houses of the Legislature,
but he made sure to include legislative leaders in the final round
of negotiations before last week's announcement by Kraft that he
had tentatively agreed to move the team.
</P>
<P>
   But now, there is rising anger among legislators who say they
think the deal's fine print will cost the state millions more than
was first disclosed, and legislative leaders are looking for ways
to make it all work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be many aspects that are not deal breakers, and we
have to find out what they are,'' said Rep. David Pudlin, the House
speaker pro tempore. ``Many of our members have very specific
questions, the answers to which have not been provided in many
cases. There are a wide variety of suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft, a Patriots vice president who is the owner's son
and was the main liaison between the state and the team, indicated
little willingness to bend. ``If it changes, then it's a different
deal,'' he said. ``That wasn't said ominously. Those are just the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland, in an interview, said, ``I don't think he's going
to walk away because he's not getting the popcorn concession. If
there's huge material changes, then we've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next week, the governor plans to release an updated set
of figures that he said will prove his contention that over the
30-year life of the deal, the stadium will not cost taxpayers
money. Rep. Moira Lyons, the House majority leader, has asked the
Legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis to prepare its own
estimates. Ms. Lyons, who is the only member of the legislative
leadership who has not publicly embraced the deal, said she needs
to know more about the deal's ramifications in order to determine
whether it is a sound financial move for the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``While you want to continue generating the enthusiasm, coupled
with that you have to look at the reality of what is being
committed to,'' she said. ``I just want people to give the
Legislature the opportunity to do the job they elected us to do,
and go through the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the state would build a $350 million
stadium for the team, which would use it rent-free in return for
paying a 10 percent tax on ticket sales. It is the extras, though,
that are drawing the most scrutiny from lawmakers. Under the draft
agreement, the Patriots would reap profits from licensing a name
for the stadium, while the state would build the team a $15 million
practice center and would reimburse the Patriots for up to $17.5
million a year in unsold club seats and luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edith Prague, a Democrat who is a former Connecticut
commissioner of aging, said flatly Friday that she would vote
against the current plan. ``It makes me extremely angry when I
think that the Patriots are going to walk away with the profits and
the taxpayers are going to have all the headaches and pay all the
bills,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Prague said she plans to try to spread the word to her
colleagues about the potential consequences for the state,
legislative leaders are still promising swift passage. The bill
authorizing the deal with Kraft will not go through the usual
system of subcommittees and committees, but instead will be
considered Dec. 9 at a joint hearing to be chaired by the Senate
president pro tempore, Kevin Sullivan, and the outgoing speaker of
the House, Thomas Ritter. The governor and Patriots officials will
be invited to testify, and the state's 186 legislators will be
allowed to ask questions. Then members will be asked to vote at a
one-day special session of the General Assembly six days later.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators said their constituents seem quite excited about the
project, and a poll released this week bore that out. The poll,
conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research for the Journal
Inquirer of Manchester, Conn., found that 60 percent of respondents
favored spending $350 million in state funds to build a new
football stadium in Hartford, while 22 percent opposed the idea and
18 percent were undecided. And the respondents apparently were an
optimistic bunch: 36 percent said they would buy season tickets.
The poll of 634 Connecticut adults was conducted Monday and Tuesday
and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   In an early indication of the hard line leaders plan to take on
the bill, Sen. Sullivan said members could forget about offering
their support in return for a road or some other project in their
districts _ a not-unheard-of strategy on other measures. ``This is
a large, statewide issue,'' he said. ``We are not in the business
of horse-trading on this project.''

   Britain: Soccer Hooligans Beware
</P>
<P>
   The British government has announced 29 measures to crack down
on soccer hooliganism by English fans, which has damaged the
country's image abroad, scared off fans at home and prejudiced
England's bid for the World Cup in 2006. The proposals include
banning known troublemakers from traveling, and making the chanting
of racist taunts a crime.

   The house in Ballymoney where three young Roman Catholic
brothers were burned alive in their beds by Protestant arsonists in
July is being replaced with a memorial park. A local assemblyman,
Sean Farren, said six other homes in the housing project would be
leveled to make a recreation area dedicated to the Quinn brothers:
Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and Jason, 9.

   The government broke nearly nine years of silence on the murder
of Dr. Robert Ouko, a former foreign minister whose death remains a
charged political issue. An 85-page report exonerated Nicholas
Biwott, one of two aides to President Daniel arap Moi who were
arrested, and then released, after the 1990 slaying. Moi had

   The debts of Mexico's beleaguered bank bailout program have

Mexican banks was hammered out in 1995 but needs refinancing to put

   ELIMINATE: INVEST-GE-FUND.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-GRADS-RECRUIT (Undated) _ Campus recruiting by Wall
Street firms and management consultants _ between them the biggest
hirers of freshly minted college graduates _ has become an
elaborate dance, with fierce competition on both sides. The
companies spend a bundle to try to snare the best and brightest,
and the kids go to greater and greater lengths to attract the
attention of the ``right'' company, just as they did four years
earlier to get into the ``right'' school. This year promises to be
fiercer than ever, with the downturn in the markets casting a dark
shadow over the promised riches on Wall Street and everyone hoping
to make it in the door before the feared hiring freezes set in. By
Andrew Ross Sorkin. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

<P>
   ROTH-IRA (Undated) _ The Roth IRA may be the best deal
Washington has ever offered savings-minded taxpayers. But few
Americans are taking advantage. The next month is taxpayers' last
chance to get the best possible deal on a Roth. Here's how, and why
you may want to do it. By David Cay Johnston. (Moved).

proposition. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-DAMS (Rowe, Mass.) _ Once the neglected stepchild of the
electricity industry, hydroelectric power gets a surprise shot in
the arm from deregulation. It turns out consumers will pay a
premium for power that comes from renewable sources like hydro
power. And their operators love them too, because they are cheap to
run and you can easily store power (i.e. water above the dam) for
use in peak periods. By Agis Salpukas. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-MANAGEMENT-TYCO (Undated) _ L. Dennis Koslowski is busily
building a conglomerate that he thinks will be fun to run. Last
week Tyco International, the company he has headed since 1992,
capped an 18-month, $11 billion buying spree by agreeing to acquire
AMP, a maker of electronic connectors. The deal will rescue AMP
from a hostile takeover attempt by Allied Signal. His is a process
fraught with do's and don'ts _ mostly don'ts. By Claudia H.

interesting or suspect new financial products. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-ASIA (Undated) _ In the last year, exposure to Asia has
generally meant risking a bad case of the flu. The region's
economic turmoil has weakened demand, and the health of many
companies _ and their stocks _ has suffered. But some analysts see
signs of a possible Asian recovery. Economists at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, for example, forecast growth in gross domestic product
for the region, excluding Japan, of 3.3 percent for 1999. By Reed
Abelson. (Moved).

   BIZ-SMARTGIVING (Undated) _ James E. Rogers of Las Vegas, Nev.,

earlier record- breaking pledge to the University of Arizona
college of law in Tucson and making tens of millions more in
donations. By Diana B. Henriques. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-FOR-ME (Undated) _ While most of us wouldn't hesitate to ask
a confidant about his love life, his paycheck is a different story.
Sex may be private, but it is rarely secret. Money, however, is the
best-kept secret. It is no wonder. Mixed messages about money
surround us. At some point, we have all been taught that money is
the root of all evil, that it does not buy happiness or, as the
song goes, love. By Linda Carroll Martin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AUTOS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-OLDSMOBILE (Undated) _ Putting televisions and
videocassette players in vans is nothing new. Builders of custom
vans have been doing it for years. But buying a custom van has
often meant accepting all that goes with it: crushed velour
curtains, for instance. Moreover, the size and shape of traditional
cathode-ray TV's usually require a ``pop-top'' _ a reinforced
fiberglass roof into which the monitor is mounted _ that can raise
a vehicle's height to more than 7 feet, barring it from many
parking decks. Oldsmobile's new Premiere edition of the Silhouette
minivan solves that problem by using a compact
liquid-crystal-display monitor as the centerpiece of its integrated
entertainment system. By Dan Neil. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   With Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-MINIVANS (Undated) _ The minivan has become the object
of snickers and it seems at risk of being muscled aside by sport
utilities with comparable space plus a rugged image. Although the
minivan segment is not growing, it is far from dead. Auto makers
are frantically working to lure new buyers with vans that are
safer, more exciting, more luxurious and more practical. By Cheryl
Jensen. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; STAND ALONE GRAPHIC &LR;

<P>
   IN-MY-BRIEFCASE (Undated) _ A voyeuristic short feature that

   That big windfall you may have been counting on to help
celebrate your 100th birthday seems likely to vanish.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the nation's life insurance companies have paid
off policyholders when they reach the century mark. That's the
so-called terminal date when, by actuarial design, the cash value
of the policy equals the death benefit.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the mortality tables used 96 as the terminal age,
one prominent collectee being John D. Rockefeller, who had a $5
million policy when he reached that age in 1935. The mortality
tables were updated in 1941 so that whole-life policies would
mature at 100.
</P>
<P>
   But at its September meeting, the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners requested that the Society of Actuaries
update the tables again, to reflect longer American life spans.
</P>
<P>
   The process, according to Tom Foley, a North Dakota insurance
official who is chairman of the society's task force on the issue,
may take two or three years. But Foley said there was little doubt
the terminal age would rise substantially. ``My guess,'' he said,
``is it would go to 110 or so.''

   At a time when colleges offer ``naming opportunities'' for
donors willing to write big checks to have buildings named after
them, Columbia University's business school has a supplemental
strategy. It's making available classroom seats and student lockers
for those who want to win public recognition for their support but
don't have as much money to give.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of big-ticket items in the school's current $18 million
fund-raising drive are already taken. One alumni family, the
Heilbrunns, gave $2 million and will have a lobby named for them. A
group of students raised $1 million to name an amphitheater in
honor of Robert Lear, the school's former executive in residence.
</P>
<P>
   And Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley each gave
between $750,000 and $1 million to have amphitheaters named after
them.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of the drive, alumni have received letters offering
the lockers ($2,500) and seats ($5,000) with the pitch that a gift
``allows you to leave your legacy at Columbia Business School.''
Marilyn Kohn, an associate dean at the school, said: ``We don't
want to name every wall and every door. But we did want to be
creative.''

<P>
   Rates Continue to Slip &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates continued to slide last week, a consequence of
the Fed's third quarter-point cut of short-term interest rates in
two months. A survey of 100 of the country's largest lenders by the
Bank Rate Monitor found that the average rate on a 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgage fell 0.03 percent, to 6.78 percent, while the
15-year dropped 0.05 percent, to 6.43 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Connor, managing editor of the company's Web site,
www.bankrate.com, said the consensus opinion was ``that the rate
cut was expected by the banks, so it had less impact than might be
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in just two weeks, the 30-year slid an average of
11-hundredths of a percent, while the 15-year shed a tenth of a
percent.
</P>
<P>
   With rates so low, one idea gaining currency is to compare
refinancing with moving and getting a new mortgage altogether.

KEITH VAN HORN IS BULKED UP FOR AN NBA SEASON THAT JUST KEEPS

 (af)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a long time, Keith Van Horn would not allow himself to think
that the National Basketball Association season was in jeopardy.
While the first seven weeks of what was to be his second NBA season
were being canceled, the New Jersey Nets' rising star was steadfast
in his belief that eventually the games would begin.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Tuesday's feuding between the league's
owners and players led to the cancellation of Friday's scheduled
labor negotiations and the Christmas Day matchup between the Knicks
and the Chicago Bulls. Because that game was to be the first
televised on NBC this season, many observers and players viewed it
as too lucrative for the league to jettison, especially with the
possibility that Michael Jordan might play.
</P>
<P>
   Now even Van Horn, who as recently as Monday ``guaranteed'' that
there would be a season, is beginning to waver. The assuredness he
spoke with less than a week ago now sounds more like hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think there's going to be a season,'' Van Horn said
cautiously over the telephone Friday from Salt Lake City. ``But I'm
not as optimistic as I was before all of this new stuff hit.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than a third of the Nets' 82 regular-season games
having been lost to the labor impasse, Van Horn's dwindling faith
is well-warranted. The window for the league to settle its
differences with the players and salvage the season is closing
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But while Van Horn said he ``gets sick'' when thinking about the
nearly $1 million he has already lost in salary, he is far from
cracking under the pressure from the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that the owners didn't want the season to
start on time because they thought the players would fold after
missing a few paychecks,'' he said. ``But that's not going to
happen. The players have managed their money better than the owners
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   As a client of the power agent David Falk and as a staunch
supporter of the players union, Van Horn has followed the labor
developments closely enough to state that salaries of the league's
coaches, presidents and general managers have increased 40 percent
in the last two to three years, as well as put forth an eloquent
argument on how the owners are attempting to make the players pay
for their mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   And as a decidedly pro-union player, Van Horn is willing to go
the distance for what the players consider to be a good deal. Even
so, in his eagerness to play, he refuses to think of that distance
as the loss of the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought far ahead enough to think about not having a
season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn will not stop following negotiations when and if the
lockout is settled. He will simply turn his attention to the
free-agent market, where the Nets will deal with the center Jayson
Williams, one of the league's most-coveted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   How well the Nets handle their situation with Williams, whose
market value appears to be about $12 million a season, will go a
long way in determining Van Horn's future with the team when he
becomes a free agent in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to look closely at how they deal with Jayson _ what
they offer him and how they go about the process of trying to
re-sign him,'' Van Horn had said earlier in the week, before
joining Williams in some bench pressing at a gym in Paramus, N.J.
``Because if they're unfair to him _ a person who's transformed
himself into an All-Star, one of the most popular players ever to
play in this metropolitan area _ if they treat him unfairly, how
are they going to treat Kerry or myself?''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the third-year guard Kerry Kittles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say, `If they don't take care of Jayson and
Kerry I'm not going to be here,' because that's not the case,'' the
6-foot-10-inch player said. ``But I am going to look at it and
judge how well they deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   While the business side of basketball consumes his mind, Van
Horn continues to work hard on his game, hoping that he will soon
get the chance to erase the memory of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Erase? After averaging 19.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and helping the
rejuvenated Nets make the playoffs as a rookie, what's to erase?
Plenty, according to Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   His first NBA season was all right, he says, but this year he
intends to be much better than the rookie who used a unique
combination of flair, finesse and fundamentals to steal some of the
Knicks' thunder in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the game a lot better now than I did a year
ago,'' said Van Horn, sporting a new beard and goatee that gives
him a more menacing look. ``I know how I want to play now whereas
last year, I hadn't found my niche yet. I'm definitely going to be
a different, more effective player this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Through film study and a keen sense of recall _ ``I can tell you
what happened 16 minutes into our third game with the Knicks'' _
Van Horn has dissected his game, discovering that he hovered too
much around the 3-point line, hoisting 25-foot jumpers, didn't fill
the lanes on the fast break as much as he would have liked, and did
not draw enough fouls. And he says his field-goal percentage (.426)
was sickening.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing happens once you step past 23 feet,'' Van Horn,
a 52 percent career shooter at the University of Utah, said with a
laugh. ``It drove me nuts for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   While his outside shooting ability is a plus, Van admits to
taking it to the extreme last year. He launched 3.6 3-pointers a
game (more than any other power forward in the league) and made
just 30 percent of them. This year, he plans to shoot ``one, maybe
two 3-pointers'' a game and rely more on drives to the basket and
17- to 20-footers.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn has honed his perimeter skills by working extensively
with Kittles, the Nets' 6-5 shooting guard. The two of them ran
full-court games over the summer with college players at Fairleigh
Dickinson, shot thousands of jump shots and concentrated on
improving their ball handling. Van Horn said that one month they
spent 30 minutes every day working solely on dribbling, especially
on the cross-over move. He also said he had fully recovered from
the sprained right ankle injury that kept him out of the first 17
games and hindered his mobility throughout last season.
</P>
<P>
   While the much quicker Kittles has helped Van Horn sharpen his
finesse game, the burly Williams has helped him add 20 pounds of
muscle to his once-thin frame.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, now a solid 250 pounds, lifts five days a week,
including at least two days with Williams. The Nets center pushes
him through two hours of weight work, then bangs with him in
full-court games of one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's about 25 percent better than he was last year and
that's going to be scary,'' Williams said. ``He's gotten a lot
stronger, a lot quicker and a lot more aggressive. Last year, I
could foul Keith and he'd be flying all over the place, but now
he's going up strong and coming back at me.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will he get the chance this season to come back
at opponents in real, live NBA games. &QL;

PANEL TO FOCUS ON LYING UNDER OATH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Idaho, S.C.)  (See related CLINTON-IMPEACH and CLINTON-IMPEACH-TEXT)

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing
Tuesday on the consequences of lying under oath, Republicans will
try to show that there is a double standard for President Clinton,
while Democrats will say that perjury, while serious, is not an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses each side plans to call _ six by the Republicans
and five by the Democrats _ in the full committee's second, and
perhaps, final hearing before voting on articles of impeachment
against Clinton reflect the two sides' competing strategies, aides
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hearing,'' a Republican committee aide said, ``we'll be
looking at perjury and its consequences, and whether is it tenable
for a nation to have two different standards for lying under oath:
one for the president and one for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Republicans intend to call two federal judges, two
retired military officers and two convicted perjurers. The
committee did not announce the witness list, pending final approval
of the Democrats' choices, but aides provided the names.
</P>
<P>
   The judges are Gerald Tjoflat of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals and Charles Wiggins of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Wiggins is a former Republican congressman from California and was
one of President Richard Nixon's staunchest defenders on the
Judiciary Committee in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The military officers are Adm. Leon Edney, a former vice chief
of naval operations and commandant of the U.S. Naval Academy; and
Lt. Gen. Thomas Carney, a former personnel chief for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted perjurers are Pam Parsons, a former basketball
coach at the University of South Carolina, and Barbara Battalino, a
former Veterans Affairs psychiatrist at a medical center in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The judges will speak to the effects of perjury on the judicial
system; the military officers on the corrosive effect of lying on
the armed forces' strict code, and convicted perjurers about the
personal price paid for lying, a Republican aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, intend to show that perjury in this case
is a peripheral issue. ``No Democrat has alleged that perjury is
not a serious legal matter, only that perjury in these
circumstances, given the underlying allegations against the
president, does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense,''
said James Jordan, a spokesman for committee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have invited Leon Higginbotham, a retired judge in the
3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, and Elliot Richardson, who in 1973
resigned as attorney general rather than carry out Nixon's order to
dismiss Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have also invited three law professors to testify:
Alan Dershowitz of Harvard University, and Stephen Saltzburg and
Jeffrey Rosen, both of George Washington University.

NFL GOES TO THE AUDIO TAPE IN COIN TOSS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League announced Friday that it would
review one of the most bizarre incidents in pro football history, a
coin flip apparently botched by game officials that led to the
Detroit Lions' victory over the visiting Pittsburgh Steelers,
19-16, in overtime, before a national television audience on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL spokesman said the league was examining tapes of what
happened before the overtime in what Steelers fullback Jerome
Bettis called ``the weirdest game I have ever been involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   Any review by the NFL would almost certainly include listening
to tapes of the coin toss before overtime, an audio replay of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh had a 13-3 halftime lead, but the Lions tied the
score at 16-16 late in the game, and that is where the game stood
at the end of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers captain Bettis and safety Carnell Lake lined up for the
coin toss and referee Phil Luckett asked who would make the call.
Bettis said he would. As the coin was flipped Bettis distinctly
said, ``Tails.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what came up, but Luckett turned to the Lion captains
and then, stunning the Steelers as well as millions watching the
game on television, asked the Detroit players if they wished to
kick off or receive. Even the Lions players appeared shocked;
nevertheless, they elected to receive. They moved downfield and won
the game on a 42-yard field goal by Jason Hanson 2 minutes 52
seconds into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh never had the ball in the overtime. But the Steelers
had a good deal to gripe about after the game. As he walked off the
field, coach Bill Cowher hollered at the officials, blaming them
for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you blow the coin toss?'' linebacker Earl Holmes
asked.

DICK O'NEILL, 70, ACTOR IN `CAGNEY AND LACEY'

<P>
   Dick O'Neill, an actor best known for his work as Charlie Cagney
in the television series ``Cagney and Lacey,'' died on Nov. 17 at
St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 70 and lived in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned nearly 50 years, O'Neill played a
variety of roles onstage, in films and on television. He began his
career in the theater, appearing on Broadway in ``Promises,
Promises,'' ``Skyscraper'' and ``The Unsinkable Molly Brown'' among
other shows. His stage credits also include ``Inherit the Wind,''
``A Man for all Seasons,'' ``South Pacific'' and ``Fanny.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked in regional theater, acting in ``Room Service'' at the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and ``The
Front Page'' at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn. He was
also a member of Arena Stage in Washington in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to playing the father of Chris Cagney in the CBS
series ``Cagney and Lacey,'' which starred Tyne Daly and Sharon
Gless as undercover police officers in New York, O'Neill had
recurring roles on ``Home Improvement,'' ``Family Matters'' and
``Cybill.'' He also appeared on ``MASH,'' ``Cheers'' and scores of
other shows.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's films included ``The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,''
``The Jerk'' and ``Prizzi's Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, O'Neill attended Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three daughters,
Gillian O'Neill of Santa Monica, Caitlin O'Neill Bailing of Los
Angeles and Meghan O'Neill Ruona of San Francisco.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: AT LONG LAST, BIG EAST HAS BIG GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, the Big East has a football game the nation can sink
its teeth into: Miami at Syracuse in the Carrier Dome on Saturday
afternoon for the Big East Conference Championship.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure if this is your experience, but whenever I mention
the Big East in a discussion of big-time college football, faces go
blank, eyes glaze over. Big East football doesn't ignite passion.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday afternoon's game is different. Each program has a
lot to gain and a lot to lose, in both the long term and the short
term. The winner captures the Big East championship outright. The
winner then will play in either the Sugar or the Orange Bowl, and
the loser will play in a lesser bowl. Miami (ranked No. 19 by The
Associated Press and No. 12 by The New York Times) has won the
conference championship five times. Syracuse (No. 21 AP, No. 16 The
Times) has never won it outright.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse (7-3), which has aspired but failed to leap into the
elite level of college football, has a rich tradition, though a
tradition on which it has lived for the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have destiny in our hands now,'' said Syracuse fullback Rob
Konrad. ``This is one of the biggest games ever in the dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Big East committed geographic fraud and pulled
Miami into the conference in 1991, the idea was to have Miami put
Big East football on the map. Miami was the Big Show in college
football. Under coach Jimmy Johnson and then coach Dennis Erickson
in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Hurricanes talked trash, they
taunted and they won.
</P>
<P>
   Those Hurricanes took a certain joy in coming into the Carrier
Dome and crushing Syracuse's dreams of regaining the glory of
yesteryear; when Ben Schwartzwalder coached the Orangemen from
1949-1973; when Jim Brown wore No. 44 in the 1950s; when Ernie
Davis wore No. 44 and won the Heisman trophy in 1961. But Miami,
6-1 against Syracuse, never let the Orangemen get back on top.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Davis took over as coach of Miami in 1995. Last season
Miami, humbled by two years of probation and the loss of
scholarships, was humiliated by Syracuse in Miami, 33-13. It was
Miami's first losing season in 18 years (5-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're writing a new chapter in Miami football,'' said Scott
Covington, Miami's fifth-year senior quarterback. ``This game is
another milestone for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Covington is one of three fifth-year seniors on the team. He
remembers the Miami of old. And cherishes the tradition. ``What
rubbed people the wrong way about the old Miami is that we were
successful,'' Covington said. ``They took their helmets off, they
talked trash. Not that we don't want to do that now; we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The `old' Hurricanes helped inspire a wave of puritan-based
celebration reforms that incarcerated fun and put players in
straitjackets. The folks who run college football enforce rules and
lose track of the natural exuberance of play. Miami, more than any
other team, exuded fun in the late '80s and early '90s. The new
Hurricanes (7-2) have an eye for fun, but Covington and his fellow
fifth-year seniors have preached the importance of a process.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to do those things you need to win big games, win
at other people's stadium,'' he said. `You need to justify what you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   This game flows into a larger ocean. Next week Miami plays
third-ranked UCLA in a game that was scheduled to be played weeks
ago but was postponed because of a hurricane. Back then, Miami was
just beginning to come together. Now, in a span of eight days,
Miami has an opportunity to play for the Big East championship and
take on a Goliath of college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal at the beginning of the season was to win the
conference and go to a major bowl game,'' Covington said. ``So in
that respect the Syracuse game is more important. But to be one of
the few games on television, to be able to spoil someone's bid for
a national championship _ that's the biggest game. Either way we
can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lawson, a fifth-year defensive lineman at Miami, loves
it. A bridge between the old Hurricanes and the new, Lawson said
the Miami legacy is back, simply repackaged to meet the new rules.
``We still gesture, we still talk, but it's not as magnified as it
was,'' Lawson said, adding that all trash talking has to be more
subtle now. ``But if you listen real close, you'll still hear the
taunting and talking.`
</P>
<P>
   Passions are flowing on each side.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked how he would control the Hurricanes, Syracuse
defensive back Phil Nash said: ``Just hit 'em in the mouth. That's
all we're going to do. That's what we want to do. If we hit 'em in
the mouth as soon as they get out there, letting them know that we
come to play, they won't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally the Big East has its game of the century.

<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ Tom Lehman, the defending champion in the
Skins Game that begins today at Rancho La Quinta Country Club, said
there is pressure, excitement and fun in the two-day event.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   This year's competition is offering a record $1 million _
$400,000 more than a year ago and $640,000 more than the purse of
the inaugural event in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But the Skins Game, which begins at 10:30 a.m. with the first
nine holes (ABC's taped coverage begins at 1:30 p.m.), isn't the
only tournament with a huge purse increase. Next year's PGA Tour
events will be worth more than $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples, who is in this weekend's field along with Lehman,
Mark O'Meara and Greg Norman, said it's about time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I think we actually deserve it,'' he said. ``When
you look at it, the first or second tournament I happened to win
(the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic), and people come up and say, `Look
at this guy, he's just won $400,000.' I think I made a million five
(actually $1,650,389) ... but in other sports, that's peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not idiots. We know when (Arnold) Palmer and (Jack)
Nicklaus played, a loaf of bread was a dime, but they still only
made $80,000 or $90,000. Now you could win $3 million next year. I
think I just saw Bernie Williams get $87 million. If I signed that
contract, I would go to tournaments and I would walk and hold hands
with the gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you wouldn't care what you shot,'' Lehman joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stand in the on-deck circle and talk to everyone,''
Couples went on. ``I think it's ridiculous that an owner can pay
someone $90 million. I can't see it, but I'm very happy the tour is
doing a great job for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And Couples is very happy to be playing this weekend. He said he
still ``giggles when he gets to play in the Skins Game.''
</P>
<P>
   He should. He is the event's all-time winningest player with 38
skins for $1.19 million. He also holds the record for most money
won on a single hole, $270,000, in 1995. Lehman won $300,000 in
last year's event, the most for a first-year Skins Game player.
</P>
<P>
   The first six holes are worth $25,000, the second six $50,000
and holes 13-17 each go for $70,000. The 18th hole will be a
$200,000 Super Skin. Any ties carry the money over until someone
wins a hole outright.
</P>
<P>
   The record for most money won Saturday is $150,000 by Couples in
1993 and equaled by Corey Pavin in 1995. Lehman, Couples, O'Meara
and Norman will be playing for $300,000 today and $700,000 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Skins Game is a friendly competition, but don't think these
players won't feel any pressure, considering the stakes. No one
wants to be embarrassed by walking away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman had no problems a year ago, when he had six birdies and
10 skins in an unofficial round of 10-under-par 61.
</P>
<P>
   Timing, he said, is everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to make birdies, but more important, it's nice to
make birdies at the right time,'' he said. ``I would gladly trade
making 10 or 11 birdies to making just one or two at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples, who withdrew from the Skins Game last year because of
his father's illness, said: ``The first day, you try to get in
position to win a skin, whether it's for $1 or $800,000. The second
day, you hit some shots and you're thinking about the other guys.
You get this rush you need to make you keep going. The pressure
mounts the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of play for our pride,'' O'Meara said. ``It's never
any fun not to play well.''

`A BUG'S LIFE' SQUASHES HOLIDAY BOX-OFFICE COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Moviegoers swarmed to the nation's multiplexes to
view ``A Bug's Life'' over the Thanksgiving holiday as it easily
led rivals with an estimated $12.4 million at 2,631 theaters during
the Wednesday-Thursday period, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day take for the Pixar-Walt Disney Co. collaboration
represents the second-highest gross for films rolling out on the
day before Thanksgiving, trailing only the $15.2 million by ``Back
to the Future II'' in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life,'' a computer-animated comedy about an ant named
Flik hiring a flea circus to fend off marauding grasshoppers, took
in more than $460,000 during a five-day exclusive opening at
Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre starting Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the film, which received generally
excellent reviews, will eventually match the $192 million total
earned three years ago by ``Toy Story,'' the first Disney-Pixar
project.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, predicted ``A Bug's Life'' will have made a total of $36
million by the end of this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also took second place with its Will Smith thriller,
``Enemy of the State,'' with $7.5 million at 2,435 theaters. That
gives ``Enemy'' more than $31 million in its first week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' finished a close third with $6.3 million
at 2,873 screens during Wednesday and Thursday to push its
first-week total to the $40 million range for Paramount. Bucksbaum
said ``Rugrats'' will provide strong competition for ``A Bug's
Life'' for several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   `` `A Bug's Life' is going to do great business, but `Rugrats'
is not going away any time soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' the third family oriented film
released to take advantage of the long weekend, opened with a
lukewarm $2.1 million at 2,384 screens during the two-day period.
Bucksbaum said the initial results may have been held down by
negative reviews and media reports of delays in the last few weeks,
but he cautioned that it's too early to write off Universal's
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences seemed to like this movie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates indicated that ``Babe'' would be in a
battle for fifth place with Universal's ``Meet Joe Black'' and
Sony's ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.'' Early figures
also showed the opening of Artisan's ``Ringmaster,'' with Jerry
Springer, in eighth place at 1,260 theaters, followed by a pair of
comedy-dramas: Warner Bros.' ``Home Fries'' with Drew Barrymore on
1,925 screens, and PolyGram's ``Very Bad Things'' with Cameron Diaz
on 1,153 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted that the overall box office for Wednesday
through Sunday, which is traditionally one of the heaviest
moviegoing periods, should finish with an increase of at least 15
percent over the same five days last year, when ``Flubber'' led
with $35.9 million.
</P>

   As many as half the handguns used in crimes had been purchased
from federally licensed dealers within the previous three years,
passing far more quickly from manufacturer to dealer to criminal
than previously believed, according to new federal law-enforcement
data that are expected to play a major role in lawsuits against the
handgun industry.
</P>
<P>
   That finding, along with other evidence that is emerging in the
suits, challenges a long-held view that most guns used in crimes
are stolen, say academic experts, gun-control advocates and lawyers
suing the gun makers. They say the data show that many handguns
enter an illegal black market even as they leave the store,
contrary to the industry's argument that its dealers are not the
source and that measures like better inventory control and tighter
regulation would do little to keep guns from criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data is hugely significant, because it shows that there is
a stream of guns, especially semiautomatic handguns, that are
moving very rapidly out of gun stores into the hands of
criminals,'' said David Kennedy, a researcher at the John F.
Kennedy School of government and director of the Boston Gun
Project, which has helped reduce juvenile violence in Boston by
identifying and cracking down on gun dealers who sell to minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means this is something we can fix,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the gun industry call the statistics exaggerated
and argue that in any case, the length of time between sale and
crime is a poor gauge of whether a gun has most likely been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first tests of the research's significance will be in
New York, where Hamilton vs. Accu-Tek, a suit brought by the
relatives of gun violence victims, is scheduled for trial this
January in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y. This suit, like
one brought by the city of Chicago, accuses gun makers of creating
a public hazard by flooding the market with their products and,
through negligence in distribution control, virtually guaranteeing
that some guns will wind up in the hands of people who have no
business owning them.
</P>
<P>
   A study prepared for the plaintiffs in the Hamilton case, based
on data compiled by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, contends that nearly 40 percent of the handguns used in
crimes around the country had been purchased from licensed dealers
within the preceding three years.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau itself, which is collecting the data as part of a
major new effort to trace the origins of handguns confiscated in
crimes, has reported that 48.8 percent of the confiscated guns that
it could trace had been sold by dealers within the previous three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a large segment of gun makers who should know
that criminals and young people are a large share of their
market,'' said Kristen Rand, a lawyer for the Violence Policy
Center, a research and advocacy group in Washington. ``The great
unknown is whether they deliberately turn a blind eye because they
don't want to know what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Guns legally move from a manufacturer to a distributor and then
to licensed dealers. But the new data suggest that many handguns
enter the illegal market through dealers who sell them to straw
purchasers acting for other customers, to out-of-town buyers who
cannot legally buy guns back home, or to buyers who lack gun
permits.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, for example, which has one of the nation's most
restrictive gun laws, undercover officers recently went to suburban
dealers and were able to buy guns while posing as members of city
street gangs. Chicago is using evidence from that sting operation
to seek hundreds of millions of dollars in a lawsuit against gun
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the analysis prepared for the Hamilton case and the data
compiled by the ATF are strongly disputed by the gun industry.
``Obviously if a gun is stolen, it can be stolen when it is young,
so their assumption is incorrect, that short `time to crime' means
the gun is purchased by a criminal and not stolen,'' said James
Dorr, a Chicago lawyer who represents three of the gun makers named
in the Hamilton suit: the Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp.; Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co.,
and the Colt's Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dorr said, the analysis in the Hamilton suit and
the firearms agency's own estimate fail to take sufficient account
of the large number of guns that for any of several reasons _ their
age, perhaps, or the erasure of their serial numbers _ cannot be
traced to the manufacturer and licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all of this, we think their high-end figure is
meaningless,'' Dorr said of the ATF's estimate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But officials of both the firearms agency and its parent, the
Treasury Department, said their data had been carefully weighted to
include guns that could not be traced. That is why the agency
provided a range, one official said, with a low estimate that 26.6
percent of all guns seized in crimes had been purchased within the
last three years. The high estimate of 48.8 percent reflects only
those guns traced to dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were based on a study of all handguns seized by the
police in several cities during 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates in the Hamilton case are based on a different set
of data: the firearms agency's figures on confiscated handguns
traced nationwide from 1989 to 1997. These estimates were prepared
by economists with National Economic Research Associates, New York
consultants who often provide expert testimony for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The economists, working for Elisa Barnes, the lawyer who filed
the Hamilton suit, estimated from ATF data that 23 percent to 25
percent of all handguns sold from 1989 to 1992 had been used in a
crime by the end of 1997, and that 54 percent of handguns used in a
crime in New York state had been purchased within the preceding
three years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the economists estimated from the agency's data
that 90 percent of handguns used in crimes in New York state were
originally sold in other states. More than half the handguns used
in crimes in New York, the economists concluded, were brought in
from just five states, all with lax gun-control laws: Virginia,
Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical analysis proves, the economists said, that the sales
in these states with weak gun-control laws ``are higher than can be
explained by legitimate demand _ suggesting that a substantial
proportion of sales in such states are not for legitimate purposes
but for resale to the criminal market.'' They contend that gun
makers deliberately oversupply dealers in these Southern states,
knowing that the excess guns will be taken to states like New York
with strong gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   A review of depositions by some of the 50 gun makers being sued
in the Hamilton case, the economists said, ``suggests that many if
not all manufacturers deliberately chose not to exercise any
supervision over the distributors and dealers to which they sell.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Dorr said, is ``absolutely incorrect.'' Such accusations
``ignore the regulatory system'' in which all dealers must be
federally licensed and all handgun sales are ``pre-approved'' by
law enforcement officials, under either the Brady Law or equivalent
state laws. If there are rogue dealers selling to criminals, he
said, it is up to law enforcement to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Dorr said, although the firearms agency usually
communicates with the manufacturer when doing a trace of a gun
seized in a crime, it does not disclose anything about the crime,
or even that there has been one, leaving the gun maker in the dark
about whether its product has actually been used for criminal
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes, the lawyer in the Hamilton suit, said gun makers
could reduce the number of guns flowing to criminals by adopting
modern inventory control and other strict distribution standards.
Such measures are already widely used by the makers of other
hazardous products, like scuba gear and certain chemicals and
paints.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the five-day waiting period required before
buying a handgun under the Brady Law will expire on Monday. It is
supposed to be replaced by a system in which gun dealers can
immediately get information, from computers set up by the FBI or
state police agencies, on whether a customer is a convicted felon.
But Ms. Rand, of the Violence Policy Center, said that ``nobody
knows what will happen'' on Monday, because Congress has not
approved sufficient money to create the FBI system and many states
have moved slowly to set up databases of their own.

ROBERT EISNER, 76, STEADFAST KEYNESIAN ECONOMIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Eisner, former president of the American Economic
Association and a staunch advocate of a view now unpopular among a
rising number of academic economists that active government
spending is needed to achieve full employment and growth, died Nov.
25 at his home in Evanston, Ill. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a bone marrow disorder, his
daughter, Mary Eccles, said.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, the William R. Kenan Emeritus Professor of Economics at
Northwestern University, served several years as the chairman of
the university's economics department.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Robert Coen of Northwestern, who was a student of
Eisner and a longtime colleague, said: ``He was a leading authority
on the economics of public budgets, business cycles, Social
Security and taxes. He brought a rare combination of passion and
scientific precision to policy discussions. His technical
contributions were central to some of the most important policy
debates of recent times.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said: `` Eisner was fearless. He never
softened his language to ingratiate. Yet no serious person in the
profession ever dismissed his views.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's early statistical studies concluded that business
investment in plant and equipment was determined more by the state
of the economy _ how close the economy was operating to capacity _
than by interest rates and other economic factors. His research
made him skeptical that monetary policy, which operates through
interest rates, could keep the economy on a steady upward climb.
</P>
<P>
   He called instead on government to drive the economy toward full
employment, running deficits if need be. This so-called Keynesian
view _ that the economy could not on its own achieve full
employment and could use help from the government _ conformed to
the teachings of leading figures within the economics profession
during the 1950s and 1960s. But the view increasingly fell out of
favor in the aftermath of the inflationary bursts and soaring
deficits of the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, in scores of professional publications, congressional
testimony and articles for newspapers, backed up his call for
active fiscal policy by criticizing what he regarded as simplistic
attacks on deficit spending. Eisner argued in several books in the
1980s and 1990s that the government's measure of deficits greatly
exaggerated their size and importance. Once the impact of inflation
and the size of the economy were taken into account, he concluded,
the country could readily afford deficits of $200 billion or more.
He also cautioned against cutting federal spending on education,
research and infrastructure for the sake of reducing federal
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also took issue with economists who attributed the
nation's lagging growth rate to low savings _ a faulty diagnosis,
he said, that led to regrettable policy prescriptions. Again, he
dissected the way government measures savings, concluding that it
was arbitrary and narrow. In a phone interview, he once said:
``When a firm pays for slabs of concrete, we call that investment.
But when parents pay tuition for their children, we call that
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to growth, he wrote, was to increase investment spending
by running a fully employed economy rather than to persuade
families and government to consume less.
</P>
<P>
   His most pointed criticism was directed at economists who
advocated what he regarded as the pernicious idea that the
government could not use monetary or fiscal policies to drive
unemployment below, say, 5.5 percent or 6 percent, out of fear that
the effort would lead to escalating inflation. The idea, Eisner
argued, relegated millions of workers to needless unemployment.
Coen said Eisner took satisfaction in the fact that unemployment
has now fallen well below levels that his critics said could never
be achieved and, as a byproduct, the once-threatening deficit has
been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent book, ``Social Security: More, Not Less,'' takes
on critics of Social Security who contend that the program is
financially decrepit and must be radically overhauled, perhaps by
turning it into a system of individual savings accounts. By
Eisner's calculations, the system is only modestly out of financial
alignment and can be balanced with minor tinkering. He took aim at
critics who pointed to the financial drain that the growing
population of elderly would put on future taxpayers, but who
ignored the fact that those same taxpayers would have fewer
children to support and, besides, would be earning far higher wages
than today's workers.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner proposed innovative ways for the government to keep track
of the economy and its own books. For example, he sought ways to
take official account of the work contributed by at-home spouses.
Several of his ideas have been formally adopted. Others, though
excluded from formal government documents, are included in
occasional reports.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner was, according to colleagues at Northwestern, a zealous
teacher who took special delight in teaching introductory courses
to undergraduates. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences and of the Econometric Society, and was the 15th
recipient of the John R. Commons Award of Omicron Delta Epsilon,
the international honor society in economics.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner was born in New York City, received his bachelor's degree
from City College in 1940, his master's degree in sociology from
Columbia University in 1942 and his doctoral degree in economics
from Johns Hopkins University in 1951. He served in the U.S. Army
from December 1942 to August 1946, rising to the rank of captain.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Edith; two daughters,
Mary Eisner Eccles, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Emily Eisner, of
Chicago; a brother, Alan Eisner, of Redwood City, Calif.; and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his often controversial views, Eisner, according to
colleagues, remained highly popular among his peers. James Tobin, a
Nobel laureate from Yale University, said: ``Bob was never
considered an outlier. His colleagues knew he played in the right
ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, Solow of MIT said, are Eisner's Keynesian views necessarily
a relic: ``He taught the profession a lot. And it ain't over. The
Keynesian idea, or some such variant, that the economy is not
self-correcting and needs government help is coming back. Eisner is
not obsolete.''

COMMENTARY: A CHINESE OASIS FOR THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last five months, a one-acre plot of land
nestled in the Staten Island Botanical Garden has been slowly
transformed into an outpost of China.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Chinese craftsmen have toiled nonstop to build the
Chinese Scholar's Garden, an exquisite collection of pavilions,
bridges and ponds. They used traditional tools or just their hands
as they put into place thick cedar columns, latticed door frames
and hand-finished granite panels. A tablet over the entrance
declares in red and gold Chinese characters, ``The Garden Where One
Experiences Many Beautiful Things.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it became the Garden Where Craftsmen Experience
Excitement and Nervousness. I.M. Pei, the architect famous for
structures like the pyramid-shaped addition to the Louvre, was
standing at the garden entrance inspecting their handiwork. His
interest was in architecture and ancestry, since Pei's family is
known for having an impressive garden of its own in Suzhou, China,
a city famous for its scholars' gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The craftsmen had traded rumpled work clothes and wooden tools
for jackets and cameras, and were chatting with Pei as he strolled
the grounds. His verdict was evident as he spoke to them in
Chinese, punctuating his words with smiles and laughs. The noon sun
cast a glow on the garden's white walls matched only by the pride
on the craftsmen's faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a wonderful day for shapes and shadows,'' Pei said.
``I think the workmanship is excellent, and I'm impressed. Of
course, you can't expect it to be like I'm used to seeing in
Suzhou, but it comes quite close. I'm very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pei had come to the garden at the invitation of his stepmother,
Aileen Pei, who was vital in helping raise part of the $10 million
needed for the project. This week she made a few trips to Staten
Island (with cookies and cake for the workers) to show off to
friends and donors the progress of the garden, which has occupied
much of her attention. The landscaping will be done early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   She got her first glimpse of the project two years ago, when
Frances Huber, president of the Staten Island Botanical Garden,
showed her a model during an afternoon tea. The model was sort of
bulky, so Mrs. Huber kept it in the trunk of her car when showing
it off. Its surroundings notwithstanding, Mrs. Pei was impressed.
Mrs. Huber was ecstatic, since she knew that Mrs. Pei's support
brought a measure of artistic integrity to the garden as well as a
wealth of contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of connections that are very personal and go
back and forth with the old southern China crowd,'' Mrs. Huber
said. ``Many of them left right before the Second World War, and
they were in finance and banking. They came to New York and
maintained those friendships. This is kind of the old society
crowd. They still exist. And she's the doyenne of it. A friend of
hers called her the Brooke Astor of the Park Avenue Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pei reached out to friends, even showing a videotaped piece
on the garden to dinner guests at her Park Avenue home. She said
she was lucky with the first foundation she approached, the Luce
Foundation. ``To do anything in New York, it takes a lot of
people,'' Mrs. Pei said. ``I know Hank Luce very well. When he gave
money, the rest was easier, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   One question that potential donors asked was: Why Staten Island?
Why not spread the wealth, both cultural and financial? There is a
certain appropriateness to the location, since the garden is at the
Snug Harbor Cultural Center, once a home for merchant seamen, some
of whom no doubt saw the real thing during their travels to the
East.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises another question: Why scholars' garden? Yangming
Chu, the curator, explained that tests in the humanities were given
to recruits for government service in imperial China. Naturally,
scholars scored best.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they retired, they wanted to create a natural garden
inside the city,'' Chu said. ``When you close the door, you're in
nature. It's to get away from the city's chaos and to look for
beauty. How do you do that but with a garden with trees and ponds
where you can write poetry, have parties and entertain friends?''
</P>
<P>
   That tradition still makes sense to today's civil servants. How
many police officers have moved to Staten Island in search of
solitude after a day on the beat? But no back yard could ever
compete with the tea house at the scholars' garden. After his tour,
Pei and his party sat down for a meal. He looked down the table and
spotted a relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever been to Suzhou?'' he asked the girl, who shook
her head. ``You must. That's where your family comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the fine example recreated in New York City, she
doesn't have to hop a slow boat anywhere. The Staten Island ferry
is faster. And free.

WHITHER BELLE? HOW ABOUT WHITE SOX? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Md., Ariz., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Decision Day looming, Albert Belle may still opt to remain
with the Chicago White Sox, a lawyer with knowledge of negotiations
between free agents and clubs said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Belle's agent continued to negotiate with the Baltimore
Orioles, the lawyer said the outfielder had spoken with Jerry
Reinsdorf, the Chicago White Sox owner, to determine if there was a
way he could comfortably return to the team. That way, the lawyer
said, could be paved by money being added to Belle's existing
contract or be accomplished through a contract extension or an
extension of his no-trade provision, which expires after next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Arn Tellem, Belle's agent, and the Orioles planned to talk again
Saturday. With an offer of $65 million for five years, the Orioles
are the only alternative right now that Belle has to the White Sox.
The Boston Red Sox had expressed interest, but said earlier this
week that they no longer were pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   Under a clause in the five-year, $55 million contract he signed
two years ago, Belle has until next Wednesday to be a free agent
and sign with another team or choose to stay with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking with Reinsdorf, the slugging left fielder apparently
wants to determine whether the White Sox will take steps to become
a serious contender in the next couple of years. But, the lawyer
said, Belle also wants assurances that the club will not turn
around a year from now and trade him. They could do that once his
no-trade provision disappears from the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox might be relieved to be free of the $35 million
they owe Belle for the next three years. They had the fourth-lowest
attendance in the major leagues last year and have shown no
indication they will do anything to rouse the fans next season.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson is another free agent who expects to make a
decision in the next few days. Alan Nero, one of his agents, said
the pitcher hopes to decide by Monday if he wants to stay home and
play for the Arizona Diamondbacks or pitch for Anaheim, Los Angeles
or Texas. All four teams apparently have offered four-year
contracts for $12.5 million or $13 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision,'' Nero said. ``Randy's really
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent said the Yankees removed themselves from Johnson's
list by failing to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   The continued presence of the Dodgers on the list was somewhat
of a surprise. Given Johnson's choice of teams and his earlier
stated criteria for selecting one, the Dodgers appeared to trail
the others because they play in the National League and hold spring
training in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers are considering selling their Vero Beach
complex and moving their spring operations to Arizona. In addition,
Johnson has decided the league does not matter, and he also likes
the prospect of playing for Davey Johnson, the Dodgers' new
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball executives nevertheless continue to believe that
the left-hander will choose between the hometown Diamondbacks and
the Angels, whose signing of Mo Vaughn on Wednesday has not dimmed
their interest in giving Johnson a lot of money, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are not on the playing level of the Angels, the
Rangers or even the Dodgers, but Nero said Johnson believed they
would be a contender before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the four-year period,'' the agent said, ``we all believe
and have enough confidence in Jerry Colangelo and Buck Showalter
that they will contend in that period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who a year ago acquired and gave lucrative
contracts to shortstop Jay Bell and third baseman Matt Williams,
have signed Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso, both pitchers, as
free agents this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion team, which plays only a few miles from Johnson's
new house, had been interested in Bernie Williams, but the Yankees
signed him on Wednesday. ``Once they signed Williams, that took
Arizona out of the picture and cleared that up,'' Nero said.
</P>
<P>
   The other attractive pitcher available as a free agent is Kevin
Brown. He is being sought primarily by the Orioles and the Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who pitched for Baltimore in 1995, has played on World
Series teams the past two years, Florida last season and San Diego
this, and the Orioles are probably closer to reaching the playoffs
than the Rockies. But the Rockies are more likely to make the most
lucrative offer.
</P>
<P>
   The agent Scott Boras said he wanted a six-year contract for
Brown, and he sought more money than the $12.5 million a year the
Red Sox gave Pedro Martinez a year ago. If Brown picks the Rockies,
Boras may try to get an $84 million contract, whose $14 million
average would make the pitcher the highest-paid player in baseball
history.

RANGERS STILL TRAIL ON JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>

By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Rangers have made the best offer to
pitcher Randy Johnson, sources have said, but it still doesn't look
as if it will be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the negotiations said the final four teams
involved _ the Rangers, Anaheim Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and
Arizona Diamondbacks _ have each offered a four-year contract for
approximately $50 million. Because Texas does not have a state
income tax, (California and Arizona do) the Rangers' offer is
considered the best as far as ``real value.''
</P>
<P>
   The source said that's why Johnson's representatives are giving
the Angels and Dodgers one last chance to improve their offer.
Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, said a decision should come no
later than Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meister said he talked with the Rangers briefly yesterday and
insisted, ``they're right in the middle of the things.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorites to sign Johnson still appear to be the Angels and
the Diamondbacks. Two sources also said the Rangers are at a
disadvantage because Johnson's wife, Lisa, isn't thrilled about the
idea of living in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Meister disputed that, saying, ``Randy wouldn't have visited
Texas if that were true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' main advantage is that Johnson lives in the
Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley and wants to pitch close to home.
The Angels' advantage is being a competitive American League team
relatively close to Phoenix that holds spring training in the
Phoenix area. Johnson also played college baseball at Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a major step forward on Wednesday by signing
free-agent first baseman Mo Vaughn, and he has been actively
lobbying Johnson to come to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin admitted the Angels would
have to be considered the favorites to win the American League West
if they sign Johnson and Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to go out and do the best you can,'' Melvin
said. ``Nobody ever picks us to win, and we've still won the
division two of the last three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said it's unlikely the Rangers would sign another
free-agent pitcher if they don't get Johnson. But Melvin did not
discount the possibility of making a run at free-agent first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has expressed a desire to return to Texas, and Melvin
said he has talked briefly with Palmeiro's agent, Jim Bronner. But
Melvin] has not yet made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be why he hasn't re-signed with Baltimore, because
he's waiting to see what happens here,'' Melvin said. ``It's
something to think about, but right now we're waiting on Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's top priority has been improving the Rangers' pitching,
and he said there's a possibility a pitching upgrade could be
available through a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I doubt it would be a No. 1 starter,'' Melvin said.

A&AMP;M OFFENSE QUICK TO TAKE THE BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M tight end Dan Campbell said he did the
only thing he could after the agonizing 26-24 loss yesterday to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized to the Aggies' Wrecking Crew defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the defense that from an offensive point of view, I was
sorry,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Until some late fireworks, A&AMP;M's best offense against a
previously suspect Texas defense that ranked 69th nationally was
two fumbles by Longhorns running back Ricky Williams. Both resulted
in short touchdown drives. Texas ran 88 plays to A&AMP;M's 49, 17 of
those in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a damned good defense and we made it hard on them,
and I told them so,'' Campbell said. ``They said we had 'em down
with two minutes left and they drove down and scored.' I said,
`Well, ya'll were tired. You were out there the whole stinkin'
game.' And that's how I felt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's offense, which had been good enough to win 10 games,
didn't get the job done yesterday, as 173 net yards indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get anything going offensively, and our defense
had to play too many plays,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``You
can't give good offensive teams that many shots at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor that good a back. Williams had 44 carries for 259 yards _
more than any back has gained against the Aggies. (SMU's Mike
Richardson had 244 yards on 39 carries in 1968).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as good as I've ever seen Ricky, as good as I've ever
seen any running back period,'' said A&AMP;M safety Rich Coady, who
made 13 tackles. ``What a lot of people don't realize is how smart
he is. Our defense is so fast that we overrun a lot of plays. We
did that in the first half, and he took advantage with a lot of
good cuts. My hat's off to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Also off is the glow of A&AMP;M's season. Only with a victory
victory against Kansas State in the Big 12 championship game next
week can the Aggies get into one of four Bowl Championship Series
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we'll regroup,'' linebacker Dat Nguyen said.
``This hurts a lot. But we have another opportunity to showcase
what we have, and hopefully it won't end on a bad note like it did
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell vowed it won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You let this fuel you, is what you do,'' he said. ``You lose a
game like this and you get mad about it and work harder. It hurts
to lose like this, but we'll bounce back and get ready for Kansas
State.''

COWBOYS CONFIDENT DESPITE LOPSIDED DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys have completed play against the best
two teams in the NFL, Denver and Minnesota. They lost both games,
being outscored, 88-59.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Chan Gailey and his team remain confident that they
can play with the league's elite. They were without their best
offensive player (Troy Aikman) for much of the game in Denver, and
without their best defensive player (Deion Sanders) for all of
Thursday's 46-36 loss to the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll see them again in the playoffs,'' linebacker
Randall Godfrey said of the Vikings. ``If we do, we'll be ready.
But right now, we have to put this game behind us. We've got to
come out next week and show that we're a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't get to show that until a week from Sunday, when they
begin the last stretch of the season on the road against the New
Orleans Saints. At 8-4, the Cowboys still hold a 11/2-game lead
over the Arizona Cardinals (6-5) in the race for the NFC East crown
and are virtual locks to return to the playoffs for the first time
in two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal here, quarterback Troy Aikman has said, is a
championship. To claim one, they might have to go on the road in
the playoffs. They trail Minnesota (11-1) and Atlanta (9-2) for one
of the top two NFC playoff seeds, which would give them a
first-round bye in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If the postseason started today, the Cowboys would host Arizona
in the wild-card round. Then, with a win, they'd probably have to
go through Atlanta and Minnesota to reach a record ninth Super Bowl
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have shown they have the offense to make a Super
Bowl run, scoring 30 or more points in five of the six games that
Aikman has completed. Against the Vikings, Aikman attempted a
club-record 57 passes, completing 34 for a career-high 455 yards.
Michael Irvin was one of nine Cowboys players to catch a pass, and
led all receivers with 10 receptions for 137 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In the next four weeks, the Cowboys should work on consistency
in the running game _ which is highly ranked, but had just 58 yards
against the Vikings _ and eliminating penalties. They committed 13
on Thursday, and have 28 for 281 yards in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings are a very good ballclub, but I think our club is
not far \Rbehind\S,'' running back Emmitt Smith said. ``The big
picture is we still have an opportunity to get in the playoffs.
We've got to take care of the rest of the season before we can
think about that. We've just got to go home and enjoy the holidays
and get back to work for New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though this has become a league where offense wins
championships, it is defense that could derail the Cowboys' title
hopes. In the past three weeks, the Cowboys have allowed an average
of 32 points per game. With rookie Randy Moss and veteran Cris
Carter combining for 10 receptions for 298 yards, Minnesota scored
six touchdowns, including five that traveled 50 yards or longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not had Sanders for an entire game since Nov.
8. So his defensive teammates claim that things will be different
when he makes his expected return for the Saints game. But it is
hard to imagine that one player at cornerback _ even Sanders _ can
make that much of a difference.
</P>
<P>
   But here are the astounding numbers anyway: The Cowboys allowed
13.4 points per game in the nine contests that Sanders has been
healthy, and 32 points in the past three.
</P>
<P>
   Still, safety Omar Stoutmire acknowledged that, ``we know we
could've played better, but we're still feeling pretty good about
our season and still have a lot of confidence. We're still 8-4 and
in pretty good shape.''

DREADLOCKS CRAZE HITS ROYAL-MEMORIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When it was over, after a breathless Ricky
Williams had lugged it 60 yards on his 14th carry and 259 yards for
the day to make a mockery of Tony Dorsett's NCAA Division I-A
career rushing record, after more than 83,000 fans had serenaded
him with chants of ``Heisman! Heisman!'' and a parade of former
greats had paid their respects, the greatest collegiate running
back of all-time summed up the majesty of the moment:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go home,'' he said, ``and take a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood there, his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his
jeans, scuffling at the floor with his tennis shoe, an impish grin
occasionally flickering at the corners of his mouth as he faced the
media after his record-setting morning and early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it hit home.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like Ricky Williams, you don't like picnics and
fried chicken legs and mom's apple pie. You don't like afternoon
naps and walks in the woods and the feel of warm sunshine on the
back of your neck in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown is dead right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Williams,'' Brown said after the Longhorns' narrow 26-24
victory over Texas A&AMP;M yesterday at Royal-Memorial Stadium, ``is a
very special person. I'm just glad he took us along for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Count me in. I like Ricky Williams. I like him a lot, and I
don't even know him.
</P>
<P>
   He has me thinking about trying dreadlocks myself.
</P>
<P>
   Brown went for the dreadlocks look himself yesterday. So did
Texas' unofficial troubadour, Willie Nelson, and even Darrell
Royal, the three of them each donning a dreadlocks wig in a
delightful taped JumboTron tribute to Williams that played after
the Texas tailback's record-breaking run near the end of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever in your life believe you'd see the day when Darrell
Royal _ ``Darrell Royal!'' _ would put on a dreadlocks wig for any
reason whatsoever?
</P>
<P>
   Probably no more than Louisiana-born-and-bred 1957 Heisman
Trophy winner John David Crow ever dreamed, back when he was
leading the Aggies to victories over Texas, that he'd one day find
himself hugging a young black man with his hair done up in
cornrows, wearing a burnt orange jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just offered me congratulations and said I'd done a great
job today and a great job my whole career,'' Williams said. ``That
was nice, coming from an Aggie.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams doesn't just break records, you see, though he owns or
shares ]16 of them in the NCAA record book. He blurs the lines. He
changes perceptions. He makes people reassess their values.
</P>
<P>
   And he does it by just being himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is a young man, as Texas publicist Bill Little told the
record crowd at Memorial Stadium during a postgame ceremony to
honor Williams, ``who believed in himself and in his dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The record fell in Ruthian fashion. It couldn't have been more
dramatic if Williams had pointed to the end zone before he made his
run.
</P>
<P>
   He had already carved 52 yards off the 63 he needed to pass
Dorsett when quarterback Major Applewhite called the play:
L-King-Zin-53.
</P>
<P>
   It was over almost before the crowd could react. The play took
Williams in the opposite direction of an Aggies blitz, and he
danced away from diving linebacker Warrick Holdman, whose
fingertips just grazed his heels.
</P>
<P>
   The hole on the left side was huge, and Williams slashed through
it in customary style, knees pumping, hips weaving. Aggies
cornerback Sedrick Curry had a clean shot at him but hit Williams
thigh-high and bounced off.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' Williams said, ``I thought I would score.''
</P>
<P>
   He raced for the left corner of the end zone, trying to angle
away from Aggies safety Brandon Jennings. Jennings probably would
have at least been able to force Williams out of bounds if Texas
wide receiver Wane McGarity hadn't gotten there in time to provide
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Jason Webster caught Williams from behind at the 5,
but there was no stopping him now. He carried Webster with him into
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Then bedlam hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was exhausted,'' Williams said, ``but I was mobbed by the
whole team on the sideline. I couldn't breathe. I wanted to yell
`Help', but I couldn't get my breath to get it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal now, but when it happened, I just wanted to go
sit on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had been relaying Williams' total rushing yards to
offensive coordinator Greg Davis as the game progressed, was
thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a run I'll remember for the rest of my life,'' Brown
said. ``Hopefully all the Heisman voters were watching today.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I thought we relaxed some, but I wasn't going to
say, `Ricky, lose about 60 so we can start over again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Williams didn't realize it, but his day was literally just
getting started. He still had another 30 carries ahead of him. He
also fumbled twice inside the Texas 20, and the Aggies converted
both fumbles into touchdowns, including one late in the fourth
quarter that forced Texas to march the length of the field for a
game-winning field goal with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ricky to forget the fumbles,'' Brown said. ``How could
anyone say anything to him after what he's done? You think I was
going to jump on him about that?''
</P>
<P>
   No need. Williams was jumping on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get back on the field,'' he said, ``and help
us score.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his last game as a Longhorns player at Royal-Memorial
Stadium, though the victory probably clinched a Cotton Bowl
appearance for the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent a message by turning down millions of dollars to come
back and help a team finish right,'' Brown said. ``He sent a
message to kids to finish school. He's a very special person.''
</P>
<P>
   Special enough, even, to make a grown man put on fake
dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes you think,'' Brown asked, ``those were fake?''

DESPITE RICKY'S STRONG LEGS, LONGHORNS WIN BY A FOOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On an afternoon when Texas running back Ricky
Williams gouged a proud Texas A&AMP;M defense for a record number of
yards, the Longhorns were forced to win by a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Williams ran over, around and through the Aggies' ``Wrecking
Crew'' defense. He gained 259 yards on 44 carries _ the most yards
ever against the Aggies _ and overtook Tony Dorsett as the NCAA
Division I-A all-time leading rusher on a 60-yard scoring run in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But A&AMP;M's unlikely late awakening forced the Longhorns to drive
70 yards against the clock and a worn-out defense to victory. Kris
Stockton's 24-yard field goal rescued a 26-24 victory before 83,687
fans _ the largest crowd ever to witness a game in Royal-Memorial
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he didn't even hit the upright,'' UT coach Mack Brown
said, referring to Stockton's game-winning kick that skimmed inside
the left upright to defeat Oklahoma State, 37-34, three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a special year for a lot of reasons _ the wins, the
attitude of the guys, the fans' support,'' Brown added. ``I've been
coaching football for 25 years, and I've never seen a place that
helped our football team more than Royal-Memorial Stadium did
today. Our fans were great.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' victory makes the Longhorns (8-3, 6-2) the most
attractive candidate for the Cotton Bowl against a Southeastern
Conference team, most likely old foe Arkansas. The loss cost the
Aggies (10-2, 7-1) a shot at a Bowl Championship Series game unless
they defeat Kansas State next week in the Big 12 championship game.
A&AMP;M most likely is now headed for the Builders Square Alamo Bowl in
San Antonio on Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who now owns part or all of 16 NCAA records, afterward
did not express a desire to visit an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go home and take a nap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's defense, which late in the game was more wreck than crew,
no doubt felt the same. The Big 12's second-best offense drilled
the league's best defense for 483 yards _ 123 more than Florida
State gained against the Aggies _ and took 88 plays to do it. Thus,
when one of Williams' two fumbles and a 35-yard punt return led to
a pair of fourth-quarter A&AMP;M touchdowns and a stunning 24-23 Aggies
lead with 2:20 to play, the rock on which the Aggies had relied all
season crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter when you need to come out and win the
game, we'd just been out there too long,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum
said. ``It was really disappointing to come back and do what we
needed to do to win the ballgame and then let them take it down the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many plays did they run today _ a hundred?'' queried
Aggies linebacker Dat Nguyen, who with 14 stops yesterday surpassed
the 500-tackle barrier in a distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Williams, Texas dominated to build a 23-7 lead by early
in the fourth quarter. The Longhorns could have led by more if not
for defensive stands that forced Stockton to kick three other field
goals _ and miss two more attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the game appeared well in hand when Texas
quarterback Major Applewhite drilled flanker Kwame Cavil for a
10-yard touchdown pass with 9:46 remaining. But several things then
conspired to enable A&AMP;M to make it a game.
</P>
<P>
   Sirr Parker's 29-yard punt return and a 55-yard pass from Randy
McCown to Chris Cole resulted in Russell Bynum's 30-yard field goal
at 8:29. Then, Williams juggled a pitch and A&AMP;M's Ronald Flemons
recovered at the UT 16, Williams' second fumble to lead to an
Aggies touchdown . After a yard loss, tight end Derrick Spiller
caught a 17-yard touchdown pass from McCown with 7:39 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Texas punted after a three-and-out series. Jason Webster
returned the kick 35 yards to the UT 24. Seven plays later, McCown
took it in from the 1 and Bynum's PAT gave A&AMP;M its only lead of the
day, 24-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never count it until it's over,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of confidence that we would win the game,'' said
the savvy youngster, who was 7-of-8 for 55 yards in the 70-yard
march. ``The reason why was because of the 10 other guys on the
field with me. I looked in their eyes and I felt their confidence.
And I knew we had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The key play was Applewhite's 25-yard completion to Cavil to the
Aggies' 19. After a 5-yard toss to Bryan White, Williams gained 7
to the A&AMP;M 7 and a first-and-goal with nine seconds remaining.
Stockton, who missed second-half attempts of 50 and 28 yards, then
split the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to redeem myself,'' Stockton said. ``I wasn't
unsure of my ability, but it didn't help that I had missed my last
two attempts.''

MAN, NATURE, COMPUTER MAKE FOR TRULY BIZARRE SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A schedule-altering hurricane. A tragic
accident. Two crucial fumbles. Teams' postseason futures determined
by a computer program. A midseason resignation by a coach from the
game's first family.
</P>
<P>
   This college football season has had its share of great games
and great stories (some of which are without final chapters). But
this season has had more than its share of bizarre happenings.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges left a trail of destruction in late September.
It also caused the UCLA-Miami game to be postponed. The ``Hurricane
Bowl'' will be played Dec. 5. Had the game been played as scheduled
on Sept. 26, the Bruins' season would be over. Instead, UCLA takes
its 10-0 record and national championship aspirations on a
cross-country road trip.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows if the outcome of last week's Kentucky-Tennessee
game would have been different if not for a tragedy. The Sunday
before the game, starting center Jason Watts lost control of his
truck on the way to hunt deer. Artie Steinmetz, a redshirt
defensive tackle, and Scott Brock, a longtime friend of Kentucky
quarterback Tim Couch, died in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were emotionally drained. It's not surprising that
the Volunteers rolled to a 59-21 victory. We'll never know if the
Wildcats would have been more competitive had the accident never
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee entered that game undefeated because the previous week
Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner stumbled and fumbled. That
allowed the Volunteers to steal a victory.
</P>
<P>
   And UCLA, the team Tennessee could wind up playing in the Fiesta
Bowl for the national championship, beat Stanford only because the
Cardinal fumbled away a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series ratings were designed to find the
nation's two best teams for the national-championship game. The
four-part formula relies heavily on computers and has been roundly
criticized by playoff proponents.
</P>
<P>
   That criticism will intensify if Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas
State all finish undefeated. Of course, with no BCS system, three
undefeated teams would create a problem and a noisy debate over the
voting in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   While Papa Bobby Bowden was having another big season at Florida
State and Big Brother Tommy Bowden was rolling up the wins at
Tulane, Terry Bowden, the Boy Genius of college football's first
family of coaches, was struggling at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a complete surprise when Terry Bowden, angered over
behind-the-scenes maneuvering concerning his dismissal, quit his
job. Bowden resigned the Friday before Auburn was to play Louisiana
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most significant games of the season, UCLA beat
Southern California, 34-17. UCLA claimed the traditional Victory
Bell, but also the inaugural Jim Murray Trophy, which was given in
honor of the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Los Angeles Times'' writer
who died in September.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. A football game trophy honoring a sportswriter.
It's been a truly strange season. SEASON'S BESTS
</P>
<P>
   Play: Ortege Jenkins. The Arizona quarterback beat Washington
when he dove into the end zone with a front flip. Only the East
German judge failed to award a 10.0.
</P>
<P>
   Team at the half: Missouri, which led Ohio State, Nebraska,
Texas A&AMP;M and Kansas State at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Spoilers: Ohio State would have gone 11-0 and Notre Dame would
have been 10-0 going into today's game with Southern California if
not for losses to Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Pass-catch combo: Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay (343
completions, 502 attempts, 4,472 yards, 44 touchdowns) and wide
receiver Troy Edwards (125 receptions, 1,829 yards, 27 touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Boston College running back Mike Cloud, who had
rushed for 1,871 yards in three seasons, predicted he would gain
2,000 yards. He finished with 1,726 yards. While he didn't reach
his predicted total, he nonetheless finished third nationally in
rushing. SEASON'S WORSTS
</P>
<P>
   Turnover: Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner's fumble against
Tennessee; runner-up, Stanford wide receiver Jeff Allen's fumble
against UCLA).
</P>
<P>
   Second-half team: Missouri, which saw first-half leads disappear
against Ohio State, Nebraska, Texas A&AMP;M and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Loss: Keith Jackson. The voice of college football is leaving
the ABC booth after the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Timing: Ohio State coach John Cooper. No, no, John, it's like
this: You need to beat Michigan when the game means something. Not
after you've already lost a game. You got it all wrong, pal.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell (coach): Iowa coach Hayden Fry ended his 37-year career
(20 of those at Iowa) with a desultory 3-8 season.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell (conference: The Western Athletic Conference saw
attendance slide, its bowl opportunities dwindle and the sniping
continue during its last season as a 16-team league.
</P>
<P>
   Trend: The Carquest Bowl became the Micron PC Bowl. Last season,
the Copper Bowl changed to the Insight.com Bowl. Considering how
the Bowl Championship Series is using computer-generated rankings
and ratings to decide the national-championship contenders, guess
it's not surprising to see the rise in computer-generated bowl
sponsorships. TOP FIVE PERFORMANCES
</P>
<P>
   Troy Edwards, Louisiana Tech vs. Nebraska: Edwards totaled an
NCAA-record 405 yards on 21 receptions in the Bulldogs' 56-27 loss
to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Dez White, Georgia Tech vs. Virginia: White had six receptions
for 243 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Yellow Jackets'
second-half rally against Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Redman, Louisville vs. East Carolina: Redman completed 44
of 56 passes for 592 yards and six touchdowns as the Cardinals
clinched a berth in the Motor City Bowl with a 63-45 victory over
East Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   David Winbush, Kansas vs. Colorado: Winbush had 268 yards and
three touchdowns on 29 carries to lift the Jayhawks past Colorado,
33-17.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams, Texas vs. Baylor: Williams rushed for 259 yards
on 39 carries to help the Longhorns rally to beat Baylor. He scored
two touchdowns in the final 2:03 as Texas won, 30-20. TOP FIVE
GAMES Washington 42, Arizona State 38: Two teams that wound up as
also-rans staged an early season shootout. The Sun Devils appeared
to win the game with a late touchdown pass until the Huskies scored
the winning points on a ``later'' TD pass.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee 20, Florida 17 (OT): The Volunteers erased five years
of frustration by finally beating the Gators. Florida had 409 yards
passing, but fumbled four times and missed a 32-yard field goal in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech 41, Virginia 38: The Yellow Jackets overcame a
38-17 third quarter deficit by scoring 24 consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M 28, Nebraska 21: The Aggies established themselves as
a top team by getting revenge on the Cornhuskers for last year's
rout in the Big 12 Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA 41, Oregon State 34: Quite likely the best game few people
saw. The Beavers gave the Bruins all they wanted. UCLA avoided
overtime when Cade McNown hit Brad Melsby with a 61-yard touchdown
pass with 21 seconds remaining. TOP FIVE UPSETS
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State 28, Ohio State 24: The Spartans' second-half
rally shocked the Buckeyes in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State 24, Florida State 7: The Wolfpack denied
the Seminoles an undefeated season and, probably, a shot at the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor 33, North Carolina State 30: A week later, the Bears beat
the team that had beaten Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   TCU 35, Air Force 34: If not for this Horned Frogs victory, the
Falcons would be 11-0.
</P>
<P>
   Temple 28, Virginia Tech 24: One of the most unfathomable games
of this season. The Owls had not defeated a ranked team in 11
years. Temple trailed 17-0 in the first half.

 &HT;    Killer escapes Texas prison
 &HT;    WITH GRAPHIC
 &HT;    By Mike Ward and Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Seven condemned killers, camouflaged like
Ninja warriors in crude outfits made from long underwear dyed
black, attempted to escape from Texas' top-security death row early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One _ Martin E. Gurule, 29, sentenced to die for gunning down
two Corpus Christi residents in a 1992 restaurant robbery _ was
successful.
</P>
<P>
   During a fusillade of gunfire by guards that brought the quick
surrender of his six escape partners, Gurule scaled two tall
chain-link fences topped with razor wire and fled on foot into a
heavily wooded area nearby, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Friday, more than 500 searchers using dogs and
helicopters combed eight square miles around the Ellis Unit prison
in an attempt to locate Gurule, the first convict to successfully
flee from Texas' death row since the 1934 escape of two members of
the notorious Bonnie and Clyde gang.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities immediately launched an investigation to determine
how the convicts were able to carry out their elaborately-planned
escape without prior detection, fooling guards for hours with
makeshift dummies in their bunks, constructed from rolled-up
bedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have actually gotten out, (Gurule) was lucky as hell.
That's all there is to it,'' said prison spokesman Larry
Fitzgerald. ``Obviously, there was a breach in security somewhere,
and we're going to get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, who heads the prison division of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, echoed those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary mission is public safety,'' he said. ``We have
failed today''
</P>
<P>
   Captured before they were able to scale the prison fence were
Henry Earl Dunn, 24; James Edward Clayton, 32; Howard Paul Guidry,
22; Ponchai Wilkerson, 27; Gustavo Julian Garcia, 26; and Eric
Dewayne Cathey, 27. All face death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, the breakout began about 8:15 p.m.
Thursday when the convicts, housed in neighboring cells on
Cellblock H-17, went to a recreation yard for an hour of exercise.
Completely enclosed with chain-link fencing, the yard is next to
their three-story cellblock _ one of three that house death-row
convicts at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said the convicts peeled back the corner of a fence
and climbed onto the roof of the prison where, clad in the black
outfits, they went undetected in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they spent the night on the roof,'' Fitzgerald said.
``They had taken prison-issue long underwear and darkened it with
felt-tip markers, almost like Ninjas. How they got access to those
items, we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   During the night, the convicts made their way down the spine of
the prison's roof, from their cellhouse at the northwest corner of
the unit to the roof of the connected, one-story chapel at the
south edge, estimated to be about a quarter-mile in distance,
authorities said. There, about 12:20 a.m. Friday, they climbed down
and sprinted across a grassy area toward the double perimeter
fences, about midway between two guard towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We detected them jumping off the roof, and our officers fired
18 shots to try and stop them from reaching the fence,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``Six went to the ground immediately and surrendered.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gurule _ described as a wiry 5-foot-7, 130-pounder _ was
already on top of the outside fence, ahead of the group, when the
automatic-rifle shots rang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it over both the perimeter fences, through the razor
wire,'' Fitzgerald said. ``He dropped when we shot at him and we
thought he might have been hit.'' By late afternoon Friday,
searchers found blood outside the fenced area, but officials could
not confirm whether it was Gurule's.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule was last seen running south from the prison into the pine
woods, where the homes of prison officials are located. Roadblocks
were quickly set up on FM 980 about a half-mile south of the
prison, and teams of tracking dogs and armed guards on horseback
were dispatched to the scene as a manhunt was launched.
</P>
<P>
   But aided by a heavy early-morning fog that delayed some search
efforts, Gurule remained at large throughout the morning as a small
army of state troopers, Texas Rangers, prison guards, sheriffs
deputies and police conducted a house-to-house search of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Two helicopters, one borrowed from the U.S. Customs Service,
joined the massive search shortly before noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the area completely surrounded with an eight-mile
perimeter, so he's got to be in there somewhere,'' Fitzgerald said
about 1 p.m. Friday. ``It's just a matter of finding where.''
</P>
<P>
   To the south, north and west of the prison are pastures and
woods. To the east is a river and some swampy areas.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said they had found no trace that a getaway car
had been arranged outside the prison for the escapees, and had no
indication that Gurule was armed.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``we do consider this inmate dangerous,'' said prison
spokesman Larry Todd. ``We do think that they had been planning
this for several days.''
</P>
<P>
   Red-faced prison officials were at a loss to explain how so many
high-security convicts were missing undetected for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Many death row convicts spend most of their time in their cells,
allowed out only to shower or exercise or work in an adjacent
garment factory. But Gurule and the six others were among those
classified as ``work capable,'' meaning they could do chores as
orderlies on the cellblocks and could come and go from their cells
much of the day _ as long as they did not stray outside their
death-row cellblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They enjoyed a little more freedom of movement, and they used
that to their benefit in this case,'' Fitzgerald said. ``They went
to the rec yard on their own, and when the officer checked on them
and they weren't there, we checked their cells.''
</P>
<P>
   There, guards recorded them as present and accounted for. Only
after the escape alarm was sounded did prison officials discover
that the sleeping forms in the bunks actually were just rolled-up
bedsheets and pillows _ as Fitzgerald put it, ``just like in (the
movie) `Escape from Alcatraz.'''
</P>
<P>
   Internal affairs investigators on Friday began quizzing guards
and other prison staff about the chain of events to see whether an
official mistake may have unwittingly abetted the escape plan.
Gurule and his girlfriend, Malisa Smith, were convicted of the Oct.
12, 1992, robbery deaths of Minas ``Mike'' Piperis, a Corpus
Christi restaurant owner, and a cook, Anthony Staton. Prosecutors
said Gurule cut restaurant phone lines, stole more than $9,000 and
shot Piperis and Staton in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule testified at his 1993 trial that he shot the two men
because he feared for his life. Piperis had confronted him, Gurule
claimed, after he threatened to report Piperis to federal tax
agents. Smith was convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Piperis' family on Friday were dismayed by the news of Gurule's'
escape. ``I hope they find him,'' said Sophia Piperis, Mike's
cousin. ``(Gurule) killed two people for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they gave him the death sentence ... it's not going to
bring (Piperis) back,'' she said. ``But we'll feel a little better
when he gets what he deserves. That's all we want.'' Austin
American-Statesman staff writer Angela Shah contributed to this
story.

POPE EXPANDS RELIGIOUS INDULGENCES FOR MILLENNIUM OBSERVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs lede and makes changes throughout.)  (htv)

<P>
   ROME _ For Roman Catholics, the year 2000 offers early
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II announced Friday that in celebration of
entering the third millennium of Christianity, penitents who do a
charitable deed or give up cigarettes or alcohol for a day can earn
an ``indulgence'' to eliminate punishment on earth or in purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials emphasize that indulgences are linked to a
sincere repentance and are not a one-day expedient. Still, some
liberal Catholics are embarrassed by a practice that seems to offer
a simplistic shortcut to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences are an ancient form of church-granted amnesty that
release penitents from certain forms of punishment for past sins.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval church sold indulgences, a practice that drove
Martin Luther to rebel, leading to the Reformation. They remain a
source of theological debate between Protestants and Catholics, and
since Vatican II, the Roman Catholic Church had played down their
importance.
</P>
<P>
   By restoring indulgences to so prominent a position, John Paul
II is making penitence a theme of the church's observance of the
millennium. He is also reassuring conservatives in the church.
</P>
<P>
   But by broadening the ways believers can earn an indulgence, he
is also trying to imbue indulgences with some of the ecumenical
spirit he wants to give the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In a papal bull titled ``Incarnationis Mysterium'' (The Mystery
of the Incarnation) to be formally issued on Sunday, the pope
proclaimed 2000 a Holy Year, and put forth edicts that in many ways
serve as a practical guide for spiritual good works during the
Jubilee, or church anniversary. He decreed that the Jubilee would
begin on Christmas Day 1999 and end on the Feast of the Epiphany,
Jan. 6, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the papal document dealt with collective penitence.
Pope John Paul II asked Catholics to seek forgiveness for past
historical errors during the Jubilee. He also asked rich nations to
ease or substantially eliminate Third World debt.
</P>
<P>
   The pope said individual sinners would be granted ``plenary
indulgences,'' which cancel the punishment for repented sins. In
Catholic theology, souls in purgatory are purifying themselves
before their entry into heaven. The indulgences are not meant to
save people from eternal punishment if they commit grave sins and
do not repent, the church teaches.
</P>
<P>
   The pope included personal acts of penitence or charity work as
a way of earning an indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the millennial celebration, believers will be offered
a wider selection of ways to receive a plenary indulgence. They can
follow tradition and attend a Mass in one of several designated
churches and perform such devotions as the rosary or the stations
of the cross. Or, an appendix to the pope's letter says, they can
visit the sick, the imprisoned or the handicapped, or give to the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can choose an act of private sacrifice. The appendix,
signed by Cardinal William Baum, an American who is a top Vatican
official, explained: ``This would include abstaining for at least
one whole day from unnecessary consumption (e.g. from smoking, or
alcohol, or fasting.)''
</P>
<P>
   The text points out that sinners must also fulfill the ``usual
spiritual and sacramental conditions'' and say the ``usual
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Crescenzio Sepe, a top official in the Vatican's
Committee for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, said, ``One could
be tempted to think: `Today I won't smoke or I won't drink wine.
I'll get a plenary indulgence and go to paradise.' '' That, he
said, would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would not be the spirit of an indulgence,'' he said.
``That would be off-beam, like returning to the thinking of the
Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences are not one-day expedients, Sepe said, but he did
not make light of brief sacrifices. ``Its not so easy for some to
give up smoking for a day,'' he said. ``It might be easier to visit
a prison inmate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pope's decision to expand the use of indulgences during the
millennium celebration is not entirely surprising. In 1985, the
pope indicated his respect for the practice by allowing Catholics
to receive indulgences by television.
</P>
<P>
   Believers who followed on television or radio a church service
where an indulgence was granted could be included, as long as they
fulfilled the same conditions as those physically present,
including confession, communion and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But indulgences, which began in early Christian times, have not
always been viewed favorably.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century, Pope Julius II offered indulgences in
exchange for contributions to build St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
Luther protested, and as his theological criticisms mounted, he was
excommunicated in 1521.
</P>
<P>
   The church later banned the sale of indulgences, but the Vatican
reaffirmed their religious importance at the Council of Trent in
1563. In 1968, Pope Paul VI also elaborated on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Including indulgences in the 2000 Jubilee ``could not be
avoided,'' said the Rev. Jared Wicks, a theologian at Gregorian
University in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative Catholics would find it intolerable that, for
ecumenical considerations, the church put into the closet a
practice affirmed by the Council of Trent,'' Wicks said, adding
with a laugh, ``And John Paul II is not one to do anything like
that.''

BUS PLUNGES FROM BRIDGE AFTER DRIVER IS SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A city bus carrying 31 people plunged off a bridge
here and plowed through the outer edge of an apartment roof on
Friday afternoon after the driver was shot by a passenger. The
driver, and a person suspected of shooting the driver, were both
killed in the accident, the police said. Twenty-nine others were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was just starting to cross Aurora Avenue Bridge, which
spans the Lake Union ship canal, about 3:10 p.m. when the driver
was shot by a passenger, the police said. The bus, heading south,
jumped a lane of northbound traffic, hitting a van, then crashed
through a guardrail and fell 50 feet, landing upright in an
apartment garden in the Fremont district, an area of residential
buildings, restaurants and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers did not disclose a motive for the shooting. They
said that two suspects were involved, and that the second person
was among the injured taken to the hospital. The gun was recovered
at the hospital, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described a scene of panic as people with broken bones
and bleeding cuts tried to crawl out of the bus. Rescue officials
pulled out several people who were stuck in the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a loud, crashing sound and came rushing out of the
apartment,'' said Chris Badgley, who lives about 50 feet from where
the bus landed. ``People were screaming for help, stumbling about.
I heard several people say there had been gunshots fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Badgley said he saw two injured people on the roof of the
apartments. When aid units arrived, they gave emergency treatment
to people who could be seen on the apartment roof.
</P>
<P>
   All the passengers were injured, Fire Department officials said.
Fifteen of the injured were in critical condition Friday night and
10 were in serious condition, said a Fire Department spokeswoman,
Sheila Strehle.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, whose name was not released by the police, was
thrown from the bus, Fire Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus is a two-compartment vehicle with the two units held
together by an accordionlike mechanism. It usually carries 120
passengers. Had the bus traveled another quarter-mile or so, it
would have fallen several hundred feet and landed in the water. But
because the crash happened at the low end of the bridge, the bus
landed on ground.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Williams, a spokesman for Metro Bus who arrived at the scene
within minutes of the crash, said the bus was not smoking when it
landed. Fire Department officials said there was no fire on board.
But they expressed amazement that the bus landed upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like this has ever happened, that I know of,''
Williams said. Had the accident occurred two hours later, during
rush hour, it is likely the bus would have been full of people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the bus, with the window shattered, came to a rest
against a pine tree in a garden next to the apartment. A large
section of the roof of the two-story apartment _ the part that
hangs over the outside of the building _ was broken away in the
crash, as was a deck. But the police said they believed no one in
the apartment was injured.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Because it's a nice day, I thought my friends, who live there,
may have been gardening and could have been caught in this
accident,'' Badgley said.
</P>
<P>
   Badgley called rescue units, and said it took at least 10
minutes for help to arrive. But Fire Department officials said
units arrived within seven minutes. Before the authorities came to
the scene, some of the injured helped other people get out of the
bus, Badgley said.

<P>
   One of the bus compartments was shattered and crumpled.

BILL BRADLEY IS SAID TO PLAN PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. _ Although Bill Bradley has said he will decide
in December whether to run for president, several of his former
longtime aides and close advisers say they believe that he has
already made up his mind to seek the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The associates say that they have watched Bradley _ who served
three terms as a U.S. senator from New Jersey before retiring in
1996 _ wrestle with this decision in 1988, and again in 1992, and
that all signs point this time to a Bradley for president campaign
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks more like he is going to do it than I have ever seen
him,'' said Marcia Aronoff, who was Bradley's chief of staff for 13
years. ``I think his feeling is that this is a time when he can
make a major contribution. And if he does it, I don't think he is
doing it quixotically. He would be running to win.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey state Senate Democratic leader Richard Codey said he
also believed that Bradley had decided to run. ``If I were a
betting man, I would bet that he goes,'' said Codey, who has
already begun lining up Democratic county leaders in New Jersey
behind a Bradley presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley has not raised any money to mount a campaign,
some of his advisers say he has been quietly talking to potential
donors for support that he can begin tapping in January. He has
also asked some leading Democrats in New Jersey and around the
country to consider withholding support and endorsements for other
presidential contenders until he makes his decision. Then there are
the dozen states, including Iowa and California, he has visited in
recent months to campaign for fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bradley said he was not plotting his next
political move based on who is running and who is not. He said he
was not paying attention to the political analysts who say that
Vice President Al Gore has the Democratic nomination already locked
up because of the power of incumbency, the outcome of the midterm
elections and the lack of an independent counsel investigation into
campaign fund-raising. In keeping with his reputation for
introspection, Bradley said he was once again relying on his inner
voice to guide his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, I looked at myself in the mirror and I said, `I am
not ready,' '' he recalled. ``In 1992, I said, `You are ready, but
don't do it.' I honored that inner voice and didn't do it. And I'm
back with this question again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not on the phone calling 50 friends, asking them what I
should do,'' he continued. ``Basically, there are only two
threshold questions. One is where I think that whatever experience
or ability or talents that I have can be used to improve the
quality of life for millions of Americans, at this particular
moment in time. The second question is whether I want to put my
wife and family through what one seems to have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley's advisers say they believe he has decided to
run this time, they are not quitting their jobs or printing
placards yet. ``Veteran Bradley watchers know that until he tells
you what he is going to do, all of the speculation and predictions
are precisely that,'' said Anita Dunn, a former aide who is now a
partner at Squier, Knapp, Ochs &AMP; Dunn, a political consulting firm
in Washington. ``But I do think this time is different. He is
seriously considering it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his advisers say that this is perhaps his last shot.
After publicly flirting with the idea for a decade now, he risks
being placed next to former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo in the
pantheon of modern-day Hamlets. They also point out that he has the
support of his family and that his wife, Ernestine, is in good
health after battling breast cancer six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the Bradleys have lived in Montclair, a suburb of
older, gracious homes, and Mrs. Bradley has been a professor of
German and comparative literature at Montclair State University.
Mrs. Bradley accompanied her husband to a recent speech he
delivered before 400 people at Montclair High School, and when
asked by a reporter whether she would support his political
aspirations, she said, ``Whatever Bill wants to do, I will support
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been two years since Bradley _ who is 55, a former Rhodes
Scholar, a 1964 Olympic Gold Medalist in basketball, a member of
the New York Knicks for their championships in 1970 and 1973 and
now a best-selling author with ``Values of the Game'' _ left the
U.S. Senate, saying he was weary of the partisan bickering. He left
open the possibility of a presidential bid in 2000 and dismissed
those who said that giving up his Senate seat would make running
for the presidency more difficult, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes giving up power is a form of power,'' he
said at the time. ``To some people, that is self-evident. Other
people have to work at that thought a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tested some of his ideas in the last two years, with
teaching stints at Notre Dame, Stanford and the University of
Maryland. He was also an essayist on the weekend edition of ``The
CBS Evening News'' and worked with various groups, including a
project to promote changes in campaign finance laws and another
that trains college students to work in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   If he does decide to run, he faces considerable hurdles from the
well-financed and well-organized political machine of Gore, and
from other possible Democratic contenders. The list includes House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri; Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts; Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and Sen. Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is going to be a heavy burden to make a
case that outlines any real substantive differences with Al Gore,''
said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who won Bradley's old seat.
``The Democratic Party does not suffer from real ideological
differences at the moment. To challenge an incumbent vice
president, there is a burden to make some real contrasts on
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish himself from Gore, Bradley would mount an
insurgent, ``out-of-the-Beltway'' type of campaign that would try
to appeal directly to voters, one of his advisers said. Bradley
might also rely on expertise he has developed during his 18 years
in the Senate on issues from Third World debt to race relations.
</P>
<P>
   He would also begin immediately to try to raise about $25
million so that he could aggressively compete in the presidential
primaries now bunched in March. (New Jersey is considering
legislation to move its primary to March from June.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has not run a campaign since he nearly lost to Christie
Whitman in his 1990 Senate re-election race.
</P>
<P>
   But recent public polls show that he looks good to his former
constituents for a White House bid. But first, he has to decide to
run and then announce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows where he is going,'' Codey said. ``He is in no rush
to get there, at times. It is as if he is not making a political
decision when, in fact, it is all about politics.''

CLINTON RESPONDS TO HOUSE PANEL WITH FRESH DENIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a House panel pressed ahead in drafting proposed
articles of impeachment, President Clinton on Friday submitted an
affidavit reaffirming his view that although he misled people about
his sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, he did nothing to
warrant criminal charges or his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to 81 questions from the House Judiciary Committee,
Clinton painstakingly denied that he lied under oath, obstructed
justice, or abused the power of his office in a recently settled
sexual-harassment lawsuit against him and a federal investigation
into the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued the rebuttal as the impeachment proceedings enter
a critical phase, with the committee and the full House tentatively
scheduled to vote in the next two weeks on whether to send formal
charges to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's responses disclosed no significant new information
on the Lewinsky matter and were likely to have little impact on the
Judiciary Committee's Republican majority, which is expected to
approve at least one article of impeachment against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In a foreword to the responses, Clinton said his legalistic
defense to the allegations ``cannot obscure the hard truth, as I
have said repeatedly, that my conduct was wrong. It was also wrong
to mislead people about what happened, and I deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   The frank admission was in stark contrast to many of Clinton's
carefully crafted legal responses. Although he repeatedly asserted
that his testimony ``was not false and misleading'' in the Paula
Corbin Jones sexual-harassment case and the federal inquiry by the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, Clinton's intricate answers
to several of the questions were reminiscent of his earlier
statements that Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat, had derided as ``a dangerous game of verbal Twister.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton maintained his position, for example, that he did not
utter a false statement in January when he told reporters he wanted
``to say one thing to the American people. ... I did not have
sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In referring to `sexual relations,''' Clinton stated in his
24-page affidavit, ``I was referring to sexual intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is central to his legal defense that he
testified truthfully under oath about the nature of his
relationship with Lewinsky based on a definition of sexual
relations that US District Judge Susan Webber Wright had issued in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Clinton's responses also cited his inability to remember
numerous details that could shed significant light on the
allegations against him. Among other matters, the details relate to
an allegedly false affidavit that Lewinsky filed in the Jones case
and efforts by Clinton's close friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., to
find Lewinsky her ``dream'' job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lewinsky's affidavit, in which she denied having a sexual
relationship with Clinton, the president said he could not
recollect whether he saw the affidavit before he was asked about it
in a deposition in the Jones case in January. ``I do not believe I
saw this affidavit before my deposition, although I cannot be
absolutely sure,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated that he did not ask his secretary, Betty
Currie, to hide gifts he had given Lewinsky. The gifts had been
subpoenaed as evidence in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few blunt admissions in his responses, Clinton
acknowledged deceiving at least six top White House aides about his
sexual liaisons with Lewinsky in the White House. ``I did not want
my family, friends or colleagues to know the full nature of my
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,'' he stated. ``I misled people
about the relationship. I have repeatedly apologized for doing
so.''
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged for the first time that his former
political adviser, Dick Morris, volunteered to conduct a poll for
him soon after the Lewinsky affair first made headlines. Starr
cited the poll in his appearance last week before the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, referring to Morris's view of the poll results, said,
``What I recall is that he said the public was most concerned about
obstruction of justice or subornation of perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he could not recall a statement that Morris
attributed to him in responding to the poll results: ``Well, we
just have to win then.''
</P>
<P>
   With recent polls showing broad public opposition to ousting
Clinton, the president also tried to cast the Lewinsky matter as a
personal indiscretion rather than a political or legal quandary.
</P>
<P>
   His foreword stated: ``For me, this long ago ceased to be
primarily a legal or political issue and became instead a painful
personal one, demanding atonement and daily work toward
reconciliation and restoration of trust with my family, my friends,
my administration and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee chairman Henry J. Hyde sent Clinton the 81
questions last month, asking him to admit or deny numerous aspects
of the allegations against him to help expedite the impeachment
process. On Tuesday, Hyde all but accused Clinton of failing to
cooperate with the committee because he had not yet answered the
questions. Hyde vowed to subpoena the answers if Clinton did not
respond by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Hyde acknowledged receipt of the
affidavit and said, ``The committee will now carefully review those
responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also has given Clinton a deadline of next Wednesday to
inform the Judiciary Committee whether he or his lawyers plan to
appear before the panel or present additional information in his
defense.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hyde has scheduled a hearing Tuesday in which
individuals convicted of perjury and other witnesses will testify
about the consequences of lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a congressional source said the Republican staff on
the Judiciary Committee is busy drafting as many as three proposed
articles of impeachment that would charge Clinton with perjury,
obstruction of justice, and abusing the power of his office. The
source said one or more of the proposed articles could be rejected
by the panel's Republicans, although the GOP-controlled committee
is seen as all but certain to approve at least one article of
impeachment alleging perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is tentatively scheduled to vote the week of Dec.
6 on the possible impeachment charges and on a Democratic
alternative that would call for condemning Clinton's behavior in
the Lewinsky affair. The full House is expected to vote the week of
Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, who had submitted two lengthy rebuttals to
the allegations, sent a letter to Hyde Friday saying they will
submit ``a further memorandum on behalf of the president in the
near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter made no mention of Clinton appearing before the
committee, a scenario that is considered highly unlikely.

TONY DORSETT, MOVE OVER: RICKY WILLIAMS HAS ARRIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It took a 24-yard field goal by Texas kicker
Kris Stockton with nine seconds remaining before Ricky Williams,
the Longhorns' magnificent running back, could celebrate his
remarkable season.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton's field goal gave the Longhorns a 26-24 victory over
Texas A&AMP;M but the eyes of Texas were squarely on Williams on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The record crowd of 83,687 at Darrell K. Royal Texas Memorial
Stadium watched Williams become the most prolific runner in college
football history.
</P>
<P>
   _ He broke the National Collegiate Athletic Association rushing
record held for 22 years by Tony Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   _ He broke the NCAA all-purpose yard mark set by Napoleon
McCallum of Navy.
</P>
<P>
   _ He tied the NCAA record for most career 200 yard rushing games
(11) held by Marcus Allen.
</P>
<P>
   _ He became just the eighth player in NCAA history to surpass
2,000 rushing yards in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Williams has 6,279 yards rushing and 7,206 yards of
total offense, and he has never returned kickoffs or punts. The
NCAA rushing record is owned by Brian Shay of Emporia State (Div.
II) with 6,958 yards. Jerry Azumah of New Hampshire holds the
Division I-AA mark of 6,280 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his glorious day would have been tainted if Texas
(8-3) had lost to Texas A&AMP;M (10-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had lost, I wouldn't be standing here right now,'' said
Williams, who carried 44 times for 259 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 6-feet, 225 pounds, decided to skip the National
Football League draft in April, and a chance to earn millions of
dollars, in order to return to a Texas team that had gone 4-7 in
1997 and was starting over with a new coach, Mack Brown, whom
Williams didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Williams entered the game needing just 63 yards to pass
Dorsett's mark of 6,082 career rushing yards, which he set at
Pittsburgh from 1973-76. Considering that Williams averaged 7.1
yards per carry against the Aggies in his career at Texas, it
wasn't a matter of whether Williams would break Dorsett's record.
It was when he would and in what fashion.
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minute 45 seconds to play in the first quarter, Williams
brought a swift end to the suspense with a spectacular 60-yard
touchdown off tackle run that showcased everything that makes him
the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the handoff, he broke free of an arm tackle in the
backfield, pulled away from a tackle at the line of scrimmage, then
racing down the left side line, Williams got a block from his
teammate, receiver Wane McGarity, and then fell into the end zone
with Aggies cornerback Jason Webster riding his back.
</P>
<P>
   Williams ran to the sideline where he was mobbed by his
teammates and greeted by Dorsett and Earl Campbell, the former
Texas Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited for Ricky I was jumping up and down when he
was running down the field,'' Dorsett said.
</P>
<P>
   After the record setting ball was secure, Williams went back to
work on breaking the NCAA mark for all purpose yards (7,172) set by
McCallum (1981-85). He picked that record up with 11 minutes to
play in the fourth quarter when he scooted around right end on a
38-yard run. At that point Williams had 40 carries for 250 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, each record breaker was followed by a goof by Williams.
On his first carry after setting the rushing record, Williams was
stripped of the ball and fumbled at the 19-yard line. That turnover
led to the Aggies' first touchdown of the game _ a 20-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Randy McCown to tight end Derrick
Spiller. That score narrowed Texas' lead to 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   On Williams first carry after setting the all-purpose yards
record, he fumbled again, bobbling a pitch that was recovered at
the Texas 16. Two plays later McCown hit Spiller for his second
touchdown of the day on a 16 yard pass play that helped make it
23-17 Texas, and helped put the surging Aggies back into the game
with 7:39 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ricky to forget about the fumbles,'' Brown said. ``What
was I going to do? Go jump on him?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams performance completely overshadowed the accomplishment
of his friend, Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen, who passed the 500
career tackle mark. Nguyen, who has 132 tackles on the season, said
before the game that he hoped Williams would get his records, but
the Aggies would win the game. Williams walked away with the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   During all the excitement over Ricky's records, the Aggies were
sneaking back in the game. Texas A&AMP;M took its only lead of the
game, 24-23, with 2:20 to play after McCown plowed in on a
quarterback keeper from a yard out and the team converted the extra
point attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Texas got the ball back at its own 23 with just over 2 minutes
to play and all three time outs. They moved the ball down the field
on the Aggies defense by passing over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Aptly enough, Williams had the final carry of the game, a 7-yard
run down the left side to pick up a first down at the Aggies 7.
That put the ball on the left hash for Stockton, who had missed two
other field goals on the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there was a huge ceremony honoring Williams at
midfield. It came complete with a two-minute highlight video on one
of the scoreboard screens. of the stadium.

MAN CONVICTED OF IRISH REPORTER'S MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The man who disposed of the gun that was used to kill
the Irish newspaper reporter Veronica Guerin was convicted of her
murder Friday, clearing the way for the prosecution of several
other men accused of targeting the journalist because she wrote
embarrassing stories about them.
</P>
<P>
   Paul ``Hippo'' Ward, 34, was sentenced to life in prison by
three judges in the Special Criminal Court here, which sits without
a jury in cases in which jurors could be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, a former heroin addict, claimed he was just a bit player
in the conspiracy to kill Guerin, who was gunned down in broad
daylight June 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of one of Ireland's most prominent journalists, who
had persisted in her investigations despite a beating and death
threats by traffickers, underscored how brazen Irish criminals had
become while exploiting a relatively new drug culture.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin's husband, Graham Turley, who is raising their 8-year-old
son, watched impassively as the verdict was read. Guerin's brother,
Jimmy, left the courthouse saying, ``I'm pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish police also were gratified by the verdict, as the evidence
they had gathered against Ward was circumstantial. Most of the
evidence against Ward was provided by the uncorroborated testimony
of Charles Bowden, a former soldier who was part of the gang that
allegedly killed Guerin because her stories focused attention on
their activities.
</P>
<P>
   But while the verdict may have emboldened the authorities here
to prosecute several other men, including the alleged gang leader,
John Gilligan, the three judges criticized police tactics used to
snare the alleged killers. The judges refused to accept Ward's
alleged confession to police, saying they were not convinced it
took place, and that even if it did, it was obtained in violation
of Ward's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said the police used extreme psychological pressure
on Ward while detaining and interrogating him, and Ward claimed one
detective punched him in the face during an interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finucane, a spokesman for the Irish Council for Civil
Liberties, said his group was worried about the precedent set by a
court basing its decision on the uncorroborated word of an
informer.
</P>
<P>
   Most Irish people, however, are unconcerned about the alleged
extreme measures used by the authorities to hunt down the killers
of Guerin. Her murder was widely considered an attack on the state,
and the public demanded a crackdown on gangland figures. Police
responded with the biggest murder investigation in the history of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick ``Dutchy'' Holland, the man who police say shot Guerin,
was convicted earlier this year of drug dealing and sentenced to 20
years. He has not been formally charged with Guerin's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan, a career criminal who had gotten out of prison and
tried to reinvent himself as a country squire by buying a stud farm
in rural County Kildare, allegedly orchestrated Guerin's murder
after she exposed him and confronted him at his estate. He is
fighting extradition in Britain, where he was arrested after
Guerin's murder while trying to flee Ireland with about $400,000 in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect, Brian ``The Tosser'' Meehan, is scheduled to go
on trial in June. Meehan allegedly drove the assassin, who leapt
off a motorcycle and shot Guerin as she was stopped at a traffic
light outside Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan's sister is Ward's girlfriend, and she was there Friday
to hear the verdict. Ward was convicted of disposing of the .357
Magnum used to kill Guerin and the motorcycle used by her
assassins.

   NASDAQ AND S&AMP;P INDEXES REACH RECORD HIGHS
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a possible merger between Mobil and Exxon sent stocks
higher. The Nasdaq composite index climbed above 2,000 for the
first time since July 20. It rose 31.23 points, to 2,016.44,
setting a new high just two points above its previous top of
2,014.25.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in a week, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index recorded a new high, closing up 5.46 points at 1,192.33. The
Dow Jones industrial average increased 18.80 points, to 9,333.08.
It is just 41 points short of the record it set Monday.

   VIAG BUYING CHEMICAL CONCERN
</P>
<P>
   Viag, Germany's third-largest utility, is acquiring the chemical
company Algroup AG of Switzerland in a stock swap worth $8.7
billion. The companies expect savings of about $334 million a year
after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   BANK DEAL DETAILS EXPECTED MONDAY
</P>
<P>
   Details of the $9.67 billion acquisition by the German banking
giant Deutsche Bank of Bankers Trust are expected Monday. One of
the main issues is how many employees will be laid off. Another is
how the deal will be financed. Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust said
the purchase would be paid for in cash, but it was not clear
whether Deutsche would dip into its own reserves to buy Bankers or
raise the money by other means.
</P>
<P>
   CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BARCLAYS QUITS
</P>
<P>
   John Martin Taylor, chief executive of Barclays PLC, resigned
after Britain's second-largest bank said it had suffered losses in
investment banking and indicated that pretax profit this year may
fall short of analysts' expectations. The last three years have
been tough for Barclays, which recorded a $415 million charge
against earnings this year for its exposure to Russian securities
and loans. That followed charges last year from the sale of the
equities business of its BZW investment banking unit, and higher
costs the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RULES FOR CHILDREN'S DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   The government issued rules that require drug companies to
conduct much wider testing of drugs for children, so the companies
can write labels that provide detailed information to doctors and
parents about proper use. Pediatricians and patients' groups
praised the rules while drug companies called them impractical and
burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   PAN-EUROPEAN MARKET PLANNED
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of eight major European stock exchanges agreed to
take steps toward creating a pan-European market that could one day
rival Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA CUTS TAXES TO SPUR SPENDING
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has decided to lower corporate taxes to
30 percent and value-added taxes to 14 percent to stimulate
industry and encourage more consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   KLM AND ALITALIA FORM ALLIANCE
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch national airline, KLM, and its Italian counterpart,
Alitalia, announced a far-reaching global alliance under which they
would merge their passenger and cargo activities next year.
</P>
<P>
   1991 FAA ORDER IGNORED
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order
requiring eight cargo airlines to change the way cargo doors are
attached to old Boeing 727s converted to freighter use. The agency
originally ordered the changes in 1991 for safety reasons, but it
contends the airlines ignored the request.
</P>
<P>
   CROCK-POT MAKER GETS OFFER
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Crock-Pot and Pollenex products, Rival, received an
unsolicited offer from an unidentified buyer and hired a financial
adviser to help it evaluate the bid.

VOTING SYSTEM TAINTED, NYC UNION LEADERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The admitted vote fraud at New York City's largest
municipal union grows out of a system in which officials with a
strong interest in the results usually oversee both the voting and
the counting of the ballots, union leaders and labor experts say.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, they said, the large-scale fraud in the 1996
ratification vote on District Council 37's current five-year
contract was not an isolated instance of vote rigging at the union,
which represents 120,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, they said, ballots have been dumped down fire
escapes, officials designated to count votes have deliberately
defaced ballots, and union leaders have given allies hundreds of
extra mail-in ballots to fill out as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   And last January, hundreds of ballots in the race for the
presidency of an engineers' local were stolen from the district
council's locked security office. That occurred after the
incumbent, who was close to Stanley Hill, the council's executive
director, saw that he was trailing in a preliminary vote count.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been suspicions of vote fraud at DC 37 for years,''
said Carl Biers, executive director of the Association for Union
Democracy, a nonprofit monitoring group in New York. ``A lot of
members have no faith in the elections. The best thing would be for
an independent outside group to administer their elections.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Hill announced that the council's
associate director and another senior official had resigned after
they admitted knowing about the fraud in the 1996 vote. Hill has
told other union leaders that the two officials not only knew about
the fraud but also participated in it.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud took place during a complicated ratification process
that involved 56 union locals and stretched out over two months.
Each local chose how to conduct its vote: some locals voted by hand
at union meetings, some had members cast ballots at work sites, and
others had members mail ballots to district council headquarters. A
handful of locals, to avoid suspicions of fraud, had the American
Arbitration Association administer and count their vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vote fraud is part of a broad investigation by Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who is also looking into
allegations of embezzlement, falsifying records, and kickbacks from
caterers, travel agencies and other vendors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers knowledgeable about the investigation said that Joseph
DeCanio, president of a highway workers' local, had told
prosecutors that the fraud took place when several union officials
filled out phony ballots at a large clerical workers' local. The
local is headed by Albert Diop, one of Hill's staunchest allies.
</P>
<P>
   Diop and Hill denied knowing anything about the fraud until The
New York Times reported last week that prosecutors were
investigating the ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Hill said he had no idea why the two
officials who resigned _ Martin Lubin, the council's associate
director, and Mark Shaplo, Lubin's top assistant _ helped rig the
vote. Neither Shaplo nor Lubin has publicly spoken about their
resignations or the vote fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Several union leaders said these two officials might have wanted
to spare Hill the embarrassment of having his rank and file reject
a contract _ containing an unpopular two-year pay freeze _ that he
had negotiated. The two officials, union leaders say, might have
also wanted to please Hill's ally Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who might
have felt betrayed by a contract defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the whole purpose of the fraud was to affect the
outcome,'' said Charles Ensley, an opponent of the contract who
heads a 14,000-member social workers' local.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidents of several locals calling for Hill to resign
or for the parent union to place the council into trusteeship, Mark
Rosenthal, president of a local representing 2,800 motor vehicle
operators, said Friday that Ensley should be the next executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   Although they said they did not know the specifics, several
union leaders at District Council 37 said they believed that
thousands of phony ballots were probably stuffed into mail bags so
they would be counted with other ballots cast by the clerical
workers' local. According to lawyers knowledgeable about the
investigation, DeCanio has told prosecutors he once saw hundreds of
blank mail-in ballots in Shaplo's office.
</P>
<P>
   Several union officials said the vote rigging in the clerical
local was not the only suspect activity in the 1996 ratification
vote. DeCanio has told other union leaders that some local
presidents gave council officials false vote totals: for instance,
if 200 members at a local's meeting voted in favor of the contract,
the local's president might report that 300 had.
</P>
<P>
   John Socha, president of a local representing workers at the
Queens Public Library, said he complained to Hill in 1996 that
council officials had counted his local's mail-in ballots without
anyone from his local present. Socha said this was suspicious, and
he added that he was surprised when council officials announced,
against his expectations, that his local had voted overwhelmingly
for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that when it looked as if the contract would
be defeated, members of the council's staff were sent into the
field to urge workers to vote for ratification. This official said
staff members were even told to give mail ballots to members from
locals that had already carried out their votes at union meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials point to other recent episodes of vote fraud.
Last week, DeCanio pleaded guilty to embezzlement and to giving
hundreds of blank ballots early this month to the candidate who he
wants to succeed him as president of the highway workers' local. At
his guilty plea, DeCanio explained that he had hoped his preferred
candidate would fill in the ballots fraudulently to guarantee his
victory.
</P>
<P>
   And in the election last January for the presidency of the
6,800-member Civil Service Technical Guild, Roy Commer was leading
the incumbent, Louis Albano, a Hill ally, in the preliminary count.
Both sides agreed to suspend the count well past midnight one
night, before a final tally was made. The ballots were then locked
inside the council's main security office, but when union officials
took the election materials out several days later, they discovered
that ballots and other materials had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was incredulous,'' said Commer. ``I became very angry and
disheartened. I thought, if they could do this in the first
election, what would stop them from doing it until they got it
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Council officials ordered a new election, and Commer won. His
opponent, Albano, has repeatedly denied encouraging or knowing
about the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a widespread suspicion that whenever ballots were
sent into the mail room and counted at D.C. 37 headquarters, the
results came out the way the leadership wanted,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill insists that vote fraud at the council is limited to a
handful of examples. Yet, in discussing the issue, he pointed to a
long history of fraud, noting that when he ran for the presidency
of the social workers' local in 1970, his opponent was found to
have thrown ballots down a fire escape.

BROADWAY PARADE TO COMMEMORATE WORLD AIDS DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Tuesday, an advocacy group will march down
Broadway to commemorate World AIDS Day, having successfully argued
in court that the Giuliani administration showed more concern for a
Yankees ticker-tape parade than about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In Co-op City, a middle-class housing development in the Bronx,
residents will be invited to gather in prayer and song for the
first time. The World AIDS Day organizer there, Crystal Dove-Paris,
acknowledges it will be an uphill battle to ``lift the veil of
silence'' about AIDS in her community of 55,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   From the simple grass roots of a Co-op City courtyard to
organized rallies in lower Manhattan and throughout the nation,
Tuesday will be a time marked by silent vigils and solemn readings
of the names of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   But now in its 11th year, the global day of remembrance is
taking on a renewed burst of activism, according to many advocates
for people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the needs of people with HIV feel more pressing,
even desperate, as public perception grows that the AIDS crisis is
a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increasing frustration and a realization that
people are going to have to take some matters into their own
hands,'' said Catherine Hanssens, the director of the AIDS Project
at Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York. ``AIDS has
become the invisible elephant in the living room that people
pretend does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors have contributed to the increased activity,
including a greater emphasis on reminding the public that people
are still dying, even as powerful new drugs have improved the
health of many others, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a growing willingness to confront politicians and
government officials who are viewed as hostile to people with AIDS,
according to advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Charles E. King, co-executive director of Housing Works, whose
group will march and hold a vigil outside city hall, said many more
people want to participate in the World AIDS Day events than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   He believes anger has outweighed fear of recrimination from the
Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had calls from dozens of organizations from around the
city wanting to participate,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the march was Housing Works and Act Up, and now
we have all these other groups saying we really want to be a
part,'' he said. ``It's very clear that people want to make a
statement to the mayor.''

NEW AIR CONTROL COMPUTERS LACK AN AUDIBLE ALARM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration is about to
begin replacing the mainframe computers that have been the
workhorses of its 20 long-distance air traffic control centers for
high-altitude aircraft, installing newer, more reliable models. And
it is starting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The new computers _ the IBM model G-3 _ will replace another IBM
model, the 3083, that was installed from 1986 to 1988 but is now
obsolete and troublesome. FAA officials said the new computers
would be free of the year 2000 flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Like the current computers, the replacements will label each
airplane on a controller's screen and show its position, drawing
this information from distant radars and the airplanes' own flight
plans.
</P>
<P>
   But agency officials and the technicians who maintain the
computers disagree on certain aspects of the planned switchover.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the technicians' union, the Professional Airways
System Specialists, say FAA is rushing the new system into place
with a ``jury-rigged'' alarm feature that could allow the computer
to fail without notice, for example, if the system lost track of an
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The technicians are complaining that the FAA is not buying the
underlying computer code from IBM; doing so would have allowed them
to reconfigure the machines themselves. They also complain that the
agency is giving IBM the job of stocking spare parts and providing
maintenance, at least initially. This decision, they say, means
that the agency will not be able to repair or make changes in the
new machines when IBM decides to stop supporting them, just as has
happened with the current computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new computers are scheduled to be switched on in all 20 Air
Route Traffic Control Centers by September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The first pair of the new computers are scheduled to go into
service briefly on Dec. 12 at the center in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.,
adjacent to MacArthur Airport in Suffolk County. If all goes well,
the system will be tried out again the following weekend, and then
turned on full-time in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Ronkonkoma center, on Long Island, is the most complex in
the country because it has a high volume of traffic in a relatively
small area.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has tried before to replace its aging air traffic
control computers, but real modernization requires rewriting its
one-of-a-kind software, and the agency has not been able to do
this.
</P>
<P>
   The old IBM 3083s, for example, are mainframe units that were
once widely used by businesses. Except for the FAA, officials
believe, the model is no longer used anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 3083s have broken down intermittently around the country,
forcing controllers to spread planes more widely, and causing
delays that have rippled through the system.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, IBM refused to certify that the 3083s would cope with
the rollover of dates from 1999 to 2000, saying it could not fix
them because it had no one who still understood the model's
computer code. The FAA's solution was to hire retired programmers
who were familiar with the 3083 to solve the problem. But that was
a temporary solution, at best, because experts said that one part
of the computer that burns out and requires regular replacement is
no longer manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost the recipe,'' said Peter Challan, director of air
traffic systems at the FAA. The part is identified only as a CLVM.
Neither FAA officials nor IBM officials can remember what this
designation stands for. Challan said the part has a large,
perfectly flat plate that is used to draw excess heat out of the
computer, but which tends to be damaged by heat over long periods.
Each air traffic control center has a pair of computers, one of
them a backup, that together generate 120,000 Btu an hour, as much
as some home heating systems.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, said that only about two dozen
spares remained. But the newer machines, the G-3's, are no longer
in production either, having been replaced by IBM's current model,
the G-5. Challan said his agency preferred the G-3's because they
have a long track record and have been thoroughly studied. The FAA
has a contract that insures that outside contractors will provide
support for the G-3 through 2008, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Challan said about 1,000 G-3 models are still in use.
</P>
<P>
   One point of contention between FAA officials and technicians
over the replacement computers has been the alarm system. When
something goes wrong with a 3083, causing the system, for example,
to lose track of a plane, it sounds an audible alarm, like a klaxon
horn, according to Michael Fanfalone, president of the technicians'
union. A technician has to push a button to turn the horn off.
</P>
<P>
   The initial plan for the G-3's was a message that would pop up
on the screen, like an error message on a computer screen. But at
the centers, the technician on duty might be performing tasks away
from the screen, the union complained.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, the company that is handling the changeover to
the new computers, changed the programming so that if the
computer's diagnostic programs find a problem, they will dial a
telephone number at the traffic control centers.
</P>
<P>
   But Fanfalone said that that system, too, is inadequate. ``It's
like a hotel wake-up call,'' he said, except that when a technician
answers, there is nothing on the other end of the line. He said
someone walking through might pick up the phone, hear no one and
hang it up, eliminating the alarm, or the phone might ring because
someone had mistakenly dialed the number.
</P>
<P>
   Challan, however, said that the areas where the phones were
located were accessible only to authorized people, and that
everyone would be trained on what the ringing of the phone would
mean. An old-fashioned alarm will be installed in a software change
in February, he said.

WHAT TO SEE FIRST: PIG, BUGS OR BABIES? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LESLIE EATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daddy and the pet bunny rabbit had to stay home, but
the rest of the Kissel family was waiting patiently Friday morning
to see the new movie about Babe the talking pig, on one of the
biggest family filmgoing days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest everything day,'' said Elena Kissel, who was
holding Rosalie, 3, and standing with Siena, 10, and Lucy, 7,
outside a theater on the Upper East Side, near their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're avoiding shopping and Rockefeller Center, and went to
the early show because we thought it wouldn't be as crowded,'' she
added with a small sigh, looking at the already sizable line ahead
of her, 15 minutes before the 11 a.m. showing.
</P>
<P>
   Similar sighs echoed across the city and in malls all over the
suburbs, as parents and their offspring mobbed theaters showing one
or more of the three new must-see movies for munchkins. In addition
to the porcine sequel ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' the current
juvenile blockbusters include ``The Rugrats Movie'' and ``A Bug's
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, many families avoided waiting in line by buying
their tickets in advance through Moviefone, which estimates that by
the end of the weekend it will have received 30 percent more
requests for information and tickets than it did for the same
period last year, said Matt Blumberg, a vice president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the movies over this long weekend has become a holiday
rite that ranks right up there with turkey leftovers for many
families. ``Basically, all of these children want to see all of
these big movies as soon as possible _ like the day after
Thanksgiving,'' said Trish Lepre, the lone adult escorting six
youngsters to ``Rugrats'' in Rye Brook, in Westchester. ``It's a
ritual with them.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the unusual number of children's cinematic offerings
is frustrating some parents, who are faced with either a moviegoing
marathon or moping moppets. Doug Johnson, who was taking his two
children and three of their small friends to see ``A Bug's Life''
in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said he wished all these movies hadn't
opened at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should spread them out,'' he said. ``There's a market for
more kids' movies, but up to a week ago there was nothing to see.
Now there's too much and no time.''
</P>
<P>
   But other parents seemed perfectly happy to sit through not just
one, but two, or all three of these movies, even in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so relaxing for me,'' said Gerri McKay-Kellett of
Rumson, N.J., who was taking her 4-year-old daughter, Adele, first
to see ``Rugrats,'' then straight to ``Babe.'' (Adele is a Rugrats
fan because, she explained, ``They play in the mud and get all
gooey _ that's what I want to do.'')
</P>
<P>
   Robin Spalin limited her two children to just one movie on
Friday, the newly restored version of the 1939 classic ``The Wizard
of Oz.'' But Erika, 7, and Lars, 5, didn't seem to mind _ they were
on their first visit from New Rochelle to Manhattan, including the
next best thing to the Emerald City: the Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see `Rugrats' over Christmas,'' Mom said.
</P>
<P>
   Peer pressure at school is part of the reason children insist
they absolutely must spend a perfectly sunny day at the movies.
``Kids talk about movies at school,'' said Glenn Moody, 13, who was
watching ``A Bug's Life'' with his sister Christine, 9, in Rye
Brook. ``If you haven't seen it, you're out of the loop.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Then there is the not-so-subtle pressure from advertising,
tie-ins at fast-food restaurants and toy promotions. The longest
lines in all Manhattan Friday were not at the movies, but at FAO
Schwarz on Fifth Avenue, where a giant effigy of Babe and his
friend Ferdinand the duck loomed over the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Gordon took her grandchildren Jordan and Lili Dworkin
there first thing, before heading to the East Side to see the pig
on screen. That way, Jordan (``I'm 5 and three-quarters'') could
take his new stuffed Babe out of the box and hold it on his lap
during the show.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Blohm, 3, acquired his wind-up blue plastic bug in the
course of a baby bacchanal: lunch at McDonald's with his mama, Anne
Bellec, followed by a trip to the movies. Like many small children
these days, Eric is something of a cineaste, having already seen
Disney's ``Mulan'' last summer at a theater, along with countless
videos at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the wide screen still has the power to impress even the most
jaded small children, or at least those who attended a Friday
afternoon showing of ``Rugrats '' in Manhattan. Though getting an
exact count of an audience is difficult when many members are so
small their heads do not clear the backs of their seats, it looked
as if about 100 children sat through the screening with a minimum
of squirming.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they were transfixed, exactly. The youngest members of
the audience kept up the toddler's running interrogatory: ``Where
are they going? What are they doing? Is that a monster, Mommy?''
</P>
<P>
   Older children howled with the wolf, squawked with the monkeys
and sang along with the babies. Adults were mostly quiet, except
when asking, ``Does anybody have to blow their nose?'' in response
to particularly loud sneezes.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie was over, David Cooper, 5, allowed that he had
found some parts of the movie ``a little scary,'' but his brother
Jeremy and his friend Sammy Chipkin, both sophisticates of 9, said
they thought it was funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the adventure,'' one said. ``I like the songs,'' the
other said. All three called the movie ``really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Cooper, the adult they had in tow, translated their
comments into adult terms. ``Two thumbs up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the report from the Kissel household was that
``Babe'' had been a hit, at least with the two youngest viewers.
But Siena, who once went to the same movie three times in two days,
wants to see two more films this weekend, two that might be a bit
over the heads of her siblings: ``The Waterboy'' and
``Pleasantville.''

FURBY FERVOR GETS UGLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Parents, grandparents, and other holiday shoppers
launched the War of the Furbies yesterday _ around 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people were lined up outside the Wal-Mart in Lynn,
Mass., wrapped in blankets or sleeping bags to shield them from the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   They had expected to be able to start buying Furbies at
midnight, but then were told by employees that they would have to
wait until 6 to snag the season's hottest new toy: a $30 talking,
sneezing, burping, dancing creature a bit larger than a softball.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, as the anxious shoppers were being let in five at a
time to buy the furry toy, no one told the others waiting outside
that there were only 30 of the colorful electronic dolls on the
shelves to begin with. Two Lynn police officers the store had hired
for the overnight detail were quickly joined by four more officers
as customer fury grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were yelling at us, wanting to know why they waited in
line if there were only 30 dolls,'' Wal-Mart co-manager Steven
Gamache said yesterday. ``But if we had announced that earlier, it
would have gotten ugly outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Zamparelli, the Cambridge father of a 7-year-old and twin
5-year-olds, said he was outside the Wal-Mart at around 11:30 p.m.
on Thanksgiving, waiting with up to 1,000 others for the store's
advertised midnight Furby sale. He knew he'd be allowed to purchase
only one, he said, so he planned to be at Kay-Bee Toys in Cambridge
by 5 a.m. to buy two more.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 a.m., though, a disgusted Zamparelli left Wal-Mart
empty-handed, and the crowd started dwindling as managers were
still explaining to hundreds of furious customers why the store had
decided to postpone the midnight sale until 6 a.m. Zamparelli said
one customer had even called the Salem Wal-Mart, and told the
parents waiting in the Lynn store's parking lot not to bother going
over there: They were sold out already.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn police yesterday said they had no reports of arrests or any
other incidents at the store.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers and clerks around Greater Boston, opening up to
four hours earlier than usual to handle the year's busiest shopping
day, had stories to tell yesterday about how the toy in short
supply flew off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Higgins, &UR;  &LR; a clerk at the Kay-Bee in Cambridge, arrived
yesterday at 5:15 a.m. and handed out pairs of tickets to about 200
people in line, limiting them to two dolls each. The store opened
at 7 a.m. and more than 200 dolls were gone within the hour,
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were upset. Those who didn't get tickets would come up
and say they lost theirs,'' Higgins said. A second shipment of 60
Furbies at 11 a.m. yesterday was gone within 30 minutes, she said.
Clerks like Higgins said they did not know when other shipments
were due.
</P>
<P>
   The animated Furby is made by Hasbro Inc.'s Tiger Electronics
division. Word of the toy hit the streets in early fall, and
because it became available late in the distribution cycle, Furbies
are being shipped from China by air rather than sea, said a Tiger
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The doll has a 200-word vocabulary and interacts with humans _
and apparently with other Furbies _ using sound, light, and motion
sensors. The more you play with it, the better it responds, says
its creator.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for Furby so outweighs supply right now that F.A.O.
Schwarz in Boston won't even stock it, and instead calls customers
on its 20-page waiting list when a shipment comes in, said Jennifer
Picard, the store's personal shopping manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our list has been closed, and we probably will not have any
Furbies on the floor until after the holidays,'' Picard said.
</P>
<P>
   Zamparelli showed up at Kay-Bee Toys in Cambridge around 3 a.m.
and was first in line. He was soon joined by two guys who sat and
played video games on a laptop, and a suburban dad who had
rollerbladed in before public transport had started running.
</P>
<P>
   Zamparelli did come away with two dolls, but needs one more. He
scanned the other shoppers and offered a few of them $50 for one of
theirs, but no one was selling. He ran into a couple of teenagers
hawking the dolls for more than $100. He declined the offer because
it was too much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been up all night for this foolishness,'' said Zamparelli
later yesterday, after waking from a nap. ``This is an experience
that I do not choose to go through again.''
</P>
<P>
   But why do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``All my kids made clear this is the only toy they want,'' he
said. ``This becomes their whole world. You want to fulfill all
their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone out there has a reasonably priced Furby to sell,
Zamparelli is a father who needs one more.

ARMS AGENCY'S COMPUTERS LACKED TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The agency responsible for managing the nation's
stockpile of nuclear weapons told the Pentagon last summer that it
had no year 2000 bugs in three of its most important computer
systems, but auditors say those systems were never independently
tested.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the Defense Special Weapons Agency, defended its
actions by saying in a letter dated Sept. 30 that it was not
required to test the systems under Pentagon rules in force this
summer when it made the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon inspector general's office, in an audit released on
Oct. 30, reported that the agency had listed three computer systems
in the category of ``mission-critical'' as ready for the year 2000
even without independent testing. The auditors said that unless the
agency made further progress, it ``may be unable to execute its
mission without undue disruptions.'' The audit was first reported
Friday in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   A malfunction of the computer systems would cause problems,
Pentagon officials said, but the computers are not involved in
controlling nuclear-weapons use.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Special Weapons Agency, absorbed last month into the
Defense Threat Reduction Agency, manages nuclear-weapons stockpiles
and helps cope with nuclear-weapons accidents. The agency is also
charged with maintaining the scientific expertise to ensure that
advanced conventional systems, nuclear systems, and command and
control systems will continue to operate if nuclear war is
threatened or occurs, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Davis, the head of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, said
the Defense Department's initial plan for year 2000 issues ``did
not require testing'' and left the job to the people who ran the
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problem, known in shorthand as Y2K, involves
computer systems that store the date as a two-digit number and
might be unable to distinguish 2000 from 1900. Some of those
systems, some computer experts warn, might stop working, stop
communicating with other systems or deliver bad data when 1999
rolls over to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon set a deadline of this Dec. 31 to analyze, fix and
test its computer systems, and will conduct large-scale tests
involving multiple computer systems in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lieberman, assistant inspector general of the Department
of Defense, said in a telephone interview Friday that the Defense
Special Weapons Agency was ``by no means alone'' in failing to
bring in outsiders for an independent test, or to maintain adequate
records of testing.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors have ordered several agencies to retest equipment under
a revised policy that was issued as a draft last June but, with 13
months to go, is not yet adopted in final form.
</P>
<P>
   ``By waiting so long to really get into high gear, we have made
this a much higher-risk proposition than it would have been had we
really gotten serious two years earlier and approached this in a
much more systematic fashion,'' Lieberman said. ``Right now it's
difficult to say whether we have managed to make the problem
unmanageable or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot initially was left up to the discretion of whoever owned
and understood each system,'' Lieberman said. ``It was felt that,
given the sheer magnitude of systems, it was necessary to
decentralize the whole operation, to give people a lot of latitude
as to what they did. In retrospect, everybody agrees that that
approach was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The programs needed for targeting and launching nuclear weapons,
as well as other major operational systems, have been reviewed for
year 2000 compliance already, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said, ``I think that when push comes to shove, the
military operators are probably the most capable group in the
government for handling contingencies; they are used to doing
without systems for whatever reason.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said finishing testing in the spring ``gives plenty of
time for tests of the systems in full-up, integrated mode before
the year clocks out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the early certification, with which the auditors
had found fault, included his agency's acceptance of assurances
from software vendors about their products, rather than direct
tests. He added, ``The principal failure is in documentation and
planning, the particular details that the devil lies in.''

N.Y. CITY HALL, ONCE OPEN TO ALL, IS NOW BEHIND BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAN BARRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Hall, the ornate, off-white building that has
stood _ in symbol and in fact _ for open government in New York
City for almost two centuries, has been virtually off-limits to the
public for three months now, as part of an extraordinary security
strategy imposed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a security plan called Operation Bravo, concrete
barriers create what is called a ``protective zone'' around the old
building, and police cruisers block access to its parking area. As
part of a ``pedestrian freeze'' tactic, police officers are turning
away tourists and banning all protests and news conferences from
the steps of a building that has been the historic last recourse
for the city's wronged and outraged.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration justifies the need for the security
crackdown by citing the impending trial of three terrorism suspects
now in detention at a federal jail in lower Manhattan, not far from
City Hall. But that trial may not take place for months, or even
years, spurring criticism that the city's landmark of democracy
will probably remain closed to the general public indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Civic groups, City Council members and state legislators have
complained that although they understand the need for heightened
security, they do not see why City Hall must be held captive. And
this week, Judge Harold Baer Jr. of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan agreed with a nonprofit group's contention that security
measures at City Hall seem designed more to stifle protest than to
bolster security. As a result, he has ordered the city to allow the
group, an AIDS service organization called Housing Works, to hold a
news conference Tuesday on the steps of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Baer questioned how the city could deny access
to small groups because of safety concerns, and then allow
thousands to jam City Hall Plaza for last week's tribute to John
Glenn and other astronauts, and for last month's celebration of the
New York Yankees' World Series victory.
</P>
<P>
   The city has appealed the ruling; a hearing in the 2nd Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan is scheduled for Monday. Deputy
Police Commissioner Marilyn Mode declined to explain the reasoning
behind the Police Department's security plans for City Hall, other
than to say, ``Events of the day dictate necessary security
arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not so much the decision to increase security that
troubles people as it is the extreme measures that have been taken.
Many government buildings, including City Hall, have long had
security systems, including guards at the doors and metal detectors
in the lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   And after the United States fired missiles at two suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan in August in
retaliation for explosions at two U.S. embassies in East Africa,
the Police Department determined there was a need for more
security. At the city's initiative, for example, sand trucks and
concrete barriers were set up near the federal courthouse on Pearl
Street.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that even now, the general public has more
access to other public buildings than they do to City Hall. Baer
noted _ and a spokesman for the U.S. marshal's office confirmed _
that news conferences are still permitted in front of the
courthouse where the terrorism suspects are to be tried.
</P>
<P>
   But at City Hall, people must prove to police officers standing
guard at the barricades that they have business inside the
building; they are then often rerouted from the front steps to a
basement that has a metal detector. Even then, a person might not
get through, said Elizabeth Lubetkin Lipton, the president of the
Women's City Club, a civic group. ``We know there were City Council
hearings where people were not allowed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists and city residents can no longer wander into a building
whose doors were once always open to everyone from passers-by to
residents wanting to complain about garbage pickups or to corner
their Council members about some personal concern. The steps of
City Hall, where news conferences and protests of all kinds
traditionally take place _ just a few months ago, several rabbis
assembled there to invoke a biblical curse _ are now off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lost a lot of its sense of being a small-town center,''
said Kenneth Fisher, a Council member from Brooklyn. ``It used to
be that people would hang out on the steps because you never knew
who you'd see, and you could get a lot of business done that way.
But now the nature of the building has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen DiBrienza, another Council member from Brooklyn, agreed.
``There is not a day that goes by that when I leave City Hall,
there are not a couple of tourists or city residents wanting to
come in,'' he said. ``I can't tell you how many times I hear the
police explaining to people, `I'm sorry, it's closed.' And I don't
get it.''

 NEW YORK: get it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Giuliani said this week that the Police Department _ and few
others _ have the expertise to make decisions about security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has decided to try these terrorists in
New York,'' he said earlier this week, in explaining the measures.
``At the same time, it's a federal judge now who's trying to decide
what the security arrangements should be. And he wants the security
arrangements to be less than the security arrangements that he has
for federal buildings in Washington and other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union _ which argued the case for Housing Works _ cited
the testimony of Lewis Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in
New York. Although City Hall ``could be an attractive target,''
Schiliro said, the FBI had ``no specific information that City Hall
is a target at the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said the barricading of City Hall reflected the mayor's
view that ``he's the epicenter of the world, that terrorists are
plotting to bomb City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Information booths on either side of City Hall _ intended to
assist tourists who now have no access to them _ attest to the
historic value of the building, which was completed in 1812.
Inside, a double-curved stairway leads to the spot where the body
of Abraham Lincoln lay in state in 1865. Upstairs are Revolutionary
War-era artifacts; downstairs are the Yankees' World Series
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here since 1974,'' said City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone, ``and I still get a thrill walking into the building. It's
such a treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a decade ago, people could freely walk into the building
from three entrances. After the bombing of the World Trade Center
in 1993, security measures at City Hall were increased for a few
weeks, but not enough to disrupt the building's hurly-burly
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, at the Giuliani administration's
direction, the police started to enforce a little-known regulation
prohibiting the assembly of more than 25 people on the steps of
City Hall. Politicians and advocates alike know that a press corps
contingent works inside, and that the building's dramatic facade
can add credibility to their news conference musings.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Baer ruled in another case filed by Housing Works that
the policy was unconstitutional and selectively enforced. He also
urged the city to ``fashion a policy which meets constitutional
muster.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, the United States launched missiles at
suspected terrorist targets. The next day, Giuliani announced
Operation Bravo, and City Hall was soon surrounded by barricades.
</P>
<P>
   A glaring exception to the heightened security was evident last
month, when Giuliani held a World Series parade on Broadway for the
Yankees that ended with an extravagant City Hall reception attended
by as many as 6,000 invited guests. Seeing in the ceremony another
chance to challenge the administration's City Hall policy, Housing
Works notified the city early this month that it was planning a
parade up Broadway on Dec. 1 to commemorate World AIDS Day. The
group said it also planned a news conference on the steps of City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 6, the city told Housing Works that access to City Hall
would be denied. Then, court documents say, city officials met on
the following Monday to put into writing the security guidelines
that the police had been enforcing at City Hall for nearly three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Those guidelines say that the police commissioner may authorize
the use of City Hall Plaza for occasions that are ``of
extraordinary public interest,'' ``uniquely appropriate to City
Hall,'' or ``unique, nonannual events of major civic and citywide
importance.'' Such events, they say, would include celebrations of
military triumphs, local world championship teams and space
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Baer said in his decision that he was bothered by the city's
last-minute scurrying to put in writing a policy that he had
suggested it formalize months earlier. He also questioned the
subjectivity of the guidelines, including the phrase
``extraordinary public interest,'' which he wrote was ``a
determination apparently made by the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said the judge's
ruling was ``a political statement rather than a judicial
decision,'' and he pointed out that the city had invited Housing
Works to hold its event a few hundred feet to the south, in City
Hall Park. ``The First Amendment certainly doesn't say that it's an
all-or-nothing situation,'' he said. ``That you either have no
events whatsoever on City Hall's steps or you have to permit all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Siegel said he saw the ruling as a crowbar to be used by
other groups to pry open the doors of one of the city's most famous
public buildings. ``City Hall is the quintessential public place,''
he said. ``It should reflect the spontaneity, the diversity, the
zaniness of New York City. Now it's as if it's a mausoleum.''

   BUS-CRASH (Seattle) A city bus with 32 people aboard plummeted
off Seattle's Aurora Bridge Friday afternoon after its driver was

The driver was thrown from the bus and killed, and a second man,

BRUINS FALL TO MARYLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYAMON, Puerto Rico _ UCLA unveiled its black uniforms Friday
in the semifinals of the Puerto Rico Shootout. Approved by the
administration and sure to enrage traditionalists, the sleek
threads will be used only on the road _ to symbolize a new era of
Bruins basketball and help recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll definitely help,'' guard Rico Hines said. ``It's the
'90s now, and guys like style and flair. They'll see it. They think
if you look good, you'll play good.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Bruins proved Friday, looks and performance aren't
necessarily related.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of welcoming a new era, the black uniforms set an
appropriately somber mood as UCLA wilted in the second half of a
70-54 loss to No. 5 Maryland at the Guerra Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had more turnovers (24) than baskets (20), and they
shot 33.3 percent in their lowest-scoring game since the 1996 NCAA
Tournament loss to Princeton. Their starting frontline grabbed
seven rebounds, and their starting backcourt committed nine
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   As consolation _ or, perhaps, punishment _ UCLA will face No. 4
Kentucky in the third-place game this afternoon. The Wildcats shot
9 percent from 3-point range and lost to Pittsburgh in Friday's
first semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be down about this game, because it's Kentucky
(today),'' Bruins forward Travis Reed said. ``If we're down, we'll
get beat by 50.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the Bruins (2-1) survived sloppiness and inconsistency
against Santa Clara and San Francisco, they could not escape
against a team as experienced and talented as Maryland. The Terps
took an early lead, coasted for much of the first half, then blew
UCLA away with an 11-2 second-half surge and built a 23-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a young team ... and when you're young, you make a lot
of mistakes,'' Maryland guard Steve Francis said. ``I think we came
at them too many different ways, both offensively and defensively.
That really took a toll on them in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trimmed the final margin to 16 with several
last-minute baskets. Insignificant now, those points may loom large
in three months. When the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee
convenes, a 16-point loss to a highly ranked team will look much
better on UCLA's resume than a 25- or 30-point defeat _ especially
if the Bruins are grasping for an at-large berth.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA has plenty of temporal problems to solve before their
postseason gains focus. The most immediate is point guard Earl
Watson, who responded to Maryland's pressure defense with seven
turnovers _ giving him 17 in two games here.
</P>
<P>
   Without Baron Davis by his side, Watson is forcing passes,
dribbling into traffic and trying to create plays where they don't
exist. Every step is a struggle, every decision comes with doubt.
He seems most comfortable under the basket, rebounding and banging
with players twice his size. Friday, Watson had as many offensive
rebounds (four) as assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels, with Baron out, probably an extra burden of
responsibility, an extra weight on his shoulders,'' Bruins coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson did not struggle alone. Freshman forward JaRon Rush
was 2 of 11 from the field and is shooting 19 percent in the
Shootout. His shot selection has been better suited for H-O-R-S-E
than five-on-five competition, and he was removed several times
after hurried attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who played well against San Francisco found the
Terps' terrain treacherous. Freshmen forward Matt Barnes made one
basket, sophomore guard Ryan Bailey made two and senior guard
Brandon Loyd didn't even play.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin was most upset with the frontcourt. Freshman center Dan
Gadzuric was impressive in the first half (six points, five
rebounds) and invisible in the second (no points, no rebounds).
Freshman Jerome Moiso, the other half of the European connection,
was softer than Charmin, with four points and three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, UCLA's frontcourt had nine points and four rebounds in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about playing in a tournament like this is
you're going to get exposed,'' Lavin said. ``A young team has to
learn where its deficiencies are, and that's in the paint
offensively and in the paint defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   And that won't change with the color of their uniforms.

   LOS ANGELES _ It is fairly early, but the next eight days should
reveal much about where the Los Angeles Kings will be headed over
the final four-plus months of the NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   After a week off following a victory that ended a six-game
losing streak, the Kings are expected to regain the services of
three key players who have been sidelined for extended periods with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   And they will need them, because starting tonight (with a home
game against the red-hot Phoenix Coyotes) and ending next Saturday
(with a home game against the defending Stanley Cup champion
Detroit Red Wings) the Kings face a stretch of five games in eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably too early to call this stretch crucial. But with a
6-12-3 record that has them mired near the bottom of the Western
Conference, it is safe to say the Kings need to post a respectable
record during a stretch that also includes games in Montreal,
Toronto and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Kings is that they finally appear to be
regaining their health.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr is expected to make his second consecutive start in
net, with Stephane Fiset listed as the backup, meaning the Kings
will have their goaltending tandem together for the first time
since Oct. 18, when both suffered groin injuries in the fourth game
of the season, a 5-5 tie with the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to return are No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel (sprained
right ankle), who has been in and out of the lineup with injuries,
and steady defenseman Doug Bodger, who has missed the past 10 games
with a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will have to wait awhile to regain their best player,
captain Rob Blake, who has a broken foot. But if Stumpel's health
hex is finally over, the Kings finally will have the added
offensive dimension they have lacked most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings couldn't have picked a better time to get healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the next eight days, they will fly coast to coast, then
play a game the next day. Such scheduling usually is a prescription
for sluggishness, a symptom that can be alleviated with the
presence of more healthy bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But it should not be assumed that all the Kings' problems are
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   They have won just twice this month, and when they have lost,
it's been for every conceivable reason.
</P>
<P>
   They've struggled to score when they've played well defensively.
When the offense has been productive, the defense often has been a
casualty.
</P>
<P>
   The power play mostly has been miserable _ Stumpel may help with
this _ and the Kings have been nowhere near as effective at
protecting leads this season as they were last year. In 1997-98,
the Kings had a 28-0-5 record when they led after two periods. This
year, they already have lost twice when leading after the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, though, this Kings team looks like an improvement over
last year's. When he is healthy, Bodger brings experience and
intensity to the defensive corps, and though Steve Duchesne has
struggled early, it is much too soon to consider his summer signing
a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the development of 19-year-old rookie Olli Jokinen,
the strong start by Luc Robitaille and the strong carryover from
last year by Glen Murray mean that if Stumpel can ever remain
healthy, the Kings will be much deeper up front than they have been
in recent years. Were they to add a marquee forward, the attack
would have the potential to be formidable depending on the cost of
such an addition.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Kings, none of this adds up to a guarantee
of anything. They have yet to display anything even resembling
consistency this season and they can't blame injuries for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Kings, much of the NHL is equally mediocre.
No team is going to be eliminated from playoff contention because
of a five-game stretch less than two months into the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as the Kings resume the season, the next eight days
appear to represent a crossroads. This is the time for the Kings to
take a forward step, or it may be a time when they continue to
struggle, setting a tone for the rest of the season.

TRULY A SEASON OF PLENTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truly a season of plenty  &LR; txr:This could have been a lean
holiday. For the squirrel and me, however, the season of plenty
arrived just in time.
</P>
<P>
   The enterprising squirrel discovered Halloween pumpkins left on
the front steps as a bit of seasonal color. So far he's eaten the
smallest of the four, and also a middle-sized one.
</P>
<P>
   I see he's begun on the big one next. His capacity is amazing.
At almost every hour of the day he is out there, chipping away at
the rind first, then, having gotten entry, eating his way inside.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that, before hard weather sets in, we will have a
20- or 25-pound squirrel on our hands. It will not be pretty
watching a creature like that trying to lever himself up a tree.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, poor pilgrim that I am, have received a Thanksgiving
blessing. It was not given me by a Native American, who, in a
simpler and less polemical time, might simply have been called an
Indian. In fact, it wasn't given by anyone at all.
</P>
<P>
   The rains brought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise be!'' I cried up from the basement. ``We'll have a
feast after all!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?'' my wife called down, her voice musical with
hope. ``You've found some wildlife?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I said. ``Mushrooms. They're growing out of the basement
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the floor's cement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. They're growing up through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' she groaned. ``Now we'll /{never/} be able to sell
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, /{sell/} it? We're in clover! Ours is a door
at which the wolf will not be seen again.''
</P>
<P>
   I hurried upstairs to display the harvest. Some were little
cuplike mushrooms in clusters. Others, which appeared to be in a
later stage, were more complicated _ many-petaled, like the blossom
of a rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not you realize it,'' I told my wife, ``we could be
sitting atop a gold mine of fungus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that's an oxymoron,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be, but I'll need to take it somewhere for
identification.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an hour of telephoning just to locate an expert, and
another hour to get to his place, which was way out past the city's
edge.
</P>
<P>
   He put my samples on the table, got books down off his shelf and
began turning pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife thinks it's an oxymoron,'' I told him. ``But that's
just a wild guess.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned some more pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one that's close,'' he said, and showed me the book.
</P>
<P>
   The type under the picture read /{Geopyxis carbonaria,/} or
Pixie Cup, and said it was most often found on burned ground or
charred wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know....I found it in the basement, growing out of
cement,'' I told the expert. ``And the house hasn't burned. Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this may not be exactly it,'' he said. ``But it's close
_ in the same family, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it say about edibility?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't say it's poisonous. Just that it's not of much
interest for the table.''
</P>
<P>
   All this occupied most of a morning, and I drove back home
half-sick with disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``False alarm,'' I told my wife. ``Our fortune is not in the
basement after all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are we having for our holiday dinner?'' she wanted to
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The squirrel, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! Not /{our/} squirrel!
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I hate it,'' I told her. ``But he's a plump little devil.
And the way I read my Thanksgiving history, somebody always has to
wind up the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a non sequitur,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I told her. ``It's a tree-climbing rat.''

UNITAS SOUNDS LIKE A SNOWBIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm still not sure whether the Internet is going to make me a
better sports fan.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I can check scores all night long and watch videos the
size of matchbook covers of the latest Deion Sanders punt return,
but when there is a game on, I'd just as soon watch it on
television, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   But I do know this: If not for the Internet, I never would have
found out how cranky an old guy Johnny Unitas has become.
</P>
<P>
   Unitas hosted an Internet ``chat'' earlier this week to promote
ESPN2's broadcast of the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award. I was
eager to take part. He's always mentioned among the greatest
quarterbacks ever, and while I can picture the buzz cut, the black
high-top cleats and the famous No. 19, Unitas was a little before
my time. All I remember are the highlight films.
</P>
<P>
   And Unitas has remained a bit of a mystery. When he left the
game, he really left _ he didn't get into coaching or broadcasting
or anything like that. So I thought this would be a good
opportunity to learn a little more about one of the true legends of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Man, did I learn. I didn't expect this to be like a chat with
Dennis Rodman. (``Mr. Rodman: Have you married and/or divorced
anyone today?'' ``Yes, twice, thank you. Now if you will excuse me
I have to pluck my eyebrows.'')
</P>
<P>
   But this was still a surprise. Unless I miss my guess, Unitas is
definitely not the kind of guy you want to cut in front of in line
at one of those all-you-can-eat smorgasbords.
</P>
<P>
   They called it a chat, but like all of these, it was really a
question-and-answer session _ we submitted the questions, and
Unitas then answered selected ones.
</P>
<P>
   (My record, by the by, remains intact; I have never had a single
question I've asked in an Internet chat answered. I started out
with something simple, asking him who he thought the best
quarterbacks today were. When it was clear that wouldn't get me
anywhere, I asked if he ever thought about letting his hair grow
out while he was playing. A Beatle wig, perhaps? Maybe some low-cut
cleats? Again, no answer. Sigh.)
</P>
<P>
   It started out normally enough. Oh sure, Unitas made a little
noise about how not as many players today ``possess the same ideals
we did in years past'' (I couldn't help but think of the wild
stories Art Donovan used to tell on Letterman), and he clearly
thought all the big money today was a distraction. He was also
adamant about letting quarterbacks call their own plays, as he did.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked about franchises moving, things got a
little . . . strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there isn't a lot of loyalty left in this country, not
only in sports but elsewhere,'' he said. ``Everyone is looking for
the almighty dollar, including the owners.'' Hmm. Sounds vaguely
familiar. Did he testify in the impeachment hearing?
</P>
<P>
   When Unitas talked about how players in his day had to play
hurt, how he once missed only a game and a half because of broken
ribs and punctured lungs, a picture started to form in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, with a hangnail, they take a few days off,'' he
said. ``They're more concerned about the longevity of their career
than the immediate results.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the picture came into focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (training methods) are as stringent as they were
in my day,'' he said. ``We have too much liberalism going around in
this country _ in sports and everything else. We need to get back
to good old-fashioned discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I saw him clearly _ his buzz cut turned snow white,
wearing those enormous sunglasses that wrap around your entire
head, driving an RV with a bumper sticker that reads ``I'm spending
my children's inheritance,'' and traveling 15 mph in the passing
lane of the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Unitas is a snowbird!
</P>
<P>
   Forget Canton, Ohio. This legend belongs in Sun City. &QL;

TICKET SALES OFF AT BOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks hoped for a season ticket renewal rate of about
80 percent for the 1999 season at Bank One Ballpark, but it appears
the figure will be closer to 70 percent or perhaps even less.
</P>
<P>
   The number dropped from 36,000 to the current 26,000. A triple
play of reasons was listed in a poll of those who did not renew,
team President Rich Dozer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 reason was that there are too many games,'' Dozer
said of the 81-game home schedule. ``Two, quite a few people said
they are combining into other (season ticket) groups. And there
have been some who have backed out because of the price increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The team raised ticket prices by an average of about 12 percent.
Managing general partner Jerry Colangelo said he did not want to
increase the prices but that it was necessary to help ease the
team's debt. He later said that there will be no price increase for
the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dozer, 90 percent of the higher-priced seats in the
lower bowl have been renewed. The renewal drop-off is primarily in
the upper deck. He said the team has agreed to be more flexible on
the season ticket payment plan.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 new applications have come in, Dozer said. If the
team, which was No. 1 in the majors in season ticket sales, can get
close to 30,000, it still could be as high as third or second, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions of free-agent pitchers Todd Stottlemyre,
Armando Reynoso and Greg Swindell and first baseman Greg Colbrunn
could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows we are making a significant attempt to improve our
club,'' Dozer said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   M.L. Barnhart is retiring on a happy note after 30
not-always-happy years at the Lee's Summit, Mo., plant now operated
by Lucent Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On this Thanksgiving Day, the cable department employee gives
thanks for Julie Ann Howell and Eileen Carter, two women in key
positions who, Barnhart says, create an atmosphere of enthusiasm
and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Mitchell is ruefully leaving her position at St. Luke
Hospital's Mid-America Heart Institute because her husband has been
transferred to New York.
</P>
<P>
   On this Thanksgiving Day, the nurse anesthetist gives thanks for
James H. Lonergan, a physician who, Mitchell says, infuses the
high-stress operating room with compassion and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   Gene King is contented in his job at Propane Resources in
Mission, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   On this Thanksgiving Day, the marketing communications worker
gives thanks for Dwain Willingham, a consultant to the retail
propane industry who has built a 25-person office where, King says,
mutual respect and good communication prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who hate their jobs won't understand. People who are
shoehorned into bad employment fits or who work in dysfunctional
environments with disagreeable co-workers won't get it, either. But
here's the truth:
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of us out here who love our work. Some of us are
darn near giddy with gratitude that our interests, our skills and
our opportunities have converged in a way that allows us to make
money to boot.
</P>
<P>
   For Barnhart, Mitchell, King and many others, a common
denominator shores up that workplace appreciation: It's the
privilege of sharing space and time with others _ especially bosses
_ who treat workers as thinking, caring partners.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart credits Howell, who is president of Local 6395 of the
Communications Workers of America, and Carter, who is manager of
the Lucent plant, with eliminating an atmosphere he found punitive
and degrading.
</P>
<P>
   When the two women gained positions of authority this year,
Barnhart said, ``They brought with them an unusual amount of
respect for people they work with. They are compassionate, and they
recognize people for their achievements and their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell says Lonergan, a staff anesthesiologist, is an island
of calm in the intense open-heart surgery operating room, where he
treats BEGIN ITAL all END ITAL co-workers and BEGIN ITAL all END
ITAL patients as individuals with thoughts and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked through disagreements, unbelievable work
situations and heartaching cases,'' Mitchell said. ``Having a
colleague like Jim say, `Thanks. Good job,' after a long day or
all-night heart transplant is worth millions.''
</P>
<P>
   King appreciates Willingham's ability to craft a collegial
workplace where neither titles nor office walls drop workers into
specific holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no formal rules governing dress, vacations or sick time,
each employee is treated as a responsible adult,'' King said. ``And
when one gets out of line, just like in any large family, someone
is there to help them get back on the straight and narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Three workplace stories. Three rounds of thanks. Three examples
of individuals' power to turn ``us vs. them'' into a thankful
``we.''

JONATHAN KWITNY, 57, AUTHOR AND PRIZE-WINNING REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind., Mo., N.J.)  (bl) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jonathan Kwitny, a journalist and author whose
subjects varied from Mafia forays into board rooms to papal
biography, died Nov. 26 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
He was 57 and lived in Cuddebackville, N.Y., and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was stomach cancer diagnosed in July, said a friend,
Anthony Scaduto, a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Kwitny's latest book was ``Man of the Century: The Life and
Times of Pope John Paul II'' (Holt, 1997). In it, Kwitny melded
journalism and history to chronicle not merely a life but also the
world events that surrounded the pope's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Kwitny and a producer, Tom Naughton, created ``The
Kwitny Report'' for the Public Broadcasting System. Backed by a
team of staff and free-lance reporters, Kwitny wrote and narrated
the weekly national half-hour news program, which won a George Polk
Award for investigative reporting in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Another of his books, ``Endless Enemies: The Making of an
Unfriendly World'' (Congdon &AMP; Weed, 1984) was a critique of U.S.
foreign policy. It got considerable critical attention and was a
runner-up for the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kwitny was born in Indianapolis, graduated from the
University of Missouri in 1962 with a journalism degree and
received a master's degree at New York University in 1964. He
started a newspaper career working as a reporter for The Evening
News of Perth Amboy, N.J., from 1963 to 1969, with two years out as
a Peace Corps volunteer in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he joined The Wall Street Journal as staff writer
producing front-page columns and articles about national and
international topics. He stayed with The Journal until his move to
PBS in 1988. Most recently, he worked for the Gannett newspaper
group guiding Trenton coverage for its New Jersey papers. He also
served as a consultant on Pope John Paul for ``NBC Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of his eight books was ``The Fountain Pen Conspiracy''
(Knopf, 1973), which told how investment swindlers work. His other
titles included ``Vicious Circles: The Mafia in the Marketplace''
(Norton, 1979), and ``The Crimes of Patriots: A True Tale of Dope,
Dirty Money and the CIA.'' (Norton, 1987).
</P>
<P>
   Kwitny is survived by his wife of five years, Wendy Wood Kwitny;
two sons, James W., 22 months, and Peter B., 5 months old; two
daughters by a previous marriage, Susanna Lynn Kwitny of Norwalk,
Conn., and Carolyn Romasz of Saratoga, N.Y.; his mother, Julia
Goldberger Kwitny of Indianapolis, and one grandson. His first
wife, Martha Kaplan Kwitny, died in 1978.

JOHNSON: DECISION BY MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There still was no puff of white smoke from Randy Johnson's camp
Friday as the Diamondbacks continued to await the prize free
agent's decision on whether he will pitch for them or another team
for the next four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Will Arizona's patience be rewarded?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still optimistic about our chances because we feel we
have a lot to offer,'' Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry
Colangelo said. ``But in the end, it comes down to the fact that
it's Randy's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo spoke to Alan Nero, one of Johnson's two agents, on
Thursday and followed it up with a Friday conversation with Barry
Meister, the other representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's a little difficult to figure what will
turn Randy one way or the other,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   As to when an answer will be given, Meister said Friday,
``probably on or before Monday. Randy still wants to sift through
all of the information he has been given.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, all the information likely has been digested several
times over. The four offers _ from the Diamondbacks, Anaheim
Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and Texas Rangers _ are all in the same
range, for four years at about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   What it comes down to for Johnson is which team has the best
chance to reach the playoffs and World Series in 1999 and/or
improve to the point to make a challenge in the three years after.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the Diamondbacks' recent additions _
pitchers Todd Stottlemyre, Armando Reynoso, Greg Swindell and first
baseman Greg Colbrunn. The team also has third baseman Matt
Williams and infielder Jay Bell, who are being counted on to
rebound from slow seasons, and one of the best young all-around
players in first baseman Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it comes down to pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Randy, it's possible that we could have the second-best
staff in baseball,'' Colangelo said. ``And even without him, we've
made a dramatic improvement.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Finley update &QL;  &QL; 
Center fielder Steve Finley, who visited Arizona officials on
Monday at Bank One Ballpark, insists he is not using the
Diamondbacks and six other teams to gain more bargaining power with
his most recent team, the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seriously considering other offers,'' Finley said. &QL;

COYOTES' PHILOSOPHY: 1 GAME AT A TIME  
 TEAM FACES GRUELING ROAD STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One reason the Coyotes believe they are off to such a smoking
start this NHL season is because they haven't looked too far ahead.
It's that old ``one-game-a-time'' mumbo jumbo you hear in sports.
</P>
<P>
   It's trite, but so far it's working to the tune of a 13-2-2
record and franchise-record-tying 13-game unbeaten streak, the
longest in the league in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, can they keep that same attitude in light of
their upcoming schedule _ a grueling four-week span in which they
play 11 of their next 13 games away from home, starting tonight at
the Great Western Forum against the Los Angeles Kings?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I haven't even looked at the schedule really
beyond the next couple games,'' said forward Rick Tocchet, who had
a goal and two assists during the Coyotes' 3-2 victory Thursday,
which extended their winning streak to seven, two shy of the club
record. ``I'll bet most of the guys don't even know who we're
playing in the third game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious. We look at our next game, we prepare, and when
it's over, you look at the next game and do the same thing. It's
kind of nice to think that way sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   So obviously, the boys weren't exactly in a chipper mood when
they were continuously asked Friday about hitting the road and to
look ahead at a list of all the teams they will be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do we play next?'' defenseman Gerald Diduck asked
sarcastically. ``That's all I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, here's how the schedule shapes up after
tonight's game in Los Angeles, which starts at 8:30. The Coyotes
are at Edmonton on Wednesday, at Calgary on Saturday, and then play
the next night in Vancouver. After returning home for one game
against Montreal, they head back to Canada for games against
Ottawa, the Canadiens and Toronto before wrapping things up in St.
Louis. Then it's back for a home game against the New York
Islanders before leaving again, this time for three games at
Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Although it sounds, looks and probably is a difficult stretch,
trips like these can actually be a blessing. There can be less
pressure on the road, less need for the players to feel they have
to ``put on a show'' to impress the fans, which they say sometimes
is the case on home ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you're home, you have a tendency to get too cute,
to play for your fans and try to make it exciting,'' center Jeremy
Roenick said. ``When you're on the road, you just stick to the
basics and you really don't care what the people who are watching
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Bob Corkum couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough when you go on the road, but at the same
time, there are aspects about it that are a lot easier,'' he said.
``I find when you're on the road, all you have to worry about is
the game. You can concentrate 100 percent on the game. When you're
at home, when you're married with children, you have other
responsibilities, which at times is great, too, because it can take
your mind off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the road, I find it much more easier to get prepared,
mentally, for each and every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point, it hasn't mattered ``where'' the Coyotes have
played. They have the NHL's best winning percentage at home (8-1-1,
.850) and the best winning percentage on the road (5-1-1, .786).
</P>
<P>
   Part of that, of course, is because they also have the league's
top-two ranked goalies in Nikolai Khabibulin and Jimmy Waite, who
have a combined 1.51 goals-against average after 17 games. Another
reason is they have the NHL's stingiest defense, which hasn't
allowed two or more goals in a record 16 straight games. And don't
forget, they also have the league's top-rated, penalty-killing
unit, which has allowed a league-low seven power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty critical point for us, though, with this many
road games coming up,'' said Khabibulin, who will look to improve
on his 8-2-1 record tonight after Waite got the start Thursday.
``It's a month or so of a lot of games, and hopefully, we can
continue to do the same job and keep winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teams, no doubt, are probably waiting for them to slide.
But Phoenix keeps proving its fast start is no fluke. The team has
defeated Detroit, Dallas and New Jersey. And it is 2-0-1 against
Colorado, a club that never had lost to the Coyotes since the
franchises were known as the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the ``one-game-at-a-time'' Coyotes to start
doing any swaggering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put our equipment on, we've got confidence,'' Tocchet
said. ``Swagger? Nah. I think you look at swagger when you're a
team like the Detroit Red Wings, when you win in the playoffs and
bring home the Stanley Cup. They're the only team that should have
a swagger in their walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean we can't walk with confidence.'' &QL;

2 CATS OUT OF OLSON'S DOG HOUSE  
 JEFFERSON, DOUGLAS EXPECTED TO START VS. BYU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Freshmen Richard Jefferson and Ruben Douglas, who were
disciplined for missing classes, are back in Coach Lute Olson's
good graces and are expected to return to the starting lineup
tonight when the 12th-ranked Wildcats visit an old rival, Brigham
Young.
</P>
<P>
   It is Arizona's first visit to the Marriott Center since 1978,
when a freshman guard named Danny Ainge scored 29 points for the
Cougars in a one-point loss to the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the focus is on the two Arizona freshmen, Jefferson
and Douglas, who did not play in an exhibition game against
Marathon Oil for violating a team rule _ not attending class. They
played against Texas Wednesday night but did not start.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are (back), and as long as they do their job, it'll be
fine,'' said Olson, who plans to get quality minutes for all of his
players tonight against a struggling 1-2 BYU club. ``They paid
their penalty and hopefully they learned their lesson. They handled
their penalty well, and that helped getting back in good graces.
They realized no one was picking on them. They just need to do what
needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be attending classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned it, now it's time to go out and reconcile for what I
did,'' Douglas told reporters this week. ``It's a learning process,
and I had to learn the hard way, so I'm not going to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, a prep all-American while at Moon Valley High, agreed
after watching his teammates in the exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult watching them,'' Jefferson said. ``I felt
like I let them down, but it was something that I had to deal with.
I'm kind of glad I learned my lesson early rather than later in the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've fallen. Now, I have to go out and prove myself again. I
have to be a positive force on the team and just continue to work
hard. It's just a matter of time when I'll be where I was before.''
</P>
<P>
   With the two freshmen back in the rotation, Olson said he hopes
to turn on the defensive heat tonight against the Cougars. Arizona
forced 21 turnovers while beating Texas, but Olson wasn't
especially pleased with his team's work in the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get a few easy ones off the break,'' Olson said. ``But
our wing guys still don't get the idea that when we get the
rebound, we've got to sprint the lanes _ right now, instead of
hanging around a little bit. That does nothing but make it more
difficult for us to find our point guard and get the break going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to keep our intensity at a high level defensively.
We'll go man-to-man. The biggest thing is getting our defense to
create some offensive opportunities for us. We did that against
Texas. I'm looking for intensity.'' &QL;

SAFETY PROVES TO BE A CUT ABOVE  
 LASSITER WINS FREE-SAFETY JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals safety Kwamie Lassiter can't remember how far down on
the depth chart he was at training camp three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He just knows he thought he would be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was the fifth safety,'' he said. ``I might have been
the sixth. I didn't like my situation. But I didn't give up,
because I know I can play this game. I ain't going to let
somebody's opinion take my confidence away.''
</P>
<P>
   He also didn't complain. He made the team as a backup free
safety, a nickel defensive back and a special-teams standout.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter thought he had become a starter when safety Brent
Alexander went to Carolina of the NFL as a free agent last spring.
</P>
<P>
   He opened training camp last July as a starter. But the week of
the regular-season opener, rookie Pat Tillman was moved ahead of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down for about a week,'' Lassiter said. ``The only
reason I was down was because I had worked hard to get the job. I
was told it was nothing I did or didn't do. They just wanted to use
Pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with Pat. We're cool. In fact, I like
Pat because he speaks his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman held the job until last Tuesday. Lassiter was promoted
ahead of him for Sunday's game at Kansas City after the Washington
Redskins scored touchdowns on six consecutive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter's interception with 62 seconds left enabled the
Cardinals to hold on for a 45-42 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not necessarily that Pat played poorly,'' secondary
coach Larry Marmie said. ``We just felt Kwamie had earned a shot.
We felt (Tillman) deserved to move up (in the preseason). But just
because you move up doesn't mean you have the job forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter, a fourth-year pro, has had to overcome a lot of odds
over his career. He wasn't drafted. Former Coach Buddy Ryan signed
him out of Kansas in 1995, and he was a long shot to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was fired a year later, and Coach Vince Tobin's staff knew
little about Lassiter. In fact, one reason he was buried so deep in
the depth chart in 1996 was that the coaches weren't sure if he was
a cornerback or a safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they had to do was put me at one or the other, and I'd
make plays,'' said Lassiter, who will be making his second career
start.
</P>
<P>
   He's serious and has backed it up this season.
</P>
<P>
   Although playing primarily as a nickel back, Lassiter has four
interceptions, the most in the secondary. He also has forced three
fumbles and recovered another on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kwamie has a great attitude, and it's reflected in his play,''
strong safety Tommy Bennett said. ``He's always around the ball. He
always happens to be there when the ball is tipped or overthrown.
Some players are blessed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter said he gets as much a kick out of getting a turnover
on special teams as he does in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's how I can help the team out, I want to be the best
at it,'' he said. ``It's a great feeling, and every time I've done
it, I've been double-teamed. Even though I'm starting at free
safety, I'd like to also stay on special teams. But it's hard to do
punt coverage and then go right back out on the field and be in the
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter said he always has made big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say that's being cocky,'' he said. ``I don't boast
or brag. I just know what I can do. Talk to guys around the league.
There's a guy on the Giants who told me he's scared to go across
the middle against me because I knock people out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've made it just because I'm starting. I think
I still have to prove myself every day. What I did yesterday,
people don't remember. People say, `He can play, but what's he
doing for me now?' '' &QL;

SPORTS + SEX  
BIG-TIME SALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Anyone who has seen the price of a 30-second
commercial on the annual Super Bowl broadcast knows that sports
sells.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be much of a stretch, in fact, to say nothing
outsells sports, except maybe for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a concept. Sports and sex. Talk about a valuable
combination.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so this is hardly a new idea. From Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders to swimsuit issues, sports franchises, the media and
Madison Avenue have all been well aware of their combined economic
value.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the joining of sports and sex has been a little more
frequent and a little more obvious, though, and that has prompted
an outcry.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-profile case involves Katarina Witt disrobing for
``Playboy''. As a figure skater, Witt is used to donning skimpy
attire in public, but her nude photo shoot was outside the athletic
arena and, some would say, beyond the bounds of good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Witt offered that it was no big deal and explained that she's
comfortable with her body and self-image. People, she suggested,
should get over it.
</P>
<P>
   A second incident involved Jeanie Buss, daughter of Los Angeles
Lakers' owner Jerry Buss and possible heiress to the family's
Southern California sports empire. She was the subject of a feature
in a recent ``Sports Illustrated''.
</P>
<P>
   ``SI'' might have launched the mother of all sports/sex media
packages with its annual swimsuit issue, but it's still no
``Playboy''. So, it was probably with surprise that readers opened
the article to find a gatefold photo of Ms. Buss on her back.
</P>
<P>
   She is naked but for two strategically-place basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   This followed the demand by international volleyball authorities
that women volleyball players at the world championships in Japan
wear one-piece swimsuit-style uniforms or an alternative, but
equally revealing ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the uniform changes, it was said, was to increase
interest in the game. And probably to attract more media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports
Foundation, is one who spoke out against these presentations. In a
piece for Street &AMP; Smith's ``Sports Business Journal'', Lopiano
chastised the media.
</P>
<P>
   Sports media coverage, she said, ``should reflect the
fundamental equality of women and men, both on and off the field.
The media should simply reflect the reality of women's diverse
sports experiences _ from grace and beauty to physical strength,
endurance and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Lopiano said, the media ``are obligated'' to report on
the efforts of women athletes to break down barriers to their entry
to sport. Instead, she added, they ``perpetuate sexism.''
</P>
<P>
   Several women's volleyball teams refused to wear the skin-tight
uniforms and were fined for their defiance. But Buss and Witt
hardly were reluctant photo subjects. Buss had actually once posed
for ``Playboy'', so her shoot was nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopiano calls it not ``appropriate to blame the victim _ the
female athlete or executive _ who is placed in a position of having
to prove herself a sex object in order to be taken seriously as an
athlete or businesswoman.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she asks, ``When have we seen major sports periodicals
depict Michael Jordan or David Stern naked or in undershorts when
covering the sports business? Why aren't male athletes stuffed into
tight-fitting uniforms that display their genitalia as a way to get
more women to watch?'' RANDY TV DANDY If you're trying to make
economic sense of the Rangers' contract offer this week to Randy
Johnson, understand that the lanky lefty offers something to a team
beyond a possible 20 wins a season.
</P>
<P>
   There are his TV numbers, for one. In Houston, cable ratings on
Fox Sports Southwest for Astros games more than doubled after
Johnson was acquired from Seattle. Also, of the three most-watched
games in Astros cable TV history, two featured Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Higher ratings mean more TV advertising dollars. That's
something Rangers owner Tom Hicks, with an eye to his regional
sports network, no doubt factored in to his offer. Added to
increased ticket sales, it all spells incremental revenue. And that
makes economic sense.

FURBY FERVOR GETS UGLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Corrects day of week throughout to Friday)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Parents, grandparents, and other holiday shoppers
launched the War of the Furbies Friday _ around 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people were lined up outside the Wal-Mart in Lynn,
Mass., wrapped in blankets or sleeping bags to shield them from the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   They had expected to be able to start buying Furbies at
midnight, but then were told by employees that they would have to
wait until 6 to snag the season's hottest new toy: a $30 talking,
sneezing, burping, dancing creature a bit larger than a softball.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, as the anxious shoppers were being let in five at a
time to buy the furry toy, no one told the others waiting outside
that there were only 30 of the colorful electronic dolls on the
shelves to begin with. Two Lynn police officers the store had hired
for the overnight detail were quickly joined by four more officers
as customer fury grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were yelling at us, wanting to know why they waited in
line if there were only 30 dolls,'' Wal-Mart co-manager Steven
Gamache said. ``But if we had announced that earlier, it would have
gotten ugly outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Zamparelli, the Cambridge father of a 7-year-old and twin
5-year-olds, said he was outside the Wal-Mart at around 11:30 p.m.
on Thanksgiving, waiting with up to 1,000 others for the store's
advertised midnight Furby sale. He knew he'd be allowed to purchase
only one, he said, so he planned to be at Kay-Bee Toys in Cambridge
by 5 a.m. to buy two more.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 a.m., though, a disgusted Zamparelli left Wal-Mart
empty-handed, and the crowd started dwindling as managers were
still explaining to hundreds of furious customers why the store had
decided to postpone the midnight sale until 6 a.m. Zamparelli said
one customer had even called the Salem Wal-Mart, and told the
parents waiting in the Lynn store's parking lot not to bother going
over there: They were sold out already.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn police said they had no reports of arrests or any other
incidents at the store.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers and clerks around Greater Boston, opening up to
four hours earlier than usual to handle the year's busiest shopping
day, had stories to tell Friday about how the toy in short supply
flew off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Higgins, &UR;  &LR; a clerk at the Kay-Bee in Cambridge, arrived
Friday at 5:15 a.m. and handed out pairs of tickets to about 200
people in line, limiting them to two dolls each. The store opened
at 7 a.m. and more than 200 dolls were gone within the hour,
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were upset. Those who didn't get tickets would come up
and say they lost theirs,'' Higgins said. A second shipment of 60
Furbies at 11 a.m. was gone within 30 minutes, she said. Clerks
like Higgins said they did not know when other shipments were due.
</P>
<P>
   The animated Furby is made by Hasbro Inc.'s Tiger Electronics
division. Word of the toy hit the streets in early fall, and
because it became available late in the distribution cycle, Furbies
are being shipped from China by air rather than sea, said a Tiger
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The doll has a 200-word vocabulary and interacts with humans _
and apparently with other Furbies _ using sound, light, and motion
sensors. The more you play with it, the better it responds, says
its creator.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for Furby so outweighs supply right now that F.A.O.
Schwarz in Boston won't even stock it, and instead calls customers
on its 20-page waiting list when a shipment comes in, said Jennifer
Picard, the store's personal shopping manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our list has been closed, and we probably will not have any
Furbies on the floor until after the holidays,'' Picard said.
</P>
<P>
   Zamparelli showed up at Kay-Bee Toys in Cambridge around 3 a.m.
and was first in line. He was soon joined by two guys who sat and
played video games on a laptop, and a suburban dad who had
rollerbladed in before public transport had started running.
</P>
<P>
   Zamparelli did come away with two dolls, but needs one more. He
scanned the other shoppers and offered a few of them $50 for one of
theirs, but no one was selling. He ran into a couple of teenagers
hawking the dolls for more than $100. He declined the offer because
it was too much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been up all night for this foolishness,'' said Zamparelli
later, after waking from a nap. ``This is an experience that I do
not choose to go through again.''
</P>
<P>
   But why do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``All my kids made clear this is the only toy they want,'' he
said. ``This becomes their whole world. You want to fulfill all
their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone out there has a reasonably priced Furby to sell,
Zamparelli is a father who needs one more.

GREENE DEFENDS SWANN  
 SOME QUESTION EXTENT OF INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynics question his threshold of pain. They find it difficult to
understand why Eric Swann would subject himself to a second knee
surgery in two months _ an operation that would end his season with
his teammates locked in a playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the cynics aren't walking in the defensive tackle's
shoes. More to the point, they're not gimping around on an
arthritic knees that have been subject to six arthroscopic
surgeries, four on the right knee in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn right,'' said Joe Greene, Swann's defensive line coach.
``That's the bottom line. Nobody can feel another person's pain.
You can speculate all you want to, but that's all you're doing _
speculating.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is go by what I feel by being around the guy, and
what I feel is just what I said. I don't know his pain. No one
does. And in my view, no player's health is worth risking for a
football game. That's just my view.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene's temper flared when a reporter asked whether Swann would
be risking his health if he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the (expletive) do you think?'' Greene said. ``Don't ask
me the question like that; like you're not sure'' Swann is injured.
</P>
<P>
   Swann underwent an ``arthroscopic flush'' on Oct. 28 and was
expected to return to the lineup next week against the New York
Giants, but he's still experiencing pain stemming from his
arthritic condition and likely will feel pain through the remainder
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He created a furor Thursday morning when he informed team
officials that he is considering undergoing season-ending knee
surgery after seeking a second opinion from U.S. Olympic Ski Team
physician Dr. Richard Steadman.
</P>
<P>
   The news stunned Cardinals management, which before the season
presented Swann with a five-year, $25 million contract that
includes a $7.5 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked in his face and have seen the different
emotions,'' Greene said. ``I saw it in his eyes when he thought he
was feeling better and thought he was going to be ready to come
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I saw the disappointment there when things started to take
a different turn. I feel badly for him, because I know he wants to
be out here. I've been in that position before when my team has
been on the field _ you want to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann has been undergoing the prescribed rehabilitation work
religiously in the mornings but has not attended practices. He made
the trip to Washington with the team, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing everything we have been asking him to do,''
Greene said. ``He wants to be there and he can't, and it's
disappointing to his fellow defensive linemen, disappointing for me
and for him, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five games to go in the season, and the window of
opportunity is sitting there looking at us, and it's never been
brighter since I've been here. He wants to be part of it, and
anybody who thinks he doesn't want to be part of it is full of
(expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals fullback Larry Centers, a teammate for eight seasons,
said Swann has not discussed his situation with other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think he might, but maybe he's just dealing with it,''
Centers said. ``Is he definitely going to have surgery?'' &QL;

INTIMIDATOR, SON A STUDY IN OPPOSITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They seem such opposites at this stage of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   At age 47, Dale Earnhardt sometimes still can be as cantankerous
as ever, reacting to most interview requests the way a growling pit
bull might react to a postman.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Dale Earnhardt Jr., who at age 24 is a model son
and a positive beacon for stock-car racing.
</P>
<P>
   While the elder Earnhardt, a seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup
champion, has struggled with only one win over the past two
seasons, the younger Earnhardt burst onto the NASCAR Busch Series
scene this year with seven victories and a driving championship.
</P>
<P>
   While one Earnhardt seemingly is on the way down, the good news
is another one is on the way up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we all know that my dad is eventually going to have
to start thinking about what's going to happen when he's done
driving race cars,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``But who knows when that
might be. He might be a little stubborn giving up the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I will be successful enough to carry on the torch.
I know there are (Earnhardt) fans out there, and I hope I can give
them reasons to still be Earnhardt fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. shouldn' worry. If he doesn't win over fans with
his talented touch behind the steering wheel, he'll likely do so
with as magnetic a personality as there is in the sport today.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Earnhardt Jr. on winning the Busch title: ``I'm glad I was just
a member of this team. I know everybody says, `Well, you're the
driver. You're the one turning the wheel.' But I tell you what,
this team deserves the credit. They gave me great race cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious as to how (winning the championship) is being
accepted by everybody else because I'm not out for all the credit.
I just hope people realize how good a team this is and how good
each person on the team is. I hope (crew chief) Tony (Eury Sr.) and
everybody else gets their fair share of credit. I don't want them
to be overshadowed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Earnhardt Jr., who lives in a trailer home, on the nearly $1
million he
 &UR; earned in race winnings this season: ``I went to the store and
bought me some new shoes and a (compact disc). I've been putting
all my money in the bank, and I'm not touching any of it because
I'm kind of nervous wondering about Uncle Sam and what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little afraid to spend any money at this time because I
have to learn all about that tax stuff, this, that and the other.
Once I get experienced and see what kind of tangible income I have,
then I'll start looking at whether I decide to buy a house or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Earnhardt Jr., on who he admires outside racing: ``Elvis
Presley. Everybody makes fun about that, but, man, I tell you what.
He had a lot of presure and demands on him. I think he did a pretty
good job with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended tragically, but I still find his life and what he
went through very interesting and mostly inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr.'s season has been a whirlwind nearly from the
beginning. Although he got off to a slow start _ Earnhardt Jr.
began the season by flipping his car on its roof at Daytona
International Speedway _ it wasn't long before he began displaying
that unquestionable Earnhardt magic.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time the season neared its end, he almost was able to
coast to the championship. It was a monster season, a season that
included 22 top-10 finishes in 31 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this team had come so close in years past,'' said
Earnhardt Jr., whose Busch owner is his father. ``If you look back
when Jeff Green and Steve Park were there, they were right back up
in the points chase. I paid a lot of attention to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what I had to do going into the year, which was
be very careful the first five or 10 races, not tear up the car and
make sure I finish in the top 10 or 15. I figured once I got some
experience, maybe I could be competitive for the championship. Once
things started going our way, we kept our momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the momentum got going, there was no slowing Earnhardt's
ascent up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, even the elder Earnhardt wanted to ensure Dale Jr.
wouldn't be grabbed by a rival team. Dale Earnhardt Inc. signed
Dale Jr. to a long-term contract, and a short time later,
Anheuser-Busch Inc., announced a six-year agreement to be the
younger Earnhardt's primary sponsor on the Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. will pursue another Busch crown in 1999 but also
will compete in five selected Winston Cup races on his father's
team, which also includes Park. In 2000, Earnhardt Jr. will begin
full-time Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   Park is anxiously awaiting the arrival of his new teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is good for our team,'' Park said. ``Multiple-car
teams seem to share more and more information, and this is an
information business. And the way (Earnhardt Jr.) has been running
this year, heck yes, he's going to help me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Dale Jr. has talent. Now it's just a matter of
getting experience in a Winston Cup car. But the competition up
here is a lot tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come over here and kick butt. Nobody has ever done
that and probably never will. You can be the king of the hill over
there (Busch) and come over here and struggle. Expectations are
always high when you start a new deal, but this is the most
competitive level of racing in the world, and it takes a lot of
patience. He's got a tough road ahead, but if he works hard, then
he will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take time, but longtime Winston Cup car owner Bud Moore,
whose list of former drivers includes the great Bobby Allison and
the elder Earnhardt for two seasons, believes Earnhardt Jr.'s
talents will begin to pay dividends sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched him quite a bit, and I'm going to tell you, he's
very stout,'' Moore said. ``He's an up-and-coming driver, just like
his daddy was. He's determined to win races, and he's going to win
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no end in him winning races. He needs a little more
experience in the Busch Series before he steps up to Winston Cup,
but he'll get that next year. Then, he'll be able to go out and
challenge most of these guys that are in Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   And won't that be fun? &QL;

A BLACK DAY FOR BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYAMON, Puerto Rico _ The idea formed two seasons ago, when
Duke visited Pauley Pavilion and looked devilishly good in black
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   It became reality Friday morning in a 70-54 loss to Maryland,
when the UCLA Bruins _ school colors: blue, gold and white _ wore
black uniforms for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Duke) was the first time we'd seen it where black looked
sharp,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``The players love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins explored shades and styles, received approval from
athletic director Peter Dalis _ but not John Wooden, according to
sources _ and submitted their order last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The black uniforms will be worn only on the road. Like 'em or
not, they're here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, we'll wear them four or five times,'' Lavin
said. ``The way we played (Friday), we might leave them in Puerto
Rico under a palm tree.''
</P>
<P>
   When he approved the new uniforms, Dalis told Lavin that all
complaints would be directed to the basketball office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll be seen as the Antichrist,'' Lavin said. ``But
one of the things we forget is, it's a kids' game. So if four or
five times we wear black uniforms in the course of a 30-game
schedule, it's not a world crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more losses, and it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Late visit: Point guard Earl Watson cut his right forearm
Thursday against San Francisco and spent a few harrowing,
late-night hours at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who received 11 stitches, was accompanied by UCLA
assistant coach Steve Spencer and trainer Jeff Smith, tournament
executive director Bill Hogan, and Luis Quihuis, San Francisco's
bi-lingual team chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the adventure, Watson shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fortunate to live in the United States,'' he said. ``It
took a couple hours, and very few people spoke English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close to being scary. I made sure I watched everything
they did, as far as the stitches and numbing me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard hit: Guard Rico Hines is only 6-foot-3, but he's quickly
becoming UCLA's enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   Hines made the hit of the season when he decked Maryland guard
Steve Francis in the first half Friday, preventing what would have
been a thunderous dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Hines, who played at St. John's at Prospect Hall (Md.), knows
Francis, a Maryland native, and they exchanged barbs throughout the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sending a message,'' Hines said. ``Earl wanted me to
take a charge. He said we needed the ball. But I wanted them to
know we were playing hard and let us know that's what we had to do.
I was trying to send a message to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson (seven rebounds) heard, but the frontcourt players did
not.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's big men _ Dan Gadzuric, Jerome Moiso, Matt Barnes and
Travis Reed _ combined for 13 rebounds.

   What's the truth about Daryl Hannah?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a special on Daryl Hannah that said something was wrong
with one of her hands. My husband swears otherwise. Who was right?
Say me, me, me. _ D.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Hannah has a shortened fingertip on one hand. Her publicist,
Alan Nierob, denied a recent report by Jeannette Walls of ``MSNBC''
that the actress wears a prosthetic for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you would notice,'' Nierob said. ``I think
that it's a congenital condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls reported on Nov. 9 that the prosthetic came off on the set
of the ABC movie ``Rear Window'' and production stopped until it
could be located.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah, who turns 38 on Dec. 3, is currently filming
``Diplomatic Siege'' in Romania with Peter Weller and director
Gustavo Graef Marino. Fans can write to her in care of Chuck
Binder, 1465 Linda Crest Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90210.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was in the Navy with Lance LeGault. Lately he has been the
narrator of a few TNN productions and had roles on ``Magnum P.I.''
and ``The A-Team.'' How can I write to him? _ R.G., via the
Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to LeGault in care of the Tisherman Agency, 6767 Forest
Lawn Drive, Suite 101, Los Angeles, Calif. 90068.
</P>
<P>
   LeGault, a one-time movie stand-in for Elvis Presley, has
appeared on more than 50 films and TV shows. He most recently
portrayed ``Elder God of Fire'' on the film ``Mortal Kombat:
Annihilation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop the Movement,'' a collection of country songs by LeGault,
is available by mail order to Shock Records, 16105-8H Victory
Blvd., Suite 382, Van Nuys, Calif. 91406. The price is $10 plus $2
shipping and handling in the United States, and checks should be
payable to ``Lance LeGault Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the term ``hard-wired'' come into use? _ R.J.,
Houston
</P>
<P>
   A: The term was coined in the late 1960s, shortly after
``hardware'' and ``software'' were adopted as references to
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware dates back to the 16th century as a way to describe the
mechanical equipment required to perform an activity.
``Hard-wired'' originally referred to an element of an electronic
circuit that was determined by the wiring and could not be changed,
according to the Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing.
</P>
<P>
   It has been extended to refer to ``anything that is not
modifiable.'' The On-Line Dictionary is available on the World Wide
Web at nightflight.com/foldoc.

   Q: What kind of plant grows on Chia Pets? _ A.F., Cleburne,
Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The seed that comes with the Chia Pet planters is ``Salvia
hispanica,'' David R. Hershey writes in the June 1, 1995, issue of
``Science Activities'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salvia hispanica,'' native to central Mexico, is part of the
mint family. It was a major food crop for the Aztecs and was used
for cleansing, wound dressing and body painting.
</P>
<P>
   Its plants are much larger when grown in soil. ``The Chia Pet
provides poor growing conditions because there are no nutrients,
and there is very little space for the roots to flourish,'' Hershey
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Enterprises, the makers of the Chia Pet, has a Web site
at www.chiapet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the years I have amassed a lot of political campaign
memorabilia. Are there any clubs devoted to collecting these items?
_ F.H., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: One such group is American Political Items Collectors, a
3,000-member nonprofit association that was founded in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Membership costs $30 per year and includes subscriptions to two
magazines published by the association. The group has 30 local
chapters, including some that are devoted to the memorabilia of
specific politicians, such as John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton and
Wendell Wilkie.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, write to Joseph Hayes, APIC
secretary-treasurer, Box 340339, San Antonio, TX 78234, or visit
www.collectors.org/apic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter is a huge fan of the Women's NBA, and I am having
trouble finding merchandise from the league in stores. Is there a
catalog? _ W.M., Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can order WNBA clothing, sporting goods, posters and
other souvenirs directly from the league. To request a catalog,
call (800) 711-3879 or visit its Web page, store.nba.com/wnba.html.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newest items for sale are WNBA Barbie and three other
dolls, Christie, Kira and Teresa. Each costs $25, plus shipping and
handling.

<P>
   Q: What were the original NFL teams? _ A.R., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1920, a group of independent pro football teams formed the
American Professional Football Association, which was renamed the
National Football League two years later.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Professional Football Researchers Association,
the charter teams were the Akron Pros, Buffalo All-Americans,
Canton Bulldogs, Chicago Cardinals, Chicago Tigers, Cleveland
Tigers, Columbus Panhandles, Dayton Triangles, Decatur Staleys,
Detroit Heralds, Hammond Pros, Muncie Flyers, Rochester Jeffersons
and Rock Island Independents.
</P>
<P>
   All of these teams were defunct by 1930, except for two Illinois
teams, the Cardinals and Staleys. Today, they are the Arizona
Cardinals and the Chicago Bears. The Green Bay Packers joined in
1921.
</P>

   Q: I know the meaning, but what does ``cut to the chase'' refer
to? _ N.C.F., Plano
</P>
<P>
   A: The expression is a reference to a director or screenwriter's
instruction in a movie _ ``cut to the chase scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut to the chase'' was used in moviemaking as early as 1929,
when a filmmaker wanted the story to progress immediately to a
pursuit, Jesse Sheidlower, a Random House editor, writes on his Web
site. ``The figurative use, which is now quite common, is fairly
recent; it seems to date only from the early 1980s.''

U.S. AGENCY CITES FLAWS IN HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal agency released a 26-page report Friday
citing several examples of serious mistakes in emergency treatment
at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn _ flaws that the
hospital says it is now fixing.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by the federal Health Care Financing
Administration, criticized the hospital's staff for making quick,
and faulty, judgments about the severity of some patients' injuries
and for repeatedly failing to provide adequate follow-up care.
</P>
<P>
   In a case earlier this year, a patient was discharged even
though CAT scans showed that a pool of blood in his brain was
growing, the report said. It also criticized the treatment provided
to patients with illnesses from heart failure to syphilis, and it
found that on busy days, emergency physicians had downgraded the
urgency of some cases without thoroughly examining the patients.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state regulators discovered these problems during
inspections at the hospital in October. Hospital executives said
they had taken significant steps to correct them, and the federal
agency has given the hospital 90 days to complete the changes.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors and leaders of medical labor unions said the
latest findings added to their concerns that the quality of care at
the city's public hospitals was declining in an era of budget and
staff cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Kings County Hospital, which serves many poor people in
Brooklyn, has long been noted for its active trauma center. But
like many public hospitals, its emergency rooms are often
overcrowded, which seems to be behind many of the failures cited in
the federal report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the difficulties typically began as nurses tried
to screen which patients needed emergency care and which could be
treated in a hospital clinic a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators found that a number of illnesses were initially
diagnosed as being less serious than they were and that none of the
patients sent to the clinic were escorted to insure that they had
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Patients suffering from diverse ailments like back pain,
numbness in the hands and a hernia were all returned to the
emergency room after being incorrectly sent to the clinic for
treatment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, an obstetrician was not called immediately when a
pregnant woman arrived in the emergency room in labor. She ended up
bleeding so much that she needed a transfusion. And one patient
suffering from congestive heart failure received only partial
workups during repeated visits to the emergency room, the report
said. It said that a social worker had noted on the first visit
that the patient was uninsured but that five months passed before
anyone wrote in the medical records that the patient could not
afford heart medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that a pattern developed wherein the patient would
run out of medication, develop congestive heart failure and be
readmitted to the hospital,'' the report said. ``There was no
evidence of coordination of services for this patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the problems at the hospital had been
referred to two other oversight agencies in the federal Department
of Health and Human Services, which could levy fines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hospital has been taking the right steps to correct
problems, the regulators wrote, adding that ``we have determined
that the immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety
has been removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said they had merged the clinic that treats
less-serious cases into the full emergency room operation to
eliminate the concerns about the patient-screening process. They
said this also should make it easier to coordinate follow-up
treatment for many patients. The hospital has also gone over its
screening policies with its emergency nurses and doctors and plans
to review 100 to 150 emergency cases a week for the next several
months to check their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   George Proctor, the hospital's operating chief, said the recent
problems focused mainly on medical processes and coordination. He
said he believed they affected only a small percentage of the
100,000 patients seen in the hospital's emergency room each year.
</P>
<P>
   Proctor also noted that Kings County had received a commendation
from a hospital accreditation agency. ``I think that, overall, the
quality of the emergency care we provide is excellent,'' he said.

FUR FLIES IN FURBY FREE-FOR-ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF PRINCE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The spirit of Christmas died like a neglected
virtual pet when shoppers clamoring for the latest fad turned
abusive early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the commotion was Furby, a fuzzy playmate with
saucer eyes, big ears and interactive abilities. The little guy is
quickly becoming the craze of Christmas 1998. Furby talks, responds
to patting and feeding and can interact with other Furbies.
</P>
<P>
   Customers waiting overnight at a Wal-Mart Supercenter to
purchase the toy began yelling and cursing when they learned that
the store had no Furbies in stock. They were asked to sign a
waiting list for the next shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Store officials called police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess some customers didn't understand what we were trying
to do,'' said Art Garza, store manager at the South Cooper Street
store. ``Some of them got upset because they weren't able to walk
home with one.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart advertisement offered Furby for $24.96, which is
about $5 less than regular retail. Customers waited for hours,
thinking that the toys would be offered for a limited time only
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A store manager asked people in the crowd to write their names
and phone numbers on a list and said he would call them in order as
soon as a shipment arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called about 4 a.m. when customers began cursing
employees and creating a brouhaha around the customer-service desk.
The crowd soon quieted and no arrests were made, police said.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m., a shipment of Furbies arrived and store employees
began calling names on the list. More than 30 customers had been
called by yesterday afternoon, Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons who had cursed employees with a high-pitched passion
returned embarrassed and apologetic a few hours later after they
were called.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go from the worst person in the world to an angel,'' Garza
said. ``I don't care if a customer rips my face off, if their name
is on the list, they'll get a Furby.''

   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ The Edgemont Panthers, with 11 starters who
have played on the same team since grammar school, earned the
ultimate reward for their togetherness Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Nadler's 10-yard touchdown run and Dylan
Kushel's extra point gave the Panthers a 28-27 victory in overtime
against Notre Dame of Elmira in the Class C final at the Carrier
Dome at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler, a senior, also threw two touchdown passes. The sophomore
tight end Matt Bernstein ran 2 yards for a score and hauled in a
5-yard touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   The state championship is the first in any sport for Edgemont,
which is in Westchester County. The Panthers (12-0) had dominated
previous opponents by an average score of 47-12, but found
themselves clinging to a 21-13 lead in the third quarter after
Nadler connected with Tom Cisco for a 19-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame (12-1) tied the game at 21-21 on a 12-yard touchdown
pass from Mike Meck to Dave Zeller and a 2-point conversion from
Meck to Zeller. Both teams went scoreless in the fourth quarter.
Edgemont marched to the Notre Dame 5-yard line with a minute left
in regulation, but fullback Peter Koh's fumble was recovered by
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame scored first in the tie breaker, in which both teams
begin from the opponent's 10-yard line, but Edgemont blocked the
extra point.

PURDUE'S SHOT AT END BEATS ST. JOHN'S, 70-69 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.Y.)  (mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two nights after blowing a 10-point second-half lead
and losing to third-ranked Stanford on free throws in the closing
seconds, St. John's blew another game against a ranked opponent at
Madison Square Garden Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After dominating No. 14 Purdue in the first half, and leading by
as many as 16 points in the second, St. John's lost, 70-69, when
the Boilermakers' Jaraan Cornell banked in a 19-footer with 1.7
seconds left in the consolation game of the Chase Preseason
National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm (3-2) led by 51-35 near the midway point of the
second half and then started missing layups, committing turnovers
and being outhustled. Purdue, on the other hand, began gaining
confidence with every St. John's miscue.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Boilermakers (5-1), who looked overmatched and
slow in the first half, began playing with fire. The full-court
press that St. John's had dismantled in the first half began paying
dividends. The change of momentum allowed the Boilermakers to put
together a 17-5 run that pulled them to within 56-52 on a 3-pointer
by Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's built the lead back to 67-61, on a layup by Ron
Artest, who led all scorers with 20 points, but Purdue scored the
next four points and pulled to within two on a layup by Greg McQuay
(19 points). Then, in a perfect example of its lack of execution,
the Red Storm committed a shot-clock violation.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if St. John's would survive, though, when Lavor
Postell scored to make it 69-65 with 16 seconds left. But Alan
Eldridge sank a contested 3-pointer from the right corner three
seconds later to pull the Boilermakers within a point. Purdue
immediately fouled Bootsy Thornton (18 points), who missed the
first free throw in a one-and-one situation.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue forced the ball downcourt and Cornell made an improbable
game-winning shot with a Red Storm player in his face.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Red Storm's full-court pressure, both
zone and man-to-man, had the Purdue players breathing sighs of
relief after they completed offensive sequences without having
their passes stolen or deflected. Just getting the ball past
midcourt was a chore as the Boilermakers wasted energy and
concentration looking over their shoulders for flying St. John's
players.
</P>
<P>
   After Purdue scored the game's first two points, Artest tied it
on an offensive rebound and layup, and the Red Storm never trailed
the rest of the half. Coach Gene Keady of Purdue played right into
St. John's hands by applying aggressive full-court pressure and
playing man-to-man defense instead of a zone. That allowed the Red
Storm to run and gun and avoid having to beat Purdue from the
outside, where St. John's is not the best-shooting of teams.
</P>
<P>
   Converting steals into layups, and hitting four of eight
3-pointers, St. John's built a 34-18 lead before heading into the
locker room all smiles with a 41-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the St. John's players returned to the locker room
one half later, the smiles had become frowns.

DOCTOR'S STABBING RAISES SECURITY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Administrators at a Brooklyn hospital where a surgeon
was stabbed four times in an elevator on Thanksgiving Day said
Friday that though the attack was an isolated crime, it left them
grappling with how to balance concerns for safety with a desire to
keep their hospital an open, inviting place for patients and their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon, Dr. Magdy Bouraee, 48, remained in stable condition
Friday at Lutheran Medical Center in Sunset Park, and hospital
administrators said they expected him to make a full recovery.
Bouraee, a vascular surgeon who has worked at the hospital for 20
years, was cut on his neck, face and arms in the attack, which
police officials said occurred around 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is doing well,'' said Robert Walsh, a senior vice president
at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the motive for the attack was robbery. Bouraee
had withdrawn money from an automated teller machine in the
hospital at least an hour before the attack. The police said that
the attacker might have watched Bouraee make that withdrawal and
then attempted to rob him after he got into a secluded elevator.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first serious assault reported at Lutheran Medical
Center, Walsh said, and administrators at the hospital viewed it as
an isolated incident. He acknowledged, however, that the stabbing
had raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals are public buildings,'' Walsh said. ``This is a
place with a very large visiting population and that is what the
public seems to want. They want security, but they also want
access.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come to visit sick loved ones are already agitated,
and they don't want to be hassled by security,'' he added. ``So the
staff is constantly trying to be sensitive to that, but also to be
alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutheran Medical Center was opened 22 years ago in Sunset Park,
inside a gutted factory. Walsh said the hospital, which has 502
beds and 240 nursing-home residents, has never had problems with
crime.
</P>
<P>
   He said, though, that the building lacked some security
equipment. For example, he said, there are no cameras in elevators,
but they will be installed as part of a renovation scheduled for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   There are also no cameras in or around the hospital ATM,
operated by Chase Manhattan. Ken Herz, a spokesman for Chase, said
that city law only requires cameras inside ATMs on public streets
and bank lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the hospital had not placed its own cameras around
the ATM machine and had no plans to install any, because the
machine is in a public lobby next to elevators and across from a
security booth. The coffee and gift shops are in the same area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the safest places you could be in the building,''
Walsh said. ``All the visitors pass by there. People going for
coffee pass there. And the security post is there, and if there's a
problem, they can see it right away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Administrators at other hospitals did not seem alarmed by the
attack at Lutheran Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not aware of any security concerns around ATMs in any of
our hospitals,'' said Frances Pandofi, chief of staff at New York
City Health and Hospitals Corp., which runs 20 public hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Parker, spokeswoman for Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center, said there are eight ATMs on the hospital property. All
have cameras inside them, she said. There have not been any crimes
reported at Columbia-Presbyterian, a 1,300-bed hospital complex,
that were related to the machines.
</P>
<P>
   The key, she said, is that security officers ask to see
identification from almost everyone who enters the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way it's always been here,'' she said.
``Security has been very well trained, and so they know how to talk
to people in a way that's very cordial and helpful.''

MAYOR SEEKS DONATIONS FOR FIGHT VS. ACLU 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ The annual tug-of-war between Republican
Mayor Bret Schundler and the American Civil Liberties Union over
the display of holiday symbols in front of City Hall has become as
predictable as the appearance of Santa Claus in shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   But now the 4-year-old dispute has a new spin. The mayor has
begun broadcasting a radio advertisement soliciting donations for a
fund that will help defray legal expenses as the case wends its way
up, down and perhaps back up again to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the court refused without comment to hear an appeal
from the city on a federal appeals court ruling that the exhibit
including a nativity scene, Hanukkah menorah and Christmas tree
violated the principle of separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to make the display less overtly religious by adding
figures of Santa Claus and Frosty the Snowman also failed to pass
legal muster. Even with Frosty and Santa, the exhibit still
``impermissibly endorsed religion,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Now the case is back before the appeals court. ``It has a new
slate of judges,'' Schundler said, ``so we don't know what it will
rule. If we lose, we will appeal again to the Supreme Court and if
we don't, we expect the ACLU to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In a radio advertisement that made its debut this week, the
mayor said, ``Today there is an assault taking place upon faith in
God. Teachers are even being penalized for teaching songs like
`Silent Night.' City halls are being banned from erecting holiday
displays. The ACLU is suing my city, Jersey City, to force us to
censor religious symbols from city cultural celebrations. And some
even want to eliminate the word `God' from American currency and
the Pledge of Allegiance.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes by asking listeners to contribute to the Jersey
City Religious Freedom Defense Fund. Schundler established the fund
last year after it became clear that legal expenses would continue
to mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a law firm, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty,
handling the case pro bono,'' Schundler said. ``But if we lose
again at the appeals court level, we will have to pay fees for the
other side. When the ACLU tries to bully you, they will tell the
taxpayers what costs you are incurring. I want to show mayors that
if, instead of rolling over, you stand up and fight against
anti-religious discrimination, people will voluntarily give you
money and you won't have to go to the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved with the case for the New Jersey branch of the
Civil Liberties Union could not be reached Friday, but Frank Askin,
a general counsel for the organization's national office, said:
``The mayor is our best source of income these days. He refuses to
accept the constitutional reality that we have separation of church
and state. We are happy to receive his contributions for the
frivolous litigation he forces us into to protect the
Constitution.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor found time to begin the campaign while coping with a
teachers' strike that crippled the school system for four days. But
he feels the issue is important to his city's harmony. Exceedingly
proud of his city's sponsorship of all kinds of festivals
celebrating the numerous ethnic and religious groups in Jersey
City, the mayor considers efforts to ban holiday symbols, which
were first displayed outside City Hall in 1968, to be
``anti-religious discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a yearlong series of ethnic festivals that we call our
`slice of heaven' series,'' he said. ``And we don't censor out
religious elements. We celebrate cultures as they are and don't
white-out religious elements. We view the nativity scene and the
menorah as symbols of culture.'' If he had his way, the City Hall
vista this year would include a Christmas tree, a snowman, Santa
Claus, reindeer, a menorah, a nativity scene and Kwanzaa ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, passers-by will see the same sign that stood there last
year. It reads: ``Due to a lawsuit by the ACLU, our traditional
menorah and creche may not be displayed this year. We are fighting
in order to be able to return these beautiful displays to you next
year. Season's Greetings!''

LARRY LIKES COACH BRASWELL'S TONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In its most simple and concise form, Andre Larry
figured he had two choices. He could run with gangs. Or he could
play basketball surrounded by the gangs and the drug-dealing and
the violence, and hope to get out.
</P>
<P>
   So Larry thumbed his nose at the evils of Compton for the
University of Oregon. He believed in a young assistant coach named
Bobby Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Larry is a 6-foot-9 junior at Cal State Northridge,
readying for his home debut tonight as the Matadors (1-2) host San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only coach I've ever had that told me that he loved
me,'' said Larry, 20. ``That was a big factor for me. I knew I
wanted to play for him. He's the only coach I wanted to play for.
He understands me. I'm that inner-city kid that needed a chance,
and he gave me that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond that began during recruiting flourished during Larry's
freshman season at Oregon. Then a better opportunity materialized.
Not for Larry, but for Braswell. He became CSUN's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   So, during a sophomore season in which Larry averaged 3.3 points
and 1.5 rebounds for the Ducks, questions crept into Larry's mind
about his place in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence was gone and his standing with the coaching staff
became a confusing issue. And the answers always seemed to lie in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Larry needs TLC. And Braswell has a way of balancing the yelling
and screaming and everything else a head coach does with compassion
and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre's like a son to me. He really is,'' Braswell said.
``When I recruited him at Oregon we just hit it off. We clicked. I
knew what he needed. He needed to have a man in his life that would
hold him accountable. Someone that would love him and encourage
him, but at the same time hold him accountable for things in his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry needed a father-figure after being reared by his
grandparents. Not that it was a bad thing because it was Larry's
grandfather who ran Gonzalez Park, where Larry spent oodles of time
playing basketball in hopes of getting out.
</P>
<P>
   Guidance and structure existed, evident from Larry's 3.7 GPA at
Verbum Dei High. It speaks to the smarts he extracted from his
grandfather, who lured Larry from trouble and into sports many
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets stronger he has the ability to play at the next
level,'' Braswell said. ``He handles the ball well. He's good on
the perimeter, but he's good on the inside, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard leaves team: Larry Beard, a 6-foot-9 junior center from
Crockett, Texas, left the team and won't return. Braswell said
Beard, in his first season at CSUN, will remain in school through
the semester before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he told me was his heart wasn't in basketball any more,''
Braswell said. ``He told me the best thing for him to do was to
finish school out and go back to Texas where his heart is. I have
to respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard, who averaged 14 points and 8.9 rebounds at Angelina
College last season, played in one game.

HOLIDAY REUNION ENDS IN TIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ In the reunion spirit of the holiday weekend, the
Rangers and the Penguins brought old friends to the rink when they
met Friday night at the Civic Arena. It was the first game between
the teams since their multiplayer trade earlier in the week, in
which right wing Aleksei Kovalev went from the Rangers to
Pittsburgh and center Petr Nedved went from the Penguins to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev had two assists and Nedved had one as the teams settled
for a 2-2 tie. It was the second tie between the two teams in two
games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev's second assist, with 15 seconds remaining in
regulation, set up the tying goal by Robert Lang, who beat Ranger
goalie Mike Richter with a long, rising wrist shot high on the
glove side. The Penguins were skating with an extra attacker
because they had pulled their goalie, Tom Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   This was the last of a five-game road trip for the Rangers, who
return home on Sunday to play the expansion Nashville Predators.
The Rangers finished the trip with a record of 1-2-2. In goal for
the Rangers was Richter, making his first appearance in more than a
week. Their backup goalie, Dan Cloutier, played the previous three
games and went 1-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean and Brian Leetch scored for the Rangers. Nedved
assisted on Leetch's goal, which gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the
second period when they had a two-man power play.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was made on Wednesday. Along with Kovalev, a right
wing, the Rangers sent center Harry York and $2.5 million to the
Penguins for Nedved, defenseman Chris Tamer and center Sean
Pronger. Nedved missed the 1997-98 National Hockey League season in
a contract dispute and was playing this season for Las Vegas of the
International League.
