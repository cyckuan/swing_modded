<HEADLINE> Three Suspects Named in Lin Ti-chuan Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Public Security Bureau in
Haicheng, northeast China's Liaoning Province, has confirmed the
identity of three suspects thought to be involved in the case
of Lin Ti-chuan, a Taiwan woman who was allegedly kidnapped
and consequently died in the city in late July.
</P>
<P>
Li Guangzhu, spokesman for the team investigating the case,
released the names of the male suspects -- Li Guangzhi, 21; Yang
Rongxi, 20; and Zhao Chuang, 22.
</P>
<P>
Li worked as manager of Dazhi Trade Company in the port city
of Dalian. The suspect's father is the general manager of the
Huamei Industrial Corp. in Haicheng, Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Yang is an unemployeed resident of Haicheng and Zhao is a
farmer in a suburban village, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary investigation indicates that the case results
from the business activities of Wei Tein-kang, Lin's boyfriend, and
notes that the suspects were most likely unaware of Lin's personal
background.
</P>
<P>
Public security bureaus in Haicheng and the neighboring city of
Anshan have assigned more than 200 detectives to the case.
</P>
<P>
A massive manhunt for the three suspects is underway in
Liaoning, and the Ministry of Public Security has ordered related
departments throughout the nation to cooperate fully, according to
the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Flood Control Remains Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Flood control experts warned today
that flood situation along the Yangtze River remains grim despite
a favorable turn in the weather which has replaced torrential rain
in the middle and lower reaches of the river with sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain in the upper reaches of the river will prolong
dangerously high water levels in the middle and lower reaches for
the foreseeable future, according to Ji Xuewu, director of the
Hydrological Department under the Yangtze River Water Conservancy
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan and surrounding areas in Hubei Province face the threat
of the heaviest flooding since 1954.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at the Shashi Hydrological Station in Jingzhou hit
43.94 meters by 08:00 this morning, some 0.94 meters above the
flood stage. The Jingzhou-Shashi areas is considered most
vulnerable section of Yangtze levees in Hubei Province. The third
flood crest is expected to raise water levels at the Shishou
Station to 40.2 meters, slightly higher than the record 39.91
meters through.
</P>
<P>
Ji noted that if the precipitation levels in the middle and
lower reaches of Hanjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze,
exceed 60 mm, the water discharge rate at Wuhan will reach more
than 5,000 cu.m./second, and this will cause greater flood control
difficulties in the transportation and business hub which has a
population of over seven million people. The current discharge
rate stands at 2,600 cu.m./second.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Flood Control Headquarters has issued a
circular instructing provinces in the middle and lower reaches of
the river to prepare emergency evacuation plans.

NEW DELHI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Home Minister L. K.

war from across the border in Jammu and Kashmir.

Advani said in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament,
there should not be any doubt about Pakistan's plan of action and

stepped up militancy in the Kashmir valley and elsewhere, Advani

Following his recent visit to Doda, Advani had said that those
rulers who could not protect the lives and property of the people
have no right to remain in power and he later clarified that he

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Apply for WTO Entrance by Mid-1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is to formally apply for
entrance into the World Trade Organization (WTO) by mid-1999 and
admission is possible in the same year, the semi-official Jordan
Times Tuesday quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government is confident of this schedule because the
results of the just-concluded negotiations between Jordan and the
WTO were encouraging, said secretary-general of the Ministry of
Industry and Trade, Mohammad Halayqa.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations, the third round in a row, with the
Geneva-based organization last month, Jordan responded positively
to the demands such as abolishing the government organ in charge
of supply affairs, fixing the ceiling on customs over imported
commodities and raising the quality of agricultural products to
meet international standards, said Halayqa.
</P>
<P>
As both sides have reached consensus and Jordan is ready to
accept the WTO's criteria on these outstanding issues, the way for
the kingdom's accession to the world organization will be easy to
walk, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, one thing that remains unsolved is the
protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in the
pharmaceutic field and Jordan has got a lot of work to do in this
regard in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The strategy that Jordan will adopt in dealing with IPR
protection in the pharmaceutic field is to hold bilateral talks
with its main trade partners to garner their support before
holding formal meetings with the WTO on the same subject, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will try all the best to persuade the WTO to accept a
three-year grace period, to prevent the 140-million-U.S.-dollar
per year pharmaceutic industry from collapsing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan inaugurated its contact with the WTO on the issue of
entrance in October 1996. The first round of negotiations was
conducted in July 1997. The second round happened in the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the 28 countries currently negotiating with
the WTO to become its members. Among the 28 countries, five are
from the Arab world. They are Jordan, Algeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia
and Sudan.

KUWAIT CITY, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Tuesday denied that
it is interfering in Iraq's internal affairs and is financing the

<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Ahmad Sabah
said in a statement after attending a parliamentary session that
Kuwait does not interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq because

The foreign minister also rejected allegations that Kuwait was
behind the ongoing crippling international economic sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is not a member of the United Nations Security Council
and therefore not capable of controlling the council on the matter
of sanctions on Iraq, he said.

The U.N. imposed sanctions against Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Remains Biggest Supplier of Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States remains the
world's biggest arms merchant in the world while the Middle East
continues to have the deepest hunger for new weapons, said a
latest study by the U.S. Congressional Research Service.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the U.S. retained its No. 1 position in
the arms trade, which it has held for seven years, by selling 15.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of weapons last year, a 44 percent
share of the shrinking global arms market.
</P>
<P>
Weapon sales by the U.S. and other nations to the developing
world are slowing since the end of the Cold War. The arms bazaar
of the 80's and early 90's in Asia and the Middle East has calmed,
in part because of the Asian economic crisis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Another factor for the slow-down is the long slump in crude oil
prices, helping slow purchases by Saudi Arabia, once the biggest
buyer of American weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The study found that Russia and France are in heated
competition for sales pacts to gain more parts of the declining
market.
</P>
<P>
Russia's best customer is India, which bought 40 Russian
fighter jets last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Russia delivered 2.7 billion U.S. dollars arms from 1990 to
1993, but 700 million U.S. dollars worth of arms from 1994 to
1997.
</P>
<P>
Among all the regions, the Middle East continues to be the
biggest buyer of new weapons and Asia is the second-biggest
regional market while the U.S. is the most reliable supplier, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to last year the United States signed contracts to
sell 44.1 billion U.S. dollars of arms to nations in the Middle
East. France is in a position to overtake the U.S. as the
region's biggest arms supplier, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Conservatives Still Trail in Opinion Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
conservative ruling parties still trail the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) in public support with only eight weeks to
go before the September general elections, an opinion poll showed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted by the German Infas institute showed that
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party and its Bavarian
sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) would win 37 percent of
the vote compared with 41 percent for the leftist SPD.
</P>
<P>
A further bad news for Kohl was the declining support for his
junior coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), without
which Kohl would not have won the previous four general elections
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
The Infas poll showed that if elections were held now, FDP
would win just four percent, less than the five percent needed to
be seated in the German federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the survey, the ecologist Greens party,
a potential coalition partner for the SPD, would win seven percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,002 voters surveyed by the Infas institute, about 25
percent said that they had not yet decided which party they would
vote for.
</P>
<P>
Despite poorer showing in opinion polls, Kohl on Tuesday again
expressed confidence about his chance to win a fifth term in
office since 1982.
</P>
<P>
The election would only be decided in the last four weeks
before the September 27 voting day, Kohl said in an interview with
the German RTL television network.

<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Tuesday called on the Iraqi government to comply with United
Nations Resolutions in order to get international sanctions
against the country lifted.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission for
disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM), cut short his visit to Iraq after
talks on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Cook said in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon that Britain
was disappointed that "Iraqi government's antics appear again to
be thwarting UNSCOM's work."
</P>
<P>
"We must obviously await Mr Bulter's full report to the
Security Council before commenting in detail. But in the meantime,
Iraqi claims that UNSCOM is haggling over minor details are
patently absurd," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook pointed out that Britain "would like to see sanctions
(against Iraq) lifted as soon as possible. But progress depends
entirely on Iraqis."
</P>
<P>
"They must first comply fully with U.N. resolutions which the
Iraqi government accepted after the Gulf War," Cook said, urging
Iraq to reconsider its position and agree in full to the
accelerated program of work proposed by the UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes Hiccup in Arms Inspection Will Be Overcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Tuesday that he saw the breakdown of U.N.-Iraqi
talks on arms inspection in Iraq as "a major hiccup", but "a
hiccup that we can overcome".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival to his workplace here
this morning, Annan declined to go into details about chief U.N.
arms inspector Richard Butler's decision to discontinue his talks
in Baghdad, saying the U.N. Security Council will hear Butler's
report before taking further steps.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is a new crisis emerging with Iraq over arms
inspection, Annan said: "Not necessarily."
</P>
<P>
To the question whether he was concerned that the Memorandum of
Understanding signed between him and the Iraqi Government in
February is in jeopardy, Annan said one should put the MOU in
context.
</P>
<P>
"At that time we had problems over access (to Iraqi
Presidential sites), problems about cooperation, and we resolved
that and it has worked reasonably well. I would hope that when Mr.
Butler comes back and reports we will be able to continue our
work," the Secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
Butler, head of U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in
Iraq, or UNSCOM, went to Baghdad on Sunday with a "road map" for
Iraq to follow in dismantling its ballistic missiles, chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
In a statement following the talks with Butler, Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Monday that Iraq was willing to
continue cooperation with the U.N. on the disarmament issue.
</P>
<P>
But he said Iraq rejected Butler's proposal for a new plan of
action, as it "made no sense" when UNSCOM was "ignoring essential
issues and focusing on minor and insignificant ones to waste
time".
</P>
<P>
Butler, due back in New York on Wednesday before reporting to
the Security Council on Thursday, said the talks collapsed because
he cannot accept Iraq's demand to give a clean bill of health on
its weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions on Iraq, effective since Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that
Baghdad has destroyed all banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leaders have called for the lifting of the sanctions
within this year, saying Iraq has complied with relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Opposed by the United States and Britain, the council failed
last Wednesday to accept a Russian proposal for scaling back the
U.N. inspection in Iraq.

Netanyahu also said that the talks were centering on the
"nature reserve" issue and Israel has just presented some new
ideas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far resisted a U.S. plan, which is backed by the
Palestinians, to yield 13 percent more of the West Bank in the
second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side rejected the Israeli proposal that 3
percent of that sum be called a "nature reserve" with limitations
on construction, unless it is assured that the area will receive
the formal status of "Area B."
</P>
<P>
All Area B land is jointly controlled by Israel and the PNA in
an interim phase before becoming "Area A," which is exclusively
controlled by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu noted that Israel had contended any further pullback
of more than 9 percent will jeopardize the security of the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States first proposed a special
solution be found for the 3 percent land, which would not harm
Israeli interests. But he did not say that the U.S. actually
suggested a "nature reserve" idea, which is now being debated
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made his remarks just after the Palestinians
rejected an Israeli proposal on redeployment, which was presented
by Netanyahu's adviser Yitzhak Molcho during his meeting with
chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said on Tuesday that the PNA is considering whether to
continue direct talks with Israel or not.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister Calls for More Sexual Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan minister of state has
called for more sexual education for people in the country so
that they can set a good example for others.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Kiryapawo, the Minister of State for Gender, Labor and
Social Development, made the appeal Tuesday at the opening
ceremony of a workshop on communication skills for adolescent
reproductive health in Jinja, 80 kms east of the capital city
Kampala, Uganda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said more adolescents drop out of school today and get
early pregnancies. They take on unsafe means of abortion or have
delivery complications since they are unprepared.
</P>
<P>
This often results in premature child birth, damaged babies
and poor parenting, he added.
</P>
<P>
He challenged participants of the workshop to set good
examples to the adolescents with good behavior at home and to
share the acquired knowledge in this field with others at the
grassroots.
</P>
<P>
They should pressure their own culture. The imported cultures
are not to blame, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nathan Musinguzi, the director of Uganda Population
Secretariat, told the workshop that half of the population are
youths and they are most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Therefore, he
added, the life of the youths should be very seriously addressed.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.N. Official Urges Israel Exit of Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President of the United
Nations General Assembly Guinadi Audvedenko Tuesday called on
Israel to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon without any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Audvedenko made the appeal here at a joint news conference
with Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 and all
related resolutions asked for a full and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern villages from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In April Israeli cabinet approved the resolution 425 for the
first time since it was adopted in 1978, but linked its
implementation with security guarantee from the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer and accused Israel of setting
preconditions for the withdrawal. But the U.N. chief Kofi Annan
and the United States welcomed the offer as a positive step.
</P>
<P>
The current U.N. General Assembly president, who is Ukrainian,
said he supported Lebanese stance toward Israel's conditional
withdrawal proposal.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his country's readiness to replace the
Norwegian soldiers working in the U.N. peacekeeping forces in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Norway has announced that it would decrease its 600-strong
battalion by two thirds at the end of this year, citing it could
no longer attract sufficient numbers of volunteers for the
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon was established in 1978
following Israel's first invasion of Lebanon, in order to confirm
the withdrawal of Israeli forces and restore Lebanese authority
over its southern territory.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said Lebanon welcomed Ukrainian willingness to replace
Norwegian soldiers and hoped the two countries further boost
bilateral ties in the economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Audvedenko arrived in Lebanon Monday on a two-day visit. He had
held talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker
Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The third session of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Ministerial
Sub-Committee meeting on the conflict in southern Sudan opened
here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The three-day peace talks which is being attended by the
Sudanese government delegation and the delegation of the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), followed the two rounds of
peace talks held earlier in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin said this ministerial meeting is part and parcel of the
IGAD peace process in Sudan whose critical significance is
recognized by all and on whose success hinges the realization of
peace, stability and national reconciliation in Sudan as well as
stability and security in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
He said the two parties to the conflict have reached agreement
on the right to self-determination of the people of southern
Sudan in the second-round negotiations in Nairobi in May, this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We the members of the IGAD Sub-Committee are determined to
work with you with even greater resolve so that you may be able
to keep the momentum already created with the view to achieving a
comprehensive settlement of the problem based on the declaration
of principles," the Ethiopian minister said.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Kenyan Foreign Minister Benayo Adhi
Godana, who is also Chairman of the IGAD Ministerial
Sub-Committee, called on the international community to take
advantage of the cease-fire and provide food and medicine to
famine stricken people in southern Sudan considering thousands of
people are dying there.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for impartiality and caution in dealing with
the issue in order to arrive at a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary General of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), called upon parties to the conflict to
resolve peacefully the crisis in southern Sudan, saying that
"nothing, absolutely nothing, can justify the continuation of
this conflict."
</P>
<P>
He added that "the people of Sudan and the world community
have confidence in the IGAD peace process and are watching us. We
must be optimistic that we shall succeed."
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Eritrea make up the
sub-committee.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army has been waging war for
greater autonomy for the people of southern Sudan since 1983.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Denies Bid to Distabilizing Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has denied the accusation that it plans to send in
additional troops to distabilize the Liberian government, as
alleged by Liberian President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) in Monrovia Tuesday, ECOMOG's Chief of Staff in
Liberia, Major-General Abdul Mohammed said the development is
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
He called the allegation ridiculous, saying that ECOMOG has
been in Liberia since 1990 to restore peace to the country, for
which Nigeria alone has spent millions of Dollars.
</P>
<P>
General Mohammed implied that the misunderstanding might arise
from the fact that some Guinean officers were coming to the
ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia to represent the 200 Guinean
troops to be deployed to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He said the officers were coming to Monrovia because it is
where the ECOMOG high command is.
</P>
<P>
As to the Guinean troops, he explained that they were not even
coming to Liberia, because Guinea and Sierra Leone have common
borders so the troops will directly go to Sierra Leone. In fact,
he said, they were already there.
</P>
<P>
The BBC said Liberia President Charles Taylor alleged in a
radio broadcasting Monday night that he has documental proof of a
plot by ECOMOG to send in additional troops to overthrow his
one-year-old government and distablizing the country.
</P>
<P>
Taylor did not name the country from where the distabilizing
troops were coming, but he said he was putting a halt to the
planned arriving of some 200 peace-keepers from neighboring
Guinea to beef up security in Liberian capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
He said he has officially informed the chairman and member
countries of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) of the alleged plot and that his government is now
stable and will not accept any additional troops.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Parliament: Polluted Water From Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's parliament insisted on
Tuesday that the recent tap water pollution reported in Amman has
much to do with the water source bordering with Israel, adding
diplomatic color on the issue.
</P>
<P>
A dispute between the anti-Israeli parliament and the
government favoring normalization of ties with Israel has become
tense over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Lower House's Agricultural and Water Committee said in a
report Tuesday that the polluted water found in western Amman in
early July came from the Lake Tiberias and the Yarmouk River, the
capital's main water sources bordering Israel.
</P>
<P>
Panic hit Amman on July 5, as many citizens, especially those
in the western part of the city, found discolored water coming out
of taps with a strange smell and taste. The situation was under
control a week later.
</P>
<P>
A number of diarrhea and nausea-related cases related to the
water pollution were admitted to hospitals. Some people rush to
buy bottled water and others turn to private water companies.
</P>
<P>
A water ministry investigation report blamed it all on the
capital's water treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
But the issue became a diplomatic one after the parliament
learnt the source of polluted water is at the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
A round of exchange of harsh words has been triggered between
the Lower House and the government. The House criticized the
government for not mentioning the polluted water.
</P>
<P>
The committee in its report called for the dismissal and trial
of Minister of Water and Mineral Resources Munther Haddadin and
the Jordan Water Authority's Secretary-General Munther Khleifat
for their role in "causing the problem."
</P>
<P>
The committee report, which was submitted to House Speaker Saad
Hail El-Sorour, said the foul-smelling and murky tap water was
caused by extra quantity of algae, while also partially blaming
the water plant for negligence.
</P>
<P>
The government has not yet responded to the committee's
call. But Crown Prince Hassan Tuesday told the government that a
"neutral" committee will be established to investigate the issue
of water pollution. By "neutral," it means non-parliamentary and
non-governmental.
</P>
<P>
A draft version of the report was made public earlier, to which
the Israeli Embassy in Jordan made an immediate response.
</P>
<P>
The embassy's spokesman Roey Gilad rejected a possible
assumption that Israel has been supplying Jordan with polluted
water from the Lake Tiberias.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is supplying Jordan with drinking water from the same
source it is using to supply Israeli citizens," he said in an
interview with the semi-official Jordan Times on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan reached a peace agreement in 1994, under
which Jordan was allowed to store 50 million cubic meters of its
water in the Lake Tiberias each winter and then reclaim it in
summer.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a water-poor country. The per capita annual
consumption of water in the kingdom is far below the
international water-poor line, or 1,000 cubic meters per per
person a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko on Tuesday expressed worry over the social and economic
tension in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"If this Titanic sinks, it will drag down everybody, not just
Belarus," Lukashenko said in an interview with the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
"if any upheavals occur there, it would be painful for me as a
political figure", he said, noting that Minsk's policy is oriented
toward Russia.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko believed that the market reforms and changes in
Russia have failed.
</P>
<P>
"Control, in particular economic, was lost in Russia in the
course of what was called market reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lukashenko expressed the belief that the deterioration
of the socioeconomic situation in Russia will not hamper its ties
with Belarus, nor will it dampen their union.
</P>
<P>
"Even if an upheaval does occur, I do not think it will affect
the Union of Belarus and Russia," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
"Difficult times bring peoples together; hey sober up and
bring the leaders closer together," he added.

<HEADLINE> Denktash: Missiles Escalate Tension in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said Tuesday that Russia's planned sale of S-300 missiles
to Cyprus will escalate tension on the divided island, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Russian Foreign Ministry envoy
for Cyprus Vladimir Tchizhov, Denktash said Russian government
should be aware of the serious consequences of its missile deal
with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash noted the situation in Cyprus will become more
complicated and peace talks more impossible if the Cypriot
government finally deploy the Russian-made surface-to-air missiles
in the southern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus reached a deal with Russia early last year to buy S-300
missiles to boost defense capacity. But this triggered harsh
reaction from Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which vowed to take
pre-emptive measures to prevent the missile deployment.
</P>
<P>
As for the stalled peace process on the island, Denktash blamed
the Cypriot government for the impasse of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Denktash walked out of the talks last year after the European
Union decided to begin accession negotiations with Cyprus soon
and at the same time exclude Turkey from is first enlargement plan.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader said that Russia should act equally
to both sides if its really wants a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed troops and took over the northern third in the wake of an
abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic" in the north, which is recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Denktash, the Russian envoy
said that Moscow looks forward to a peaceful settlement of the
Cyprus issue. The most important thing is to build up confidence
between the two sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the S-300 missiles that the Greek Cypriots
are to buy from Russia would not obstruct a solution to the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting on the eastern Mediterranean
island since the missile deal was struck. It was reported that the
missiles would be delivered and deployed by the end of this year.

The anti-Israeli parliament and the government favoring

</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, a special commission was established here
late Tuesday under Crown Prince Hassan's instruction.
</P>
<P>
The commission, headed by a high official from the Ministry of
Justice, is charged with the task of identifying the pollution
source, finding the persons responsible for the contamination and
checking the current quality of the tap water in the capital.

The commission includes members from the semi-official Public

ANKARA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- To ensure a just election in next
year, the Turkish government named Tuesday three independent
politicians to fill the posts of the resigned interior, justice
and transportation ministers.
</P>
<P>
Independent deputy Hasan Denizkurdu was appointed as justice
minister, Istanbul Governor Kutlu Aktas as interior minister and
another independent deputy Arif Ahmet Denizolgun as transportation
minister, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
President Suleyman Demirel approved the appointment late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish Constitution, the justice, interior and
transportation ministers must be replaced with independents no
later than five days after the parliament announces the election
date.
</P>
<P>
This stipulation is designed to ensure a just election because
those who hold the three posts might have unfair influence on the
voting.
</P>
<P>
The parliament announced last Thursday that the early elections
would be held on April 18, 1999 in a bid to create a stable
government for the country.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy To Slow Down This Year and Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Higher interest rates and rising
inventories will slow down Canada's economic growth this year and
next, an economic think-tank predicted here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth will slow from the unsustainable pace of 3.7
percent posted in 1997, dropping to 3.1 percent for 1998 and 2.7
percent in 1999," the Conference Board of Canada said in its Summer
1998 Canadian Outlook.
</P>
<P>
The 175 basis point hike in short-term interest rates over the past
year will hurt durable consumption and housing in the country.
</P>
<P>
And the current inventory buildup is now out of line with sales
growth, and an imminent inventory correction will slow the pace of
employment growth, according to the forecast.
</P>
<P>
But as exports to the United States continue to increase and the
government sector ceases to be a drag on the economy, Canada should
still manage to generate about 350,000 jobs this year and another
300,000 next year.
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic rise in inventories over the four quarters ending
in the first quarter of 1998 creates the chief risk to the outlook,"
said Paul Darby, director of the board's economic services.
</P>
<P>
"If firms continue to build inventories through to the third
quarter of 1998, in spite of slowing demand, the result would be
stronger growth in 1998 but sharp pause next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The continuing Asian financial crisis and the effects it is having
on the Canadian dollar is another concern to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"There remains the risk of a sharp increase in interest rates
should the Bank of Canada move to vigorously defend our currency,"
Darby said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current weakness in the dollar, the board does not
expect the central bank to raise interest rates until forced by a
hike in U.S. rates late next year.
</P>
<P>
The lack of any inflation threat, the continued weakness in the
Canadian economy, and the decline in commodity prices will persuade
the bank to accommodate the decline in the dollar in the near term,
the board said in its economic forecast.

<HEADLINE> Guns Found in Capitol Shooting Suspect's Montana Cabin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Guns, ammunition and spy books
were found in the remote Montana cabin of Russell Weston Jr., the
man accused of killing two police officers in the U.S. Capitol
last month, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Weston's cabin in Rimini, Montana, agents found, among other
things, a.22 calibre handgun, a shotgun and a plastic bottle
containing gun powder, according to a Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) account.
</P>
<P>
The diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic also kept spy books.
</P>
<P>
Weston, 41, was charged with the shooting deaths of Capitol
police officers Jacob Chestnut, 58, and John Gibson, 42, whose
bodies were put to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Weston, recovering from several gunshot wounds from the July 24
shooting, is not expected to appear in court until later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Weston is locked to his bed and under guard in a D.C. hospital
room. The judge has also authorized a visit from two mental health
professionals.
</P>
<P>
Police had already found a box of ammunition matching the type
of gun used in last week's shooting in the U.S. Capitol in
Weston's red pickup truck. A police search turned up a box of
"Remington.38 Special" cartridges.
</P>
<P>
According to affidavits, Weston's parents told the FBI he had
an irrational fear of the government. The FBI said his parents
provided anecdotal evidence of his fears, which became an
overriding feature of his daily life.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Blocks Pessimism About Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, the
Regent said Tuesday that there is no need to be pessimistic about
the results of the recent Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations,
because it is still premature to make a final judgment in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The obstacles facing the peace negotiations are just temporary
and Jordan hopes "a breakthrough would be achieved soon," Hassan
told reporters after attending a regular cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure satisfactory results of the peace talks,
Israel should follow the Palestinians in accepting a proposal put
forward by the United States, which calls for the Jewish state to
withdraw troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the peace talks and the U.S. proposal, Jordan
sticks to its support to the Palestinians in their pursuit to
achieve their own rights on their national soil, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are speaking about the Jordanian interests rather than a
Jordanian role. The Jordanian interests demand concentration on
helping the Palestinians remain in their homeland," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis have been conducting peace talks
for the past two weeks in Tel Aviv, but no achievements have been
made.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the talks centered on the U.S. peace
proposal. The Palestinians have already accepted it, but Israel
rejected it on security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has publicly expressed
pessimism about the results of the talks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Breakdown of Iraqi Talks "Disturbing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that the breakdown of talks between Iraq and the U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler was "disturbing" but not
surprising.
</P>
<P>
"It's inexplicable, it's disturbing but it's not surprising to
us," White House spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The White House spokesman's comment came after Butler cut short
his visit to Baghdad on Tuesday as iraq's Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz rejected a proposal to accelerate U.N. weapons
inspections and instead demanded the files be closed.
</P>
<P>
It "only puts further back the day that Iraq will get what it
says it wants, which is relief from sanction," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. officials were waiting to hear a report to the
U.N. Security Council by chief weapons inspector Butler on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not raise the temperature until we get a full report
from Chairman Butler," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that all options, including a military one,
remained "absolutely" open on dealing with Iraq but cautioned
against jumping to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
At a State Department briefing, spokesman James Rubin said
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had "shot himself in the foot" by
mishandling a chance to end economic sanctions, and reversed
himself in the past.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has only harmed itself," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he couldn't said whether a new crisis loomed but
added that Washington would "continue to follow a policy that
has kept him (Saddam Hussein) contained."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Businessmen Raps EU Anti-Dumping Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian businessmen Tuesday
threatened to stop or reduce trade with six European countries
that have approved anti-dumping duties on Egypt's cotton exports.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting at the Egyptian Businessmen Society,
representatives from different business groups said this step is
also meant to preempt imposition of anti-dumping duties on other
Egyptian products.
</P>
<P>
France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Italy and Greece have planned
to levy a 20 percent anti-dumping tax on imports of unbleached
cotton fabrics from Egypt, "without backing up the claim with firm
evidence," Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the business people said they support Egypt's
participation in bilateral and multilateral pacts to boost the
openness of the country's economy and accelerate the switch from
aid to partnership.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Egypt's entrepreneurs proposed that an
industrial fund be set up to pay legal bills for defending
Egyptian firms accused of dumping. They also recommended the
government reduce imports from the six European Union (EU)
countries.
</P>
<P>
Some participants even called on the government to ban the
import of genetically-altered seeds from Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU has issued over 2,000 resolutions on imposing
anti-dumping taxes against different countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The resolutions have obvious political dimensions," said Ahmed
Izz, head of the Egyptian Federation of Industries.
</P>
<P>
The EU is expected to issue a final verdict in September on
whether or not the anti-dumping tariff will be imposed on Egypt's
cotton fabrics, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's annual imports from the EU averaged 5 billion
U.S. dollars, while exports were about 1.7 billion dollars, of
which oil products alone account for more than 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exports about 20,000 tonnes a year of unbleached cotton
worth about 147,000 dollars, an industry official has said.
</P>
<P>
Under EU anti-dumping rules, the European Commission may of its
own accord impose provisional anti-dumping duties for six months
on goods it deems as unfairly low-priced in the EU market.
</P>
<P>
After that, the commission may ask for definitive duties for
five years, but needs the approval of a majority of EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
Seven countries are opposed to the anti-dumping fees, namely,
Germany, Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and
Finland.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is Africa's largest cotton producer. Its exports have
boomed on the back of poor harvests elsewhere and strong global
demand.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gov't Plans Introduction of New 20 Dlr Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The newly designed 20 U.S.
dollar bill will go into circulation from September 24, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new bill, like the revamped 100 dollar and 50 dollar notes
before it, is aimed at making it tougher for computer-savvy
counterfeiters to produce highly deceptive fakes.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department is launching a public campaign to make
sure people can tell between bonafide and bogus bills.
</P>
<P>
The new notes, with a larger and off-center portrait of Andrew
Jackson, the nation's seventh president, on the front. The north
side of the White House will appear on the reverse, and the
denomination will appear in large dark numerals on a light
background, to help people with poor vision.
</P>
<P>
The new notes will replace the old notes, which also depict
Jackson on the front, and the South side of the White House on the
back, as they wear out. That should take about two years. However,
Rubin stressed that the old notes always will remain legal tender.
</P>
<P>
The government issued new 100 dollar notes, with Benjamin
Franklin, in March 1996 and new 50 dollar notes, with Ulysses S.
Grant, in October 1997. It plans to simultaneously introduce a new
10 dollar and a new 5 dollar notes and, after that, a more
modestly designed 1 dollar notes.
</P>
<P>
The new 100 dollar, 50 dollar and 20 dollar notes all have a
watermark in the shape of the portrait, visible when the bills are
held to the light. They have an embedded plastic security thread
that glows under ultraviolet light, red for the 100 dollar notes,
yellow for the 50 dollar and green for the 20 dollar notes.
</P>
<P>
And the numeral in the lower right corner of each
denomination's face is printed in color-shifting ink. It looks
green when viewed straight on and black when viewed from an
angle.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Index Continues Falling, Sign of Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A key gauge of future economic
activity fell in June for the second month in a row, signaling a
further slowing of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a private business research group here,
reported today that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators for
June stood at 105, down 0.2 percent from the previous month. The
decline was in line with economists' expectations, but sent Wall
Street stocks sliding.
</P>
<P>
While the report pointed toward a cooling of an economy that is
in the eighth year of an expansion, it said it is premature to say
a recession is looming.
</P>
<P>
Despite that caution, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
nearly 300 points at the closing.
</P>
<P>
The index slipped 0.1 percent in May. Earlier, the board had
reported it held steady during that month.
</P>
<P>
The group officials indicated that the slowdown in the economy
measured by other indicators for the second quarter will continue.
</P>
<P>
The leading index is designed to forecast economic activity six
to nine months in advance.
</P>
<P>
The leading index operates from a base of 100, set in 1992.
First calculated in the late 1960s, it is periodically fine-tuned
and figures from past years are revised.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States is watching
closely the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is
hoping to discuss with regional African governments how to prevent
a growing revolt against Congolese President Laurent Kabila from
widening, the White House said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Congolese Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji,
Rwandan-backed ethnic Tutsi elements spearheading a revolt in the
army had held part of the eastern town of Bukavu, on the border
with Rwanda. Fighting was reported in several towns in the country
and army rebels hijacked a plane Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the Congo is something we are watching very
carefully," White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said. "We are in
touch with several governments in the region to assess what is
going on there and what we can do to prevent a widening of this
situation."
</P>
<P>
Kaliba vowed at a crisis meeting in Kinshasa Monday to use
military force against the revolt, which started with overnight
shooting in the capital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I think we would encourage President Kabila to reach out to
all segments of Congolese society to try to resolve the ethnic
differences that have bubbled up in the last few days," Crowley
said.

BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The remains of Lin Ti-chuan, a

Representatives from the mortuary suggested that the casket
bearing Lin's remains be shipped by air from Beijing to Kaohsiung,
via Macao. However, Lin's relatives insisted the remains should be
transported via Hong Kong so as to ensure its return to Kaohsiung
before dusk on Saturday in accordance with Taiwan's custom.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules German Soccer Hooligans Return to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A court in Doual of France on Wednesday ordered
a German soccer fan suspected of attacking on a French policeman during the
World Cup to go back to jail, overturning an earlier decision freeing the young
man.
</P>
<P>
Karl-Heinz Elschner is one of six suspects arrested in connection with the
June 21 attack on Daniel Nivel, 44, who spent six weeks in a coma, gaining
consciousness on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Elschner was placed under investigation for attempted homicide, then freed
June 29 after his lawyer successfully argued that authorities may have
misidentified his client.
</P>
<P>
In the succession of legal moves, the prosecutor's office then appealed the
decision to free Elschner, opening the way for Wednesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered Elschner behind bars because it feared he would not show
up for an eventual hearing before the two witnesses who identified him,
according to his attorney, Eric Dupont-Moretti.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Increase Defense Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' House of Representatives
(Parliament) Wednesday approved a government-tabled bill to
increase defense levy from now 3 percent to 4 percent, to meet
defense needs.
</P>
<P>
The controversial bill was approved by a majority vote in the
56-member House, and the increase runs from the beginning of this
month.
</P>
<P>
Two separate amendments, put forward by opposition Working
People's Progressive Party (AKEL) and the government-partner the
United Democrats, were rejected.
</P>
<P>
One amendment is for the contribution to be levied according to
income, and the other, for a 1 percentage point increase in the
Value Added Tax to cover defense needs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the approval, House Speaker Spyros Kyprianou
said the outcome of the voting "sends the message that the people
of Cyprus and their representatives are determined to back all
efforts for the island's defense, for as along as Turkey continues
to occupy part of Cyprus and continues its threats and the ethnic
cleansing policy."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou, who watched the House
plenary session, said the decision showed "the political
leadership fully backs ... the continuous upgrading of our
National Guard's capability, increasing our defense ability and
reinforcing our position at intercommunal talks."
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou welcomed the
outcome of the voting, noting that this will increase the Defense
Fund's income by around 40 million Cyprus pounds (about 80 million
U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a 425-million-dollar deal with Russia last year
to buy S-300 anti-aircraft missile system to boost its defense
capability.
</P>
<P>
The deal triggered criticism from the U.S. and some other
western countries. Turkey has threatened to take all necessary
measures to prevent the deployment of the missiles in the south of
the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained a 35,000-strong armed force in the
northern part of the island.

LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- English 400-meter runner Solomon
Wariso, who had been banned for three months in 1994, was cleared
here on Wednesday to compete at the Commonwealth Games after
winning his appeal against a drug ban.

Wariso was suspended for three months in 1994 after testing
positive for ephedrine at the European Championships. He was sent

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The joint Saudi-Yemeni
military committee discussed a number of contentious border issues
during its third session Wednesday in Riyadh, capital of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency quoted informed political sources as saying
the committee, which began its meeting Tuesday, has focused on
consolidating stability in the controversial Red Sea island,
Duwaima.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes broke out on the island on July 19 between Saudi

one officer was captured in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The joint military committee had been formed in accordance
with a 1995 memorandum of understanding to settle border disputes
between them.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the committee sought to take political steps
to avoid recurrence of any skirmishes, and discussed deploying joint
patrols to prevent any armed clashes along the dividing line on
Duwaima island.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors on the Arabian peninsula share a
2,000-kilometer common border and have a decades-old dispute over
three Red Sea islands and part of the desert region, where huge
oil reserves are expected, between them.

WUHAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Water levels in the middle reaches
of the Yangtze River continue to rise and are exerting even
greater pressure on levees in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, which has witnessed the heaviest flooding this decade
due to heavy rain since late June, has mobilized over one million

<P>
PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- France Wednesday expressed its
regret over what it called "growing instability" in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo) and called for a return to calm as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We are following very closely the evolution of the situation,"
said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She also suggested that French nationals should not go to D.R.
Congo for the time being, but excluded an evacuation of the 1,200
French nationals from that country.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Kinshasa seems calm now. The fighting which
went on there did not reach the districts where most of the
French (living in Congo) reside," she said.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi Banyamulenge soldiers started a rebellion in the capital
Kinshasa and the eastern provinces of Nord-Kivu and Sud-Kivu on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and the government of President
Laurent-Desire Kabila remained cool since the latter came to power
by toppling Mobutu Sese Seko 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
France also has trouble in improving its relations with
D.R.Congo's new rival Rwanda, which accused Paris of backing the
country's former Hutu military regime before and during the 1994
genocide against Tutsis.

Patrick Kluivert turned down a nine million pound (14.63 million

Ferguson was critical of Kluivert's conduct during negotiations

"Maybe he doesn't know how big Manchester United is," Ferguson
said. "I am very surprised he has not given himself the

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- After one month of operations,
Hong Kong's Customs and Excise and Immigration departments said
Wednesday that their services at the new Hong Kong International
Airport at Chek Lap Kok are better and more efficient than at the
old airport of Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
Customs and Excise staff have continued to meet their
performance pledge of clearing all passengers within 15 minutes,
except those stopped for a secondary inspection.
</P>
<P>
Cargo clearance operations have improved greatly thanks to a
new computer system - the Air Cargo Clearance System (ACCS).
</P>
<P>
"There has been a marked improvement in clearing air cargo
manifests and sending customs clearance instructions to cargo
operators," said Chief Superintendent Lawrence Wong Sau-pui, head
of airport command of the Customs and Excise Department.
</P>
<P>
"Previously it was practically impossible to clear the cargo
manifest of a flight prior to its arrival and we could only manage
to clear the cargo manifest of each flight within 45 minutes of
receipt of the cargo manifest at Kai Tak," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the new airport we have been able to clear the manifests of
about 25 percent of incoming flights before landing and to send
customs clearance instructions to the majority of the remaining
flights within 20 minutes after receiving and verifying the
accuracy of a cargo manifest, " he added.
</P>
<P>
This great improvement has been made possible by the ACCS which
provides an electronic link between the Customs and Excise
Department and the six air cargo operators to facilitate the
transfer of cargo data and
clearance instructions.
</P>
<P>
"The ACCS has allowed the four express cargo operators (DHL,
UPS, TNT and Federal Express) to clear their air cargo very
efficiently which has resulted in a much higher throughput than
expected," Wong said.

<P>
Figures show that 90 percent of air cargo is being cleared
within 20 minutes upon request, compared to within 60 minutes at
Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Department figures available for the first two
weeks of operations show that 99.5 percent of passengers cleared
immigration within 15 minutes, while 100 percent were processed
within 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
This compares to 95.7 percent clearance within 15 minutes at
Kai Tak for the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason is that manning levels have been increased by
about 30 percent at peak hours. We have about 60 staff in the
departures hall and 85 in the arrivals hall during busy periods,"
said Senior Principal Immigration Officer Henry Siu of the
Immigration Department's Airport Division.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet received any negative comments about our
service. However, we have had some positive feedback that the
courtesy of our staff has much improved and that passengers
appreciate their politeness."
</P>
<P>
Airport Authority figures show that over the past month, the
new airport has handled an average of 87,000 passengers and 460
flights a day. The busiest day was July 20 when there were 510
flights and 97,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, almost 70 percent of flights have left on
time or within 15 minutes of their scheduled departure, while
about 83 percent have left within 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Passengers are waiting an average of less than 15 minutes to
reclaim their luggage, which is often on the baggage carousel by
the time visitors clear Immigration.
</P>
<P>
The first pieces of luggage on some flights have been on
baggage carousels within two to five minutes of the aircraft
arriving at the terminal.
</P>
<P>
Cargo throughput also improved - from 2,700 tons a day on July
14 to 4,700 tons on August 2. The average daily throughput from
July 14 to August 2 was 3,535 tons compared to the 1997 daily
average of 4,892 tons at Kai Tak.

NICOSIA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is promoting a plan to
turn the island into an international information center and a
bridge between Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Finance Minister Christodoulos
Christodoulou at a press conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the success of the plan will depend on the response of
the private sector, which is urged to "utilize the opportunities"
that arise in the framework of the information society.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said the advanced sectors of information and
telecommunication of the island will back up the national strategy
to create the information society.
</P>
<P>
He did not further elaborate the plan.

The Minister said the Cypriot government is also promoting a
plan to computerize the whole public sector, a step which will

</P>
<P>
Referring to the "Millennium Bomb," or the inability of some
computers to distinguish the year 2000 from 00, or 1900 when the
year comes, Christodoulou said that most public services in Cyprus
will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed the need to create the necessary
awareness and provide all possible assistance to enterprises to
deal with the problem in an efficient manner.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 440,000 community service
centers in Chinese cities had hired over 1.38 million people by
the end of 1997. with some 5.47 million urban volunteers engaged
in free community service activities, according to the Ministry of
Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
China introduced community service to cities and towns
nationwide in the early 1990s. The main goal of community centers
is providing families with convenient services at a reasonable
rate, with services ranging from housework and maintenance to
escorting children to school.
</P>
<P>
Community service agencies also provide free services for
senior citizens lacking family support, as well as disabled
individuals and the families of soliders and revolutionary
martyrs. Related services make community life more interesting and
colorful, and help improve relations between residents, according
to the government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to
developing the community service sector in recent years, with
extensive media coverage on the issue attracting an increasing
number of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists note that community services not only make life
easier for busy urban residents with little time for household
chores, but also create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
They estimate that an average annual growth rate of 15 percent
will enable China's community service sector to provide 1.7
million jobs each year.

"intensive care unit", the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Industrialists who had attacked the increase saying it would
raise overall production costs, hailed the suspension decision by
the government.
</P>
<P>
John Makamure, chief economist of the National Chamber of
Commerce, said the chamber welcome the suspension as the hike
would have had a devastating impact on commerce and industry.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the decision very much because electricity is a
major component in any production process and input costs were
going to rise rapidly," said Makamure.
</P>
<P>
He urged that cabinet critically review the increase and come
up with a justifiable increase that would not seriously affect
consumers, especially industrialists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nick Swanepoel, president of Commercial Farmers
Union, said the 37.5 percent hike would have been unbearable to
farmers in the face of other viability problems in the production
of other commodities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cities Encouraged to Develop Community Services (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Governments at all levels nationwide have painstakingly
attempted to persuade some 10 million laid-off workers, most of
whom lost their jobs due to economic difficulties of their state
employers, to turn to the community services for a living.
</P>
<P>
In July, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
announced that laid-off workers engaged in community services
would be exempt from management fees for three years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs show that
value-added of China's community services sector accounts for a
mere two percent of Gross Domestic Product, with the sector
contributing only 1.7 percent of the country's overall employment.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Youth League of China, the world's largest youth
organization with some 68 million members, also encourages the
country's younger generation to provide voluntary community
services.
</P>
<P>
"Volunteering will help them establish virtue based on altruism
and dedication," according to one league official.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs today recognized 46 districts
from 31 cities as "National Model City Districts for Community
Service."
</P>
<P>
An unnamed ministry official said the city districts not only
feature complete community service facilities, but have also
succeeded in providing new jobs for laid-off workers and have
developed wide-ranging services to help needy people.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that other cities and towns will follow suit in order
to add more impetus to the development of community services in
China," said the official.

<HEADLINE> Feerick Backs up NBA Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Arbitrator John Feerick ruled
Tuesday that he has jurisdiction on a grievance filed by the NBA
Players Association that calls for players to receive their
guaranteed salaries despite the lockout imposed by owners.
</P>
<P>
The NBPA filed a grievance with Feerick on June 30 on behalf of
players with guaranteed contracts for the upcoming season. The
union contended the NBA would be in breach of contract if it
failed to make scheduled payments due during a lockout, which
owners imposed the following day.
</P>
<P>
Once the collective bargaining agreement expired, the NBA
argued in U.S. District Court in New York that Feerick could not
have jurisdiction over the grievance because his term as
independent arbitrator had ended.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, Feerick issued a decision that he had preliminary
jurisdiction to rule on the grievance and scheduled a hearing for
both sides 10 days later. NBA attorneys unsuccessfully sought a
stay of the hearing, then did not attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ruling by Feerick paves the way for him to determine
the validity of the grievance sought by the Players Association,
who continue to test the seemingly elastic boundaries of
guaranteed contracts.
</P>
<P>
"I have considered the issues involving my jurisdiction to hear
the underlying dispute and the arbitrability of that dispute,"
Feerick wrote in his decision. "I find that I have such
jurisdiction and that the dispute is arbitrable. In so finding,
however, I express no view of the merits of the underlying
dispute."
</P>
<P>
The ruling by Feerick comes two days before attorneys for the
NBA and the union are to resume collective bargaining." The
important thing is that the NBA owners will not be able to delay
this case through the court system, but instead, will have to
plead their case expeditiously before the arbitrator," NBPA
executive director Billy Hunter said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Eleven players were named in the grievance the union filed on
behalf of more than 200 players whose pay schedules would be
affected by a lockout. The list includes Boston Celtics guard
Kenny Anderson, who was to receive his entire 5.8 million U.S.
dollars salary for next season on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Other players are scheduled to receive similar payments this
summer, but the NBA maintained it is under no obligation to pay
the salaries.
</P>
<P>
Feerick asked both sides to contact him to schedule a hearing
date.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon Otto hit land along the
east China coast early this morning and by early tomorrow morning
is expected to move inland and threaten Anhui Province with the
heaviest flooding this year.
</P>
<P>
Anhui officials televised an emergency conference today in an
effort to mobilize local residents to work even harder to protect
Yangtze River levees which have faced a serious threat since the
beginning of summer.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in the Anhui section of the Yangtze have exceeded
warning marks for 40 consecutive days and above the 1954 record
level for seven days running. The water level at Anqing hit 18.4
meters by 08:00 this morning, some 2.32 meters above the warning
mark, but 0.34 of a meter below the 1954 record.
</P>
<P>
Otto is expected to bring rain storms which will exacerbate the
threat of floods along both the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers.
</P>
<P>
Local residents are maintaining a constant vigil on Yangtze
levees dykes. The State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters plans to send a large shipment of flood relief
materials to Anhui later this evening.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts National Flood Control Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
today warned that flood control efforts in China have entered a
critical stage, and demanded that Chinese Communist Party
committees and governments at all levels spare no effort to combat
the worst floods in four decades.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who also heads the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, made the remarks during the third plenary meeting of
the department which is responsible for flood control along the
Yangtze River and in north China, as well as combating the effects
of typhoons in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Wen briefed participants on the national flood situation and
noted that flood control along the Yangtze has entered the most
critical stage this year. He said continuing heavy rain in the
upper reaches of the river has spawned the fourth flood crest
which is rapidly approaching the middle and lower reaches, and
noted that typhoons in the latter areas are expected to cause even
great problems.
</P>
<P>
North China has also entered the normal flood season, said Wen,
adding that windstorms and rainstorms are expected to hit coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters has called for ensuring the integrity of
Yangtze levees, and guaranteeing the safety of major cities and
people. Wen called for special emphasis on the middle and lower
reaches of Yangtze, and urged northern regions to prepare for
major flooding and coastal areas to remain alert for typhoons.
</P>
<P>
Wen pointed out that main levees, major cities, transportation
trunks, and the well-being of people living along the Yangtze have
been well protected thanks to the combined efforts of the Party
Central Committee, the State Council, soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the first Law on Flood Control, which went
into effect earlier this year, stipulates severe punishment for
acts of dereliction of duty and ineffective leadership. Endithem

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Suspends Repatriation of D.R.Congolese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) - The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has suspended the repatriation
of refugees from western Tanzania to the Democratic Republic of
Congo (D.R.Congo) following an army rebellion in the east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the UNHCR Branch Office in Dar es Salaam said
that some 700 refugees were scheduled to be repatriated Wednesday
aboard the Ship Mv Mwongozo to the Lake Tanganyika Port of Baraka
in the D.R.Congo, but the trip was cancelled after being adviced
by the UNHCR office at Uvira in the D.R.Congo.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Wednesday that there has been no report of
any new arrival of refugees from D.R.Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We are closely monitoring the situation in that area and we
have made appropriate preparations," they said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53,971 Congolese refugees had been voluntarily
repatriated from the UNHCR camps in western Tanzania since the
operation began last September till the end of July.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, some 48,000 Congolese refugees
still remain in Tanzania, waiting for repatriation to their home
country.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese refugees have crossed the border to the western
areas of Tanzania since late 1996, fleeing a civil war between
rebels led by Laurent Kabila, now president of D.R.Congo, and the
Zairean army of former President Mobutu Sese-Seko who died later
in exile in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR report said that as of June 30 this year, Tanzania
accommodates a total of 331,538 refugees from neighbouring
D.R.Congo, Burundi, Rwanda and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here said Kabila's government
Tuesday urged its neighbors to resist the temptation to involve
themselves in the army revolt.
</P>
<P>
Kabila vowed Monday at a crisis meeting in capital Kinshasa to
use military force against the revolt which started with
overnight shooting in the capital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from seven southern and central African countries are
planning to meet Saturday in Zimbabwe for a summit on the latest
situation in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is expected to host his
counterparts from D.R.Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and
Namibia in the resort town of Victoria Falls.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa Tuesday held brief talks in
Mwanza, north Tanzania, with visiting Vice-President Paul Kagame
of Rwanda. Rwanda has denied any involvement in the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers in Goma and Bukavu in the east of D.R.Congo bordering
with Rwanda announced their revolt over local radio stations
Sunday and Monday and urged Congolese citizens to rise up against
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> China Battles Relics Smuggling (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to the Museum of Chinese
History now have the opportunity to view a 1,000-year-old carved
head which only two years was pilfered from a stone statue
and smuggled to the United States via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the ancient relic, which weighs 400 pounds, was sold
in a San Francisco auction for 45,000 US dollars. US law
enforcement agencies complied with Chinese government demands and
confiscated the relic, which was returned to China on June 23, a
few days in advance of President Clinton's recent visit.
</P>
<P>
"The statue can never be restored to its original state,"
according to archeologists.
</P>
<P>
The stone relic is currently on display at the ongoing 20-day
anti-smuggling exhibition in Beijing. The exhibition, jointly
sponsored by the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, Ministry of
Public Security and General Administration of Customs, also
features a number of ancient relics returned three months ago from
Britain. Pottery and porcelain pieces account for the bulk of over
3,000 items on display.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qinghai, an official with the General Administration of
Customs, noted the situation involving relics smuggling has
intensified since foreign dealers are seeking even greater profits.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs departments cracked down more than 600 cases of
relics smuggling in 1997, with related actions leading to the
confiscation of over 11,200 items. The departments solved 12 cases
involving more than 370 relics during the first half of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Risk of Recession Grows In Britain: Forecasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) - Britain's leading economic
forecasters have painted a bleak picture of the country's economic
prospects, increasing the pressure on the Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) to hold interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The London Business School (LBS) said Tuesday that the
government's failure to co-ordinate monetary and fiscal policy had
increased the risks of recession in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The LBS predicted UK economic growth would slow to 2.2 percent
this year and to 1.3 percent in 1999, before picking up again in
2000.
</P>
<P>
It said there was no need for another rate rise, and argued
that the MPC's actions would cause growth to slow by more than
necessary to meet the inflation target.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Oxford Economic Forecasting (OEF) predicted that
the manufacturing recession would deepen, and said the likely
length and depth of the recession depended on the actions of the
MPC.
</P>
<P>
OEF predicted that the UK services sector would grow at a
robust four percent in 1998, but the growth rate should slow to
2.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for manufacturing, by contrast, was far more
gloomy, with output predicted to fall by 0.5 percent this year, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Growing concerns about the risk of a recession in Britain have
prompted speculation that the MPC will keep interest rates on hold
this week for a second consecutive month.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Announces New Export, Import Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government
Wednesday announced new export and import policies to further
liberalize the country's external business, with a view to
narrowing down the existing trade deficit by earning more from
export.
</P>
<P>
Exporters will be able to export products without any letter of
credit (LC), but furnishing buying contract, purchase orders or
advance payment papers, according to the new export policy.
</P>
<P>
The import regime will be also further liberalized allowing
export-oriented units to import machinery and raw materials
without opening any LC to facilitate export.
</P>
<P>
Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael Ahmed formally unveiled
the policies at a news conference here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The new policies were designed to boost export and consolidate
and diversify the country's industrial base, he said. "Both
policies will have a five-year duration with effect from this year
to June 2002", but the government "may review the orders every
year and make necessary changes," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is for the first time the government is offering
five-year export and import policies to enable businessmen and
investors to make long-term investment decisions," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that the new policies would protect the
interests of domestic industry while further simplify the
procurement process of raw materials for export units.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of five-year policies is a shift from earlier
practice of the government which traditionally formulated export
and import policies every two years.
</P>
<P>
The export policy, which envisages a growth target of 12 to 13
percent during the next five years, offers a number of incentives
to boost export income and diversify the export base.
</P>
<P>
The new import policy will further liberalize the import regime
which will ultimately benefit the export industries while keeping
the list of restricted items almost the same in the new policy.
</P>
<P>
The private sector will be allowed to import petroleum
products, but not the items imported by the Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The import policy also restricts the import of granular
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the import of shrimp spawn and fry is restricted in
the policy.
</P>
<P>
The new policies accord a special favor to leather and leather
products, new and high value-added ready-made garments, computer
and agro-processing, treating them as thrust sectors deserving
great incentives.

The examination of the head is necessary to establish the cause
of death because the head, heart and lungs are the three most
important organs to support people's life, Zuo explained.
</P>
<P>
Lin's family, however, submitted a written application Tuesday
asking that her head and genitals not be examined in the autopsy
process.
</P>
<P>
After taking into consideration the family's appeal, the
forensic experts responsible for the autopsy decided to adopt the
NMR as a compromise to examine Lin's head, according to Zuo.
</P>
<P>
But the NMR is only a partial measure and cannot entirely
replace a full examination, he said, adding that Lin's family has
stated that they will not complain if the NMR cannot establish a
cause of death.
</P>
<P>
Liu Gangqi, deputy secretary general of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, said the examination of Lin's
body was conducted in accordance with the concerned laws and
regulations while fully taking into account her family's wishes.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt. Urged to Save Textile Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's textile operators have
urged the government to take urgent steps to save the
"endangered" sector from extinction.
</P>
<P>
Victor Eburabjolo, the new chairman og_the Nigerian Textile
Manufacturers Association (NTMA), disclosed at a news conference
recently that its members have retrenched about 114,000 workers
in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
According to Eburabjolo, the textile association with about
100 members in 1995 has lost 40 percent of its members while the
total work force of the industry has dropped from 250,000 to
136,000.
</P>
<P>
The chairman warned that more workers might be laid off unless
the government takes urgent steps to create an enabling
environment for the growth of the sector.
</P>
<P>
Eburajolo blamed the government for years of insensitivity to
the potentials of the industry as a non-oil foreign exchange
earner and employer of labor.
</P>
<P>
He identified poor infrastructure facilities, incessant power
outage and persistent fuel scarcity as major threats to the
textile industry.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation of Nigerian currency Naira, devaluation of
the French Franc, massive smuggling and dumping by foreign
producers were also identified as factors militating against the
country's textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Eburajolo said the devaluation of the French Franc has, to a
large extent, robbed the Nigerian textile companies of the west
African markets.
</P>
<P>
"The era of our textile dominance of the ECOWAS (the Economic
Community of West African States) market is gone, as most traders
and customers consider African prints from Nigeria very costly,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman claimed that with added incentives and government
support, the association's member companies could employ about
400,000 Nigerians and attain a production level of 50 billion
meters of cloth per year.

<HEADLINE> China Battles Relics Smuggling (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Unscrupulous criminals smuggle relics through a variety of
channels, including tourists, shipping containers and mail,"
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Guangzhou customs departments confiscated 110
fossils of elephants and mammoth which roamed the earth some three
million years ago. Smugglers frequently used express mail services
to ship items from the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that domestic and international smugglers
have formed alliances in smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials thwarted three attempts by a Beijing
foreign trade company to smuggle 5,600 pieces of relics during
1997 alone, with 80 percent of the items involved listed under
state protection.
</P>
<P>
Kong Xiangxing, deputy curator with the Museum of Chinese
History, noted that the illegal excavation of tombs and relics is
extremely serious in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and
central China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"Remote sensing technology has enabled China to map groups of
tombs built over 500 years ago, with satellite photographs clearly
showing extensive points of illegal entry.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists stress that more protection should be placed on
historical sites and cultural relics, and continually remind
people that value of relics is beyond duplication.
</P>
<P>
China's anti-smuggling campaign, just as the battle against
drugs, remains as an urgent and difficult task in the face of
well-equipped smugglers. The Ministry of Public Security and
General Administration of Customs have expressed their
determination to strengthen management and halt relics smuggling
attempts within China.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges U.S. to Announce Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Wednesday urged the United States to publicize its
peace plan as soon as possible in order to save the stalled Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made this request in a statement before presenting his
new cabinet lineups to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Arafat briefed the PLC members the current
peace talks with Israel, saying the peace talks have not achieved
progress due to Israel's headline policy.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also urged the European Union states, the Arab world
and other countries who care about the Middle East peace process
to make real efforts to save it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan calls on Israel to pullout its troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank territories during the second stage troop
redeployment. It was accepted by the Palestinians but rejected by
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. still refuses to announce the plan due to the pressure
from Israel although the plan was leaked to the press in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis started their direct talks in
July 19. Israel proposed to pull out from 13 percent West Bank
territories, but insisted that 3 percent of which being turned
into "nature reserves."
</P>
<P>
This has been rejected by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition to Issue No-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's opposition parties are
likely to propose a no-confidence motion against the current
cabinet, Chingchai Mongkoltham, the opposition chief whip, said in
the parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the move of the opposition came after the government's
failure to address the country's economic woes after being in
power for eight months.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest estimation of the government Monday,
the Thai economy will experience a 6 to 7 percent contraction in
1998, much worse than the previous estimated 4 to 5.5 percent
shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
Chingchai, deputy leader of the New Aspiration Party, the
country's largest political party, said that the opposition is
gathering ammunition for the censure motion.
</P>
<P>
Among key issues providing ammunition would be the government's
alleged failure to revive the economy, rising prices and
unemployment, alleged irregularities in a multi-billion-baht
synchronous digital hierarchy project to set up a nationwide fiber
optics network.
</P>
<P>
If proposed, the motion will be the second of its kind the
opposition ever issued against the current coalition headed by
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Democrat Party. The first
no-confidence motion was proposed in March but vetoed in the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Envoy Appeals for Lifting of Sanction on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese ambassador to
Tanzania Kuol Alor Wednesday appealed to the international
community to help mediate the conflict in his country and lift
economic sanctions for the transportation of relief goods.
</P>
<P>
Holding a press conference at the Sudanese embassy in Dar es
Salaam, Alor said Tanzania has a role to play in mediating the
conflict as it is a member of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
All African countries have a responsibility in maintaining
peace on the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He compared the trouble in Sudan to the problems in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, which should be a concern of all
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the Sudanese government unilaterally
announced a ceasefire Tuesday on the eve of a three-day peace
talks with the rebel force, the Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has been waging war for greater autonomy for the
southern areas of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government's ceasefire announcement is aimed at creating a
conducive atmosphere for the peace talks and ensuring the flow of
relief goods to the south where a lot of people have died of
famine because of ravaging wars and inadequacy of relief and aid
by the international community, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The ceasefire is not a maneuver," he said, noting that the
government wishes to reaffirm its position of making peace in the
country as the perennial wars have brought a great deal of agony
to people.
</P>
<P>
"We have to have peace in Sudan," he said, hoping that the
rebel movement will reciprocate to cease fire permanently.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the rebel force to abide by the constitution
passed in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ambassador appealed to the international
parties which initiated unilateral economic boycott measures
against Sudan to lift the embargo because it made it difficult
for the government to procure spare parts to keep railways
running, which is crucial to transportation of relief goods.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Election Committee Announces Initial Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian National
Election Committee (NEC) on Wednesday finished verification of
preliminary results of the July 26 election amid mounting
complaints by some political parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the results, the ruling Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) of incumbent co-premier Hun Sen won more than 4.9 million
votes, to be followed by Funcinpec of Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
with 1.55 million votes, and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP), with about 690,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
Specific seats for each party in the National Assembly were not
given. But by using the NEC allocation formula, the CPP would get
64 seats, while Funcinpec and the SRP would get 43 seats and 15
seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
The other 36 parties campaigning in the election get no seats.
</P>
<P>
Final results and the official allocation of seats are expected
in late August.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, failing to acquire the required two-thirds majority,
or 82 seats in the National Assembly, will have to form a
coalition with Funcinpec or the SRP, or both.
</P>
<P>
Some political parties led by the SRP beefed up their campaign
against the election, which they said was rife with "fraud" and
"irregularities".
</P>
<P>
They said they would not accept the result unless votes were
recounted in some disputed constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The NEC has set up a special panel to deal with the complaints,
and the Constitutional Council will give the final verdict before
releasing the final results and allocating parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
The new National Assembly is supposed to convene on September
24 before the new government forms in early October.

<HEADLINE> Bills Submitted to Japan's Parliament Over Banking Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government and the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday submitted to
the Diet (parliament) six bills aimed to build a "bridge bank"
system and rid the country of a banking mess, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The government wants the Diet to pass the bills as quickly as
possible, but it remains to be seen whether it can persuade the
opposition to support the bills without changing key provisions,
political sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bridge bank bill will allow the government to put failing
banks under state control for a period of up to five years.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to prevent bank failures from triggering
defaults on deposits, general panic, severing of credit to healthy
corporate borrowers and increased unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Another government bill suggests creating a committee of experts
under the Prime Minister's Office to untangle a problem of multiple
claims on collateral behind problem loans.
</P>
<P>
The four other bills were drafted by legislators of the LDP with
the aim to stabilize the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
The leading opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DJP) has
already objected to the bridge bank plan, saying the process would
be tantamount to a bailout of banks and construction companies,
major bank borrowers and LDP supporters.
</P>
<P>
Although the LDP holds a majority in the House of Representatives
(lower house), the opposition camp controls the House of Councillors
(upper house).
</P>
<P>
To enable the bills clear both houses of the Diet, the LDP may
be forced to make substantial concessions to the opposition with
revisions of the bills, political sources said.

MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Uzbekistan have urged
the warring factions in Afghanistan to settle their differences
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released late Tuesday in Tashkent, the
Uzbek capital, the two countries said they were "deeply concerned
over escalation of bloodshed on the Afghan soil".
</P>
<P>
The document came after talks between Russian First Deputy
Defense Minister and Chief of General Staff of the Russian Armed
Forces Anatoly Kvashnin and Uzbek Defense Minister Hikmatulla
Tursunov, and Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban movement should immediately terminate military
activities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Russian and Uzbek representatives are prepared to immediately
meet representatives of the warring sides so as to prevent further
escalation of military activities in the north of Afghanistan and
promote a quick settlement of the Afghan crisis."
</P>
<P>
The two sides also threatened "all necessary measures to
strengthen security of external borders" as current developments
in Afghanistan "might directly jeopardize security and national
interests of Russia, Uzbekistan and other Central Asian states".
</P>
<P>
They also expressed worry over the reduced presence in
Afghanistan of the United Nations and other international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The will of the Afghan people seeking territorial integrity
of the country, national accord and settlement of internal
problems by peaceful means has been openly ignored," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Civil war has been raging in Afghanistan follow the withdrawal
in 1989 of Soviet troops, which occupied the country from 1979.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Speaker Calls for Freezing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly Chairman
(Parliament Speaker) Saadoun Hammadi Wednesday urged the
government to freeze relations with the U.N. Special Commission
on disarming Iraq, known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi made the appeal when addressing a special session of
the parliament, which is considering Iraq's relationship with
UNSCOM after disarmament talks between UNSCOM and Iraq broke down
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a resolution adopted last October by the
250-member parliament, which calls for suspending Iraq's relations
with UNSCOM if the latter fails to set a timetable for ending its
work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We see the (October) resolution should have been
implemented," he said, adding that "now we call for the
implementation."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hammadi reiterated that Iraq has fulfilled all
its obligations under relevant U.N. resolution and has destroyed
all its prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi said that UNSCOM "serves the U.S. policy of prolonging
sanctions" against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He called for the lifting of the trade embargo, which bans the
country from freely exporting oil, its main revenue-earn. The
embargo has been in place since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions on Iraq can not be lifted unless UNSCOM
verifies that Iraq has destroyed its chemical, biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's talks, UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler refused
to grant Iraq such a clean bill of health, citing he does not have
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership recently issued a number of statements
vowing to have the U.N. sanctions lifted within this year, and
threatening to adopt "alternative strategy" should its cooperation
with UNSCOM not lead to the lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Butler will report to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday on
the details of his talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, which Butler said "came to early end."

NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian army authorities said
the intensity of ongoing Pakistani shelling and firing on Indian
positions in north Kashmir was "unusual" as missiles were also
fired.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai, Malaysian Trade Bodies Sign Cooperation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Board of Trade
and Malaysia's National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NCCIM)
signed here Wednesday a cooperation agreement to enhance trade and
cooperation between the private sectors of both countries in all
sectors and industries.
</P>
<P>
"We, however, have already agreed in principle with Malaysia to
use own currencies in our bilateral trade," Vichien Tejapaibul,
chairman of Thailand's Board of Trade told reporters after the
signing.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is progressing towards use of the baht in its trade
with Malaysia, except for matters concerning interest rates and
credit risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand was waiting to discuss with Malaysia the
interest rate factor which posed quite a problem with the current
fluctuations in currency rates.
</P>
<P>
As for the credit risk, he said Thailand's Export-Import Bank,
Ministry of Finance and Bank of Thailand were working out things
to do away with the exchange risks.
</P>
<P>
As for enhancing cooperation, he said Thailand recommended
fishery as one of the areas to be explored by both countries due
to its potential and that Thailand was prepared to assist in terms
of technology.
</P>
<P>
NCCIM Vice President Paul Low on the occasion named services,
education and the automotive industry as among the sectors for
which cooperation could be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Low said, "We want concrete business and trade by implementing
some strategies that both governments have agreed."
</P>
<P>
On the current economic turmoil, Vichien said that it was not
fair to blame Thailand for the regional problem.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes this to happen but the only way is to improve our
 economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
From January to May 1998, bilateral trade between Malaysia and
Thailand stood at 7.6 billion ringgit (1.844 billion U.S. dollars)
in Malaysia's favor.

<HEADLINE> HK's Control Measures Against EV-71 Effective: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The threat of a major outbreak
of enterovirus infections in Hong Kong would be most unlikely due
to the effective control measures instituted by the
Inter-departmental Working Group on EV-71, a health official said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Paul Saw, Deputy Director of Health of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said Wednesday after the third
meeting of the working group that he was confident that through
the concerted efforts of the SAR government, the medical
profession, the media and the general public, cases of enterovirus
infections in Hong Kong can continue to be kept at a low level.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by Saw, the meeting was attended by representatives
from the Health and Welfare Bureau, Education Department, Social
Welfare Department, Urban Services Department, Regional Services
Department, Information Services Department, Department of Health
and Hospital Authority.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at Wednesday's meeting that from mid-August the
government will specially distribute a total of 1.2 million
leaflets on the hand-foot-mouth disease to students in
kindergartens, primary and secondary schools as part of its
protective measures to prevent the spread of enterovirus
infections.
</P>
<P>
Special attention will continue to be paid to hygiene measures
during stepped up inspection visits to child care centers,
schools, swimming pools and children's playrooms, Saw said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health (DH) had completed inspection of some
383 child care centers during which health advice on prevention of
enterovirus infections was given.
</P>
<P>
The Social Welfare Department has distributed leaflets to child
care centers. To ensure that the hygiene condition in child care
centers is maintained, the Social Welfare Department will step up
visits to these centers, Saw said.

JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government
Wednesday called on all countries not to interfere in the
internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement reaching here, the Namibian Foreign Ministry
urged all countries, particularly neighboring countries of the
DRC, to refrain from actions that would amount to interference in
the internal affairs of that country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the rebel forces, supported by Rwandan
troops, started a revolt in the army. The Rwandan mercenaries,
who helped bring DRC President Laurent Kabila to power a year
ago, turned on him after Kabila ordered them to leave the
country.

Saw said that the Education Department Tuesday organized two
more seminars on hand-foot-mouth disease for teachers and
principals of primary schools. The first two such seminars for
kindergartens were organized at the end of July and all four
seminars were well attended.
</P>
<P>
District Education Officers will pay special attention to
hygiene measures in school during their inspection visits.
</P>
<P>
At public swimming pools, the Urban Services Department and
Regional Services Department had strictly implemented the hourly
sampling of the pool water ensuring that the free residual
chlorine level is maintained at the level sufficient to kill the
virus, Saw said.
</P>
<P>
The Information Services Department had produced a new poster
on the hand-foot-mouth disease for distribution in addition to the
new TV and radio announcements of public interest on the subject,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Hospital Authority has been closely monitoring hospital
admissions due to hand-foot-mouth disease and complications
associated with enterovirus infections, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of hand-foot-mouth cases recorded at sentinel
centers (137) and in public hospitals (47) in the week ending
August 1 showed a downward trend.
</P>
<P>
As on Wednesday 40 confirmed cases of EV-71 and six suspected
cases were recorded. All patients had been discharged except for a
34-year-old man who developed complications of meningoencephalitis
and is in satisfactory condition in hospital, Saw said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Ranks Third in Exports to Iraq Under U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan sold 305.3 million U.S.
dollars worth of goods to Iraq, ranking the third after France and
Australia in exports to the sanction-ridden country under the
oil-for-food program, said an official report.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reached the agreement on the program with the United
Nations in 1996, which allows it to sell a limited amount of oil
in every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods. The deal began to be carried out in December that year.
</P>
<P>
The report issued here by the Jordanian Trade Center and
obtained Wednesday said that during the first three phases of the
deal, Jordan respectively sold to Iraq 111.4, 100.9 and 93 million
dollars worth of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal is an exception of the U.N. trade embargo
imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait, which is
aimed at easing the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed Jordan's success in trade with Iraq to
the geographic link, healthy bilateral relations and
competitiveness of the Jordanian-made products.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government and the representatives overseas have
contributed to garnering contracts from Iraq and getting them
approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, it said.
</P>
<P>
All the contracts reached between Iraq and any other countries
must be agreed on by the U.N. committee.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian exporters and Iraqi diplomats here said on Wednesday
that the kingdom will remain in high place in exports to Iraq in
the fourth stage of the oil-for-food deal starting from last
June.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Announces Postponement of Local Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government
Wednesday officially announced the postponement of provincial
council elections (PCE) scheduled to be held on August 28 due to
security reasons, according to a press release from the Commission
of Elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the government dose not give a new date for fresh PCE
polls.
</P>
<P>
A number of political parties including the ruling People's
Alliance and opposition United National Party nominated candidates
for five provincial councils after they were dissolved in June
this year, but the campaigning failed to get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
The government Tuesday declared state of emergency Islandwide
to aim at the postponement of the PCE.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier said it was in no position to provide
security for the PCE because a large number of troops and police
had been deployed in the north of the country to fight against the
Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sri Lankan Constitution does not allow the
government to delay the vote for the PCE, unless a state of
emergency is declared across the island country.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga earlier said that a decision on
the postponement of the PCE was imminent. She said she would
personally prefer to go ahead with the elections. However, it
would be foolish for democratic parties to expose themselves to
terrorist attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The armed forces of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo) have crushed the
rebellion by Tutsi Banyamulenge soliders in Kinshasa, Justice
Minister Mwenze Kongolo announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing (left of the rebels) in Kinshasa," said
Kongolo.
</P>
<P>
He said that several dozen rebel soldiers holding out in the
western part of Kinshasa had surrendered to the authorities and
had been put into military custody.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi Banyamulenge soliders, who were descendants of Rwandans
but had settled in Congo for generations, staged a rebellion in
Kinshasa on Sunday to protest the expulsion of Rwandan officers by
the D.R. Congo government.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion came at the same time as a military battalion in
the eastern provinces of Nord-Kivu and Sud-Kivu at the Rwandan
border declared a rebellion against the rule of President
Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The D.R. Congo government Tuesday formally accused Rwanda of
invading the eastern part of the country and supporting the
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The two major cities in the east, Goma and Bukavu, have fallen
to the rebels and fighting has reportedly spread to the northern
city of Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> 2ndld-writethru: No Big Changes in Arafat's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, August 5 (Xinhua) -- No big changes were made in the
cabinet reshuffle presented here Wednesday by Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat to the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
According to the new lineup, Nabil Shaath is to remain as the
Minister of the Planning and International Cooperation, while Saeb
Erekat will retain his post of Minister of Local Government.
</P>
<P>
Both Shaath and Erekat were key members of Arafat's former
cabinet and in the past they provided useful assistance to Arafat
in conducting peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Munther Salah was appointed Minister of Higher Education to
replace Hanan Ashrawi, who was transferred to the portfolio of
tourism and archaeology.
</P>
<P>
New ministers were appointed to the ministries of labor,
industry and agriculture. Hikmat Zeid, an independent PLC member,
was named Minister of Agriculture to replace Abdul Jawad Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Rafiq Natsheh replaced Samir Ghoshe as Minister of Labor while
Sa'adi Krunz, a professor and PLC member, was appointed as
Minister of Industry to replace Bashir Barghouti, who is not in
good health.
</P>
<P>
There were 10 new faces in the cabinet, nine of them are PLC
members. Three new ministries were announced: environment,
parliamentary affairs and prisoner affairs.
</P>
<P>
All former ministers but one remains in the new cabinet, and
all new ministers but one come from the mainstream faction Fatah
led by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Former ministers of the Labor, Industry and Agriculture were
named as ministers without portfolios and will remain in the
new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Shaath said that the new cabinet
represented "a new direction" for the Palestinians, because it is
more capable in solving the problems facing the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
"The new cabinet will be more flexible in future cooperations
with the PLC and strengthen the management efficiency in various
ministries as required by the PLC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salah said that although there were no big changes in the
reshuffle, the new cabinet is determined to lead the Palestinian
people in developing economy and achieving peace.
</P>
<P>
He denied the allegation of serious corruption in the former
cabinet, which led to the reshuffle at the request by some PLC
members. He argued that the main problems in certain ministries
were only the lack of efficiency and management experience.
</P>
<P>
In June, the PLC threatened to table the first no-confidence
vote against the PNA to protest the alleged corruption and
inefficiency. The whole PNA cabinet resigned on June 24 to pave
the way for the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Arafat presented his new cabinet list to the PLC after
addressing the PLC members about the economic and political
situation facing the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The PLC is to hold debate on the new lineup before giving its
final approval. No date has been set for a vote on the cabinet
reshuffle.

<HEADLINE> Reunification Concept Vital for Taiwan Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A reunification concept is the
ideological basis of dealing with the Taiwan issue, which resulted
from China's civil war and the subsequent intervention by the
United States, said a Chinese scholar here today.
</P>
<P>
Mao Jiaqi, a professor at the Taiwan Research Institute under
Nanjing University, made the remark at the ongoing 7th Seminar on
the Taiwan Straits Relationship, adding that only with a
reunification concept which stems from an aspiration for national
prosperity can Chinese people across the straits reach agreement
and finally reunite.
</P>
<P>
The professor emphasized that, for the present, Chinese people
across the straits should join hands to prevent further splitting
of the motherland, which he said has been intensified since Lee
Teng-hui came to power years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan media reports, some 70 percent of Taiwanese
agree on consultations across the straits, and the number of the
Taiwanese who prefer the "independence of Taiwan" is very small
and will not increase in the foreseeable future, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the professor pointed out that greater attention
should be paid to this group of people as they constitute great
resistance to the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tang Yi, a member of the National Society on Taiwan Study, said
that Taiwan authorities' policies which manage to persuade more
Taiwan businessmen to invest in southeast Asia countries instead
of the motherland's mainland have greatly hampered economic
cooperation between the two sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
Many scholars attending the seminar said the Taiwan authorities
have fallen into a dilemma: on the one hand, the vast market on
the mainland is particularly lucrative and attractive, on the
other hand, the Taiwan authorities are worried that the Taiwan
economy will become too dependent on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
But, actually, the mainland has become a powerful generator for
the Taiwan economy as statistics show that to date, Taiwan enjoys
an 80 billion US dollar trade surplus with the mainland, which is
beneficial to the Taiwan economy and helps the island to become a
"safety zone" in the present financial turmoil, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
About the political future of Taiwan, Tang said that if the
Taiwan authorities really focus on bilateral developments between
the two sides and reunification with the motherland, they will not
be worried by the "political safety" issue.
</P>
<P>
Many scholars also called for talks on procedural issues
concerning political negotiations across the Taiwan Straits at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zaixi, a senior research fellow with the Institute for
International Strategic Studies, said the talks between the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the Straits
Exchange Foundation show that the unofficial meetings on practical
matters are not enough to solve many major issues, and only
political negotiations can settle issues concerning the principle.
</P>
<P>
Scholars pointed out that the mainland has showed its sincerity
in boosting the settlement of political disparity between the two
sides, and that they hope the Taiwan side will change their
hostile attitude and create a new situation for the healthy
development of cross-straits relations.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Calls for Hard Work to Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada here Wednesday called on all sectors to join hands in
helping the country's economy escape a looming recession.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent plunge of the stock market, triggered by the
recession in Japan and the fall of the Dow Jones index, has not
been confined to the country, but has been the general trend
across Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index Tuesday slid
31.66 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,511.44 points, the lowest since
April 2, 1993. It rebounded by 13.31 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The only answer to the financial downtrend is to continue
working harder to help the people hurdle the current crisis,
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"According to reports, the downtrend is not only here in the
Philippines, but it's all over Asia. So, we can not do anything
but work harder," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said he has been meeting with his economic
managers to fine-tune several measures to help rescue the economy
from recession.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippine economy slid to its five-year low of
2.5 percent growth in the first quarter this year, but analysts
believed that it can manage to grow by 2-2.5 percent this year
while the economies in other Southeast Asian nations will plunge
into recession.

<HEADLINE> No Crisis Over Iraqi Arms Inspection: Chief Arms Inspector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' chief
disarmament inspector in Iraq on Wednesday denied that the
breakdown in talks with the Iraqi government was a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission for
Disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM), on Tuesday cut short his visit to
Iraq after talks with the Iraqi leadership on dismantling weapons
of mass destruction collapsed.
</P>
<P>
On a stop-over in London on his way back to New York, Butler
told the BBC he would brief U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
later Wednesday before reporting to the Security Council on
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"I said very specifically to him (Annan) that I don't think
any of us should describe this as a crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was optimistic about a resolution to the
latest stand-off, Butler said: "I don't use the concepts of
optimism and pessimism in this business. It's a bit emotional."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed: "Necessity is the mother of invention,
and we must solve this problem. And therefore I think we will find
a solution."
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that as Iraq obviously felt "boxed in", it
might be "smart" for the international community to consider the
prospect of putting an end to the severe international sanctions
against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China Halting Job Fees Collection for University Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China announced today that it
will prohibit local governments, companies and alma maters from
charging university students high fees.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made by the State Development Planning
Commission and the Ministry of Education, says that college
graduates have to pay various fees to get a job, including a
"city-increased population fee," a "job-recommendation fee" and a
"work-cash pledge."
</P>
<P>
The sum varies from hundreds to thousands of yuan for each
graduate, and has caused financial problems for them and their
families.
</P>
<P>
China abolished the system of state job assignments for
graduates in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The announcement says that nobody should charge graduates
unreasonable fees in the name of helping them find a job, and
units and schools should stop trading students as commodities
labeled with certain prices.
</P>
<P>
China's market economy has introduced reforms into the higher
learning sector, and all the students had to pay their own
tuitions fees which were previously covered by the government.
</P>
<P>
China's policy still holds that everybody has the right to an
education regardless of their status and wealth.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Be Major Rubber Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has the potential to be a
major rubber producer in the world because it has favorable
weather conditions, soil type and cheap labor, rubber traders
said.
</P>
<P>
Ibukun Akinduro, Services Director of Michelin Group Company,
disclosed that Michelin had plans to invest about 20 million U.S.
Dollars over the next five years to develop rubber plantations in
the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Michelin, which has joint plantations in four states in the
country, was aimed at transforming the plantations from their
current role of local rubber supplier into major exporters at the
international markets, The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the company has taken various measures
to achieve this goal including increasing its equities in the
four plantations.
</P>
<P>
Michelin has decided to use Nigeria and Brazil as case study
in rubber research, Akinduro said, adding that the company's
research in Nigeria had achieved a major breakthrough with clones
from Osse River Rubber Estate which yielded 2.5 tons per hectare
annually, the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said Michelin would make joint plantations in Nigeria
"the world's reference for natural rubber productivity in the
tropical zone" if their extensive agricultural investment plans
could be carried out in the near future in the country.

<HEADLINE> Survey Spells Out Income of Chinese Transient Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China's 34 million transient
workers earned a total of 200 billion yuan last year, according to
a recent Statistics Bureau survey reported in the Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
China has a massive troop of such surplus farm workers rushing
to labor and service jobs in the cities. The survey shows their
per-capita annual income averaged 5,642 yuan last year, double
what they could earn from farming. Analysts here predict that this
income differential will continue to stimulate more rural workers
to follow this road.
</P>
<P>
The sample survey, conducted among 150,000 farm laborers
working as transients elsewhere in the country, indicates a
regional difference in term of incomes.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 57 percent of the surplus farm laborers flocked to
coastal cities. Their income accounted for 67 percent of the total
payroll in these areas, with per-capita annual earnings of 6,633
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five percent of the job hunters chose cities in the
central region, where they earned an average of 4,454 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The resource-rich western part of China welcomed an increased
number of workers, who earned 13.6 percent of the region's
payroll, averaging 4,158 yuan a person for the year.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that the transportation industry has
provided the highest-paying jobs for Chinese transient workers,
offering 9,231 yuan on average a year, while construction, service
and factory workers were comparatively poorly paid with annual
incomes of from 5,245 to 5,470 yuan.

HANGZHOU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Intermediate People's Court
in Jinhua, east China's Zhejiang Province, on Tuesday sentenced
Yang Shangrong, a local tax official to death, for his involvement
in counterfeit value-added tax invoices worth millions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shangrong, former director of the inspection team in

value-added tax invoices worth 20.58 million yuan in the latter
half of the same year. The former official received kick-backs
totalling 90,000 yuan from the illegal transactions.
</P>
<P>
Yang's actions resulted in substantial losses for the
government and tax revenues totalling one million yuan have not as
yet been traced.
</P>
<P>
The local court rendered the verdict in accordance with
criminal law and regulation governing punishment for individuals
engaged in counterfeiting value-added invoices.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Seeking New Palm Oil Accord with Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Colombia Wednesday sought a
new government-to-government agreement with Malaysia for proposed
Malaysian investments in the development of 300,000 hectares of
palm oil plantations in that country.
</P>
<P>
If there is a new government-to-government agreement, the
proposed investments by Malaysian companies in Colombia can be
further facilitated, Colombian Ambassador to Malaysia Arturo
Inflante said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was specially arranged to brief reporters
on the results of Colombia's recent general election and its
impact on bilateral relations with Malaysia, especially in the
field of economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
"This is important especially in view of the fact that we are
having a new government soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inflante said the investment proposal, which was worked out two
years ago, has attracted the attention of a Malaysian group
consisting of six companies led by Golden Hope Plantations Bhd.
</P>
<P>
However, he said a complete feasibility study has to be first
commissioned before an agreement between the two governments can
be signed.
</P>
<P>
"This is because the financial crisis in Malaysia may lead the
government to restrict private investments abroad. For us, the
interest and commitment to making this project materialized are
still high under the new government because I do not think there
will be much change in the country's economic, investment and
trade policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Colombia also wants to invite the Malaysian
private sector to participate in the privatization of Colombia's
infrastructure projects which will cost about 30 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between Colombia and Malaysia amounted to 10.6
million U.S. dollars in 1996 with Malaysian exporting to Colombia
rubber and rubber products, electrical and electronics products,
machinery parts and medical instruments, and Colombia exporting to
Malaysia vinyl policlorure, fungicides, herbicides, artificial
teeth, steel, paper and machinery.
</P>
<P>
On Colombia's general election, which was held in two stages in
May and June and saw the Conservative opposition winning a
three-corner fight, Inflante said President Ernesto Samper will
end his four-year term Friday and hand over power to
president-elect Andres Pastrana.

MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Navy is holding a
joint exercise with a passing U.S. naval vessel outside Philippine
territorial waters west of Luzon, a press release from the
Philippine Navy said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-hour exercise, which started early Wednesday morning, is
code-named "Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training." Its

press release said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Philippine Navy chief Vice Admiral Eduardo Santo
has deployed a mixed flotilla of patrol ships, patrol gunboats and
an aircraft to participate in the exercise.

readiness of vessels, equipment and personnel, while the U.S. Navy
takes it as an alternative for a bigger naval exercise to support
its Pacific Command's cooperative engagement strategy of promoting
training opportunities in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Introduces New Checks on Sugar Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
announced new measures to deal with the persistent glut caused by
cheap imported sugar in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi announced Tuesday
that the government will impose a development levy with immediate
effect from 20 percent to 40 percent on sugar imported into Kenya
or kept in bonded warehouses before August 5.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is also looking into the possibility of
introducing a quota system on sugar importing, said Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kenya Sugar Authority and Kenya Revenue Authority
will take measures to ensure that numbered seals are placed on
all warehouses and transit vans transporting sugar to border
areas so as to deter traders from unloading transit sugar on the
local market.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the domestic market has been flooded with
cheap sugar imports, most of which end up in the east African
country at lower prices because of non-payment of appropriate
duties at the port.
</P>
<P>
As a result, domestic producers are unable to dispose of their
sugar stocks at economical prices, resulting in high stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
The sugar stocks in Kenya have reportedly reached 35,500 tons
worth at least 1.3 billion Shillings (21.8 million U.S. Dollars).

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The situation on the Line of
Control (LoC) is still precarious with the Indians continuing
their firing, killing and injuring civilians, a spokesman from the
Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, the spokesman said that various areas
across the LoC have been ravaged, more than 50 civilians have been
killed and many injured besides considerable damage to property as
a result of heavy unprovoked artillery and mortar fire from the
Indian side for the last one week.
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously concerned. Such a situation always carries
the risk of escalation in uncharted directions. The international
community is seriously worried at the implications that this
situation carries in an area which is a nuclear flash point," he
said.)
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Pakistan desires peace and
tranquillity, reduction of tensions and resumption of talks with
India with a view to finding peaceful solution to the outstanding
issues particularly the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's approach to the dialogue is serious, focused and
result oriented, said the spokesman, adding that "it is in keeping

Pakistan wants to accord priority to the issues of Peace and
Security and Jammu and Kashmir in consonance with the Agreed
Agenda and in accordance with the understandings reached by the
two countries in their Islamabad Accord in June last year, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Under the item Peace and Security, we believe there is urgent
need for discussion on nuclear and conventional restraint and
stabilization and avoidance of conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Jammu and Kashmir which is the core issue must certainly
deserve similar priority treatment," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Number of China's Urban Employees Continues to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- By the end of June, the number of
China's urban employees in the state and collectively owned
businesses had dropped to 143.85 million, 2.86 million less than
in the same period last year, according to the latest statistics
from the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the drop to the fact that more and more
people have been employed by overseas-funded, private and township
businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
The increase in retirees and laid-off workers also brought down
the number of employees on the job.
</P>
<P>
The state firms now have 105 million employees, while
collectively owned ones employ 27.1 million.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period, the country distributed 466.7
billion yuan of wages to these urban employees, 18.7 billion yuan
more than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly wage was 513 yuan, up 6 percent on a
year-on-year basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States has become
one of the major foreign investors in north China's Hebei
Province, whose investment totaled 65.5 million U.S. dollars in
the first half of 1998, up 108 percent over the same period of
1997.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Hebei Provincial Statistics Bureau told a
news conference here today that the province actually used foreign
investment of 800 million U.S. dollars in the past six months,
dropping by 15 percent, with the directly used part reaching 120
million U.S. dollars, down 23.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Asian financial crisis, the investment from Asia
and Europe dropped by 31 percent and 73.4 percent, respectively,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
Some 57 firms were added to the province's foreign-funded
enterprises during the period, with the investment hitting about
67 million U.S. dollars, up 111.4 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the increasing foreign capital
investment is beneficial for China's economic growth, which is
suffering from a monetary shortage and sluggish market demand.

<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The fourth flood peak on the
mainstream of the Yangtze River passed Chongqing City at 5
p.m. (Beijing time) Tuesday and is moving downstream toward
Wanxian in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ministry of Water Resources shows that the
water level of the Yangtze River running through all parts of
central China's Hubei Province rises at a daily rate of 0.06-0.9
meter. The level of the section between Shashi and Luoshan has
surpassed the previous record and is expected to remain at the
present height until early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The water level at the location of the Three Gorges Dam Project
rose continuously at a flow rate of 50,000 cubic meters per second
this morning due to persistent rain in the region.
</P>
<P>
The maximum water flow at the Three Gorges is expected to
exceed 54,000 cubic meters per second when the fourth flood crest
comes on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
But the water level at sections downstream of Hankou is
falling. By 6 a.m. today, the level at the Jiujiang Hydrological
Station fell to 22.84 meters, 0.13 meter lower than Tuesday's
level, which is still higher than the record mark. Dongting and
Poyang lakes also reported falling water levels today.

CANBERRA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly firmer in Sydney Wednesday, buoyed by a stronger Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian finished here at 60.68 U.S. cents, from 60.58
U.S. cents late Tuesday.

Late in Sydney gold bullion was trading at 288.10 U.S. dollars

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Two bodies have been found in the rubble
of a collapsed apartment house in Berlin so far after a suspected gas
explosion totally destroyed the house early Tuesday morning, German
rescue workers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The body of an old woman had been recovered shortly before dawn and
another body had been found later. Their identities, however, had
still to be determined, police said.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 rescue workers, helped by specially trained dogs and
high-tech detecting devices, have been working overnight to try to
find possible survivors.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 registered tenants of the apartment house, five people
remained unaccounted for, including a 13-year-old boy whose parents
survived the tragedy and watched as rescuers tried to find him. The
boy's dog had been pulled alive out of the rubble.
</P>
<P>
Investigations showed that some residents of the house in a western
district of Berlin had already gone to work when the explosion
occurred at about 6:00 a.m. Tuesday. Several others were found either
on vacation or having moved out of the residential block.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that the explosion might have been triggered by
a gas leak in the basement of the building, but the determination of
the exact cause would probably take several months.

<HEADLINE> HK Fund Industry Sees Heavy Net Outflows in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- With investors' confidence
dampened by the weak Japanese currency, Hong Kong's unit trust
industry witnessed net outflows of 133.9 million U.S. dollars in
June, the highest monthly net outflows so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Eleven out of the 14 fund sectors saw net outflows, according
to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
The sector which suffered the highest net outflows was Single
Asian Countries (excluding Hong Kong and Japan) funds, with 110.14
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As to why redemptions soared in June, Lin Yoke Seetoh, acting
chairman of the association, said, "The weakening of the yen and
its knock-on effects on the regional currency markets further
dampened investor sentiment."
</P>
<P>
"Sentiment has already been weak as there are very few signs of
improvement in most of the Asian economies and recovery is not
within sight," she noted.
</P>
<P>
The industry as a whole would have had a heavier overall net
outflow had it not been for the robust inflows into European
equities funds, according to the HKIFA, which groups 47 funds
management companies.
</P>
<P>
While Asian sectors were very weak, European equity funds have,
since February, consistently generated net inflows every month.
</P>
<P>
"As the prospects of the Asian markets continue to deteriorate
and the upside potential of the U.S. market was limited in the
medium term, the European markets become a focus for investors,"
Seetoh said.
</P>
<P>
"European markets have performed strongly over the last 24
months and European equity funds have recorded relatively strong
returns," she added.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- About 400,000 international
tourists visited Australia's wineries each year, a tour operator
said in Adelaide, capital of South Australia state, Australia's
major wine-producing area.
</P>
<P>
Francis Wong, managing director of Encounter Australia Co.
Wednesday said wine tourism in Australia was estimated to be worth
about 240 million U.S. dollars annually and had the potential to
grow to 660 million U.S. dollars into the next century.
</P>
<P>
"South Australia, which enjoys a worldwide reputation and image
for its wine and is the nation's major producer and exporter of
wine, is poised to prosper from this spectacular growth in wine
tourism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Encounter Australia Wednesday launched a tourism package which
linked the state's wine regions and which would be aimed at
corporate travelers from Asia, Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the package would attract clientele with high incomes
to South Australia with the specific aim of experiencing wine and
regional foods.
</P>
<P>
"We will be working closely with the wine regions, the regional
tourism operators and fine restaurants to encourage guests to stay
in the wine regions rather than concentrating on the capital
cities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian tourism industry earn a total of 9.6 billion
U.S. dollars each year.

PHNOM PENH, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The National Election
Committee (NEC) on Wednesday suspended its daily news
briefing because of disturbance by the opposition Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP).
</P>
<P>
The NEC said in a statement that this decision was made
Tuesday after "one political party took advantage of the
presence of dozens of journalists at the daily NEC press
briefings, to hold its own press conference".
</P>
<P>
SRP officials interrupted Tuesday's news briefing by the NEC
which had been giving daily briefings one day after the
multi-party election on July 26.
</P>
<P>
The SRP accused the NEC of favoring the ruling Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) in the process of vote counting and
allocation of parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
The SRP charged that the NEC used a calculation formula that
would give the CPP more parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
The NEC began to announce verified initial results step by
step on August 1. Up till Tuesday only votes of two
constituencies remained unchecked. Vote verification for 21
constituencies has been finished so far.
</P>
<P>
Early results showed that the CPP, collecting the most seats,
appeared set to win the election. But the SRP and other parties
claimed fraud in the election and demanded vote recounting in some
areas.

<P>
RAMALLAH, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat presented here Wednesday the lineup
of his new cabinet to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)
for approval.
</P>
<P>
No big changes were made in the reshuffle. Nabil Shaath is to
remain as the Minister of the Planning and International
Cooperation, while Saeb Erekat will retain his post of Minister of
Local Government.
</P>
<P>
Both Shaath and Erekat were key members of Arafat's former
cabinet and in the past they provided useful assistance to Arafat
in conducting peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Munther Salah was appointed Minister of Higher Education to
replace Hanan Ashrawi, who was transferred to the portfolio of
tourism and archaeology.
</P>
<P>
Shaath told Xinhua that he believed that the new cabinet
presented by Arafat represented "a new direction" for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said the new cabinet is more capable in solving the problems
facing the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
"The new cabinet will be more flexible in future cooperations
with the PLC and strengthen the management efficiency in various
ministries as required by the PLC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salah said that although there were no big changes in the
reshuffle, the new cabinet is determined to lead the Palestinian
people in developing economy and achieving peace.
</P>
<P>
He denied the allegation of serious corruption in the former
cabinet, which led to the reshuffle at the request by some PLC
members. He argued that the main problems in certain ministries
were only the lack of efficiency and management experience.
</P>
<P>
In June, the PLC threatened to table the first no-confidence
vote against the PNA to protest the alleged corruption and
inefficiency. The whole PNA cabinet resigned on June 24 to pave
the way for the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Arafat presented his new cabinet list to the PLC after
addressing the PLC members about the economic and political
situation facing the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The PLC is to hold debate on the new lineup before giving final
approval to it during this special session, which opened at noon

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Develop Agro-Processing Industries: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Agro-processing industries have the
potential to become the biggest investment sector in Bangladesh
within the next five to ten years, said Finance Minister A.M.S.
Kabria Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings in this sector might be even higher than that
of ready-made garment exports which account for nearly 68 percent
of the country's total, the national BSS news agency quoted the
minister as saying at a workshop inaugurated here.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured support from the financial institutions in
setting-up agro-processing industries, saying that this would take
back resources from the urban to rural areas, raising farmers
income which "in turn will support the local industries."
</P>
<P>
The Krishi (agriculture) Bank had already been instructed to
finance the agro-processing industries while the newly-formed
Employment Generation Bank scheduled to start functioning next
month would also finance small scale industries, he told the
workshop.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that other financial institutions would follow.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in her policy statement has
announced agro-processing industries as a thrust sector, and "time
has come for the entrepreneurs to act promptly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabria emphasized the need for coordinated actions by the
entrepreneurs, the business community, bankers and the research
bodies to increase productivity through modernization and product
diversification.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is an agriculture-based country with over 80 percent
of its 127 million people living in the rural areas and 64 percent
of the employment opportunities in the country being directly
originated by the sector. The agricultural sector now contributes
only 32 percent of the country's GDP.

<HEADLINE> Iranian MP Calls for Tehran-Cairo Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian legislator has
called for reconciliation between Iran and Egypt to serve the
mutual benefits and common Islamic interests, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mutual interests, key role of the two countries in regional
affairs and their joint views on crucial issues require the
atmosphere between them be cleared, Taha Hashimi, member of Iran's
Majlis (Parliament) Presidency, told a press conference held here
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-Egyptian contacts could also prove beneficial to
the Islamic nation, especially in regards to the holy city of
Jerusalem and Islamic affairs, Hashimi said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iran have yet to normalize their relations, which
were severed in 1979 after Egypt granted political asylum to the
Iranian shah ousted in the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Hashimi, who was here to probe prospects for establishing an
Islamic parliamentary union, said that he would work to enhance
the friendship between the two parliaments in a bid to improve
their countries' overall relations.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed Iran's desire to restore relations with Egypt in
all domains, adding that preliminary steps have been taken in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Since Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric
taking office a year ago, called for improved relations with
Egypt, the two key Muslim nations in the region have exchanged
high-level visits aimed at seeking cooperation in trade, economy
and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Hashimi said that his talks with Egyptian People's Assembly
Speaker Ahmed Fathi Sorour clearly reflected a "common perspective
as to all issues," particularly Jerusalem and Israeli
intransigence in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Terming Israel's policy as aimed at marginalizing Arab and
Palestinian rights, Hashimi called for a joint Islamic front to
force Israel to give in to Arab and Islamic rights, especially on
the issue of Jerusalem which houses the third holiest Islamic
shrine of Aqsa Mosque.

<HEADLINE> Internet Firewall Market Among Fastest-growing Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Internet firewalls were one
of the fatest-growing businesses last year, with revenues jumping
143 percent worldwide between 1996 and 1997, a U.S. market
analysis firm has announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The International Data Corp. (IDC) predicted that the
firewall market worldwide will reach 1.8 billion U.S. dollars by
2002.
</P>
<P>
Internet firewall is a security mechanism that allows
limited access to a Web site as well as approves traffic in and
out in accordance with a thought-out plan.
</P>
<P>
IDC said that the rapid growth of this market was driven by
companies upgrading their firewall systems and by a demand for
multiple internet firewalls to provide companies with high
availability and throughput.
</P>
<P>
The United States will remain the strongest market, said IDC,
adding that the European and Asia-Pacific markets will grow much
faster.

<HEADLINE> One Million Zambians Apply for Tele-Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- About one million Zambians have
applied for the long-distance education program which was
introduced last May in the country with about 9.5 million
population.
</P>
<P>
Lawrency Shimba, the Zambian Minister of Science, Technology
and Vocational Training, revealed this here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have already received applications and processed them,"
the Post newspaper Wednesday quoted Shimba as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the degree program is supposed to start
before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Shimba said that the program has taken long to start
because his ministry is waiting for a response from the
ministries of education and legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his ministry has consultative meetings with
the other ministries and a memorandum of understanding has been
signed.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry of education deals with matters concerning
higher education and this is a case where the ministry comes in.
We have to wait for a feedback," said Shimba.
</P>
<P>
The degrees will be awarded by the respective institutions
involved in the program at the end to the courses, according to
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Shimba pointed out that the private institutions involved in
the program will directly award the degrees to their students
after completion of courses.

<HEADLINE> China Boasts 960,000 Private Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by government
policies, the number of private enterprises in China has now grown
to over 960,000, a conference on the private sector was told here
recently.
</P>
<P>
These businesses have a total payroll workforce of 13.49
million people and combined registered capital of 514 billion
yuan (61.927 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Though this may still be considered small, with an average of
only 13 employees per private firm, a number of private giants has
emerged with fixed assets ranging between several hundred million
and even one billion yuan, according to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Another encouraging sign is the strong presence of private
firms in the developed coastal areas. In Shantou in Guangdong
Province, for example, the private sector now accounts for an
incredible two-thirds of the city's industrial assets, four-fifths
of the retail sales, and 40 percent of all exports.
</P>
<P>
Conference participants also pointed out some private-sector
problems including low productivity and a low level of technology.
</P>
<P>
They also called for stronger government support for and more
favorable policies toward bank loans, the use of overseas
investment, and foreign trade rights.

<HEADLINE> Faster Growth Predicted For China's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Even though China's economy grew
a percentage point less than the targeted eight percent in the
first half of this year, economists here say that major indices
like investment and bank loans indicate a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, the amount of bank loans was 15.6
percent more than for the same period last year, 0.4 percentage
points higher than the January-May figure. Investment in fixed
assets was also up 15 percent in the second quarter, from first
quarter's 10.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
This momentum is expected to continue in the second half,
according to Xiang Huaicheng, the Finance Minister, who told a
conference recently that China will adopt more measures to spend
more on infrastructure to stimulate economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transport has announced increased spending on
road construction of 180 billion yuan, 50 percent more than was
planned at the beginning of the year, and other measures are being
considered.
</P>
<P>
A State Statistics Bureau economist predicts that the growth in
fixed assets investment will be above 15 percent in the second
half and that this spending is likely to put economic growth above
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has cut interest
rates five times to spur consumer spending and to stimulate the
economy. But the first half of the year still had a slumping
market and falling inflation and a retail price index that fell
2.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Faster Growth Predicted For China's Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheng Xiusheng, of the State Council's Development Research
Center, says that people have fewer expectations about incomes
because of unemployment and lack of efficiency and he predicts
that the sluggish market will continue.
</P>
<P>
The Asia financial crisis will also continue to affect Chinese
exports and its economic rebound, Cheng notes. If the Japanese Yen
continues to depreciate in value, Chinese exports will go down
further. He predicts that the drop in exports will possibly affect
GDP growth by half a percentage point to one point.
</P>
<P>
In the past, approximately 20 percent of China's GDP came from
exports. The government has adopted measures to speed up exports,
like increasing export tax rebates of textiles, machinery,
ships and products in two other trades.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the recent flooding will also throw a pallor over
China's economy, they say. Since June, the Yangtze, Yellow and
Nenjiang rivers have been hit by heavy flooding and that may pull
economic growth down some 0.5 percentage points, according to
another economist, who predicts that economic growth will met with
some resistance in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there will be possible significant signs of a
rebound in the fourth quarter, he says.

<HEADLINE> NZ Defense Minister Calls for Buying Third Frigate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Defense Minister
Max Bradford has called for buying a third new frigate to enhance
the military capability of the country.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper Wednesday quoted the Defense Minister as saying at
Auckland's Newmarket Rotary Club Tuesday that the Asian economic
crisis had made the Asia-Pacific region much less secure and New
Zealand needed to buy a third new frigate.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, New Zealand signed a contract
with Australia on buying two frigates. The first one is already on
service and the second is still under construction.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post quoted Bradford as saying "While prosperity
binds nations together in self-interest, economic decline
encourages old conflicts of interest to surface and that can
overhang a threat to the stability of the region."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand was spending 0.7 percent of gross domestic product
on defense, less than many other countries in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bradford said the government had committed 663 million N.Z.
dollars (338 million U.S. dollars) to rebuild military
capabilities because "we must be able to make a meaningful
contribution to the security or our Asia-Pacific backyard."
</P>
<P>
He said that a decision must be made soon on a third frigate to
replace HMNZS Canterbury when it retires in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot enjoy our prosperity and security without playing
our part in protecting the open sea lanes and promoting and
participating in the wider confidence-building activities in the
Asia-Pacific region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Finish 1.5 Percent Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian stock market plunged
more than 1.5 percent Wednesday but recovered slightly from a
sharp morning sell-off inspired by a near-300-point drop on Wall
Street overnight and uncertain Asia markets.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index ended 42.1 points weaker at
2640.2, around the midpoint of the day's trading range.
</P>
<P>
Earlier weakness in leading stocks led the market to a low of
2622.6 before a recovery by stocks including Australia's leading
mining company BHP and insurance company AMP supported the bourse.
</P>
<P>
The resources stocks were partly supported by a broad increase
in commodity prices while the industrials were dragged down by the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
A couple of big stocks to buck the trend were BHP which
finished 8.2 cents higher at 13.90 Australian dollars, recovering
from a low of 13.45 Australian dollars, while AMP rose eight cents
to 20.85 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index was 81.9 points weaker at 4644.6
while the all resources index slipped 8.6 points to 1021.8.
</P>
<P>
The banking index shed more than 1 percent, or 71 points, to
5892.8 points with National Australia Bank slipping 13 cents to
22.36 Australian dollars, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia
dipping 23 cents to 20.22 Australian dollars, Westpac bank easing
down 16.5 cents to 10.255 Australian dollars and ANZ bank falling
19 cents to 10.26 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the resource sector, Rio Tinto was 25 cents weaker at 18.25
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 334.89 million shares worth 625 million
U.S. dollars with falls outnumbering rises by 793 to 315.

<HEADLINE> International Observer Defends Assessment of Cambodia's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Sven G. Linder, chief
representative of the International Election Observers, on
Wednesday rebuffed a demand to change the positive assessment of
Cambodia's election.
</P>
<P>
Linder said in a statement that the observers did a good job
in monitoring the election and any charge against them "might be
construed as attempts to depreciate the efforts made in good
faith by international observers to support the democratic
development of Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"By international standards the quality of the election
observation operation in Cambodia in 1998 has been high, and the
coverage of the electoral process comprehensive," Linder said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodians went to polls on July 26 to elect a new National
Assembly. The ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) won the
election which was disclaimed by some political parties as being
"full of fraud." But the international observers assessed that the
election was "free and fair" and was "acceptable."
</P>
<P>
This assessment irritated the election opponents who demanded
that the election be re-assessed.
</P>
<P>
In response to the demand, Linder said some 500 international
observers were observing some 17 percent of all polling stations
and some 13 percent of all counting centers, all chosen at random.
</P>
<P>
"This is sufficient and even high by international standards,
which normally require above 10 percent coverage in order to
enable observers to make a reliable assessment of the quality of
an election," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said long-term observers will remain until the whole
electoral process is concluded.
</P>
<P>
"In short, the International Observer Community feels that it
has made, and is making, a special effort of high quality by
international standards in Cambodia," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said: "It is regrettable if these efforts are not
appreciated in some places. International observers will, however,
continue to render their services for -- as we see it -- the
benefit of democracy in Cambodia."

<P>
COLOMBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A female British national was
nabbed at the Colombo airport when attempting to smuggle out a
bundle of foreign currency amounting to 18,000 U.S. dollars
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The woman came from Lebanon with an intention of staying in the
country for a couple of days, according to customs sources here.
</P>
<P>
But for some unknown reasons, she had changed her mind and
decided to leave within a few hours of her stay in the country,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The customs searched her and discovered the foreign currency
bundle of 18,000 U.S. dollars on her waist. She said it was the
money she had when she arrived here, but she had not made any
declaration to the effect, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Within the few hours of stay here, she may have managed to get
the money and was trying to leave as soon as possible, the sources
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the woman missed the flight and may have to stay in
the country a day or two till the next available flight, said the
sources, adding that the foreign currency that amounts to more
than one million Rupees was confiscated.

<HEADLINE> 15 Turkish Soldiers Killed by Kurdish Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen Turkish soldiers have been
killed and 25 others injured in a surprise attack launched by
Kurdish rebels in southeastern Turkey, the Cumhuriyet newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) guerrillas launched
the raid Monday night on the government troops stationed on Mount
Kato along the border with Iraq, the paper said, quoting sources
from the Emergency Rule Region Office.
</P>
<P>
The PKK members also kidnapped 10 soldiers, whose whereabouts
were unknown, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The office has so far not issued official statement on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Government troops are stationed on the Mount Kato to block the
guerrilla escape routes into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The mountain, in the province of Sirnak, which is about 1,200
kilometers southeast of Ankara, is known as one of the strongholds
of the estimated 1,500 kurdish rebels operating inside Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerrilla war since 1984 to
establish an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 35,000 people have since been killed in the war.

<HEADLINE> US Public Companies Warned About Year 2000 Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Executives at more than 9,000
public companies in the United States are receiving a letter this
week warning them to start disclosing more details about year
2000 computer preparations.
</P>
<P>
The letter is from the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). It asked the companies to give investors more information on
industry's readiness when the dates of computer systems turn over
for the millennium. SEC has put the letter on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
SEC chairman Arthur Levitt said in the letter that the lack of
information regarding the preparations for the year 2000 could
seriously undermine the confidence of investors placed in the
companies.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent SEC report, most U.S. public companies fail
to discuss specific plans, timetables or cost of their Y2K
preparations although a majority of them have begun including the
issues in their financial reports.
</P>
<P>
A SEC spokesman said that companies could face fines if they
deliberately conceal a lack of preparations.
</P>
<P>
Year 2000 computer problems stem from a programming shortcut
that reads years as just two digits. When the decade flips,
computers affected by the problem will read 2000 as 1900, creating
useless data or crashing altogether.
</P>
<P>
In his new netebook "Year 2000 Recession?" Edward Yardeni, chief
economist for Deutsche Bank Securities (North America), predicted
that year 2000 computer glitch issues would lead to a 30 percent
drop on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Reserves Reach Lowest Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's foreign reserves reached
the lowest point in the first half of 1998 due to heavy
debt-servicing, according to a latest report of the Zambian
Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Microeconomic Indicators, an official monthly publication
of June released by the Ministry of Finance, revealed that the
foreign reserves of the country have fallen from 237 million U.S.
Dollars in December last year to 117.6 million U.S. Dollars in
June this year, the lowest point in the first half year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's gross reserves have declined drastically and no
balance of payment (BOP) support inflows from the donors have
been recorded in the first six months this year, said the
publication.
</P>
<P>
The fall in reserves has been mainly attributed to a
64.4-million-U.S.-Dollar disbursement by the Zambian government
toward servicing its foreign debt of 7.2 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The publication also revealed that the Zambian government has
not received any inflows from the donor community for the BOP
support in the past six months ending June.
</P>
<P>
In December, 1996, Zambia's national reserves were 220.7
million U.S. Dollars while the figure for the same period of 1997
was 237.9 million U.S. Dollars which, however, have been steadily
falling against the demands for debt-servicing, said the
financial publication.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the Zambian government managed to negotiate
for a 530-million-U.S.-Dollar aid package at a consultative group
meeting in Paris.
</P>
<P>
However, the aid has not come into the African country because
the Zambian government can not meet one of the preconditions set
to the release of the funds.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the funds can flow into Zambia only when
the Zambian government completes the privatization of its copper
mines which used to earn over 90 percent of the foreign exchanges
for the country.
</P>
<P>
But the government does not want to privatize the mines in a
hurry to avoid sacrificing the people's interests.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Vows to Take Measures to End U.N. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Following the collapse of its
talks with the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq, or
UNSCOM, Iraq has vowed to take measures to end the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after an emergency meeting of the
powerful Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath Party
chaired by President Saddam Hussein late Tuesday night, the Iraqi
government blamed the UNSCOM for the failure of the latest round
of talks that broke down Monday night.
</P>
<P>
It condemned the UNSCOM for serving the U.S. interest through
"unjustified delay" of its inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM was "falling under the American domination and
implementing anti-Iraqi U.S. policies by constantly resorting to
manoeuvers, procrastination and unjustified delay of its works,
with the object of maintaining the sanctions imposed against the
Iraqi people to serve the US designs," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government reaffirmed its determination to confront
the UNSCOM's "manoeuvers" by taking additional measures to
safeguard Iraq's national interests to end the crippling economic
sanctions imposed by the U.N. after Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say what the measures were.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in late July, the Iraqi leadership already threatened
to take measures to lift the sanctions, but it late decided to
wait for the outcome of the visit by UNSCOM's Chairman Richard
Butler.
</P>
<P>
Butler left Baghdad Tuesday and is expected to report to the
U.N. Security Council on the latest talks. He said upon his
departure that the failure of the talks was due to the Iraqi
demand that the UNSCOM give a clean bill of health to Iraq so to
pave the way for the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Butler rejected the Iraqi demand, citing that he had not yet
obtained enough evidence. In protest, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz refused to continue the talks with Butler.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year long mission by the UNSCOM, which is in charge
of destroying Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, has been marred
by repeated confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The last confrontation, in which the U.S. and Britain deployed
massive military forces in the Gulf, was averted at the last
moment by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his visit to
Baghdad.

<P>
ANKARA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurrieyt (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish government named three independents Tuesday to fill
the posts of the retired justice, interior and transportation
ministers to ensure a just general election scheduled for next
April.
</P>
<P>
Under Turkish Constitution, the portfolios of justice, interior
and transportation must be replaced with independent politicians
no later than the fifth day after the parliament announces the

</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Defense Department has approved the sale of
Stinger missiles worth 150 million U.S. dollars to Greece in a
bid to help the ally enhance its defense capability.
</P>
<P>
The Stingers, known as guerrilla missiles, can be used by
ground forces to counter armed helicopters, cruise missiles and
other low-flying jets.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey received 1.5 million foreign tourists in June, down 4
percent from the same month in 1997, according to the latest
tourism report released by the State Statistics Institute.
</P>
<P>
And the total number of foreign tourists in the first half of
this year was 3.8 million, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- The Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter has said that Turkey's
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) has recruited around 50
Swedish members of Kurdish origin over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The mercenary troops were sent to southeastern Turkey after
receiving training in secret camps in the Netherlands and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 to establish an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Israel Tests Missile in South Lebanon: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel is testing a new kind of
advanced anti-tank missile in its occupied south Lebanon, the
Lebanese Daily Star newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language paper said it has learned the missile is
likely that of NT Danday, or Long Spike, under development by
Israel's state-owned Rafael armaments company based in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the missile, which is apparently far more
sophisticated in design and capability than the existing identical
projectiles, has been speculated for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be put into use, amid great secrecy, in
south Lebanon last February.
</P>
<P>
The paper said one Lebanese civilian has been killed and four
others, including three Muslim guerrillas, wounded by the secret
weapon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has since been spearheading a
resistance movement to drive about 2,000 Israeli occupation troops
out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Lebanese army has collected some
fragments of the Israeli missile and is carrying out a study. But
the army has found there is little it can do to counter the
new missile.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Down in Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rate dipped slightly in July 1998 to 10.6 percent from
10.7 percent in June 1998, based on the 1994 basket of
commodities, the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report from the office showed that month-on-month inflation
rate in July 1998 decreased to only 0.3 percent compared to 1.7
percent in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate from January to July stood at 9.2 percent,
it said, well within the government target of a single-digit
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Socio-economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said in a news
release Wednesday that based on the latest indicators, the economy
could be veering towards a lower inflation path.
</P>
<P>
Except for fuel, light and water, the increase in prices of all
commodity groups decelerated relative to their year-ago and
month-ago levels.
</P>
<P>
Prices of food items such as rice, corn and dairy products rose
minimally relative to June levels. This is in stark contrast to
the experience in June when food prices increased by 1.9 percent
relative to May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the slowdown in food prices could be traced to the
easing of the El-Nino as well as the timely importation of rice.
He remained optimistic that the downtrend in the prices of
agriculture-based products will continue.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Dollar Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Dollar has been
falling against major international currencies as the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe failed to save the local currency with hiked
rediscount rate.
</P>
<P>
As the move by the Zimbabwean central bank to raise the
rediscount rate from 31.5 percent to 35 percent Monday failed to
save the local unit, the Zimbabwean Dollar continued to
depreciate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Banks were Tuesday buying the U.S. Dollars for 22 Zimbabwean
Dollars and selling them for 28 Zimbabwean Dollars, while the
British Pound Sterlings were being bought for 34 Zimbabwean
Dollars and sold for 44.95 Zimbabwean Dollars, with the wider
spreads further deepening the volatility and uncertainty in the
market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency dealers said the situation was one of
confusion and panic, with most corporate clients holding back and
refusing to deal with the rates offered by banks, the daily
Herald newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the forward market cover purchases by importers were
somewhat reduced, but the market was dry of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
With low inflows of tobacco and mining
export earnings, the country's foreign currency reserves are to
fall to less than the equivalent of one month import cover,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The recommended reserves are an equivalent of three months of
import cover.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Selects Shenyin-Wanguo Best Securities Firm in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Shenyin-Wanguo Securities
Co. Ltd. was selected by the "Euromoney" in its July issue as the
best securities company in China for the year of 1997, according
to information from the company.
</P>
<P>
The news was also found on the Internet. A merger of two
separate Shenyin and Wanguo securities companies two years ago,
Shenyin-Wanguo Securities Co. Ltd. played a vital role in China's
securities market in the past year, which also demonstrates
China's determination of going into international capital market,
company sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Yuchun, general manager of Shenyin-Wanguo,
the corporation seized market opportunities and adjusted operating
strategies last year. It shifted its priority from pursuing assets
of scale to seeking the quality of assets to reduce bad assets of
scale and lay a solid foundation to prevent risks.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the whole company's assets of scale had
dropped to 16.7 billion yuan (2.01 billion US dollars), but net
assets had increased to 2.3 billion yuan (277 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
While avoiding risks, the company has made efforts to enlarge
market share. It trades in 548.3 billion yuan (66.06 billion US
dollars) in terms of business volume and earned a profit of 876
million yuan (105.5 million US dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The general manager pledged that his company, as China's
biggest brokerage, would continue to be inventive with its
services and expand its market penetration this year.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Agriculture Ministry
is drafting a master plan that would raise the fishing industry's
annual export earnings to 10 billion U.S. dollars by 2003, said
Agriculture Minister Soleh Solahuddin.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the fishery sector only earned 2.2 billion U.S.
dollars from exports and this year, it is expected to earn 4
billion U.S. dollars," Solahuddin told reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
he said his ministry needs more strategies that would boost
fishery sector's export earnings.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the fishing industry is a fast foreign exchange
earner compared to other agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
"However, efforts to earn more foreign exchange should not
sacrifice the environment through the over exploitation of the
country's marine resources," he added.

<HEADLINE> China to Make Changes in Management of Tea Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
grant the right to export tea to its foreign trade companies,
tea manufactures and foreign-funded companies beginning Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
They will make tea deals by themselves if granted the right to
trade tea by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The current management only allows some foreign trade
companies and manufacturers to export black tea by themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the new management, which will replace
the old one on Aug. 10, quotas and export licenses are still
necessary for tea exports, but trading companies need not forward
contracts to the China Chamber of Commerce of Exporters and
Importers of Foodstuff, Native Products and Animal By-products to
be verified.
</P>
<P>
Officials of MOFTEC said the reform of tea exports is aimed at
better meeting the market demand and providing convenience for
local enterprises trading tea.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that China exported 97,920 tons of tea
during the first half of this year worth 168 million
U.S. dollars.

The Lubei Group enjoys the lowest production cost among peers
across the country, and the group generated a net profit of more
than 200 million yuan (about 25 million US dollars), accounting
for one sixth of the country's chemical industry output.
</P>
<P>
The phosphorus plaster, an industrial waste from producing
phosphorus ammonium, contains harmful elements such as fluorine,
which causes heavy pollutions to environment and ground water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The production of each ton of phosphorus ammonium, generates
three or four tons of phosphorus plasters and the amount of
phosphorus plaster discharged into the whole world reaches 280
million tons each year. Researches on utilization of phosphorus
plasters have began among developed countries in 1940s, but no
effective ways has been developed to deal with the over-abundant
resources.
</P>
<P>
"The technology has solved one of the industrialization
problems plaguing the world for decades. The invention of the new
technology has combined the economic efficiency with environment
protection," said Zhang Chunhao, academician of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The technology also attracts attention of chemical industry
enterprises in other countries. Agreements on technology transfer
have been signed with enterprises in Russia, Belarus, and
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
A project with an annual production capacity of 150,000-ton
phosphorus ammonium, 200,000-ton sulfuric acid, and 300,000-ton
cement has been under construction by the Lubei Group, which is
expected to come into operation in October.

The facility utilizes the residue from the production of
phosphorus ammonium to manufacture acid and cement, and the
sulphuric acid can be used to produce phosphorus ammonium, a
fertilizer in high demand. The production of the three products
leaves no discharges and maintains sound circulation.
</P>
<P>
The application of this technique has made the place where the
enterprise is located free of waste residue, waste water, and
waste gas, and even less noisy.
</P>

"The adoption of the technique has reduced the cost by about 30
percent," said Feng Yisheng, chairman of the board of the
corporation, who along with his colleagues spent many years

BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Not one of this year's 80,000
laid-off Beijing workers applied for jobs as sanitation workers by
the deadline in a recent "job-aid" campaign sponsored by the
Beijing Municipal Environmental Sanitation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
An official with the bureau said the salary for a street
cleaner is nearly three times higher than unemployment relief
funds, laid-off workers in the capital are still reluctant to take
jobs cleaning the streets and removing garbage.
</P>
<P>
So far, Beijing has more than 1,000 street cleaners. Of those,
about 70 percent are farmers-turned-workers from areas other than
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The enrollment of sanitation workers is part of the "job-aid"
campaign arranged by the municipal government. The environmental
sanitation bureau promised to enroll Beijing laid-off workers
instead of farmers from other areas in the coming years.
</P>

An official with Beijing's Municipal Labor Bureau said
excessive self-respect and sense of face kept laid-off workers in

million yuan (eight million US dollars) coming in the form of
subsidized financial support from the central government.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy Doing Well: Says IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has expressed its pleasure with the progress made to date
by Zimbabwe in managing fiscal and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Director of IMF African Department, Michael Nowak,
told a news conference Tuesday that Zimbabwe's budget deficit,
projected at around 7.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
for the 18 month period to December, had over-performed by 1.5
percent of GDP below the set target.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite a considerable target and this is good news which
people do not know about," the Zimbabwe News Agency Wednesday
quoted Nowak as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The market does not know about this and perhaps the
Zimbabwean government should be telling people about it," the IMF
official said.
</P>
<P>
Nowak, who is leading a team of IMF, World Bank and African
Development Bank officials on a fact-finding mission to Zimbabwe,
said that inflation would come down within the next few months
because the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had managed to curtail money
supply growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zimbabwe could expect a rapid slow-down in
inflation in the coming few months. "The reason we have around
30 percent inflation is that last year it had a 35 percent growth
in money supply," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there are areas the government still needs
to address such as receipts of privatized assets which are down,
the anticipated fuel price rises and the government's
reintroduction of price controls.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from these points regarding economic fundamentals, we
believe the government's reform program is on track under the
present difficult circumstances," Nowak said.
</P>
<P>
But he could not say whether Zimbabwe now qualifies for the
second tranche for improving its balance of payments position
from the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Karst Caves in Guilin Attract More Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The karst caves of Guilin in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have become one of
the prime destinations for tourists from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The city of Guilin has now developed a dozen such caves into
scenic spots. The Ludi cave is a typical example. This cave was
discovered in 1959 and opened to visitors three years later, and
has by now received 25 million tourists. Last year, it contributed
20 million yuan to local revenues.
</P>
<P>
The 240-meter-long Ludi cave covers an area of 15,000 square
meters, and has long ranked first in tourism among the country's
300 opened karst caves.
</P>
<P>
A provisional survey shows that the region has more than 3,000
karst caves distributed over an area of 2,400 square kilometers.
Local government is making the most of its cave resources to gain
greater economic results.
</P>
<P>
The Guanyan cave is more modern. It was found by a karst cave
expedition team a decade ago, and opened to visitors recently. Zhu
Xuewen, president of the China Cave Research Association, had the
12-kilometer-long cave equipped with a trolleybus, boating on a
subterranean stream, and escalators to better entertain tourists.
</P>
<P>
Now, an increasing number of cave experts and amateurs from
China and abroad are visiting the city's karst caves. However, Zhu
warns that cave expeditions can be dangerous without the proper
organization, preparation, and special guidance.

Autonomous Region reported stable economic growth in the first six
months this year.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Bangladesh's 2nd Largest Trading Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany has become Bangladesh's
second largest trading partner after the United States as the
latter's exports to that country are rising rapidly, a major
English daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's exports rose from a modest 180.34 million U.S.
dollars in 1991-92 to 428.10 million dollars in 1996-97, The
Independent daily said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's trade with Germany had been distinguished by the
rising curve of its exports dominated by ready-made garments
sector, which accounted for nearly 68 percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
The success of Bangladesh's exports to Germany was attributed
to the booming performance of garments, specialized textiles,
leather and leather goods, frozen foods, jute goods, ceramics and
handicraft, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh-made products are gaining a foothold in German
markets, due to constant participation by manufacturers at
specialized German trade fairs held in Berlin and other cities.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi businessmen have also been scouting for German
investors on their own. They organized an investment seminar in
Germany's city of Hamburg in November 1997 to project the
attractiveness of the country's investment climate and the areas
of profitability.
</P>
<P>
As a result, German investments, though relatively moderate,
have begun to take a toe-hold in Bangladesh, with over 6 million
DM (Deutsche Mark) registered already and more expected,
especially in the export processing zones in Chittagong and Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Apart from all these achievements made in the bilateral trade
relations, the two countries have already set up some joint
ventures in Bangladesh, which are mainly related to textiles,
ready-made garments, leather and shoe industries, paper industry,
shipping and maintenance of container vessels.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the German Investment and Development Company has also
co-financed seven industrial projects in Bangladesh since 1981,
the report added.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein's Health Stable After Treatment: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan now
enjoys good and stable health at a United States clinic
after nearly one month of hospitalization, the semi-official
Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to worry about. The treatment is going fine
and the king's health is reassuring and his morale is high," the
paper quoted Crown Prince Hassan as saying after chairing a
regular Cabinet session Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The king's private physician Samir Farraj said in a statement
that the treatment on the king at the Mayo Clinic in Rochestor,
Minnesota, is progressing well and the king is responding very
well.
</P>
<P>
The king is taking his meals regularly and undergoing
physical exercises in the morning and evening, among other
activities, said Farraj.
</P>
<P>
He added that the clinic is giving a second session of
chemotherapy to Hussein and the outcome is expected later the
month, said Farraj.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 62, has been hospitalized at the clinic since July 14
for treatment of lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic tissue,
which is highly treatable with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Farraj said that Hussein would receive chemotherapy
intravenously over a period from four to five months. The results
of the first session of chemotherapy "are very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear when the king would return home, because it
depends on the outcome of the second session of chemotherapy,
which is due on August 20 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Hussein underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular
medical checkups there ever since.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, he had surgery for an enlarged prostate that
was benign. He had an operation in November 1997 to remove an
inflamed lymph gland that was also found to be benign.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East and
is to celebrate 46 years on the throne on August 11.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Two gigantic bridges will soon be
built to link Zhoushan, an offshore island city, with Ningbo, a port
city, as the first phase of the "Peninsula Project" in east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>

<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>

Cooperation Zafer El-Beshri said on Tuesday that Egypt's ties with
the United States are at their best stage.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations are shifting from the aid stage to that

<HEADLINE> Brisk Business in State Treasury Bonds Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Business at the secondary market
of state treasury bonds has been brisk amid increased issues of
such bonds at the primary market since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Shenyin-Wanguo Securities Co. Ltd. show
that the issue of state treasury bonds on the primary market was
258 billion yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But in the first half of this year, the issue of treasury bonds
hit 225 billion yuan, including 180 billion yuan worth of state
treasury bonds for individual investors, plus 45 billion
yuan of special state treasury bonds aimed at non-state commercial
banks. This does not include 270 billion yuan worth of special
treasury bonds soon to be issued for state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Information from the secondary market shows that investors have
been active in purchasing state treasury bonds as interest rates
on bank savings deposits have declined. The business volume in the
secondary market has remained high.
</P>
<P>
In Frbruary the Minisytry of Finance announced the issuance of
125 billion yuan worth of certificate treasury bonds, with an
original term of eight months. But the issue was finished in just
four months. The later issuance of another 17.36 billion yuan
worth of state treasury bonds was also completed in short order.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts attributed the brisk business in the primary
and secondary markets of treasury bonds to falling interest rates
on bank savings deposits and less-risky features of state treasury
bonds.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that brisk business at the two markets should
continue in the latter half of this year as the overall economic
situation in China improves, coupled with downward inflation,
possible new bank interest-rate cuts, and the listing of more new
securities investment funds which are required to invest 20
percent of their respective total assets in state treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
China has cut bank interest rates four times since May of 1996,
with the latest drop on March 25.

<HEADLINE> Poverty May Cause Voter Apathy in Zambia, Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- More people will not participate
in Zambia's forthcoming local government elections due to high
level of poverty and ineffective electoral process, Zambia
Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) has warned.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Tuesday, ZIMT President Alfred Zulu said
a national survey carried out recently indicates that 90 percent
of the estimated 1.3 million people who voted during the
country's last presidential and parliamentary elections in 1996
will be forced not to vote because of high level of poverty,
newspaper The Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Many people we talked to indicated their reluctance, citing
poverty and lack of developmental ideas by the serving
councillors as the main reasons. This is true because many people
are hunger-stricken to the extent that they may fail to walk long
distances to reach polling stations," Zulu said.
</P>
<P>
He charged that the country's Elections Commission has failed
to perform its responsibility of creating an accessible electoral
process.
</P>
<P>
Voters are currenlty asked to walk long distances to register
themselves and later on take a similar journey to collect their
voter's cards for the elections to be held late this year.
</P>
<P>
Zulu pointed out that voters' apathy has been worsened by
job loses which has forced many people to migrate to different
places far off from their registered polling stations.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Zambian government to implement a local
government reform program before holding the eleciotns to make
the elections meaningful.

<HEADLINE> Central China Hubei Province Reports Stable Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- In spite of sluggish market demand,
Hubei Province in central China registered a steady increase in
the first half of 1998, with gross domestic product (GDP) hitting
148.9 billion yuan, up 9.5 percent from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wu Weixian, director of the Hubei Statistics Bureau, said in an
interview with Xinhua that the province's economy, which has been
on a sound track for the past six months, began to pick up in
May.
</P>
<P>
Increasing investment in infrastructure construction had a
positive effect on economic growth during the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the province realized an industrial
added value of 44.58 billion yuan over the past six months, a
year-on-year increase of 9.9 percent, while fixed investment
reached 25.26 billion yuan, up 13.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the major "bottleneck" confronting the province's
economy is continuing industrial inefficiency and difficulties in
upgrading farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu remains bullish about the positive impact
investment will have on economic growth in the second half of this
year.

<HEADLINE> China's Shirt Quality Rated Satisfactory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China's shirt quality is
satisfactory, according to inspection results released today by
the State Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau conducted a quality inspection from March to June of
142 brands of shirts made in 12 provinces and metropolitan areas
including Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
More than 85 percent of the shirts passed inspection, the
bureau said, an increase of 16.3 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Shirt quality has witnessed a notable improvement throughout
the country," said a bureau official, adding that shirts made in
the cities of Beijing and Tianjin and the provinces of Hebei,
Fujian, Hubei and Hunan received a satisfactory rating of 100
percent in the inspection.
</P>
<P>
Inspection results show that shirts produced in Jiangsu and
Zhejiang provinces with a satisfactory rate of 91.7 percent and
88.2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, problems still exist, according to the bureau,
especially in a number of wholesale markets. For example, some
shirts are not up to standards, and the quality of women's shirts
falls far behind that of men's, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that, although China's shirt production capacity
has reached a high level and many overseas brand shirts have been
produced or processed in China, the country still does not have a
brand known worldwide in the shirt industry.
</P>
<P>
"Such a situation should change," they said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Opens Tourist Service Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A Tourist Service Center came
into operation here Wednesday in a move to boost tourist arrivals
on the occasion of Visit Nepal Year '98.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating the center, Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala noted that tourism has become a force in linking a
destination even at remote local level to national, sub-regional,
regional and international level.
</P>
<P>
"The recently-concluded SAARC (South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation) meeting also has once more reaffirmed the
need of developing regional tourism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In South Asia, we see tremendous potentiality of
intra-regional travel as well as attracting inter-regional
tourists," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Maldives celebrated Visit Maldives Year in 1997,
Nepal is observing Visit Nepal Year in 1998 and Pakistan is
scheduled to do the same next year.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts, I hope, will certainly complement to build the
South Asian image as a regional tourist destination," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tourist Service Center, built with a loan assistance of 1.1
million U.S. dollars from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is a
multi-faceted service complex designed to meet the diverse
promotion and information needs of foreign visitors to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Marshuk Ali Shah, resident representative of ADB in Nepal, said
on the occasion that the bank accords high priority to tourism in
Nepal in view of its contribution to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Tourism along with ready-made garments and carpets is Nepal's
major foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
Dipendra Purush Dhakal, secretary at the Ministry of Tourism
and Civil Aviation, noted that in the first seven months of this
year, tourist arrivals had grown by 9.7 percent to 260,000 over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the opening of the Tourist Service Center,
the first of its kind in the country, he is hopeful that the
target of attracting 500,000 tourists this year will be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom has received an average of 300,000
tourists every year in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop Technique for Faster Gene Identification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a gene-cloning and DNA-sequencing technique that enables
them to identify an average of 15 new human genes a day and
thereby help complete DNA-sequencing.
</P>
<P>
A manager of the Shanghai Shenyuan Gene Development Corporation
said his company will build 10 "assembly lines" with this
technique to complete the cloning and DNA-sequencing of all the
100,000 human genes.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yumin and Xie Yi, professors at the Life Science College of
Shanghai-based Fudan University, developed this gene-cloning and
DNA-sequencing technique.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai New Huangpu Group signed an agreement in February with
Fudan University to spend 100 million yuan (12 million
U.S. dollars) on the gene-cloning program and some other jointly
launched high-tech biological projects.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the human body has about 100,000 genes,
and by using traditional gene-discovering techniques, Chinese
scientists has expected to identify only about one percent of them
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Human-gene research can provide detailed information on human
tissue structures and characteristics which are expected to be the
foundation for the development of biological medical science in
the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Two Jewish Settlers Killed in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Jewish settlers were
killed in the West Bank early Wednesday in an attack launched by
suspected Palestinian militants, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The attack happened in the Jewish settlement of Itzhar,
about 10 kilometers away from the Palestinian West Bank city
of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The two young men, only one of whom was armed, were shot when
they were on a routine security patrol of the settlement
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Suspected Palestinian militants fired at the settlers from a
close range, and escaped after taking away their guns
after confirming they were dead.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army has imposed curfew on four Palestinian villages
in the area and set up road blocks.
</P>
<P>
The army also reported the attack to the Palestinian police
and asked for their help in locating the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The killing came amid the high tensions between Israel and
the Palestinians over the second redeployment of Israeli troops
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the right-wingers, the Israeli government
has rejected an American proposal which calls for a 13 percent
Israeli withdrawal, citing it would endanger its security.
</P>
<P>
The latest double killings are set to cast further shadow on
the just-resumed Israeli-Palestinian talks on the second stage
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Following the killing, the right-wing National Religious Party
lawmaker Nisan Salominavsky visited the settlement to show support
to the settlers.
</P>
<P>
Salominavsky urged again the government to halt the
negotiations with the Palestinians, saying that the attack
showed that the Palestinians did not desire peace.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, Costa Rica Remain Divided on Border River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The river that borders Nicaragua
and Costa Rica has no similarity to the Rhine River in Germany,
which is navigated by vessels from many different European
countries, Nicaraguan Vice-president Enrique Bolanos said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter published by local newspapers Tuesday, the
Nicaraguan vice-president argued with the Costa Rican former
president Oscar Arias over a statement he made regarding the San
Juan River which borders the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Arias said he longed for a situation similar to that found on
the Rhine River where many different European flags fly over
plenty of boats.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Nicaragua's suspension of free navigation
on the river.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Nicaragua suspended free navigation following a
heavy deployment of military personnel by Costa Rican President

Under current treaties, the 300-kilometer section of the river
that separates Costa Rica from Nicaragua is under Nicaragua's
sovereignty. Costa Rica however has the right of free navigation
through this waterway.
</P>
<P>
In response to Arias' statement, the Nicaraguan vice-president
said in his letter that ships crossing the Rhine transport only
merchandise and none of them carry troops or weapons without
Germany's authorization.
</P>
<P>
"No one doubts the fact that the section of land in question is
under German sovereignty. The rest of the Rhine belongs to many
countries, while the San Juan River belongs only to Nicaragua,"
the vice-president argued.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Okays Social Security Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved the
amendment to the Social Security Act proposed by the Ministry of
Labor and Social Welfare, which allows the government to reduce
its contribution to the Old-Age Pension and Child Care Allowance
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The amendment frees the government from contributing an equal
amount to the fund, according to a government press release said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Act stipulates that the government must
establish the Old-Age Pension and Child Care Allowance Fund by
December 31 to which, the government, employers and employees must
each provide an equal contribution of an additional 3 percent of
wages.
</P>
<P>
However, the amendment removed the phrase "provide equal
contribution" and did not specify how much the government will
contribute.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Trairong Suwankhiri said earlier that under the
current economic crisis, the government cannot shoulder the burden
of contributing 3 percent of wages to the fund.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will finalize the percentage of the
government's contribution and issue a ministerial regulation
concerning the matter.
</P>
<P>
However, the amendment triggered strong opposition from workers
and unions, which threatened to call a protest against the
government's decision.
</P>
<P>
The government, employers and more than 6 million workers now
covered under the scheme which pays medical bills, including
childbirth, disability and death benefits, had been required to
contribute 1.5 percent of wages to the Social Security Fund.
</P>
<P>
In order to relieve the financial burden of all parties, the
government decided to reduce contributions to just 1 percent for
three years starting in January of this year.

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Still Grave in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation in Bangladesh's
capital city of Dhaka and its adjoining areas remains grave as 54
out of 90 wards have been submerged by flood, according to
officials of the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC).
</P>
<P>
One-tenth of the 9 million people in the capital have been
affected by flood, press reports Wednesday quoted the DCC
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 160,500 square meters of roads have been damaged by
flood due to constant heavy rain during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Of the flood-affected people, nearly 40,000 have taken refuge
in 87 flood shelters in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city's protection embankment is still under threat as the
water level of the rivers of Buriganga and Turage continued to
rise at several points.
</P>
<P>
The DCC authorities have so far allocated 100,000 taka (about
21,277 U.S. dollars) for each of the nine seriously-hit zones in
the city as emergency aid and 221 metric tons of grain and other
relief materials to the flood victims, the DCC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the DCC had also organized 10 medical teams to work in
the flood-affected areas as water-borne diseases mainly cholera
and cold fever have broken out in different parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
The overall flood situation in the country was improving with
water in the major rivers receding gradually, though the situation
might deteriorate again in northern and northwestern areas of the
Ganges and Brahmaputra basins and upper parts of the Meghna basin
due to downpours, the Flood Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
However, the floods that have already caused heavy damage to 37
of the country's 64 districts might prolong, experts from all
disciplines dealing with floods feared.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that the floods had come earlier this year
and one full month of annual peak flood still lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
Under the influence of the weather phenomenon La Nina, heavy
rainfall might continue and aggravate the situation, they said.

<HEADLINE> Government, Opposition Differ on Stability in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee asserted Tuesday that his government was stable
while Congress leader Sonia Gandhi said the government might fall
at any time due to its internal squabbles.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliamentary party meeting of the ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Vajpayee said the BJP-led government
at the center continued to be stable and there was "no alternative
to his government at this juncture."
</P>
<P>
He said impression created by the opposition about the
government's instability was baseless and maintained that his
government was not only stable but would remain firmly entrenched
for a full term.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked his partymen to go to their
constituencies and expose the role of the opposition, which he
said was responsible for stalling important legislation including
the Women's Reservation Bill tabled before the parliament last
month.
</P>
<P>
Almost simultaneously, Gandhi told a meeting of the Congress
party in the parliament that the BJP-led coalition might fall
anytime due to its internal squabbles.
</P>
<P>
"In these circumstances, the Congress has to be on the alert
for any development in the medium or even short term," she said,
adding that "at any moment, we might be called upon to assume
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
This session of the parliament has shown that there has been no
governance, only a struggle for survival, Sonia said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress leader sharply attacked the Vajpayee government
for what she called failures on various fronts including economy.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Sonia called the BJP-led government
"unstable" and said, "The instability of the government does not
arise from anything that we in the opposition are doing but its
own internal quarrels."
</P>
<P>
Like Vajpayee, She also asked the parliamentarians of her party
to go back to the constituencies, interact closely with the party
workers "and thus strengthen the Congress at its base."

<HEADLINE> Tibet: Projects Play Vital Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The completion and operation of
60 aid projects undertaken by the central government and China's
other provinces in Tibet will have a vital bearing on the
autonomous region's progress and stability, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
People's Government, is quoted as saying that the 60 projects are
among the 62 key construction items, planned by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State
Council in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The remaining projects -- a hydropower station in Woka and a
water irrigation hub in Manla, both in southern Tibet -- will
begin to supply power next year.
</P>
<P>
The 62 projects, costing an estimated investment of 4 billion
yuan (481 million US dollars) are in the fields of energy,
education, culture, health, television and radio, industry,
agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry and water conservancy,
transportation, post services, telecommunications and civil
aviation and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Major state commissions and ministries and 29 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities have provided funds and
expertise in this "milestone" in Tibet's history of development,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, these projects are propelling Tibet's
economic, scientific and cultural advancement, and will enhance
foreign investment and people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
With premier equipment and expertise, he said, the Tibet No. 2
People's Hospital built by Shanghai in 1996, for example, has
provided first-class medical services to local residents.
</P>
<P>
"It even boasts a market-leading remote diagnosis network,
through which experts in Shanghai can examine patient in Tibet," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural projects helped produce an additional 225,000
kilograms of grain during the 1994-97 period, Yang said. And the
energy projects, including the Manla hydropower station, are
expected to raise the annual power supply by 267.3 million
kilowatt hours.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Increase Budget Deficit in Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved a
proposal of the Economic Ministers' Council Meeting to increase
the budget deficit in the next fiscal year from 1.5 to 3.5 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP), the government said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet meeting held on Tuesday agreed to expand the state
enterprise investment in 1999 by running a deficit of 2 percent of
the GDP while increasing the government deficit to 1.5 percent of
the GDP to boost the economy, the government said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The press release said public spending will be focused on the
rural employment creation, unemployment solving and infrastructure
improvement.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has to convince the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to accept the Thai request for the wider deficit in the
1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said on Tuesday that he will brief
 IMF officials on the government's view of the progress of reforms
since the crisis hit in July last year.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team is now in Bangkok, conducting a quarterly review,
also known as the fifth letter of intent, of the organization's
172 billion U.S. dollar bailout package to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said the IMF
team has agreed in principle to the Thai government's deficit
proposal since the country's private sector was being strangled by
a liquidity crisis at a time when stimulating the economy becomes
urgent.
</P>
<P>
The next installment of the IMF's package would be 810 million
dollars, due to be paid next month pending approval of revisions
to targets and policies for the upcoming fifth quarter of the
program.

<HEADLINE> CSRC Chairman Calls for Hi-tech-Venture Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the
China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), called for a more
mature securities market to facilitate the state-enterprise reform
and the advancement of high technology during his recent
inspection tour of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country will give bigger play to the
securities market in supporting the commercialization of science
and technological achievements.
</P>
<P>
In fact, shares of high-tech companies have already become the
star group in the stock market, pursued by infestors since last
year.
</P>
<P>
"The CSRC will grant prior support to those high-tech firms
which promise high-growth potential, and a group of such companies
should be listed on the securities market," said Zhou Zhengqing.
</P>
<P>
General speaking, a high-tech bloc refers to shares of
comapnies in information technology, biochemical pharmaceuticals,
new materials and new technology sectors, according to securities
analysts at the China Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhou pointed out, the poorly performing companies
should be restructured, and company efficiency should be improved
to reduce the relatively high price-to-earnings ratio.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of listed companies is of vital importance to the
healthy development of the securities market," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also underlined that there are currently some
urgent security-company problems, and the CSRC will take active
measures to better regulate such companies.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Calls for End to Blind Selling of State-Owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A commentary today called on
the various localities to take effective measures to halt the
practice, now in vogue, of blindly selling off small state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, written by a special commentator of Xinhua,
pointed out that some places have resorted to selling off small
state-owned enterprises without analyzing the situation in an
attempt to reshuffle the small state-owned enterprises system.
</P>
<P>
Some local authorities have also dispatched personnel to these
enterprises to supervise and accelerate their sale.
</P>
<P>
The selling of small state enterprises, which has been
spreading quickly, has produced the wrong orientation for China's
reform of state-owned enterprises, affected the healthy
development of enterprises, and has eventually hindered the
reemployment of laid-off workers from these enterprises. Serious
social problems in some areas has been the result, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
It blamed this faddish selling practice mainly on a failure to
understand the guidelines of the 15th Party Congress, which
clearly states that a wide range of forms should be utilized to
vitalize small state-owned enterprises. But leaders in some
localities have simplified these serious and complicated reforms,
and have taken them to mean merely selling such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urged officials at different levels to carefully
study and fully understand the guidelines of the 15th Party
Congress, especially the policies concerning reform of state-owned
enterprises, and adopt correct forms in accordance with actual
situations in the process of reshuffling these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also said that thinking in terms of absolutes
and over-simplified working methods are other reasons for this
current trend.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to handle matters according to objective
economic laws in developing the economy," the commentary warned,
urging officials to bear in mind the past bitter lessons learned
from the violation of such laws while attempting economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also stressed the importance of fully listening
to and valuing the opinions of the majority of the workers when
choosing ways to reform small state-owned enterprises to ensure
such reforms are carried out in an efficient manner.
</P>
<P>
Those small state enterprises which are found to be deeply in
debt, and have no hope of revival, should be sold off, said the
commentary, adding that this step should follow strict standards
to avoid the potential loss of state assets or endanger the
legitimate rights of workers.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Spending at Cost of Other Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A new worldwide survey finds
that spending on the year 2000 computer problem, or the
"Millennium Bug", has been squeezing other information technology
projects, InformationWeek online service reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Information technology budgets were flat or reduced between
1997 and 1998 for 91 percent of the 15,000 companies and
government agencies in the survey on the Y2K problem by Gartner
Group, a leading United States research company on information
technology.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, spending on the problem was projected
to increase from five percent of the budget in 1997 to 29 percent
of the budget this year, with actual spending in the first half of
the year at 18 percent of the budget.
</P>
<P>
That means, the Gartner Group said, year 2000 spending is at
the sacrifice of other information technology projects. Efforts to
avoid providing additional funds for year 2000 projects are so
extreme that half of all the surveyed organizations have decided
not to test their computer systems at all.
</P>
<P>
While that is not true for most large U.S. corporations,
Gartner Group said, the tight budgets have resulted in far more
reliance upon existing information technology staff for year 2000
projects than expected.
</P>
<P>
In other words, information technology staff are preoccupied by
the year 2000 problem and have no time for other projects.
</P>
<P>
As a result, labor rates won't go up as expected for year 2000
programmers, although wages for project managers, Web designers
and Windows programmers are still being pushed up by high demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, peak demand for year 2000 services has
already been passed by large corporations, while demand is
currently peaking with mid-sized companies, and the peak for small
companies will come later this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the survey on year 2000 spending, Gartner Group
has recently completed research on the worldwide year 2000 risk
assessment and insurance coverages, InformationWeek reported.

<HEADLINE> Austrians Optimistic About Asia Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Most Austrian enterprises believe
they have good trade potentials in East Asia and Southeast Asia,
according to a study released Tuesday by the Vienna Institute of
Economic Research (WIFO).
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic and financial crisis in East Asia and
Southeast Asia, two-thirds of Austrian enterprises have increased
their exports to the region, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 10 percent of them are pessimistic about future
economic ties with the region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, Austria's exports to the region have more than
doubled with an average annual increase of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
A sustained strong economic growth in East Asian and Southeast
Asian countries has attracted Austrian enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, the study says Austria's economic investment in the
region is still limited. It warns the Austrian enterprises not to
ignore the Asian market because of its temporary difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Reiterates Claims over Malvina Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Senate President
Eduardo Menem defended on Tuesday Argentina's claims to grant
permission and privileges to oil companies doing developing work
in the Malvina Islands (Falklands).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with visiting British Foreign Office
Minister Tony Lloyd, Menem said he told the British minister that
under Argentine law, any oil company would be punished if it took
up activities in the Malvinas without Argentine agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said the law was only to defend the Argentine rights in
accordance with its Constitution which recognized the Malvinas as
part of Argentine territory.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that oil companies which do not pay
Argentina three percent of the oil profits will be punished.
</P>
<P>
This law was approved by the House of Representatives in May
and was submitted to the Senate for approval.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Menem and Lloyd was held in a friendly and
relaxed atmosphere, the Senate president said.
</P>
<P>
After his visit to Argentina, Lloyd will travel to Uruguay and
Chile.

<HEADLINE> Leading Life Insurer Introduces International Expertise to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China is forging stronger ties
with large foreign insurance companies to develop talent with more
mature managerial skills.
</P>
<P>
The first group of 43 people from Beijing who have passed
examinations as U.S. Life Office Management Association Fellows
at the Life Management Institute (LOMA FLMI) program was
recognized here recently by the Beijing Insurance Association
(BIA) and the U.S.-based John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Company.
</P>
<P>
The students are officials of the People's Bank of China, and
employees of major Chinese insurance companies such as the
People's Insurance Corp of China, the Pacific Insurance Company
and the Ping An Insurance Company.
</P>
<P>
They took the tests last fall and this spring, and two of them
have already passed all the 10 exams under the program, thereby
obtaining the designation of Fellow in Life Management Institute
and Associate of Customer Service from LOMA.
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice-President of John Hancock International John
Francisco said he was "impressed" by the result. He said it took
him three years to pass all the tests, while those two students
completed them in only one year.
</P>
<P>
John Hancock is the first to introduce the LOMA FLMI program
into China, an internationally recognized program that is
considered basic preparation for careers in life insurance.
</P>
<P>
John Hancock, the leading life insurer in the U.S. and Canada,
previously set up two LOMA test centers in Nankai University in
Tianjin, and at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing center, a joint program between the BIA and John
Hancock, is oriented toward government officials and industry
employees, according to Francisco, and the improvement of their
managerial skills will help in a "more direct" manner to bring
international expertise into the Chinese insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government and John Hancock also conduct regular
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
John Hancock will organize a trip to the U.S. in December for
nine officials from China's State Development Planning Commission,
the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China. They will
meet with U.S. government officials and discuss the possibility of
further cooperation in the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
John Hancock established a new representative office in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, in June,
to go with its three other Chinese offices in Beijing, Tianjin and
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Warns of Threat From La Nina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of
Communications Giri Suseno has warned the country of the threat of
floods, violent tropical storms and landslides to be brought about
by the arrival of the La Nina weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the people to take measures to anticipate
possible disasters starting from this month, the local press
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon began last month when torrential floods swept
through several places in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"This natural phenomenon generally lasts for between eight to
12 months. Its impact will therefore be extreme and will likely
continue to be felt well into the first quarter of 1999," Giri
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as floods have inundated East Kalimantan
Province since last Saturday, followed days of excessive rains in
the province. At least five people died in the downpour after a
dam burst from a week of heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
La Nina, which means "the little sister," arises from unusually
cool temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and often follows the
drought-inducing El Nino weather pattern.
</P>
<P>
During El Nino's reign last year, Indonesia experienced severe
drought which triggered forest fires on the islands of Sumatra and
Kalimantan. The drought also stunted rice, cocoa and coffee
harvests.
</P>
<P>
Head of the National Research and Rescue Agency Harinto had
earlier warned the country's all provincial governors about the
imminent threat of flooding.

The paper quoted a recent report from the State Bureau of the
Metallurgical Industry as saying that the sector suffered a total
loss of 580 million yuan (69.88 million US dollars)in the
January-June period this year.
</P>
<P>
The sector produced 57.25 million tons of iron and 55.22
million tons of steel in the first six months this year, growing
7.2 percent and 6 percent respectively from the corresponding
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The metallurgical industry reduced its losses by 260 million
yuan (31.33 million US dollars) in the first half year.
</P>
<P>
The report said a number of debt-ridden companies are expected
to become profitable by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The industry's production target is 107 million tons of steel
this year with an expected net profit of 2.5 billion yuan (301
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sector's losses, however, overshadows the ambitious
targets. The loss in the first half of this year was partly blamed
on steel prices declining and the upswing of prices in energy
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, transportation price hikes in April are estimated to
reduce the sector's profits by nearly 3 billion yuan (361 million
US dollars), said the report.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing financial turmoil in Southeast Asia largely
dampened the industry's profit estimates for the year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of steel products dropped 32.4 percent from the
corresponding period last year to 2.5 million tons in January-June
this year, according to the Customs, the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> Interpol Requests Capture of Colombian Suspect in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The international criminal
police organization (Interpol) has asked Costa Rican authorities
to capture Colombian politician, Alvaro Leyva, suspected of
receiving a huge sum drug money.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Presidency Under-Minister Rogelio Pardo told
reporters that Leyva was found to have arrived in Costa Rica on
July 24 from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, Leyva was accused of having received close to
155,000 U.S. dollars from a man involved in drug dealing money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
Former parliamentarian and former minister, Leyva is considered
a key man in the negotiations that new Colombian president, Andres
Pastrana, wants to establish with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican attorney general declared his interest in the case
and pointed out that he will send the anti-narcotics attorney to
Colombia to collect more information about Alvaro Leyva's case.
</P>
<P>
The politician could ask for asylum here since he considers
that the interpol's petition came as a result of a political
maneuver against him.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's Foreign Minister, this week
referred on various occasions to Leyva's presence here and
reiterated that his presence in the country was legal.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not put aside the chance that the Colombian
politician could ask for asylum if his extradition was required.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers Begin Heavy Drilling at Austrian Collapsed Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Austria's recovery workers will go
ahead with heavy "hammer drilling" into the pit, seeking to find
10 miners feared dead in a collapsed mine, Austria's APA news
agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This was a political decision, it's going to be a very arduous
task," the agency quoted rescue operation spokesman Alfred
Zechling as saying in the mining village of Lassing, southwest of
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to begin heavy drilling had been ordered
by the Economics Ministry and that the state would pick up the
extra costs.
</P>
<P>
Heavy drilling equipment was due to arrive in Lassing before
the end of Wednesday, Zechling added.
</P>
<P>
But officials on Monday said there were little hope to find the
lost miners, buried in a landslide 18 days ago, alive.
</P>
<P>
The decision to adopt heavy drilling to speed their rescue
operation came following heavy criticism of the rescuers' slowness
and lack of coordination in the country's worst post-war mining
disaster.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Plans to Clear Up Major River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has planned to channel
more than 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) on 17 projects
to clear up the Suzhou River, the 53.1-km-long main waterway
flowing through this most bustling center in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a China Daily report, tons of rubbish now move
slowly on the narrow, dark and stinky waters of the river.
</P>
<P>
Tireless efforts by the city's environmental defenders have
greatly reduced the river's rubbish.
</P>
<P>
It is imperfect, yet it at least allows us to hope for the
perfect to end the 80-year-old history of pollution, said Ge
Huizhen, vice-director of Shanghai Municipal Environmental
Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou River became the city's most convenient dustbin
with the rapid development at the beginning of the century. Its
waters turned dark and began to stink as early as 1920s.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Shanghai Environment Monitoring Center
indicates the best section of the river's water is barely
qualified for the State's class-five water standard, which
represents the lowest water-quality rating.
</P>
<P>
The city has had to extract five million tons of water from the
upper streams of the Huangpu River everyday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lewinsky Preparing for Grand Jury Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and former white House intern Monica Lewinsky met with their
attorneys on Tuesday to prepare for grand jury testimony about
their relationship, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Supreme Court ruling Tuesday cleared the way for a
White House lawyer to appear before special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's grand jury probing the Lewinsky allegations.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Lanny Breuer, who specializes in dealing with the
scandal, was cleared by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to testify
over White House objections that such testimony would violate
attorney-client confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Clinton won political support from the
congressional Hispanic caucus, who met with him at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what, we stand with the president to the end,"
Representative Esteban Torres, a Democrat of California, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Torres said members of the caucus of 17 Democrats, "to a man
and a woman," gave Clinton that message during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, at the White House, held the first of what White House
officials said are likely to be several meetings with his private
lawyers, David Kendall and Nicole Seligman, to prepare for his
videotaped August 17 testimony to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist's ruling on Breuer on Tuesday also presumably would
let deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey, one of Clinton's
closest confidants, face the grand jury. However, Lindsey is
recuperating from back surgery and is unlikely to appear this week.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, the 25-year-old former White House intern at the
center of the case, was reportedly also meeting with her lawyers,
Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, to prepare for her testimony,
which has not yet been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Lewinsky denied, under oath in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case, having a sexual relationship, and Clinton
said publicly he never told anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
But after receiving a grant of immunity from prosecution,
Lewinsky is prepared to testify that she and Clinton had a sexual
affair and agreed that it should be kept quiet, news reports
quoted unidentified sources as saying. The sources said Lewinsky
would not say she was specifically told to lie.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Barry Toiv said on Tuesday there had been
no change in Clinton's account of the relationship. "I have not
heard anything to suggest otherwise," Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
He added there were no plans by Clinton to give any new public
accounting of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
Toiv expressed disappointment with Rehnquist's ruling, saying,
"This is about the ability of not just this president, but more
importantly, future presidents, to have the benefit of the
attorney-client privilege, which is a bedrock of our legal system."
</P>
<P>
Attorney-client privilege holds that lawyers cannot be
compelled to testify about confidential conversations they have
with their clients.
</P>
<P>
Starr's team argues that government lawyers' duty as civil
servants trumps their duty to their presidential client. A federal
judge and an appeals panel have ruled against the White House on
this point, and the White House wants the full Supreme Court to
consider the matter when it reconvenes in October.
</P>
<P>
The White House had sought in the meantime to bar testimony
from Breuer, Lindsey and other lawyers, but Rehnquist turned down
that request.

<HEADLINE> Customers Advised to Use Pure Water With Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Experts warn that companies in
the business of selling so-called pure water should take more
into consideration than their marketing plans and advertising,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Waterman Distilled Water Co. Ltd allegedly
distributed 1,193 buckets of five-gallon pure water to the market
without inspection, it reports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Waterman sold bottled mineral drinking water,
produced on May 5 and May 15, that had microorganism indexes far
above legal standards set by the state.
</P>
<P>
On the consumers' behalf, the Hygiene Inspection Division of
Shanghai Hygiene Bureau has placed Waterman and two other
companies that are alleged to have sold unhealthy water on file
for further investigation and prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Pure water became available in the Chinese market just a few
years ago. This new source of drinking water has aroused wide
interest among customers in large cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But a recent survey showed the pure water business is not in as
good a shape as it sometimes appears.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 brands of pure water are sold in Beijing and the
number of companies is rising.
</P>
<P>
This stems mainly from a relatively high profit margin in the
business and promising prospects. Start-up and operating costs are
low. High technology is not emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The business is now threatened by a flowering of unlicensed
participants who not only spawn price wars and unwise competition,
but also those who are detrimental to the business because of poor
product quality.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Pushes for Private Bank Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, August 5 (Xinhua)-- Myanmar is speeding up its efforts
in the development of local private banks whose business is
gaining momentum despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis
which has been plaguing the region for over a year.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of 1997, there were 21 local private banks in
Myanmar with 64 branches in 18 major cities in addition to six
state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Yoma Bank, May Flower Bank and Asia Wealth Bank are
the three leading private financial institutions with Yoma Bank
witnessing the opening of 17 branches across the country within
three months.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 private banks, seven are allowed to carry out foreign
exchange transactions in the wake of the country's expanding
foreign trade activities.
</P>
<P>
With the interest rates rising from 12 percent to 16 percent,
people had bank deposits totaling 101.35 billion kyats (337
million U.S. dollars) at the end of 1997, of which 38 percent were
in private banks, an increase of 13 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen the ties between private banks, six of
them reached an accord in June 1997 on internal remittances among
them.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar allowed the establishment of private banks and foreign
bank representative offices as the first phase of its financial
reform, to be followed by granting Myanmar-foreign joint venture
banks as the second phase and setting up of exclusive foreign
branch banks as the third phase.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial reform has now entered the second phase
after memorandums of understanding (MOUs) were signed respectively
between six Myanmar private banks and six foreign banks, which
have already opened representative offices in Myanmar, on
joint-venture banks.
</P>
<P>
The six foreign banks are Japan's Fuji Bank, Thailand's
Farmers' Bank and Siam City Bank, Malaysia's May Bank and Public
Bank, and Cambodia's Global Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
A total of 49 foreign banks from 16 countries and regions,
mostly from Japan, Thailand, France, Singapore, Malaysia and South
Korea, have set up representative offices in Myanmar since the
country reformed its financial management system in line with the
market-oriented economic policy introduced in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
In addition to bank savings and loan services, Myanmar also
opened up its insurance industry to local private banks and
foreign investors after the enactment of the country's Insurance
Business Law in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, three Japanese marine and fire insurance companies
-- Mitsui, Yasuda and Tokio -- have signed MOUs with state-owned
Myanmar Insurance institutions to set up joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
In June 1996, Myanmar's state-run Economic Bank and Japan's
Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. established a joint-venture
Securities Exchange Center here in Yangon to handle securities and
bonds for the over-the-counter market with the objective of
developing a full-fledged securities exchange in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's financial sector
registered an increased of 13.7 percent in its services value in
the 1997-98 fiscal year, which ended in March, as compared with
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The rise was due partly to the fast development of private
banks in the country, according to an official report on the
nation's financial, economic and social conditions.

<HEADLINE> Ibis Population On the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The crested ibis population has
grown this year, giving the rare species known as an "oriental
fossil" a 21 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 1988, the crested ibis population grew to
130 from 107 in 1997, with 16 young ibis breeding in the wild and
23 breeding in Shaanxi Crested Ibis Protection and Observation
Station in Yangxian County, Shaanxi Province, China Daily quoted
Li Bin, working staff of the station as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The endangered bird, whose origins can be traced back 60
million years, was found in large numbers in most of China, as
well as Japan and Germany, hundreds of years ago. It now lives in
the wild only in China.
</P>
<P>
Since May, 1981 when Chinese scientists found seven wild
crested ibises in Yangxian County in northwestern Shaanxi
Province, the protection, research and breeding work on the bird
has been going well and scientists now know a great deal more
about the endangered bird, distinguished by its red head feathers,
grey plumage and hooked beak.
</P>
<P>
"They have made progress in finding out about the bird's
distribution, the breeding habits and the reasons the bird is
under threat," Li said.
</P>
<P>
From early March of this year, the scientists at the station
continued the breeding programs for the bird both in the wild
and in captivity, based on their rich experience of successful
captive breeding over the past five years and wild breeding last
year, Li said.
</P>
<P>
They put six pairs of adult crested ibises into the
experimental breeding. The birds produced 35 eggs which were
artificially hatched. By the end of June, 25 chicks had hatched,
though two died after their birth.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen chicks hatched in the wild at the same time and are
under close observation by the ornithologists, Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The private economy has been
mushrooming in north China's largest port city and is expected to
boost local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin added 15,000 self-employed households and private
businesses during the first five months of this year, employing
nearly 70,000 people.
</P>
<P>
This brought the city's total number of private businesses to
250,000 and the number of employees involved to 570,000.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of this year, local private
businesses paid more than 300 million yuan in taxes, a 28 percent
rise from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has expanded partly by making full use of
second-hand facilities eliminated by local state enterprises which
underwent reforms and by leasing, contracting, merging, purchasing
and funding local state businesses.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, outstanding loans granted to the local
private sector totaled 850 million yuan, focusing on the areas of
catering, services, transportation, processing of farm and
sideline products, retail sales, and small wholesalers.

-- After crossing swords over the "pro-poor and anti-rich"
rhetoric of President Estrada, big businessmen have expressed
confidence in his leadership and even offered to help him surmount
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine stock market Tuesday collapsed to its
five-year low as market confidence worsened. Blamed were the bleak
economic scenario painted by the Estrada administration, the
recession in Japan and the jitters in the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Top Mafia Fixer Arrested in Marbella </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A top Mafia business fixer was
arrested at his luxury villa in Marbella Tuesday, the ANSA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Martello, 50, fled the country last month when
Palermo prosecutors issued an arrest warrant to capture him on
charges of rigging billion-lire (million-dollar) auctions in favor
of firms linked to long-sought chieftain Bernardo Provenzano, one
of the older Mafia leaders still at large and top of the Italian
police's most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
Martello was arrested by Italian police working through
Interpol, ANSA quoted Italian police sources as saying. The
arrest was made with the help of Spanish police.
</P>
<P>
Martello first fled Italy in May 1993 when Palermo prosecutors
issued an arrest warrant that was later revoked.
</P>
<P>
He also faces other charges including buying a contract for
Cosa Nostra-linked firms to enlarge a waste disposal site outside
Palermo in 1990.

JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia's net foreign
exchange reserves until July 31 reached 14.198 billion U.S.
dollars, down by 20.3 million dollars from the previous week, the
local press Wednesday quoted the central bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drop in foreign exchange reserves was mainly caused by
repayment of the government's foreign debts despite earnings from
oil export, the central bank said.

However, the foreign exchange reserves still exceeded the
International Monetary Fund-set minimum limit of 13.4 billion
dollars, it added.

<HEADLINE> Border Tension Reappears Between Costa Rica, Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican authorities
reacted cautiously on Tuesday to Nicaragua's decision to impose
new navigation restrictions in the border river San Juan.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua suspended free navigation in the river on Monday
following a heavy deployment ordered by Costa Rican President
Arnoldo Aleman, who navigated along the river.
</P>
<P>
Under current treaties, the 300-kilometer section of the river,
which separates Costa Rica from Nicaragua, is under Nicaraguan
sovereignty, but Costa Rica has the right of free navigation
through this waterway.
</P>
<P>
A conflict arose three weeks ago when Nicaragua forbade Costa
Rican armed forces from navigating the river with weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican Ministry of Public Safety and Nicaragua's
Defense Ministry reached an agreement last week, under which Costa
Rican police officers can keep on navigating the river carrying
weapons, but they should inform Nicaragua before hand.
</P>
<P>
This agreement, however, met with strong opposition from
Nicaragua's political sectors, which made president Arnoldo Aleman
say that it was just a simple "press release."
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua also prevented Costa Rican press from going with
president Aleman during his navigation of the river on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The step was seen as a violation of the right to free
navigation that Costa Rica has.
</P>
<P>
But Costa Rican Public Safety Minister Juan Rafael Lizano chose
not to comment on the situation, following Foreign Minister
Roberto Rojas's suit.

<HEADLINE> Worst May Be Over for Philippine Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy could have
bottomed out in the second quarter of this year and will gradually
pick up from the second half of the year as interest rates ease,
Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published here Wednesday, Medalla said economic
growth in the second quarter is expected to have been slower than
in the first quarter, reflecting the full effect of the prolonged
drought brought about by El Nino and the regional financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the second quarter will be the worst (period for
the economy), then (we expect) some recovery after that," Medalla
said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the country's gross national product
(GNP) grew by 2.5 percent and its gross domestic product (GDP) by
1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the economic growth in the second quarter is "not
going to be better than the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be surprised if the economy in the second quarter
performed better than the first," he said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data, including industrial output and sales and
farm production, have not been encouraging, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the thing to stress is we're not heading toward a
recession. What we have is a slowdown. Even signs of recession, we
still don't have those," he said.

<HEADLINE> Historic Indian Treaty Signed in Canada's B.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- An historic treaty between Nisga's
Indians and the government was signed in the Canadian province of
British Columbia Tuesday, giving the natives rights to their own
land.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Nisga'a, the federal and provincial
governments said the treaty signals a reconciliation after many
years of pain and distrust, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty gives the Nisga's 1,930 square kilometers of land in
the lower Nass Valley hundreds of kilometers northwest of
Vancouver, and self-government akin to municipal governments and
about 125 million U.S. dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
The Nisga'a get resource rights over their lands. They can set
up their own courts. But Canada's Criminal Code and Constitution
applies to the Nisga's.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Nisga's will give up their tax-exempt status and
further claims, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Nisga'a have been demanding ownership of their territory
for over 100 years, and never wavered in their fights to win land
rights.
</P>
<P>
They reached an agreement in principle with the provincial and
federal governments in February 1996 and the three sides shook
hands on the final deal about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
However, before going into effect, the treaty initialed Tuesday
must be approved by the nearly 5,500 Nisga'a, Canada's Parliament
and British Columbia's provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
If it is ratified, it would become the first land claims
settlement in the Canadian province this century, and could serve
as an example for talks with some 50 other tribes, the reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Seven People Still Missing after House Explosion in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Seven residents are still missing
after a possible gas explosion reduced a four-storey apartment
house to rubble early Tuesday morning in a western district of
Berlin, German police said Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
About 400 rescue workers, helped by dozens of specially trained
dogs and special radar equipment, are now busy in searching for a
13-year-old boy and a 66-year-old retired couple who are believed
to be still trapped in the debris.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers said that their special equipment had detected
sounds of possible heart beatings under the debris. However, the
rescue operations have been going slowly because rescuers had to
move the rubble by hand for fear of further collapse.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 registered tenants of the apartment house, some had
already gone to work when the explosion occurred at about 6:00
a.m. Tuesday. Several others were found either on vacation or
having moved out of the residential block.
</P>
<P>
Among those in the building, a 33-year-old university student
was rescued several hours after the explosion and several other
survivors had managed to free themselves out of the debris later
in the day, police said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that the accident might have been caused by
technical defect in gas pipes in the basement of the building, but
the determination of the exact cause would probably take several
months. The rescue operations were expected to last until
Wednesday, officials said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reorganizing Air Force for Crisis Deployments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force said
Tuesday that it will remake itself into 10 combat-ready units for
responding to crises around the world.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization over the next 18 months that will involve
more than 2,000 warplanes and support aircraft is aimed at
flexible response in areas while cutting operational tempo that has
battered aircrew morale and contributed to a shortage of Air Force
pilots.
</P>
<P>
Each team will contain 175 aircraft, including 18 F-15C
air-to-air fighters; 10 F-15E ground-attack jets; eight F-16J jets
to suppress enemy antiaircraft missiles; 12 A-10s for armor attack
missions; as well as other surveillance, refueling and transport
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The team will also have F-117 Stealth Fighters, B-52s and B-2
bombers on call, but those will remain at U.S. bases until needed.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, two teams will be ready to deploy quickly
on any kind of mission, remaining on alert for a 90-day period
every 15 months. Others will remain behind, in the United States
or at bases overseas, to train and prepare for future deployments.
Still other specialized units will remain on call, Air Force Chief
of Staff General Michael Ryan said at a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization means the fighters, bombers and support
aircraft from geographically separate units may not be together
all the time, but they will train together and deploy together.
They would be organized under a specific set of commanders
established at 10 so-called "lead" bases, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
But the sites for those bases have not yet been chosen, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization should be implemented by January 1, 2000,
said acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters. He said the
teams "will be able to provide both decisive firepower and
humanitarian support" for the wide variety of missions now
demanded of the service.
</P>
<P>
"We finally got the message. Some of these contingencies are
not going to go away," Ryan said, calling the move "an integration
of our total Air Force, something we haven't done in the past."
