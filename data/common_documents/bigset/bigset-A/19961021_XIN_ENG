<HEADLINE> Escaped IRA Bomber Found Living in Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- One of Britain's most wanted
Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombers, who was on the run for more
than 10 years, has been found living in the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Dermot McNally, who escaped during a massive breakout from
Northern Ireland' Maze prison in 1983 while serving three life
sentences for bombing and other terrorist offenses, has been found
living under his own name less than miles from the border with
Northern Ireland, according local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The IRA bomber boasted last week that he would remain a free
man because of the Irish authorities' inaction and a loophole in
the extradition laws.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that this case is really a huge
embarrassment to the Irish government at a time when other Maze
escapees are being successfully extradited from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench committee
on Northern Ireland, was quoted as saying that he would raise the
matter with Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew and the
Irish government.
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely horrified and regard this as a matter of very
grave concern. There is a clear-cut case for extraditing him and
in today's climate I would expect the maximum cooperation from the
Irish government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Office confirmed Saturday that
McNally was still "at large" and a spokesman for the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said that he would be arrested if found in Northern
Ireland.

ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan managed a 1-1 draw
against Azerbaijan in the hockey tournament of the International
Islamic Women Invitational Games held in Islamabad's twin city of
Rawalpindi on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A field goal by skipper Robina Nasreen a minute from the end
earned Pakistan the score on the first day of the women's games.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan had gone 1-0 up, nine minutes from time against
Pakistan when Zohra, also the team captain for the visitors,
neatly converted a penalty stroke.
</P>
<P>
But Pakistan's persistent attacks in search of an equaliser
paid off through Robina Nasreen.
</P>
<P>
In the other match of the hockey competition, Uzbekistan upset

TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) achieved its election target of 235 seats in the Lower
House in the election today, but was still short of a clear
majority, Japan Broadcasting Corp.(NHK) reported.

With only eight seats still undecided, the LDP had won 238 as

The results indicated that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was
virtually assured of reelection, but his party will have to remain
in a coalition government as it has for the past two and a half
years.

ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Rashid Dostum, leader of
Afghan Uzbek Militia, today held talks with visiting Pakistani
Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar in Mazar-i-Sharif, Dostum's
headquarters in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Mazar-i-Sharif said that Dostum and Babar
had detailed discussions about the prevailing situation in
Afghanistan, especially the military situation near Kabul and the
possibility of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Dostum's spokesman Mohammad Yousif said that the visit was the
fifth in a week by Babar to Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Yousif said in Mazar-i-Sharif today that a decision had been
expected at the meeting on whether the Taliban Militia, which
overran Kabul on September 27, would agree to a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
He also renewed the denial that Dostum's army was backing the
forces of the ousted government troops led by Ahmad Shah Masood in
the battle with the Taliban north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Dostum, Babar said that Pakistan was not
meddling in Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We are bringing the Afghan nation together," he said. "This is
not interference."
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with Dostum were "positive".
</P>
<P>
Babar later flew to the southern Taliban stronghold of
Kandahar.

<HEADLINE> UK-Argentine Arms-for-Oil Deal Unveiled by Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
agreed to a secret plan to re-equip the Argentine navy in return
for a lucrative deal to explore for oil in the disputed waters
around the Falklands (Malvinas).
</P>
<P>
The British government ministers do not want to reveal the
intended relaxation of its weapons embargo against Argentina
because of the controversy sparked by a similar move in the "arms
to Iraq" affair, according to a report carried in today's Observer
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed deal, the Rolls-Royce will be allowed to
open negotiations to export key components to the Argentine navy
which will enable it to repair engines in six of its major
warships.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government in return will approve a three-way
deal to give British companies access to the potential oil
bonanzas in the South Atlantic and exploration licenses will be
awarded on October 28.
</P>
<P>
Reuter quoted a spokesmen of Britain's Department of Trade and
Industry as saying earlier today that there were no changes in
Britain' arms embargo against Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"The embargo is in place. Its existence and policy on its
applications on defense sales is kept under regular review," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Reacts to Elections Day Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenneth Kaunda, former republican
president and leader of Zambia's major opposition party, the United
Independence Party, will make a statement as a reaction to president
Frederick Chiluba's announcement of the general elections day slated
for November 18.
</P>
<P>
The local daily ''Sunday Mail'' quoted Kaunda as saying that his
statement will be made next week after a party central committee
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Anoter opposition party, the Zambia Democratic Congress, has
expressed welcome to the announcement of the elections day but claimed
that President Chiluba has betroyed the people by extending his term
of office which expires by October 31, according to the same daily
report.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba announced at a public rally on Saturday that the
country's presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on
November 18.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''I remain president before, during and after elections
until I hand over to another president or to myself.''
</P>
<P>
In his announcement, Chiluba stressed that the elections will be
held on the 1996 constitution and his government will not be
intimidated by anyone.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 constitution stipupates that only the second indigenous
generation Zambians are qualified to be the republican president. this
actually bars Kaunda from running for the presidency as his parents
were immigrants from neighboring Malawi before Zambia won
independence.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have argued that the 1996 constitution is not
just and they have demanded the repealing of it. Kaunda has maintained
so far that he will run for the presidency and nothing can stop him.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Leader Lambasts IMF for Dictatorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
yesterday lambasted the International Mometary Fund (IMF) for playing
dictator by withholding funds for Zimbabwe's second phase of the
economic reform programme.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Mugabe said bodies like the IMF and the world bank
should not dictate terms to governments but ''should be partners in
development programmes''.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF is our organization, so is the World Bank and even the
United Nations. It (the IMF) should not be in a blind dictator who
does not look at the (adverse) effects of the policies emanating from
it. the harshness of the policies is what we critize,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe pointed out the quarrel with the IMF is about ''the severity
of the measures that it prescribes -- measures made purely on
viewpoints, which may be wrong''.
</P>
<P>
When the economic reform programme was launched, it was against a
background of social, economic and educational backwardness of the
majority of Zimbabweans created by the colonial history, which had to
be corrected, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We explained all this to the IMF saying it means the provision
of billions of Dollars. But the IMF said 'no' and that is where we
disagreed,'' Mugabe said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, yesterday paid a
one-day visit to Swaziland, offering the IMF's technical assistance
with the swazi government.
</P>
<P>
In a private meeting with Swazi Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini and
cabinet ministers in mbabane, capital of the kingdom, Camdessus said
he endorsed the swazi government's efforts to correct ''the dangerous
trends of the country's economy... declining growth and increasing
public expenditure', said sources reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus praised dlamini, who was an IMF regional director until
his recent appointment as swazi prime minister, for the measures the
Swazi government had taken to avoid an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the Swazi government, on its own initiative, was adopting
voluntary structural adjustment measures to safeguard the country's
economy in a ''professional and efficient'' way.

<HEADLINE> afg102023hke-- Kenya Alarmed by Medics' Migration to Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 200 Kenyan doctors
have left their home country to work in southern Africa over the past
two years, aggravating the crisis of medics shortage in public
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The ''Sunday Nation'' newspaper today quoted Khama Rogo, Chairman
of the Kenya Medical Association, as saying, ''it's indeed a very
worrying trend,'' adding that ''we are losing all our young doctors to
the south.''
</P>
<P>
In what the association describes as a ''mass exodus'', the mainly
young medics are being lured by higher salary and better working and
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Khama rogo confirmed that the exodus doctors are mainly moving on
to southern africa, including Lesotho, Botswana and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the flight down south was precipitated by the
fruitless 1994 strike by government doctors demanding the registration
of their trade union.
</P>
<P>
Nearly the entire committee members of the spurned Kenya Medical
Practitioners and Dentists Union have migrated to southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 4,000 doctors registered in the east African
country, fewer that 1,000 are working in the public hospitals, where
80 percent of kenyans are relying on for health care.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: LDP To Form New Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) won 239 seats in Sunday's House of Representative
election, far topping its preelection strength of 211, but failed
to capture a clear majority in the 500-seat lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
The party remained Japan's largest political party, but was 12
seats short of garnering enough seats to end the nation's three
years of coalition rule.
</P>
<P>
The LDP's performance secured Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's continued premiership, although the LDP is expected to
seek alliance with other parties, including the current coalition
partners -- the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party
Sakigake, to form another coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, appearing in nationally televised TV interview
Sunday night, said, "After all the election results become known,
I think I will have to start talking with other parties about
policies."
</P>
<P>
LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato also told the press that his
party will ask the SDP and Sakigake to join in talks at the
secretary general level to discuss the possibility to forming a
new coalition.
</P>
<P>
But the LDP's links with the SDP could dissolve, because SDP
head Takako Doi, a former lower house speaker who returned to lead
the party, said on the campaign trail that her party would not
take posts in the next cabinet.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Doi said she will honor her campaign
promises.
</P>
<P>
In the election, the main opposition New Frontier Party (NFP),
however, was unable to maintain its preelection strength of 160
seats. It took 156 seats in the new lower house.
</P>
<P>
The newly created Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) attained 52
seats, the same number the party had before the poll, while the
Japanese Communist Party (JCP) advanced to 26 from 15.
</P>
<P>
The SDP and Sakigake lost a number of seats, only winning 15
and 2 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, Doi, Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the NFP, Yukio Hatoyama
and Naoto Kan, co-leaders of the newly formed DPJ, and JCP leader
Tetsuzu Fuwa all won their seats in the house. But Sakigake chief
Shoichi Ide lost his reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
Voters turnout in the election slipped to a record low of 59
percent, according to Kyodo News. The previous low was 67.3
percent posted in the previous general election in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
The poll was the first to be contested under a new electoral
system that could mark the beginning of a realignment in Japanese
politics. The new system of 300 single-seat voting districts and
200 proportional representation seats replaces the 511-seat lower
house elected under a 70-year-old multiple-seat constituency
system.
</P>
<P>
The electoral change was intended to end "politics as usual"
and allow a viable two-party system to emerge in the country.
Theoretically, the two parties would offer voters clear choices on
major issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
The fresh method was also introduced to rectify a system in
which thinly populated rural constituencies enjoyed more clout
than urban area.
</P>
<P>
The races in single-seat constituencies drew 1,503 aspirants,
including a record of 153 women. Of the total, 1,261 candidates
ran in single-seat constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Belgians Demonstrate for Fairer Judicial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian capital of
Brussels has seen the biggest demonstration ever when more than a
quarter of a million ordinary people took to the street today to
demand reform of the country's justice system and better state
protection of children.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also protested against the supreme court's
removal of a judge overseeing a case of child sex-abuse and murder
and alleged the authorities had mishandled the investigation.
</P>
<P>
During the last week, demonstrations broke out spontaneously
after the Belgian top court removed a judge who believed to be
able to bring to justice those involved in the paedophile ring.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration today was organized by the parents of the
victims of convicted child rapist and suspected murderer Marc
Dutroux and his alleged accomplice Michel Nihoul.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the bodies of four tortured and starved girls
in hidden dungeons in properties owned by Dutroux last August
deeply shocked the country, provoking an unprecedented crisis of
popular confidence in governing institutions.
</P>
<P>
Anger at the incompetence of the complicated legal system
reached new heights after the supreme court moved investigating
judge Jean-Marc Connerotte off the Dutroux case, accusing him of
bias.
</P>
<P>
During the march today, demonstrators, clutching flowers and
white baloons, listened intently as the families of the murdered
and missing children appealed for justice and fundamental reform
of the political and judicial systems which have failed to stop
the child sex and murder ring.
</P>
<P>
Many people in the march believed the authorities had not acted
decisively either on this case or on a series of unresolved
corruption and criminal investigations over the past decade.

<HEADLINE> More Companies Worry About Computer Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 percent of the
executives who oversee data systems for major companies in the
United States say they lack confidence in the security of their
networks, the USA TODAY reported today.
</P>
<P>
A poll of 1,320 executives conducted by a professional survey
company found significant increases in problems from computer
viruses and hackers -- especially from fired employees,
no-longer-used temporary employees, and corporate spies.
</P>
<P>
Respondents reporting losses due to computer viruses jumped
from 8 percent in 1995 to 24 percent, when the survey was conducted
in August and September, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
About 32 percent of the respondents said they discovered
serious losses due to malicious acts by company insiders -- nearly
twice the number reported last year. That increase could be tied
to the growth of corporate layoffs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Another 18 percent of the respondents reported problems from
outside hackers. Computer security systems appear to be
increasingly vulnerable to attack as more companies open sites on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
About 34 percent say they use the Internet for business
purposes, up from 26 percent last year. But 40 percent of the
users said they depended on an outside service provider -- such as
America On-Line or CompuServe -- for the service, and for
security.
</P>
<P>
One in four of the respondents said that someone had tried to
break into their networks via the Internet over the last year.
</P>
<P>
Only about 31 percent said they could determine when a hacker
tries to access the company system from the Net. And 74 percent
said they haven't designated a special group to respond to such
incidents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 6 percent reported problems from industrial
espionage. The figure may be low, because the good spies don't get
caught, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Russia Willing to Expand Trade With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Federation Council
Chairman, Yegor Semeonovich Stroyev, said in Beijing today that
Russia is willing to expand economic and trade co-operation with
China, and especially to increase contacts between localities of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meeting representatives from Chinese industrial and business
circles, Stroyev said that while undertaking the construction of
its market economy, Russia is willing to establish a broad contact
with other countries, and has always stressed the development of
economic and trade links with China.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, he pointed out, trade volumes between the
two countries have been hovering at around five to six billion US
dollars annually, which is relatively small for two nations with a
shared border of 4,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The two nations are complementary in their economies, and they
have carried out fruitful co-operation in various sectors, Stroyev
said, expressing "full confidence" over the prospects of future
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation Council, the legislature of the nation,
is willing to pave the way for economic and trade co-operation
between the two countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Active in ASEAN Regional Forum: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today in Beijing that the
relationship between China and ASEAN has entered a new stage this
year, with China becoming a full dialogue partner of the
association.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Izhar Ibrahim, director-general of political affairs of
the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Qian noted that China's ties with
ASEAN member countries have witnessed sound progress.
</P>
<P>
Through Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), economic
co-operation between China and Indonesia has increased, and
likewise, communication and contact between them have risen, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
China is actively taking part in the activities of the ASEAN
regional forum, and is devoting itself to the establishment and
popularization of the concept of regional peace along with ASEAN
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proven, he pointed out, that APEC is an original
creation for regional economic co-operation, which caters to the
diversity and specific situation of the region.
</P>
<P>
He continued that as two biggest developing countries of APEC,
China and Indonesia bear the same responsibilities of upholding
the spirit of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim agreed with Qian, expressing the belief that China will
play an ever increasingly important role in cooperation with ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim and his party arrived in China on Sunday for the fourth
consultation between ministries of the two states.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxuan, held talks with Ibrahim
today, and they exchanged views on bilateral ties and on
international and regional issues of common concern. They also
reached a principled agreement on the maintenance of an
Indonesian consulate in Hong Kong after China resumes its exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Minister: Oil, Gas Remain Staple Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Oil and natural gas will remain
the primal source of global energy for another century, Egyptian
Minister of Petroleum Hamdi el Banbi told the 13th Oil Conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected that the world demand on oil would rise by
2 percent annually, saying that the current output exceeded demand
by 2 million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Supply will keep ahead of demand till 2005 but it can fall
short by over 10 million bpd by 2010, he sounded the warning at
the opening session of the 13th Oil Conference, a bi-annual event
organized by the General Egyptian Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even if some new sources replace oil to cover the
energy shortage, they can not substitute oil in fields that have
direct impact on human life, he said.
</P>
<P>
The convocation of the conference, considered an important
chance to lure foreign investors to Egypt, coincides with the
110th anniversary of the establishment of the oil industry in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry, one of the four largest foreign currency
earners in Egypt, produced 50 percent of the country's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas industry has witnessed noticeable growth, with
crude oil and gas output reaching 44.1 million tons and 9.9
million tons respectively in 1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate domestic consumption of oil products and natural
gas reached about 30.65 million tons this year, up by 7.4 percent
over last year, according to a report by the general Egyptian Oil
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has signed 277 oil exploration agreements with foreign
companies, with a total foreign investment of 17.2 billion
dollars. So far, 61 new oil fields have been found.
</P>
<P>
Banbi attributed the increase in oil finds and agreements to
the domestic stability and security.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was among the first countries to extract oil from the Red
Sea, but production only began in 1910.
</P>
<P>
The first oil refinery in the Middle East was built in Suez in
1911, when the world production of oil did not exceed 400,000
bpd.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Three countries have
given their reservations about a proposed accord on free movement
of nationals of the 12-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC) within the region.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive-General Kaire Mbuende names the three states as
South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. He gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende told the press today in Goborone that relaxation of
travel restrictions is inevitable if southern Africa is to grow
into a formidable player in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC draft protocol is intended to remove
obstacles on the free movement of capital and labor, goods and
services, and people among the 12 countries in the sub-regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
The SADC chief said the accord will be implemented gradually
in three phases.
</P>
<P>
In the first step, visa restrictions will be abolished,
followed by granting rights of residence.
</P>
<P>
The third phase will see the introduction of commercial,
employment and trade guidelines for SADC nationals in the region.
</P>
<P>
SADC was formed in 1992 aimed at creating a free trade area in
southern Africa by the year 2000.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Results from Japan's national elections on Sunday gave a
major victory to the party that has dominated the country for
most of the postwar era and that has been most reluctant to open
up Japan to far-reaching change.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Republican nominee Robert Dole proposed a series of
restrictions on political fund-raising Sunday as he and his
Republican surrogates kept the spotlight on what he says is
another area in which the ethical lapses of the Clinton
administration have been exposed.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The continuing deficit in U.S. international trade may
foreshadow a grim report on third-quarter economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The August deficit in goods and services narrowed to 10.83
billion dollars, the Commerce Department reported, but because the
July figure, at 11.60 billion dollars, was the largest in almost
five years, the change isn't much to brag about, analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Russian Federation Council Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today met Yegor Semeonovich Stroyev, chairman of the Russian
Federation Council, and his party.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev extended Russian President Boris Yeltsin's regards to
Jiang, and Jiang also asked Stroyev to pass on his regards to
Yeltsin, and wished Yeltsin a speedy recovery.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed Stroyev and his party to Beijing, and said that
exchanges between the two parliaments are an important component
of Sino-Russian ties. He believed that Stroyev's current visit
will become a milestone in exchanges between the two parliaments,
and will advance the development of Sino-Russian friendship.
</P>
<P>
When President Yeltsin visited China in April of this year, the
two countries decided to develop a strategic partnership towards
the 21st century, promoting bilateral relations to a new level,
noted Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed his belief that with the joint efforts of
the two parliaments, and of people from various sectors,
Sino-Russian friendly co-operation ties in every area will be more
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said that this is his first China tour, bringing the
friendship of Russian people to Chinese People.
</P>
<P>
Russia pays close attention to China's development with great
interest, and hopes that Russia-China ties in politics, economy
and other fields, will be more stable and consolidated, noted
Stroyev, adding his council is willing to create good conditions
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the meeting were Cao Zhi,
secretary-general of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress, and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations previously slated to be held in Eilat, Israel, have
been indefinitely postponed.
</P>
<P>
Israel has suggested the talks be moved to places near
Jerusalem in order to keep in constant touch with its negotiating
team, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported, citing an
Israel Radio report this morning.
</P>
<P>
The postponement came when the sluggish negotiations entered
the third week on Israel's troop redeployment from the West Bank
city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the two sides have agreed on all security
arrangements for the Israeli pullout from Hebron and only minor
issues regarding the civilian administration of the city remain to
be resolved.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has warned the
Israelis not to negotiate previously agreed issues, adding that
there will be no partitioning of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He told the Palestinian negotiating delegation that the current
negotiations are aimed at forging a mechanism for implementing the
signed accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israel-PLO agreement signed last September, Israeli
troops would have withdrawn seven months ago from Hebron, the last
West Bank town under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The pullout was delayed first due to a series of attacks by
Hamas in Israel, then by the hardline policies adopted by the
government dominated by the Likud party, whose Chairman Binyamin
Netanyahu rose to power by winning Israel's general elections in
May.
</P>
<P>
Israel is pushing for tougher security arrangements for the 450
Jewish settlers who live among 200,000 Palestinians in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
It wants to retain the right to send troops into the self-rule
area to pursue extremist suspects and to set up buffer zones in
parts of the city still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Besides Hebron, Minister of Local Administration at the
Palestinian National Authority Saeb Orekat said that there are
other commitments the Israelis have to abide by, such as Gaza
airport, security passages, the release of the Palestinian
detainees and water.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, who is mediating in the talks, has
threatened to return to the United States if no "significant
progress" is made immediately.
</P>
<P>
The on-and-off peace talks resumed after a four-way Washington
Summit decided to heal wounds from last month's rioting in Israel,
which killed 79 people.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani PM Sends Envoy to Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrived here today with
a message from Bhutto for Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani in a bid to iron out differences on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani envoy, Zafar Helali, said that Pakistan will
never turn its back to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Helali made the remarks when meeting with Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister Allaedin Boroujerdi.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan maintains that Tehran and Islamabad should constantly
cooperate and exchange views on issues relevant to Afghanistan,"
he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran has time and again accused Pakistan of supporting the
militant Taliban students in Afghanistan in the fight against the
ousted government headed by Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran reportedly maintains that the Taliban is a hand-raised
group. It has flourished as a result of U.S. planning, Saudi
financial support and Pakistan's logistical backing.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the Afghan capital of Kabul by the Taliban has
strained the relations between Tehran and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
While expressing concern about the current fighting in
Afghanistan, Helali said his country is ready for any kind of
negotiation in this connection.
</P>
<P>
He also announced his country is interested in having serious
cooperation with Iran to settle the current problems in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his regret over the events which led to the current
fighting in Afghanistan, Boroujerdi said Iran believes that no
incident can undermine the ties between the two Moslem and
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran had done its best not to let the current
developments in Afghanistan adversely affect Tehran-Islamabad
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official stressed that if due attention is not
paid to the realities in Afghanistan as the foundation of peace
in the country, the crisis will persist.
</P>
<P>
Describing exchange of views in all fields between the two
countries as beneficial, Boroujerdi said Iran has accepted
regional cooperation as a suitable channel for regional
security.

Algiers Ali Boucetta was killed today in a shootout between

</P>
<P>
ASP, the official news agency of Algeria also reported that

shootout, which lasted from this morning till this afternoon.
</P>
<P>

after the elected Islamic municipal authorities were outlawed by
the army in 1992.

<HEADLINE> New Party Advocating Taiwan Independence Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the State Council today called the newly
established "Taiwan Independence Party" a reactionary political
organization, with the explicit purpose of splitting the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the party, established by a handful of
extremists advocating "independence of Taiwan", openly claim that
Taiwan is not part of China. The party takes "the establishment of
a new and independent Republic of Taiwan" as its "unchanging
paramount purpose", which demonstrates the reactionary nature of
the party, said the spokesman in Beijing. "Their scheme will never
succeed," he added.
</P>
<P>
What merits attention, the spokesman stressed, is that the
Taiwan authorities parading themselves against "the independence
of Taiwan" have tolerated, and even winked at, rather than
prohibited, the establishment of the "Taiwan Independence Party".
</P>
<P>
The official noted the attitudes of the Taiwan authorities show
that its professed stand against Taiwan's independence is a
two-faced tactic.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan authorities to take effective measures to
fight against attempts for Taiwan independence as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the Chinese people, including
Taiwan compatriots, firmly oppose evil activities to split the
motherland by the creation of "independence of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
With the Chinese people's struggle against separation of the
nation, and the independence of Taiwan, the vast majority of
people in Taiwan have fully recognized the fact that "the
independence of Taiwan" will lead to a dead end, the spokesman
elaborated.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Chinese government, and people, will not sit
idly by, and remain indifferent to any attempt to achieve
"independence of Taiwan" and the creation of "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman finally called for unity of all the Chinese
people, including Taiwan compatriots, to fight against any schemes
and activities to split the nation, and to continually promote the
development of ties across the Taiwan Straits, and fight for the
cause of reunification of the motherland as early as possible.

<HEADLINE> EDS-mored details added Chinese, German Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that Sino-German relations
have returned to normal after experiencing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Beijing, Qian said that as long as China and
Germany handle problems in bilateral relations, in accordance with
the principles guiding the development of bilateral relations, the
development of Sino-German relations can have broad prospects.
</P>
<P>
Noting that relations between the two countries experienced
twists and difficulties during a previous period, Qian said they
are again on a normal and healthy development track. The
vice-premier added that he hoped that bilateral relations can have
a long-term and steady development.
</P>
<P>
Qian was making his remarks during talks with German Federal
Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, who arrived
in Beijing today as Qian's guest. Kinkel is leading a business
delegation consisting of dozens of members.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Kinkel, Qian recalled his recent
fruitful talks with Kinkel in New York, and said he is ready to
exchange opinions in Beijing with his German counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that German Federal President Roman Herzog's visit to
China next month will be an important event in bilateral ties, and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is looking forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>
The constant contact and exchange visits between leaders of the
two sides are of significance for promoting mutual understanding,
and developing bilateral friendship and cooperation, added Qian.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that China is a great and important country, and
Germany is making efforts for the development of good cooperation
with China in politics, economy, culture and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
President Herzog said he was glad to have the opportunity to
visit China, Kinkel continued.
</P>
<P>
On issues of Taiwan and Tibet, Kinkel said, his government
adheres to a "one China" policy, which has gained support from
various circles in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers held that China and Germany should
make joint efforts to push forward the development of economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation for Germany's stand on free trade
and anti-protectionism, Qian said he hopes that Germany, as one of
China's major trade partners, will continue to play a positive
role in promoting trade between China and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Kinkel noted that Germany will make efforts to remove obstacles
in EU-China trade, and supports an early entry by China into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed other issues in bilateral
relations and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan was present at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Seeks Continued Tie-up with SDP, Sakigake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
today tried to persuade his two partners in the outgoing coalition
government to join a new alliance after failing to secure a
majority in Sunday's general election.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, 59, head of the conservative Liberal Democratic
Party, met Takako Doi, head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP),
and Schoichi Ide, chief of New Party Sakigake, according to Kyodo
News reports.
</P>
<P>
But Doi and Ide gave mixed responses during their 50-minute
meeting, the news agency said, quoting coalition officials.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's LDP, the main partner in the three-way coalition,
won 239 seats in Sunday's House of Representatives election, 28
seats more than in the last parliament, but 12 short of the 251
seats it needs to govern alone in the 500-seat lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is now trying to form a coalition government to run the
country. Doi, a former lower house speaker, told Hashimoto she
would consult with the party on Tuesday and Wednesday, but said it
would be difficult for her party to keep the same coalition status
as it had before the poll.
</P>
<P>
Sakigake leader Ide, who lost his seat in the election, said
his party would remain in the LDP-led coalition if an incoming
government was fully committed to administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
While the LDP gained 28 seats in Sunday's election, the SDP and
Sakigake suffered major setbacks. The SDP lost half of its 30
seats in the outgoing lower house, while Sakigake lost seven of
its nine seats.
</P>
<P>
Despite the SDP's and Sakigake's poor election performance,
Hashimoto told a press conference before his meeting with Doi and
Ide that the tripartite government bloc had won the public's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
A veteran political analyst said the LDP will have no choice
but to form a coalition government with its current two partners.
</P>
<P>
However, given the SDP and Sakigake's setbacks in the poll, the
coalition would be weak, Minotu Morita told a briefing at the
Foreign Press Center.
</P>
<P>
Morita said the new Democratic Party of Japan, which was only
formed a month before the election and which won 52 seats in the
new parliament, would not want to cooperate with the LDP having
seen the losses suffered by its SDP and Sakigake partners in
Sunday's election.

<HEADLINE> Evening Party Held to Commemorate Long March Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A grand music and dance party
was held in the Great Hall of People in Beijing this evening to
commemorate the 60th anniversary of the victory of the Red Army's
Long March.
</P>
<P>
Top party and state leaders, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li
Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Li Huaqing and Hu Jintao, watched the
performance along with a 10,000 strong audience.
</P>
<P>
One hundred representatives of Long March veterans were also
present at the event.
</P>
<P>
Sixty years ago, the Red Army, led by the CPC, covered 12,500
kilometers, trekking through more than a dozen provinces and
municipalities, defeating numerous attacks by Kuomintang forces,
and became strong through their great and historic feat.
</P>
<P>
It was during the event that Mao Zedong's position as the core
of the first generation of the CPC leadership was firmly
established.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing reform and opening up in China, started by Deng
Xiaoping, core of the second generation of CPC leadership, in
1978, and currently lead by the third generation of the CPC
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core, was eulogized in the
evening party as "the New Long March."
</P>
<P>
Actors with high resemblances of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Zhu
De, appeared at the party and played several historic moments in
the lives of the late leaders. The actor portraying Deng Xiaoping
waved hands with soldiers; and recordings of Jiang Zemin's speech
calling for the party and all the people to "struggle for the
realization of the country's cross-century goal" were played.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the party, three giant pictures of Mao, Deng and
Jiang descended from the top of the stage, and were met with
thunderous applause.

<HEADLINE> New York Economy Starts to Bounce Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The economy of New York City,
which has foundered since the recession of the early 1990s, has
begun to crawl back towards prosperity, according to a report of
the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the city's production of goods
and services grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, the highest
for the first six months of any year since 1988.
</P>
<P>
From january to August, 32,000 new jobs were generated in the
city, compared to 9,000 created in the same period of last year.
Also this year, record numbers of tourists are visiting the city,
sending the hotel occupancy rate to the highest level in recent
memory.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the recovery in the city to the boom on
Wall Street, which has led to higher profits in banking and
securities firms. The city is also benefiting from upturns in the
communications, entertainment and software industries, they noted.
</P>
<P>
But economists warned that the new spate of improved economic
figures does not mean that the city is entering an era of robust
expansion.
</P>
<P>
It is a sign of how poorly the city fared in the recession that
many economists are hailing even this new, sluggish growth, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Launch 25-day National Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to launch a 25-day
census beginning from Tuesday in a fear of population explosion
in two decades.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei today called on the
people of the whole nation to take an active part in the
national census.
</P>
<P>
Iranian population authorities have already sounded the alarm
bell for a danger of population explosion as 25 million youngsters
 under 17 are approaching the age of marriage.
</P>
<P>
Iran's population stands at 65 million at present. There
are a large number of children under 16 or 17 and they are
reaching gradually the age of marriage.
</P>
<P>
In other words, 25 million youngsters mean 12.5 million
couples in the future. If each couple have two children,
still they will add 25 million to the population.
</P>
<P>
The past decade witnessed a fast growth of population which
has been doubled from 34 million in 1976 to 65 million, despite
the fact that Iran's oil export income dropped by half.
</P>
<P>
The population growth, therefore, has posed a grave threat to
the development of the national economy and other social
development.
</P>
<P>
Specialists warned that the population would be doubled again
in 20 or 25 years, thus naturally aggravating the conditions
and constituting pressure upon the decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
Iran conducts public census on population and housing every 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei urged the people to offer accurate and precise
response to the census takers calling at their homes, stressing
the significant role of census in reconstruction and development
planning.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's statistics system faces many deficiencies,
lacking the required high capability. Consequently, the data
needed for economic planning are not adequately presented or
are outdated with a high error margin.
</P>
<P>
These problems in turn disrupt the country's economic and
industrial system.

PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- France has for the first time

Iraq, Agence France Presse(AFP) quoted a U.S. Air Force official
as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Bourland, a spokesman for the

<P>
But the French have refused to fly to the 33rd parallel, the
boundary of an extended no-fly zone imposed by the United States
last month in retaliation for an Iraqi military incursion into
Northern Kurdish areas, AFP reported.
</P>
<P>
The Arab newspaper Al-Hayat said that France had asked the
United States to let it take part in reconnaissance missions in
southern Iraq in late September to test the accuracy of
intelligence provided by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Until now, French warplanes have only joined in escort missions
for U.S. and British fighters over southern Iraq in the ``Southern
Watch'' operation, although France has been joining reconnaissance
missions over northern Iraq in the ``Provide Comfort'' operation.
</P>
<P>
Eight French Mirage F1-CR combat aircraft arrived in the Saudi
air base in Kharj, 100 kilometers south of Riyadh last weekend to
join six French fighters already based there, AFP quoted
diplomatic sources in Riyadh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kharj has now become the new allied air base in Saudi Arabia
for" Southern Watch" for the United States, Britain and France,
which abandoned their air base in Dhahran, northeast Saudi Arabia
after a bomb-attack in the nearby town of Khobar in June killed 19
U.S. soldiers and wounded many others.
</P>
<P>
The two no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq were
established by the allies after the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> More Iraqi Refugees Arrive in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 7,000 Iraqi Kurdish
refugees crossed Iran's Bashmaq and Siranband border strips Sunday
night following recent developments in northern Iraq, the
official news agency IRNA said here today.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported that 5,000 of the refugees have been accommodated
at Siranband refugee camp of Baneh and 2,000 at Bashmaq of
Marivan in the western province of Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
The report said that thousands of Iraqi Kurds are moving
towards Iran for fear of a renewed attack by the Iraqi army and
forces of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi refugees fled to Iran a month ago after forces of
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) pulled out of northern
Iraq in the wake of a joint assault by the KDP and Iraqi
government forces.
</P>
<P>
At present, 52,000 Kurds are sheltered at the Iranian
border camps of Siranband and Bashmaq.

<P>
SARAJEVO, Oct 21 (Xinhua) -- Three civilians were killed and
seven wounded Sunday in two separate mine explosions in
northeastern Bosnia, the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed near the town of Gradacac and another
two wounded when one of them stepped on a mine. In a separate
incident some 15 kilometers from Gradacac, one person was killed
and five injured when their tractor hit a mine.
</P>
<P>
Both incidents happened in the demilitarized zone in the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
"These incidents are a tragic reminder that there are far too
many mines... that pollute this country and continue to maim and
kill innocent civilians," IFOR spokesman Simon Haselock said.
</P>
<P>
He said IFOR would try its best to help all sides of Bosnia to
mark and remove mines, adding that the Bosnian people must press
the government to work diligently to make the region
mine-free.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia is littered with thousands of mines left over from the
three-and-a-half-year war which ended last December.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Quotes Added Chinese, Colombian Presidents Confer in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Colombian President Ernesto Samper Pizano held talks today in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes the current visit of Samper will be a
major contribution to the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Samper is the first Colombian head of state to visit China. He
paid a visit to China in 1987 as president of the Liberal Party of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that Sino-Colombian relations have developed
steadily and smoothly since the two countries set up diplomatic
links in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Colombia are developing countries around the
Pacific area, and both countries are faced with the tasks of
maintaining world peace, promoting economic growth, and improving
the living standard of their people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China and Colombia share views on many major international
issues, and the two countries are conducting fruitful cooperation
in international affairs, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"We admire the just position of the Colombian government to
withstand pressure, oppose external interference, and firmly
safeguard national independence and sovereignty," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Talking about issues concerning the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), Jiang said China "fully understands"
Colombia's wish to join the regional organization.
</P>
<P>
Samper said he has arrived in China at a time when the
Colombian government has decided to retain its consulate-general
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The decision shows that Colombia sticks to the "one-China"
policy, he said. He added that Colombia supports China joining
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president said his country attaches importance to
economic cooperation and trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
He told Jiang that the entrepreneurs accompanying him on the
visit have a big interest in cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that the cooperation between China and
Colombia in economy, trade, technology and culture, have been
increasing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side is satisfied with the development of
bilateral relations, and appreciates the efforts of President
Samper, and the Colombian government, to develop bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang held that Sino-Colombian economic and trade cooperation
has great potential, and that China welcomes more Colombian
business people to invest in China.
</P>
<P>
On the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), Jiang congratulated Colombia
for its effective work as current chair of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The basic purpose of the NAM still has great vitality today,
and China has always attached importance to, and supported the
movement, and has maintained good cooperative relations with NAM,
Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Samper said he appreciates China's supports to the Non-Aligned
Movement.
</P>
<P>
During the talks the two heads of state also exchanged views
on international issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Samper, his wife and party, arrived in Beijing on Sunday at the
invitation of Jiang for a three-day state visit to China.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy to Afghanistan Calls for Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The UN special envoy to
Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, today called for an immediate ceasefire
among the Afghan warring factions.
</P>
<P>
A report coming from Kabul quoted Holl, who is visiting the
Afghan capital, as saying, "In my mind, a ceasefire has the
highest priority."
</P>
<P>
"I think that ceasefire should be the first step to be taken,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Once we can reach a ceasefire, I think the climate is better
to go forward for political talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as a political settlement is concerned, I consider
myself only a mediator," he said, adding the Afghans must take
responsibility for their own actions.
</P>
<P>
"It is not for the UN to impose a political solution but to
extend a helping hand to the people of Afghanistan to find one,"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that mediation by Pakistani Interior Minister
Nasirullah Babar between the Taliban Militia and the ousted
government troops was both "complimentary and supportive" of the
UN initiatives.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Babar visited the Taliban headquarters in the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar where he got a conditional
acceptance for a Monday ceasefire which was proposed by Rashid
Dostum, leader of the Uzbek Militia.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said today that they accepted the ceasefire
proposal on condition that an exchange of prisoners was carried
out simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Holl arrived in Kabul today for talks with the Taliban ruling
council in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Macao Senior Civil Servants to Visit Beijing, Qingdao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of 12 senior civil
servants from Macao are to start a week-long visit to Beijing and
Qingdao from October 25 to increase their knowledge about China.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants include deputy heads and section chiefs of a
 dozen government departments, who in a row have decided to remain
 in the future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Government after 1999 when China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
The departments range from birth identity, census and
statistics, finance, economy, social works, education and youth,
posts and telecommunications, to tourism and law translation
office among others.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second such visit since December last year. They
 are expected to meet with officials of the National People's
Congress, the Ministry of Personnel, State Administrative College
and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State
Council, and the Qingdao Municipal Government in east China's
Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said that such visit will help increase Macao's civil servants'
confidence in serving the future Macao SAR Government.
</P>
<P>
"The visits to the inland of China represent the friendly
cooperation between China and Portugal," he told the group of
civil servants today. "We hope that more Macao civil servants will
stay in Macao and serve the Macao SAR Government after 1999."
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that the visits to China's inland will
increase the civil servants' knowledge about China, help them know
about the policy of "One Country, Two Systems", which will be
implemented in Hong Kong and Macao after China resumes its
exercise of sovereignty over these regions.
</P>
<P>
"To know about China does not mean what is now being practiced
in the inland will be practiced in Macao," the director assured
the civil servants. "The capitalist system and basic life style
will remain unchanged for 50 years in Macao. And there is no
reason to change that."

<HEADLINE> EC In Last-ditch Bid to Solve Telecoms Dispute With S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
and South Korea are to hold top-level talks this week in a
last-ditch bid to solve a dispute over access to the lucrative
South Korean telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
EC Vice President and Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is to
take up the issue during a meeting with South Korean Foreign
Minister Gong Ro Myung on October 28 in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The EC claims that South Korea discriminates against foreign
companies in its 8 billion-U.S.-dollar-a-year telecommunications
procurement market through legislation and practice.
</P>
<P>
The main national operator, Korea Telecom, is told to buy from
the country's manufacturers whenever possible and the second
operator, Dacom, has a similar purchasing policy, the EC claims.
</P>
<P>
These policies, which are contrary to the national treatment
rule of the World Trade Organization, cost European exporters some
900 million dollars a year, the EC says.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has been trying to get South Korea to open up
its market for the last two years, but negotiations so far have
failed to come up with an agreement. If these latest talks fail
the EC is threatening to take the dispute to the World Trade
Organization for arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM: Expanded EU Role in Mideast to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said today that a high-profile European role in the Middle
East politics would help speed up the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think we could solve all problems with Israel, but
offering assistance to the Palestinians is a very important
issue, even to Israel," said the top Italian official.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak this
morning, the Italian premier said Mubarak feels pessimistic over
recent events in the region and is very concerned about the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Mubarak believes that a European-Italian
role would be constructive in convincing Israel to respect peace
accords it has signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who left for home following a one-day visit to Egypt
today, came here apparently in a bid to further ties with the
largest Arab country and seek a greater say in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the EU was not seeking any immediate results,
which would be unrealistic, Prodi said it just wanted to push
forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Prodi highlighted the benefit of an expanded EU role in the
area in the future. "If there is pressure from a large entity
like the EU, it will bear fruit sooner or later", he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he waved off Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's recent dismissive remark that Israel is
uninterested in an active European Mideast role.
</P>
<P>
"Can Europe be the party to provide the financial assistance
and strengthen its economic presence in the Middle East and then
be expected to remain silent," he asked.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis have indefinitely postponed
their difficult negotiations on Hebron, the last West Bank city
still under Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
Israel is pushing for greater security for the 450 Jewish
settlers among 120,000 Palestinians in the city, while the
Palestinians demand Israel speed up its troop redeployment in
line with the Oslo 2 agreement.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said Mubarak supported Italy to go ahead with the idea
of sending an EU envoy to the area and of intensifying the
European role.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Mideast tour of French President Jacques
Chirac, he said their tours are not contradictory. "They go in
parallel lines," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Prodi reaffirmed the Italian participation in the Cairo
economic summit slated for November 12-14. The heavy industries,
banks and private sector will be highlighted for their mutual
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Italian premier also met with Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid Sunday night on ways of strengthening
Arab-European ties in general and Arab-Italian relations in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Their talks touched upon the frozen peace process on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks and the implementation of the signed
Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Israeli troop redeployment from
the West Bank city of Hebron.

Jordan's continued support for the Palestinians and described King
Hussein's visit to Jericho last week as historic.

He said his talks with the prime minister focused on the
importance of inter-Arab cooperation and coordination between
Arab-Israelis and Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Such coordination will help abort attempts by Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government to derail the Middle
East peace process and impose its fait accompli policy in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, he added.

He said Arab Israelis had initiated contacts with Arab states

BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Candidates for Thailand's
November 17 general election began registration today to contest a
total of 393 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
With registration, the campaigning also officially started
today.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the start of the registration, campaigning vans
began blaring election platforms along busy streets and in crowded
communities.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day registration period which ends Friday, the
15 contesting political parties will field more than 1,485
candidates in the country's 76 provinces, as by law each
contesting political party must register at least 99 candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party led by former opposition leader Chuan
Leekpai and the New Aspiration Party led by caretaker Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh are widely
believed to be the only parties to appear at this stage to have a
serious chance of forming a new government after the polls.
</P>
<P>
The two parties are neck to neck, each claiming to be able to
grab no less than 100 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, caretaker Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa said
that he would be contented if his Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party
would win 30 seats, as about half of the former 91 MPs of his
party have defected to other parties.

And with the backing of the whole nation, and the smooth
progress of the resettlement, the Three Gorges area will gradually
become a new area where the economy will move at high gear, and
where people live and work in peace and contentment.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all people engaged to go all out with a
concerted effort, to strive for the projected damming of the river
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that the Three Gorges Project is a huge
trans-century project, which will generate immense economic and
social benefits.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the whole nation has been mobilized for
the project in a developing country. This fully shows the
superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which can
concentrate its energy on a number of major projects.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was confident that it is entirely possible to
complete the resettlement by keeping abreast with the pace of the
project, with the joint efforts of all departments involved.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the resettlement is closely associated with
the lives and work of the people in the reservoir area, as well as
its economic development, reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that governments at all levels should give play to
the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and take a practical
and effective approach towards resettlement work.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the resettlement should be carried out in
line with the principles of keeping the program abreast with
construction progress, stressing the main parts, and finishing
the work at an even earlier date if the funds are provided.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the future development, Li urged the reservoir area
to seize the opportunity to readjust its industrial structure,
strengthen technical upgrading, and develop a number of pillar
industries amid the resettlement of people and relocation of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He added that the damming of the river is the central task of
the Three Gorges Project in 1997, and all departments concerned
should ensure the completion of the task as scheduled with a high
quality.

<HEADLINE> Pak-US Military Consultative Group Meeting Concluded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan brought out problems
in implementing the Brown Amendment during the 12th Pak-US
military consultative group meeting which was concluded here
today.
</P>
<P>
The US delegation, led by US Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs Franklin D. Kramer, agreed to work
with Pakistan to try to resolve these difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The US delegation and Syed Salim Abbas Jilani, Pakistan
Secretary Defense, also held wide-ranging talks on areas of
bilateral interests, including exchange of briefings on regional
perspectives, threat perception and UN peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The working groups on security assistance and military
cooperation held in-depth discussions on their respective agendas.
</P>
<P>
The US side emphasized that the US and Pakistan shared
important strategic objectives including regional stability,
resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan and UN peace-keeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
The US also reaffirmed that the pursuit of such broad common
objectives was the key to the strengthening of their bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to meet again in Washington next year to
continue their fruitful dialogue on security issues.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member US delegation currently is on a three-day
official visit to Pakistan for the annual meeting of Pak-US
military consultative group.
</P>
<P>
The Pak-US military consultative group was revived during US
Defense Secretary William Perry's visit to Pakistan in January
1995 after being suspended for five years.
</P>
<P>
The Brown Amendment, which was passed early this year, enables
Pakistan to get back its paid military equipment except F-16
fighters, which had been embargoed by the Pressler Amendment.

<HEADLINE> US Official Meets with KDP Leader in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Pelletreau today met with leader of
Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Massoud Barzani on the
latest developments in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sermet Akacanli told
a weekly press conference that Pelletreau, who arrived in Ankara
Sunday, flew to the Turkish border town of Silopi, Sirnak province,
where Pelletreau and Barzani are holding talks on the serious
fighting between the KDP and its rival -- the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
Akacanli said that some Turkish Foreign Ministry officials
participated in the bilateral talks between Pelletreau and
Barzani as observers.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pelletreau is expected to return to Ankara
this afternoon or this evening after meeting with Barzani.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is also trying to make arrangements for a meeting
between Turkish officials and PUK leader Jalal Talabani, but a
date for the meeting has yet to be fixed, Akacanli said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Barzani would not come to Ankara to hold
talks with the Turkish side on the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish deputy spokesman expressed his hope that the
serious fighting between the KDP and PUK should come to an
end and peace and stability should be returned to this region.
</P>
<P>
The intensified fighting, triggered by a KDP counterattack, has
dimmed hopes for an immediate breakthrough although the sides
have given their acquiescence to the U.S. mediation bid.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the fighting intensified near the strategic dam
of Dukan after Barzani's forces captured the city of Ranya
with a three-pronged attack.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the
KDP and the PUK
ting in 1994.

ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting broke out
north of Kabul today between the Taliban militia and the ousted
government troops led by Ahmad Shah Masood, said a report reaching

<P>
The report said that Masood's troops reached Karez-i-Mir, 10

would accept ceasefire provided certain conditions were met.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban fired scores of rockets onto Karez-i-Mir to stop
the advancing troops loyal to Masood.
</P>
<P>
The fighting followed the call for ceasefire at midday today,
which was proposed by leader of the Uzbek Militia Rashid Dostum
and was accepted by the Taliban and Masood conditionally.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said they had accepted the ceasefire, but only if
an exchange of prisoners was carried out simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Taliban-controlled Radio Kabul also vowed to fight to the death
if it was necessary to defend the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
Masood's spokesman said they would accept the ceasefire only if
the Taliban agreed to demilitarize Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, French Foreign Ministers meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al Sharaa and his French counterpart Harve de Charette held a
round of talks here today to follow up a summit meeting between
Syrian President Hafez Assad and visiting French President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Minister arrived in Damascus Saturday
afternoon, accompanying President Chirac on the first leg of his
six-day Middle East tour which also take him to Israel, the
Palestinian territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
No details of the meeting were given, but it was almost certain
that they focused on the stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks and
bilateral relations as well.
</P>
<P>
The same subjects were discussed by the two presidents earlier
and both leaders found many in common to voice.
</P>
<P>
Syrian political analysts believed that choosing Syria as the
first country for President Chirac to visit this time showed that
Paris was fully aware of Syria's principal role in regional
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said after his talks with President Assad Saturday that
nothing could possibly be achieved in the Near and Middle East
without Syria.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's Mideast tour, under the theme of "consolidation of
the Middle East peace process," was aimed at urging the concerned
parties to take concrete steps along the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Syrian and French sides held talks on economic
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed Syrian sources anticipate the signing of a
financial agreement during President Chirac's visit, ending a
dispute over repayment of Syria's 1.3 billion franc (250 million
U.S. dollars) debt to France.
</P>
<P>
A senior French official was quoted as saying that the
agreement would open the way for new state-guaranteed French
investment in Syria and increased trade.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is scheduled to leave for Israel Monday amid mounting
criticism by Israeli hardliners for France's pro-Arab stand.
</P>
<P>
The French president has vowed to push forward the peace process
by asserting a bigger say and basing on the land for peace formula.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Layer over Antarctic Begins to Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The massive hole in the ozone
layer seen over the Antarctic in September and early October has
started to recede, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
said in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have found that every year since the discovery of
the hole in the 1980s, the ozone layer depletes severely during
September and October, but then starts to recover.
</P>
<P>
This year, the hole in the ozone layer reached a maximum spread
of over 20 million square kilometers between the end of September
and early October, an area equal to twice that of Europe
stretching from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains, the WMO
said. But that's smaller than last year's record 22 million square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
A part of the hole where a 55 percent ozone loss occurred has
also begun to reduce from a maximum spread of over 10 million
square kilometers reached on October 5, WMO added.
</P>
<P>
The average ozone deficiency in the hole is about 40 percent,
according to the organization.
</P>
<P>
The ozone hole over Antarctic appears every year between
September and October when cold weather and the sun's rays combine
to result in the maximum ozone depletion.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon of over 50 percent ozone loss first appeared as
a small area in the Antarctic spring in 1991, but now affects a
much larger area.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer is a protective shield which absorbs and blocks
out most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. Its
depletion could lead to an increase in such rays which could cause
cancer, reduce in agricultural production and affect the marine
food chain. Many scientists believe the hole in the ozone layer
is contributing to global warming.

<HEADLINE> Assad, Chirac Hope to Revive Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
Al-Assad and visiting French President Jacques Chirac vowed here
today to work together to revive the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents appeared together at a press conference
after talks. Al-Assad expressed the hope that Israel would give a
positive response to the joint efforts by Syria and France to
enhance the peace march.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac said that his country and the European Union
as a whole are determined to play a greater and more effective
role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad said that his talks with President Chirac focused on
the peace process, calling them "successful."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu would
heed the call for peace and honor all its commitments so that
all parties might reap the fruits of peace.
</P>
<P>
President Assad pointed out that Syria's relations with France
were developing and President Chirac's visit would contribute to
future bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chirac reaffirmed France's determination to assist
the EU in reviving the Middle East peace process, underlining the
necessity for adherence to the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had come to the region as a man of peace, and
would spare no effort to help restart the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Europe has extended huge assistance, consequently, this
has to be translated into Europe's participation in the process
because it cannot stand with arms folded, the French leader asserted.
</P>
<P>
Chirac admitted that the United States is playing an effective
role in Arab-Israeli peace talks, but he stressed that the
European presence in the peace process does not mean a
denunciation of the U.S. involvement in the region.
</P>
<P>
The French president arrived here Saturday on the first leg of
his current Mideast tour which will also take him to Israel,
Jordan, Lebanon, the Palestinian autonomous region and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the U.S. were not at all pleased to see the EU in
general and France in particular seeking a greater say regarding
the Mideast peace process. However, the Arabs hail the move.
</P>
<P>
Asked about bilateral Franco-Syrian relations, President
Chirac announced that the two countries had reached an agreement
on the rescheduling of Syria's 250 million-dollar-debt to France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expected the bilateral ties to further grow in
economic, cultural, technological and scientific fields through
enhanced regular consultations.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Progress in Israel-Palestine Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
are possible to make some progress, but deliberations are still
going on.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
briefed him on the latest development in the peace negotiations
during a telephone conversation Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
No agreement has been reached at the end of the on-and-off
Palestinian-Israeli talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba,
which will resume Monday in Eilat, southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to normalize relations with
Israel, has played a key role in mediating the ongoing talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Arafat also sounded him out on holding an Arab summit
with Iraqi participation to coordinate Arab stances against Israeli
policies, but he did not second the idea.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed that convening such a summit requires procedures
and certain dynamics, and should be subject at present to joint
Arab needs.
</P>
<P>
After all, Egypt is still following up the implementation of
the resolutions of the previous Arab summit which was held here in
June, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the continued Israeli attempts to Judaize Jerusalem, Moussa
said that Egypt would not recognize Israel's annexation of the
city or consider it its capital.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance does not bear any interpretation or change," Moussa
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the final status of Jerusalem should be determined
during the final phase of negotiations between Israel and
Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects Increase in Olive Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will witness a bumper
harvest of olive with an estimated increase of 46.1 percent from
last year's 65,000 tons to 95,000 tons, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The olive harvest is slated to begin with November 1 and will
last for two months, including olive oil production, Director of
Agriculture Economics and Policy Department Fawzi Ammari said,
quoted by the English daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture is recommending that farmers do
not start picking the fruits before they are ripe because some
producers are tending to harvest too early in order to obtain
higher profits.
</P>
<P>
"This year's olive output is expected to be very good or even
excellent," he said.
</P>
<P>
But "because of the summer drought - olive trees require
moderate temperatures and humidity - the estimated olive
production will be 95,000 tons instead of (the expected)
110,000," he added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 81,600 tons of olives will be used for olive oil
production while the remaining 13,400 tons will be pickled.
</P>
<P>
Olive tree plantations amount to a total of 866,000 dunums
(77,940 hectares) in the kingdom and grow in two areas called
"fruitful" consisting of 627,000 dunums (56,430 hectares) and
"non-fruitful" covering 239,000 dunums (21,510 hectares), Ammari
explained.
</P>
<P>
Annual consumer need of olive totals 16,000 tons to 17,000
tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ammari could not yet provide estimates on this year's price
for olive oil nor the amount of money farmers will be paid
for their harvests.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Parliament Welcomes Chirac's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Upper House Speaker
Ahmad Lawzi welcomed here today the visit to the kingdom by French
President Jacques Chirac Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told French Ambassador in Amman Bernard Bajolet that house
members are looking forward to listening to President Chirac's
address before the parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lawzi said the historical Franco-Jordanian ties laid down over
decades by King Hussein and French leadership are strong leverage
for Jordan to continue the joint work to promote cooperation in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
The Senate speaker reiterated Jordan's appreciation of France's
policies under President Chirac towards all issues in the region.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan and the Jordanian government have expressed
welcome to the French president's visit to the kingdom and
endorsed French efforts to play a new and more important role in
the Middle East peace process which is now stalled because of
Israeli delay in implementing the signed accords with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who is on his seven-day Middle East tour, planned to
promote European Union (EU)'s role, particularly the French role
in the Middle East peace process to a level as a sponsor and
meditator as the United States enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu Sunday rejected
French call for greater European role in the Middle East peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
He visited Syria and Israel and will also tour Jordan, Egypt
and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Stresses Need for Early Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has stressed the need for an early solution to the
Cyprus problem and pledged intensive efforts to reach common
ground between Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Sunday at a conference of Greek Cypriots who staged an
armed struggle between 1955 and 1959 for the island's independence
from British colonial rule, President Clerides noted that the
Cyprus problem is going through a period of a methodic and
in-depth investigation into the possibility of achieving common
ground which would lead to direct negotiations between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the Greek Cypriot side cooperates in this effort in
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
"We want to reach a solution the soonest, if possible before
negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the European Union begin or,
at least, to see the ground set for a solution until then," the
president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also stressed the need for reunification and peaceful
co-existence with the Turkish Cypriots under conditions of peace
and safety.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops sent troops to take
the northern third of the island following a short-lived coup,
engineered by the then Greek Junta against late President
Archbishop Makarios.
</P>
<P>
The problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rules out European Participation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has brushed off a French call for greater
European role in Middle East peace talks, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think at this time of such sensitive negotiations it
will be wise to introduce another interlocutor, another
facilitator," the Israeli prime minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Equally we have a set course for the resumption of
negotiations with Syria and that doesn't include American
participation. I would be very careful before I would add more
cooks to the broth."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Israel had made it clear to Syria that it
wants to continue the peace talks and there is no reason for
deterioration in the situation. He added that Israel is
monitoring closely Syrian moves and escalation would not benefit
either side.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks came in direct response to a call made by
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus Saturday for France
to act as a co-sponsor of peace talks between Syria and Israel
together with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who is now on a Middle East
tour, made it clear that the European Union, France in
particular, would like to play a more active role in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is scheduled to visit Israel and Palestinian autonomous
areas today.

<HEADLINE> Iran Tries to Prevent Further Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
claimed that it will try to prevent further devaluation of the
national currency, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Economic and Financial Minister Morteza Mohammad-Khan said
Sunday that the government prevents any rise in the parity rates
of hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he added, the rise in the foreign exchange against
the local currency will lower the purchasing power of the
national currency.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official made the statement while the Iranian
monetary market is once again suffering from a big fluctuation
in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Although the official exchange rate still stands at one U.S.
dollar against 3,000 Rials, the exchange rate has gone up to one
dollar against 4,550 Rials in the black market.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the local currency has affected prices of
other goods, such as gold and daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of directors of the financial
organization for expansion of ownership of manufacturing units,
he said that among major plans adopted by the government are to
curb rising inflation, increase purchasing power of the public
and strengthen the national currency.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the government's main policy is to check
the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate is spiraling up about 100 percent on the
year-to-year basis. However, the government said that it stands
at 40-50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on producers not to seek increased
profits through lower production and higher prices.
</P>
<P>
He said that replacing imports constitutes a part of the
industrial policy of the country, adding that enhancement of
exports will be pursued in the course of the Second Five-Year
Development Plan (1995-1999) as a complementary measure which
itself requires an increase in the quality of products and
reduced wastes.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the rise in production in the country over recent
years, Mohammad-Khan said that Iran's petrochemical output had
reached 10 million tons, whereas the figure stood at 400,000
tons at the outset of the First Five-Year Development Plan
(1989-1994).
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran was self-sufficient in the area of
producing construction materials and there was no need to import
them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held a meeting in Beijing this
afternoon with Colombian Foreign Minister, Maria Emma Mejia
Velez. The minister is in China accompanying Colombian President
Ernesto Samper Pizano.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her pleasure at meeting Qian again, Mejia said
that President Samper's current visit to China is of great
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Colombia and China have good political and
diplomatic ties, and she hopes that bilateral economic and trade
relations can be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Sino-Colombian trade relations have developed
well, and the two countries can strengthen their cooperation by
exploring new ways, such as cooperative production.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also talked about anti-drug
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mejia said that all countries in the world should conduct
multi-lateral cooperation to solve the drug problem.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the drug issue requires international
cooperation. In addition to drug producing countries,
drug-consuming countries should also shoulder heavy responsibility
because the great market demand for drugs would result in wide
spread drug production and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On Non-Aligned Movement, Qian said that the Chinese government
holds a positive attitude toward, and supports the movement, while
holding that this movement is necessary under the current
situation, and can play a positive role in uniting developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mejia also invited Qian to visit Colombia at his convenience,
and Qian expressed his appreciation for the invitation.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from Australia's
State of Queensland, led by its Premier Robert Borbidge, arrived
in Shanghai today for a visit.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the biggest industrial and commercial city in China,

<HEADLINE> 21 Pct of 14-Year-Olds Regular Smokers In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- In Australia, "approximately
seven percent of 12-year-olds are regular smokers, with the
proportion increasing three fold to 21 percent for 14-year-olds."
</P>
<P>
This was stated by the West Australian Health Promotion
Foundation during the launching of an anti-smoking campaign, a
media release issued from Perth said.
</P>
<P>
Most young people who take up smoking do so during the
transition from primary to high school, the "Smoking, we're
smarter than that" campaign is aimed at 11- and 12-year-olds
moving to high school.
</P>
<P>
In West Australia, the foundation estimated 22,000 15-year-olds
to be regular smokers, project coordinator Kathryn Sydney-Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
"Smoking is seen as a rite of passage, something teenagers know
they will be confronted with as they enter high school. Many see
smoking as a badge which help them develop a reputation and social
status amongst their peers," Sydney-Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"Smoking, we're smarter than that", addresses the issue of the
social desirability of smoking and will communicate to young
people that smoking is not a smart look, Sydney-Smith added.

<HEADLINE> President Samper's Visit A New Chapter in Bilateral Ties: NPC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said
today in Beijing that the visit to China by the Colombian
President has opened up a new chapter in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement this afternoon during a meeting with
Colombian President Ernesto Samper Pizano.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the Sino-Colombian relations are developing
smooothly. The peoples of China and Colombia have enjoyed a
traditional friendship despite the geographical distance setting
the two countries far apart, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Qiao, China and Colombia, as developing countries,
are faced with common tasks of developing economies, raising
people's living standards, and safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two nations share the same or similar views on
many major international issues, which has laid a firm foundation
for developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the "one China" stand consistently taken by
the Colombian government, said the NPC chairman.
</P>
<P>
Samper said he was glad to have the opportunity to visit China
for the second time. He said Colombia hopes to enhance its
cooperation of mutual benefit with China in various areas,
including promoting exchanges between the parliaments of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that China is playing an important role in
keeping international forces in balance. As chairman member of the
Non-Aligned Movement, Colombia wishes to enhance coordination and
cooperation with China in the Movement.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said parliamentary exchanges are a major part of China's
friendly relations with Latin-American countries. The NPC attaches
great importance to its friendship with the Colombian
Congress. Since the two countries forged diplomatic relations in
1980, parliaments of the two sides have enjoyed effective
exchanges, which have not only helped consolidate and enhance
friendship and understanding between the parliaments, but also
helped promote an overall advancement in mutually beneficial
cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qiao also briefed Samper on China's reform
and opening up. He asked Samper to convey his regards to
presidents of the Colombian Senate and House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president arrived in Beijing on Sunday for a
three-day state visit as guest of President of Jiang Zemin.

Convention and Exhibition Center. Hong Kong is to host the ABU
General Assembly for the first time. The host broadcaster is Radio

broadcasting associations.
</P>
<P>
The organization now has a membership of 99 broadcasters, among

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Race favourite Kenneth Eriksson
narrowed Richard Burns lead in the Hong Kong-Beijing rally by 12
seconds on Monday as the Swede looked to make up time lost in a
disastrous first stage.
</P>
<P>
Burns, in a Mitsubish, was beaten by his Swedish rival in a
Subaru in the first special and the two fought a close duel
throughout the third day of the 3,800-kilometer rally, the
closing event of the Asia-Pacific championship.
</P>
<P>
Burns lost three seconds in the first special to Eriksson, the
defending champion, but won by nine seconds in the second.
</P>
<P>
Eriksson gained 25 seconds in the last stage of the day after
Burns hit a rock.
</P>
<P>
Burn's overall time at the end of the day was one hour 46
minutes 34 seconds, one minute ahead of Finnish teammate Ari
Vatanen, and one minute 22 seconds ahead of Eriksson.
</P>
<P>
Eriksson got left behind on the first day after a truck went on
the road and he thought the rally had been held up.
</P>
<P>
Five teams pulled out of the competition on the third day,
including the Italian pair of Fabrizio De Sanctis and Christina
Rossi and one of the seven private entries from China.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's leg four will consist of five stages over 110
kilometers that will take the event to Wuhan, capital of Hubei
province.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Australia Sign Defense Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Australia
signed today an agreement that would allow the Republic of
Singapore Air Force (RSAF) to deploy its helicopters in Oakey,
Queensland of Australia, for training, the Defense Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a Defense Ministry statement released here today,
Tony Tan, Singapore's defense minister and deputy prime minister,
who is on an introductory visit to Australia, witnessed the
signing of the agreement, together with his Australian counterpart
Ian Mclachlan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed two other agreements between the
Australian Defense Force (ADF) and the Singapore Defense Forces
(SAF). These included an ADF-SAF Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
on Long-Term Personnel Exchange and a Royal Australian Air
Force-RSAF MOU on Air-to-Air Refueling.
</P>
<P>
Tony Tan hailed the pact signed today as a new chapter in the
defense relations between the two countries, saying that it was a
testimony to the Australian government's affirmation that its ties
with Asia remained a top priority.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore minister said Singapore appreciated Australia's
willingness to provide land and air space for SAF training.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest agreement, the RSAF can deploy up to 12 Supper
Puma helicopters and 250 staff and their families at Oakey till
the year 2010, while Singapore is expected to pay about 40 million
Singapore dollars (about 28.57 million US dollars) to construct
facilities like those at Pearce Flying School in Western
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that the next logical step is to establish a similar
facility in Australia to train SAF's advanced jet pilots.

<HEADLINE> Manila Defends Decision to Bar "Trouble-Makers" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ramos administration today
defended its decision not to allow "trouble-makers" to enter the
Philippines to ensure the peaceful proceeding of the informal
leadership conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) on November 25.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Jose Almonte told reporters here that
as the host of the meeting, the government has the responsibility
to prevent any potential incidents during a series of APEC
meetings next month.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government in coordination with the
security agencies of other APEC economies has drawn up a list
containing the names of those who may disturb the APEC meetings
and activities.
</P>
<P>
Those people who are on the list will not be allowed to enter
the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, President Fidel Ramos ordered the barring from the
country of foreigners deemed to be out to disturb the APEC
meetings next month. But the order was criticized by some human
rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
"This is not done by us alone. This is in coordination with
other security agencies of the APEC economies so the evaluation is
not necessarily unilateral," Almonte said.
</P>
<P>
Next month, APEC activities will begin with the informal senior
officials meeting on November 20, followed by the eighth APEC
ministerial meeting on November 22-23 in Manila and the fourth
informal APEC leadership conference on November 25 in Subic.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Current Account Problem Not Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia was on track with
budget forecasts of solid economic growth and reduced unemployment
but its current account deficit remained a problem, Assistant
Treasurer Rod Kemp said today.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a manufacturing industry forum here, Kemp also
confirmed the government's projection of an 8.25 percent
unemployment rate for 1996-97 after last week Employment Minister
Amanda Vanston refused to guarantee that the jobs target would be
reached.
</P>
<P>
"The government is also expecting a fall in the unemployment
rate, although this will be muted to some extent as people are
encouraged to enter or re-enter the workforce. Hence the
unemployment rate is forecast to fall only modestly to around 8.25
percent by next June," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect solid growth to continue this year and are
forecasting real GDP growth of around 3.5 percent. This
expectation reflects the positive outlook for the international
economy and favorable domestic economic fundamentals," he added.
</P>
<P>
While talking about the main challenges facing the government,
Kemp urged to boost national savings and reduce the current
account deficit, which stood at 1.33 billion Australian dollars
(1.05 billion US dollars), seasonally adjusted in August.
</P>
<P>
"It has been argued by some that the recent decline in the
current account deficit means that it is under control," he said.
"While this statement is true, it is wrong to conclude that the
current account deficit problem is over."
</P>
<P>
He said the improvement seen in the current account deficit in
the last year was due to cyclical rather than structural factors,
and very low national savings could not keep current account
deficit at a comfortable level.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Russian Federation Council Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia should
strengthen cooperation in international organizations and
international affairs to make greater contributions to world
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
This was stated today by Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), at a meeting
with Yegor Semeonovich Stroyev, chairman of the Russian Federation
Council, in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Qiao extended a warm welcome to Stroyev on his first China trip
as the Federation Council Chairman. Both China and Russia are
countries of important influence in the world, and both are
permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations,
Qiao said. Therefore, he noted, the strengthening of consultation
and dialogue between the two countries on major international
issues would play an important role in helping develop all
undertakings in the international community.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are neighboring countries, and their
friendship dates back to ancient times. China attaches importance
to its relations with Russia, and hopes that Russia maintains a
domestic stability.
</P>
<P>
"This is very necessary to friendly neighbors," Qiao said,
adding that "China and Russia also have much in common. They
should not only strengthen cooperation and develop good neighborly
relations, but also learn from each other in building their
countries according to their own conditions."
</P>
<P>
Touching on exchanges between China's NPC and Russia's
Federation Council, Qiao said that the NPC appreciates the
Council's positive role in helping develop bilateral friendly
cooperative relations. The NPC would join efforts with the Council
to continue to maintain and advance the existing friendly
cooperative relationship, and enhance exchanges, with a view to
making new contributions to the development of bilateral relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also briefed the Russian guests on China's latest economic
achievements and answered their questions.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said Russia is very much interested in China's domestic
political stability and sustained economic growth. During the
ongoing visit, he said, he had witnessed the thriving scene now
prevailing throughout China. He said he also learned that the
Chinese people are fully confident in their future, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges for Resumption of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President
Jacques Chirac called here Saturday night for the resumption of the
Middle East peace talks, pointing out that there were "no security
without peace."
</P>
<P>
At a state banquet given by Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad in
his honor, Chirac asserted that the resumption of negotiations
necessitates reviving the mutual trust and sharing the same
keenness on the success of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The success of the peace talks is in need of "improving the
ways and framework of the negotiations," Chirac noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the French-Syrian efforts would
succeed in bringing the Arab-Israeli peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
To help the peace process succeed, the bloodshed and the
killing of the sons of Palestine, Israel and Lebanon from time to
time must stop immediately, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Peace can be possible only on the bases of what has been
achieved in the four years of Arab-Israeli peace talks and the
land-for-peace principles, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac voiced his determination to further boost the
French-Syrian ties.
</P>
<P>
The partnership between the two countries should be based on
equality and fairness with a view to establish "regional peace and
harmonious economic development," President Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived here Saturday afternoon on a three-day official
visit to Syria, the first leg of his current Middle East trip that
will also take him to Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian self-rule areas,
Jordan and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes French Role in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan welcomed today the visit
to Jordan by French President Jacque Chirac next Wednesday as
part of his five-leg regional tour designed to strengthen the
French role in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
An official statement said that the strong relations between
King Hussein of Jordan and President Chirac are the foundations
of continued growth of friendly cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified official source hailed the increasingly
important role of France in the region, saying the French role
is effective within the overall European Union (EU) peace moves.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a role would be a leverage enhancing
international efforts which are aimed at the continuation of the
peace process in the region on the basis of justice,
comprehensiveness and permanency.
</P>
<P>
He said positive and constructive role of France under the
leadership of President Chirac contributes to laying down solid
basis for the Middle East post-peace era.
</P>
<P>
The French president, who is visiting Syria, will also tour
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"This comprehensive visit is aimed at bringing a message of
peace to the region," French Ambassador in Amman Bernard Bajolet
was quoted by the Jordan Times as saying. "France wishes to see
that balance is restored to the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Chirac's current Middle East tour, the
ambassador told reporters that "French moves could not be
considered as an appeal."
</P>
<P>
"They are a reflection of the aspirations and demands of the
countries of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
France and the EU have been pushing for an effective role in
the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
The European countries, especially France, have expressed
dissatisfaction with their U.S.-defined role of providing
financial and economic support while being excluded politically.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said the EU has demanded to be a sponsor
of the Middle East peace process as the United States, but
Washington and Tel Aviv opposed the attempts to strengthen the
Europeans' hand in the region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said recently that
European activities in the region should be limited to financial
support.
</P>
<P>
The French ambassador told reporters that France was not
content to play such a supporting role, "especially at a time
when aid by the U.S. to the region has diminished considerably."
</P>
<P>
"Our desire to launch a new political campaign in the region
does not mean that we want to rule out the American role,"
Bajolet said. "The American role, as is well-known, is
necessary."
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal has voiced the
Kingdom's readiness to accept a greater political role for Europe
in the region, saying that an European role in the peace effort
was needed now more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials and diplomats, while hailing attempts to
introduce an effective new role by the Europeans, have
nevertheless expressed fears that other economic and political
factors might hamper the effort.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that the driving force behind France's
change of heart is its isolation in the aftermath of the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
While it rallied behind the U.S. at the time, France was left
out afterwards and its role was marginalized in the
international arena, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is Chirac's first official visit to Syria, Israel, Jordan
and Egypt since he took power last year.

<HEADLINE> Assad Lashes out at Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
condemned Israel for its "stubborn" policies, which, he said,
would undermine the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at the Israeli government at a state banquet
given in honor of visiting French President Jacques Chirac here
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad said that the peace process, launched at the Madrid
peace conference four years ago, seemed to be in a blind alley due
to the reluctance of the Israeli government to honor all the
commitments it has made.
</P>
<P>
Israel maneuvers while talking about peace, Al-Assad said,
adding but what kind of peace it is talking about when it publicly
announced that it will never withdraw from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Golan plateau in the 1967 Middle East war
from Syria. Damascus has asked the Jewish state to pull out its
troops from the heights while Israel refused to give it back
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
How the peace process could succeed while the current Israeli
government refuses to recognize the binding commitments made by
the previous Labor-led government, the Syrian leader said.
</P>
<P>
The previous Israeli government hinted at withdrawal from the
Golan Heights in exchange for full normalization of relations. But
it lost the May elections to the right-wing Likud bloc.
</P>
<P>
Hailing a greater role by France in the peace process, Al-Assad
said he found no contradiction between the European and the
U.S. roles in the search for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Chirac in return reiterated his country's determination to push
forward the stalled Middle East peace process alongside the United
States on the basis of "land for peace" formula accepted by the
Arab countries and the previous Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"There shall be no security without peace," said the French
president, pledging to make it heard in Israel that "the principle
of land for peace remains the basis for any agreement and this
holds for the Syrian territory of the Golan Heights."
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in Damascus Saturday on a three-day official
visit. He is scheduled to fly to Israel Monday to go on with his
current Mideast trip which will also take him to Jordan, the
Palestinian autonomous areas and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israeli Siege on West Bank Virtually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite Israeli claims that
the siege imposed on the Palestinian territories since September
24 had been lifted, reports from the West Bank say the siege is
virtually still on, said The Jerusalem Times.
</P>
<P>
According to the Palestinian weekly newspaper published in
East Jerusalem at the weekend, while Israel announced it had
issued thousands of work permits for Palestinians who want to
work inside Israel, only several hundreds were able to really
benefit from the permission.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials were quoted as saying that while Israel
claimed it issued 35,000 work permits for Palestinian laborers,
only 3,000 crossed the borders at one point for work in Israel
and another 2,000 entered the Erez industrial area to work
there.
</P>
<P>
Most of the permits issued so far were for work in
construction, agriculture and services. The siege on the Gaza
Strip was partially lifted to allow some movement for goods and
people between the strip and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some workers complained that even though they carry
permits to work in Israel, Israeli soldiers either tore up their
permits or prevented them from entering Israel. Or if they did
reach their work places inside Israel, police harassed them and
arrested them on charges of entering Israel without permits.
</P>
<P>
The West Bank city of Nablus was the hardest hit by the
siege. Its residents were prevented from leaving the city, while
neighboring villagers were barred from entering.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities at last declared to lift the siege on
Nablus on October 15 only after the residents called for
emergency assistance due to severe shortages of food, medicine
and fuel.
</P>
<P>
Reports from other West Bank towns say that the Israeli army
intervened in daily life and prevented farmers from reaching
their farms to harvest their crops.

<P>
According to Middle East Economic Digest (MEED), a business
weekly published in London today, the bank currently has a total
of 255 million dollars allocated for Yemen for the three-year

following severe flooding in the central and southern provinces of
Hadramaut, Marib and Shabwa in June.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- A Saudi-Japanese joint venture is to build two

<HEADLINE> Omani Sultan Meets with GCC Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Omani Sultan Qaboos
Bin-Said met today with visiting Secretary General of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil al-Hojeilan, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hojeilan briefed the sultan about current
preparation for the convocation of a GCC summit conference in the
Qatari capital of Doha in December.
</P>
<P>
Hojeilan paid a brief visit to Bahrain Saturday for
consultations with Bahraini Emir Sheikh Isa Bin Suleiman
al-Khalifa and other senior Bahraini officials on Bahrain's
participation in the scheduled Doha summit. No announcement was
made about the consultations.
</P>
<P>
Hojeilan's visit to Oman came within the framework of an
intensive political drive to avoid the prospects of an
unprecedented incident in GCC summits should one of the six GCC
states, namely, Bahrain, boycott the Doha summit.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain announced about a month ago that it would not take
part in the Doha summit.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why his country would abstain from attending the
Doha summit, Bahraini Information Minister Mohammed al-Muttawa
had said that this is due to the fact that the GCC states have
failed to make a decisive move to contain the Bahraini-Qatari
territorial dispute with friendly means.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Syrian Official Warns Against Collapse of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Syrian official
warned here today that the Middle East peace process was in danger
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Soliman Qaddah, assistant secretary general of Syria's ruling
Socialist Arab Baath Party, told the Syrian Agricultural Engineers
Association that the region was on the verge of tension and war on
account of Israel's intransigent and hostile attitude towards
peace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an inaugural meeting of the association, Qaddah
pointed out that the peace process, initiated in Madrid five years
ago, was stumbling and was being exposed to the threat of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Qaddah criticized Israel for failing to commit itself to the
search for a just and comprehensive peace. As a matter of fact, he
said, Israel's intransigence, arrogance and hostility to peace was
mounting day after day.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government was not after the establishment of a
just and comprehensive peace, but is seeking to achieve its own
peace, the peace of force, to realize its own security and
ambitions, and to consecrate its occupation of the Arab
territories, the Syrian official charged.
</P>
<P>
He asked why the peace process should continue if the Israeli
occupation of Arab territories remains in force, the policy of
settlement upheld, the confiscation and ultimate usurpation of
Arab lands unabated, and the violation of Arab sanctities
uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official called for the adoption of unified
attitudes and coordinated Arab action in a bid to restore the
occupied territories and the usurped rights of the Palestinian
Arab people and to confront Israeli challenges.
</P>
<P>
This requires the translation of the recent Arab summit
resolutions to effective Arab attitudes, and a unified Arab
political course to put an end to all forms of normalization with
Israel, and to compel it to adhere to the true peace option, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit, held in Cairo in June, sent a strong signal to
Israel that it goes along with the peace process or to risk a
setback in its efforts to normalize relations with Arab
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Considerable Progress in Hebron Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said here today that "considerable progress"
had been made in the negotiations with the Palestinians on the
Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of continuous talks, Israel and Palestine are
reportedly close to reach an agreement on the security
arrangements in the disputed West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
The talks, with the participation of U.S. special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross, will resume Monday in Eilat,
southern Israel, and local media estimated that an agreement
could be reached "very soon."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a Jewish delegation from the United States this
afternoon, Netanyahu said that he hoped "the Palestinian side
had made a decision to stop the delaying tactics (in the talks),
and to complete the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister said that a secured agreement in
Israeli troops' redeployment in Hebron is not just an Israeli
interest, but "it is equally a Palestinian interest."
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel had offered "sensible and just details
of security" in the negotiations with the Palestinians on the
redeployment
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to say whether an agreement with the
Palestinians on the Hebron issue could be reached within a week.
He said that the negotiations "are still at a sensitive stage."
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to the peace process, and we are buying the
peace process," stressed the Israeli premier.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the current negotiations with the
Palestinians are aimed at seeking security in the agreement,
which he believed was achievable.
</P>
<P>
After closing the interim agreement, said Netanyahu, "then we
will seek to renegotiate a final settlement which would lead to
rest the question of Israel and the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the final settlement between the
two sides would give maximum freedom to the Palestinians, at the
same time give the Israelis maximum security.

<HEADLINE> IAE To Establish High-level Link with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Director of the
International Energy Agency (IEA) Robert Priddle will lead the
group's first high-level delegation to visit China and discuss
ways of boosting cooperation with the world third largest energy
producer.
</P>
<P>
During his visit from October 28 to November 5, Priddle is
expected to sign with the Chinese government a cooperation
agreement, "which will provide a framework for and facilitate
greater cooperation and dialogue between the IEA and China,'' the
Paris-based international organization said today.
</P>
<P>
The IEA said that China, though not an IEA member country, is
an important player in the world energy market, because it is the
world's third largest producer and consumer of energy, behind only
the United States and Russia. China also has the world's fourth
largest power industry in terms of installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
Although an oil importer since 1993, China produces 2.92
million barrels of crude oil per day, and it is the world's
largest coal producer, with a production of 1,292 million tons in
1994, said IEA.
</P>
<P>
It said that for the past two years, IEA and China have
launched a number of cooperation projects in energy efficiency,
environmental protection, energy supply security, energy
technology and statistics standardization.
</P>
<P>
The IEA will organize a conference on China's energy efficiency
improvement in Beijing on December 3-4, while China will attend
IEA seminars on energy security issues.
</P>
<P>
The IEA was founded in 1974 as a forum for coordinating the
energy policies of 23 industrialized countries, with the
objectives of improving world energy supply and demand structure,
more efficient use of energy, and development of alternative
energy sources to reduce dependence on any one source.
</P>
<P>
The organization also engages in assistance in the integration
of environmental and energy policies, and the promotion of
cooperative relations between oil-producing and oil-consuming
countries.
</P>
<P>
The present IEA member countries are Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Britain and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Leader Meets Spanish King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam met Spanish King Juan Carlos I here Monday and discussed
with him ways to strengthen bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kim responded favorably to Carlos' request
for active government support for further South Korean business
ventures in Spain. He also said Spanish automobile and aircraft
parts manufacturers are welcomed to invest in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Kim explained to Carlos the latest developments on the Korean
Peninsula, while Carlos conveyed Madrid's support for Seoul's
efforts for peace and stability on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim also thanked Spain for supporting South Korea to join the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and
expressed the hope that the two countries would cooperate in the
OECD as well as in other international affairs.
</P>
<P>
On October 11, the OECD Council decided in Paris to admit South
Korea to the organization. Thus, South Korea will become the 29th
member of the OECD.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a National Assembly plenary session here
Monday afternoon, Carlos pledged Spain's assistance in keeping
peace in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Spain would make every effort if and when
cooperation from the international community is needed for peace
in East Asia, adding that Madrid would encourage the European
Union's participation as well.
</P>
<P>
Carlos, who was the first Spanish head of state to visit South
Korea since Seoul and Madrid established diplomatic ties in 1950,
arrived here Sunday for a five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The trade between South Korea and Spain stood at 1.41 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995. As of the end of last year, South Korea's
direct investments in Spain had amounted to 45.8 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ramos: Philippine Economy Likely to Grow 7.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that his country's economy is likely to grow 7.1
percent this year, a robust growth from 5.5 percent in 1995 and
5.1 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Innovative governance and better policies have transformed the
Philippines into a vibrant economy, Ramos said at the opening of
an international conference on governance innovation in Manila.
</P>
<P>
He said that from the so-called "sickman of Asia," the
Philippines has become the strongest bet for "flavor of the year"
for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office, the Philippine
economy registered an increase of 7.7 percent in the second
quarter of this year and 7.1 percent for the first half.
</P>
<P>
Because of good governance and better policies in place, Ramos
said, "The country has become much more resilient to
macro-economic shocks."
</P>
<P>
Last year, despite the bad weather that hampered the
agricultural sector and threatened to ignite high inflation rate,
that did not happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ramos said, inflation was contained and is now at a
comfortably low level of 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"As the World Bank would put it, we have set the basic
macro-economic fundamentals in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that the sound performance of the economy could be
attributed to the bold policies the government initiated in the
past four years, such as the liberalization of telecommunications,
energy, transportation, banking and insurance sectors.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Patrick Rafter
won a rain-delayed final over American Vincent Spadea to take the
singles title of the 1996 Marlboro Tennis Championships here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 61st-ranked Australian won the match 6-2, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in
two hours 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The final, originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon in the
open-air central tennis court in the Victoria Park here, was
postponed for one day by the organizers due to continuous rain
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter took the first game in the final Monday afternoon with
two service breaks and more successful forehand drives.
</P>
<P>
But Spadea returned strongly in the second, scoring more points
on service to beat Rafter who made many unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
Rafter improved his service and broke the American's service
twice each in the third and fourth games. And with fierce volleys,
Rafter took an upper hand and won the games in a row.
</P>
<P>
Spadea, who had failed to qualify for the final, replaced his
compatriot Richey Reneberg who quit Saturday's semi-final against
Swede Jonas Bjorkman after suffering from a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
Spadea beat Bjorkman to qualify for the final.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Agrees to Increase Reporters' Allowance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Jordan Press Association
(JPA) Sunday reached a tentative agreement with the government
regarding the increase of salary allowances for its members
employed by the Jordan News Agency, Petra, Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The debated increase would move the previous 60 percent of
allowance up to 90 percent, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Administrative Development Kamal Nasser
and JPA President Seif Al Sharif signed a memorandum of
understanding to this effect during a visit by the minister to JPA
offices where he met with the association's board members.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said Friday that he had submitted a request to raise
the Petra journalists' allowances to Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti and was awaiting the government's reply.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that JPA members are the only members of
Jordanian professional associations who receive less than a 90
percent allowance for their labors.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the minister promised to submit the
memorandum to the Council of Ministers soon.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of allowance currently paid by the government
to the 95 Petra journalists amounts to an annual 772,000 Jordan
dinars (about 1.08 million U.S. dollars) and the additional
requested amount would amount to approximately 36,000 dinars
(about 50,400 dollars), the JPA president disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the government agreed to increase the
salary for engineer and medical associations after they
threatened to go on strike if the government would not respond
positively.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Urged for Nigeria Election Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Some individuals and groups in
Nigeria are trying to persuade head of state Sani Abacha to run
in the 1998 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The local "Punch" newspaper today called the lobbying activity
a kite flown to test public opinion on the possibility of Abacha
succeeding himself.
</P>
<P>
It also disclosed that some of the country's five
newly-registered political parties are courting abacha as their
flagbearer.
</P>
<P>
General Sani Abacha came to power in a successful coup in
November 1993. In October 1995, he announced a three-year
transition program for power transfer to an elected president on
October 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Mazi Sam Ikoku, deputy chairman of the
Transition Implementation Committee, as saying that Abacha can
not be a presidential candidate as a military man, but if he
quits from the armed force, nothing will bar him.
</P>
<P>
He commented that the parties have the right to amend their
constitutions to accommodate a desired candidate, saying that it
is the same in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The deputy chairman praised Abacha as one of the most
successful political leaders of Nigeria in terms of keeping the
country together.

MILF is preparing for a large-scale offensive against government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Management Staff Chief and Undersecretary
Alexander Aguirre disclosed here today that the government will
try to bring the MILF leaders to the negotiation table as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Although the military reports identified members of the MILF's
"lost command" as those who are planning to conduct major
offensive operations, he said, it is still imperative to pursue
peace talks with MILF leadership.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said Fortunato Abat, chairman of the government panel
who will negotiate with the MILF, will fly to Mindanao to talk
with the MILF leaders to discuss how to start the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the aim of the government-MILF peace talks is to
achieve a comprehensive peace in Mindanao, but the total peace can
only be achieved if all other armed groups in Mindanao are also
involved in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's peace agreement with the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) will serve as a "term of reference" in the
negotiation with the MILF. However, the agreement was widely
opposed by almost all rebel groups in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> 250,000 Refugees Flee Camps in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 250,000 refugees have fled
their camps in Uvira, eastern Zaire, as fighting was still surging
this morning between government troops and the Banyamurenge rebels
in the region, reports said.
</P>
<P>
All the refugees in Uvira have left their 12 camps this
morning, Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted sources of humanitarian
groups there as saying.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) in the Great Lakes region of Africa put the figure of the
fled refugees at 220,000. He said many of the refugees were moving
towards Bukavu, capital of South Kivu province in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, a UNHCR spokesman said all the refugees from Uvira
were on the move, with some of them going to Bukavu, and some
going to the hills and banana plantations nearby.
</P>
<P>
"Some villagers also fled with the refugees. But no one has
arrived in Bukavu for the moment," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that fighting was going on this morning
between Zairean troops and the Banyamurenge rebels near Bwegera,
some 40 kilometers north of Uvira.
</P>
<P>
The camps housed Burundian and Rwandan refugees. The former
had fled ethnic conflicts between Hutus and Tutsis and the latter
were mainly Hutus reluctant to return home for fear of retaliation
from the Tutsi government after the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has accused Rwanda and Burundi of
supporting the Banyamurenges, originally ethnic Tutsis from Rwanda
but long resident in the mountainous regions in eastern Zaire.

ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan capital Kabul was
calm after the planned ceasefire deadline on mid-day (0700 GMT)

Dostum on Sunday and delivered to the Taliban militia by Pakistani
Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar, who is shuttling among Afghan
warring factions to seek ceasefire and peace talks.

<P>
The Taliban accepted the proposal on condition that prisoners
of wars should be exchanged simultaneously.

A spokesman for Ahmad Shah Masood, military commander of the
former government, in northern Jabul Saraj town said today that
Masood was ready to accept a ceasefire with the Taliban on

<HEADLINE> French Group Reaffirms Alliance with South Korea's Daewoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Lagardere Group of France
today reaffirmed its alliance with the South Korean Daewoo
Electronics corporation over the envisaged take-over of the state
company Thomson Multimedia by the South Korean corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based economic daily La Tribune Desfosse reported
today that negotiations are going on between the French government
and a French company on the possibility of maintaining the Thomson
Multimedia ``under the French flag.''
</P>
<P>
``A white knight could deposit, in the next few days, an offer
for the renewal of Thomson Multimedia at the Commission of
Privatization. The project could gather the financiers around a
recognized and indisputable businessman,'' said La Tribune.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Lagardere Group said today that the group is not
aware of the on-going negotiations and that its alliance with
Daewoo is maintained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the financing plan for the envisaged take-over of
Thomson Multimedia could be announced Tuesday, if Lagardere is by
then still authorized by the government to do so.
</P>
<P>
Lagardere has obtained the agreement from the government last
week to take over the industrial-military giant Thomson SA group
to build one of the largest defense industrial corporation in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Lagardere has decided to sell the civilian part of the Thomson
SA, the Thomson Multimedia, to Daewoo, while maintaining the
military part of the group, the Thomson CSF, to build a military
industrial giant with the Matra Defense Espace corporation.
</P>
<P>
The French government, which claims its neutrality in the
privatization plan, also has agreed to the plan of selling Thomson
Multimedia to Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
But the plan has met opposition from some trade unions, which
are hostile to the overall policy of privatization of Prime
Minister Alain Juppe.

<TEXT>
<P>
Today, I should like to talk about the question of guiding
public opinion in particular. At the National Working Conference
on Publicity and Ideological Work, I made the four points about
arming people with scientific theory, guiding them in correct
public opinion, training them to have lofty ideals, and inspiring
them with excellent literary works.
</P>
<P>
Departments and units in charge of publicity and ideological
work must provide the best products for the people, and use the
best products to "arm the people", "guide the people", "train the
people", and "inspire the people". In all four aspects, news
organizations can play an important role, and should have a sense
of the great and glorious mission of guiding the people with
correct public opinion, in particular.
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that the economic base determines the
superstructure, which in turn has an enormous impact on the
economic base. This is a basic point of Marxism. As an important
part of the superstructure and ideology, and because of its
characteristics and advantages, press-related public opinion is
closely linked to various aspects of politics, the economy, and
cultural life, and has a wide-range and profound impact. This was
true in the days when press and communications were not so
developed and it is all the more so today that press and
communications are more modern.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of a speech by General Secretary of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party and Chinese President Jiang Zemin during
his inspection of People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, on
September 26:
</P>
<P>
I have been reading the People's Daily for a long time. I read
it every day. But, this is the first time for me to come to the
People's Daily and actually talk with so many comrades in person.
</P>
<P>
First of all, I should like to extend my sincere thanks and my
greetings to all comrades at People's Daily. It is the official
newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
and China's leading newspaper. It is enormously influential both
in China and abroad. Over the past several decades, as the
mouthpiece of the Party, and under the leadership of the Party
Central Committee, the newspaper has adhered to the correct
guidelines and principles for a newspaper and has made great
contributions to the revolution, construction and reforms.
</P>
<P>
In trying to make a success of People's Daily, many veterans at
the paper have contributed their precious time and energy all
their lives, and their merits and spirit are worth praising and
emulating.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the paper has continued to serve the
people and socialism. It has publicized and help implement the
Party's basic theory, principles, and policy decisions in a
comprehensive and correct manner, and has reflected the great
deeds and ideological outlook of the masses of people, thereby
playing an important role in guiding public opinions for the
reforms, the opening up, and the socialist modernization drive,
and has truly played the role of pace-setter for newspapers
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Members of the editorial board of the paper and all other
employees work in a unified and diligent way, running the paper
with care, providing correct opinion guidance, and enriching the
contents of the paper and giving it new characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper has also made great progress in improving
internal operations, and has maintained its trend toward
stability, unity and continued progress. The Party Central
Committee is satisfied with the People's Daily's work. The paper
has won the trust of the people and has prestige among them. I
hope that all of us can treasure that trust and prestige, and can
constantly improve our work and run the paper even more
successfully.

<P>
Historical experience has shown repeatedly that correctness in
guiding public opinion is essential to the growth and
consolidation of our Party, the establishment and consolidation of
the people's political power, the unity of the people, and the
rich, strong and prosperity of the country. Correctly guiding
public opinion means happiness for the Party and the people. Error
in guiding public opinion spells disaster for the Party and the
people.
</P>
<P>
The Party's press work shares the good and bad with the Party
and is part of the life of the Party. We can say that public
opinion work means ideological and political work, and that work
is vital to the future of the Party and the country. Therefore,
our Party has consistently emphasized that leadership in
press-related public opinion must be firmly in the hands of those
who are loyal to Marxism, to the Party, and to the people.
</P>
<P>
Press-related public opinion organizations must above all
adhere to correct political orientation and to providing correct
guidance for public opinion. And, the work of press-related
opinion must, while centering on economic construction, be
subordinate to and serve the overall work of the Party and the
country. We must never become confused about this or waver in it.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Agree to Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
today agreed to ceasefire on all fronts in Afghanistan from
mid-day (07:00 GMT), said a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The report coming from Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters in
southern Afghanistan, quoted a Taliban spokesman named Mulla
Haqqani as saying that the Taliban also proposed a 12-member
commission to monitor the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said that the commission will include representatives
from the Taliban, the Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostum, the
Shiite Hezb-i-Wahdat led by Karim Khalili, and the former
government forces led by Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
"We accepted the ceasefire proposal raised by Dostum on the
condition that the ceasefire comes into force with a simultaneous
exchange of POWs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that visiting Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah
Babar, who arrived in Kandahar with Dostum's proposal late Sunday,
left for Mazar-i-Sharif, Dostum's headquarters in northern
Afghanistan, today to convey the Taliban's response to Dostum.
</P>
<P>
The ousted Afghan government troops led by Masood had advanced
towards Kabul recently and reached areas only 18 kilometers north
of the capital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that Masood got strong military support from
Dostum against the Taliban, but Dostum denied such accusation.

<P>
People's Daily plays an important role as a model and guide for
the country's other newspapers and the entire press circle as a
whole. Therefore, in implementing the same role of guidance in
public opinion, comrades from the People's Daily take an
especially heavy load and take especially heavy responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, People's Daily has accumulated a great deal of
experience and some profound lessons. It is a valuable asset to
summarize such experience and lessons, which should never be
forgotton. I hope that People's Daily will adhere to the Party
spirit and perseverely take as its guidance Deng Xiaoping's theory
of building socialism of Chinese characteristics and by the
Party's guidelines, and conform strictly with the Party Central
Committee no matter when and no matter in what circumstances to
expand on the themes of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism,
enthusiastically praising the people's outstanding achievements in
the reforms and construction, and inspire the people to work
arduously for the revitalization of our nation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, criticism and exposure must also
be conducted on negative phenomena such as corruption, so as to
give scope to a supervisory role in public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Those working in the newspaper office should have the whole
situation in mind and foster overall concepts, adhere to runing a
newspaper as statesmen, handling the relations between reforms,
development and stability in the correct way. What to print and
what not to print or how to print -- must proceed from a
consideration of the overall situation and the overall interests
of the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
With a prerequisite of adhering to correct guidelines for
public opinion, the art of publicity should be pursued, the level
of guidance be raised, and the publicity reports be made still
closer to life and to the readerships so that these reports will
become ever more popular with the broad spectrum of readers.

highly-competent contingent that runs the press. We should give
full scope to the journalists' enthusiasm, initiative, and
creativity through ideological and political work.
</P>
<P>
All the news media units should increase coordinations and join
forces to play a bigger role in promoting material civilization on
the one hand, and ethical and cultural progress on the other.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, central publicity departments and the press
circles have positively explored into the possibility of joining
forces and have gotten beneficial experience which should be
summed up to improve standards, so that the work can be done still
better.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that "All soldiers on the
ideological front should be 'soul engineers' of the humanity." The
title 'soul engineers' of the humanity is a very great appraisal
with high expectations, and is in fact not very easy to live up
to.
</P>
<P>
Educators must be educated themselves first. In order to
undertake still better the task of guiding the people with correct
ideology, members of the press, Communist Party members and
leading officials in particular, must strive to improve their
ideological, political and professional quality. Those comrades
working on the journalism front, especially middle-aged or younger
comrades, should have lofty ideals for the future and work in a
down-to-earth way, making genuine and assiduous efforts, on the
basis of good ideological, political, and professional qualities.

<TEXT>
<P>
The older generation of revolutionaries all attached great
importance to media work. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "A
provincial newspaper plays an extremely great role in organizing,
encouraging, promoting, criticizing, and advancing the province's
work and work for all the people in the province."
</P>
<P>
If this is the case with the provincial newspaper, it is even
more so for the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Party
Central Committee. Under the new historical conditions of reforms
and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping also pointed out that "the
Party's newspaper and periodicals must become the ideological
center of national stabilization and unity." We must fully
understand the essence of these directives to guide our work in
the news.
</P>
<P>
The people of all ethnic groups across China are working for
the accomplishment of the magnificent goals defined by the Ninth
Five-year Plan for National Economic and Social Development
(1996-2000) and the Long-range Goals for the Year 2010. The
beginning does not look bad and the overall situation is good,
even though there are still many difficulties and problems yet to
be overcome and resolved on the road of advancement.
</P>
<P>
Hostile forces have not abandoned, nor will they give up their
attempt to "Westernize" or "divide" the country. We should remain
sober-minded, seize opportunities, carry out the reform in an
in-depth way, and broaden the scale of the opening-up, so as to
promote a sustained development for national economy and all-round
progress of society, while resolutely safeguarding the political
situation which is marked by stability and unity. We must prepare
ourselves for any possible dangers when living in safety, and for
any possible risks when things are going smoothly.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is essential to lay a solid theoretical foundation.
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong thought and Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics should be adhered
to, and the Party's basic line should be kept to in guiding one's
own thinking and work. When a good theoretical basis is laid on
the Party's theory and political line, one can maintain a correct
political stance and political orientation, no matter how complex
the circumstances are or how the situation will change.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to lay a solid foundation for one's awareness
of policies, laws, and disciplines. The policies of central
authorities should be fully grasped, state laws and regulations
firmly be adhered to, and the working disciplines for press work
be strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
Media work is very closely related to politics and policies. If
members of the press do not understand or are not acquainted with
the Party's policies and state laws and regulations, they will not
be able to make a better presentation, or may even misguide the
public, bringing undeserved losses to the work of the Party and
the people.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to lay a solid foundation concerning the
viewpoint of firm belief in the masses. Media work and the work of
the Party's newspapers, are by virtue of their nature the work for
the public and are a major link between the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
Forging close contact with the masses of people is a must as
well as basic skills required by members of the press. Journalists
should foster the concept of firm belief in the masses, share weal
and woe with them, be good at doing investigations and studies,
keenly feel the pulse of the age, and attentively listen to the
aspirations of the people. In so doing, they are able to write
more good works that truly portray the reforms, opening-up, and
socialist modernization drive.

<P>
One must have extensive knowledge, because knowledge means
strength. The first thing is to have a thorough knowledge that has
direct links with one's own professional work, while reading
widely, including books of philosophy, politics, the economy, law,
history, and literature. One should also have as extensive an
understanding of science and technology as possible. I hope that,
among our press ranks, there will be more editors, reporters, and
commentators who understand politics and are well-versed in many
fields.
</P>
<P>
One must have solid training in journalism, because both
editing or reporting call for professional ability, and a good
command of language. Nowadays, many stories in newspapers have
good themes and content, and refined language and not only are
educational but also enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
Some articles, however, do not pay attention to style, and are
dull or full of cliches, try to please the public with nonsense,
and present concepts in an archaic manner, making it hard for
readers to understand them. This style of poor writing should be
changed and press people should be given a big push to have a
thorough training in basic skills.
</P>
<P>
In this new historical period, everyone should carry forward
the Party's working style in journalism. That means, first,
dedication to profession, and love for and devotion to the Party's
news work; second is to seek truth from the facts, report the
facts, and speak the facts; third is hard work and plain living,
fearing neither hardship, weariness, or danger to oneself; fourth
is a clean and honest working style: resisting money worship,
hedonism, and the ego, abide by the professional ethics, and
resolutely eliminating the practice of paid news; fifth is careful
work style, constantly improving one's work and be strictly on
guard against mistakes; and sixth is having the courage to create
something new, because news work is always someting new and has
broad prospects.

Journalists should, following the basic policy and principles
of the Party's journalist work, continue to explore new areas of
reporting and new reporting forms and methods, and write more
creative but good articles. The Editorial Board of the People's
Daily should encourage and organize their staff to work hard to
gain professional proficiency so that they can write more and
better stories, and this deserves recommendation.
</P>
<P>
People's Daily has many talents. Now many veterans have
retired and the present employees are middle-aged or are younger,
who are active in thinking and strong on new initiatives, and the
future and expectations of the Party's journalist work should rest
on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
The younger and middle-aged journalists should bring into full
play their own merits and strong points, but they should also be
able to see their faults and shortcomings, and conscientiously
carry forward their strong points and avoid their shortcomings and
inherit and carry forward the good traditions and work style of
the journalists of the older generation, and should mature
politically and professionally as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the People's Daily should pay more attention to
the work related to younger and middle-aged people, giving them
more to do, providing better conditions for them to contribute
their talent and to become more knowledgeable, and should work
hard to train a contingent of journalists who are politically
aware, professionally competent, and who have a strong sense of
discipline and a good work style.
</P>
<P>
The Party's policy has always been one that the Party and the
people run the newspapers. In this new historic period, this
policy should be better implemented in a way that suits the new
circumstances and new practices. While concentrating their efforts
on running the paper well, people of the People's Daily should
also work hard to do a better job of management and other business
undertakings. Party committees and governments at all levels
should care more about the newspaper, support it and make active
contributions to making it a better paper.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President Promises to Solve Economic Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam said here today that his government will vitalize
economy and enhance national defense of the nation.
</P>
<P>
In a policy speech on the 1996 budget bill which Prime Minister
Lee Soo-sung read in the National Assembly plenary session, Kim
said that the government will continue the effort to eliminate
inefficiency and irregularities to improve his administration's
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government will give top fiscal priority to
checking inflation next year, Kim promised to improve the system
of distributing agricultural and manufactured products to stabilize
prices by lowering transportation and storage costs.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will use the joining of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) as a turning point to actively
participate in the international economic and trade activities,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
On October 11, the OECD Council formally decided in Paris to
invite South Korea as a new OECD member. When South Korea joins
the organization of the advanced nations within this year as expected
after going through required domestic procedures, it will be the 29th
OECD member country and the third nation to join it this year after
Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
On the recent submarine incident, Kim urged the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to admit its submarine
infiltration into South Korea, apologize for its provocative move
and promise that such an incident should not be repeated in the
future.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has said that a group of armed DPRK people
"infiltrated" into the country's Kangwon Province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Over the past one month, 11 DPRK people were founded to have
killed themselves, 11 were killed South Korean troops and one was
captured alive. Three are reportedly still missing.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has said that the submarine, while on a training mission,
drifted after having an engine trouble and hitting rock in the sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul claimed that the case of the intrusion was not
an "inadvertent incident that occurred during routine training" as
Pyongyang said, but was a "carefully premediated act of provocation."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has repeatedly threatened to take retaliatory steps
against South Korea for the killing of DPRK people who "landed ashore
in South Korea due to the engine trouble of the submarine."

TOKYO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Japan (BOJ) is to
maintain its easy monetary policy for the time being to ensure
Japan's economic recovery, Kyodo News Service quoted bank Governor
Yasuo Matsushita as saying here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the outset of a two-day quarterly meeting of the
BOJ's local branch managers, Matsushita said that it is
appropriate to continue giving monetary policy priority to
consolidate the groundwork for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita said the Japanese economy is continuing a recovery.
The tempo of the recovery, however, is still "moderate," partly
because structural reforms of the economy are serving as a damping
factor for the momentum of the recovery, he said.

<HEADLINE> OIC Envoy Calls for Immediate Ceasefire in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) today appealed to the Afghan leaders for the
cessation of hostilities and immediate ceasefire, paving the way
for the negotiated solution of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The fresh appeal was made by the OIC Secretary General's
special representative on Afghanistan, Sheikh Ibrahim Saleh Bakr,
in a press conference held here.
</P>
<P>
Bakr recently returned from Afghanistan after holding talks
with the Taliban leaders and the powerful northern warlord Rashid
Dostum.
</P>
<P>
He could not meet with the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani
or his military commander Ahmad Shah Masood due to communications
difficulties, as he put it.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban and Dostum are ready for ceasefire,
followed by peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But both sides put some conditions on the talks. The Taliban's
condition was the neutrality of Rashid Dostum in their war with
Masood forces. Masood, who has allied with Dostum, wanted to make
Kabul a free zone.
</P>
<P>
Distrust prevails among the faction leaders and does not allow
them to agree on the place of talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his formula for peace after the cessation of
hostilities, Bakr said the observers from the OIC and UN member
countries will be appointed to monitor the compliance of
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
As a next step, he invited the Afghan leaders to the OIC
headquarters at Jeddha for talks.
</P>
<P>
All the groups, including Afghan former king Zahir Shah, will
be invited to the talks. The neighboring countries will take part
in the negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to find peace is negotiations. The Afghan
leaders have the realization that the talks are the sole solution.
War has ravaged the country and its continuance will invite more
penury and destruction to the people of Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not give any deadline for the ceasefire. However, he
said, the sooner it is, the better.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Afghanistan today said the Taliban
militia today accepted Dostum's proposal for a ceasefire on all
Afghan fronts from mid-day today (07:00 GMT) amid continuous
fighting around the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban accepted the proposal on the condition the
ceasefire comes into force with a "simultaneous exchange" of
prisoners held by the warring factions, said the Taliban official,
Mulla Muhammed Haqqani, from the militia's headquarters in
Kandahar in southwest Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Three rockets smashed into Kabul airport today minutes after
the arrival of the United Nations special envoy on Afghanistan,
Norbert Holl, who flew into Kabul on a special UN flight, for
talks with the Taliban administration's acting Deputy Foreign
Minister Sher Mohammad Stanakzai.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
strengthened against major currencies today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 79.78 US cents from 79.45 on
Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was revived by buying orders from both
domestic and overseas investors. The interest rates differential
between Australia and other Western countries makes the Australian
dollar an attractive shelter for investors.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was pushed up to a four-year-high against
the Japanese yen by buying interest from Japan. It ended at 89.97
yen from 89.15 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also firmer against the German mark,
ending at 1.2313 marks from 1.2247 Friday.

<P>
TOKYO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Mitsubishi Electric
Corp. plans to manufacture commercial communications satellites
in a few years to meet an expected surge in global demand for the
product, Kyodo News Service quoted a company spokesman as saying
Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first Japanese company to enter the satellite
market currently dominated by U.S. suppliers, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electric is expected to receive orders from Space
Communications Corp., a Mitsubishi group carrier of satellite
communications services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Space Communications launched in 1992 two commercial
satellites, both produced by U.S. manufacturers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company will turn to Mitsubishi Electric when it replaces
the satellites at around the turn of the century, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese satellite suppliers currently produce satellites for
the National Space Development Agency of Japan for technological
experiments and also supply some commercial satellite components
to U.S. and European manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electric hopes to boost annual sales of space
communications-related products, including commercial satellites,
to 100 billion yen in 2000 from the current 40 billion yen, he
said.

TAIYUAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province is trying to
develop infrastructure to put an end to its backwardness, with
about 22 billion workdays involved in water conservation work in
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the province improved one million
hectares of eroded land and added 200,000 ha of farmland, and is
expected to have 10 billion kg in grain output this year, a record
high.
</P>
<P>
The province is on the loess plateau and lacks water resources,
but the "Life Project" to divert Yellow River water, with a total
investment of 12 billion yuan, will ease the water problem to a
great extent.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has invested 13 billion yuan in roads since 1993, and
every village is served by roads, while the Taiyuan-Jiuguan
expressway, the province's first, was completed in June of this
year. Another 132-km expressway, from Yuanping to Taiyuan, is
expected to open to traffic in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure development has not only improved the
standard of living, but also provided a good investment
environment, according to Sun Wensheng, governor of the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The commission of the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway Line not only has brought about favorable
conditions for development in east China's Jiangxi Province, but
also created many investment opportunities for domestic and
overseas investors, according to a senior provincial official.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zheping, vice governor of the province, said in a recent
interview with Xinhua that Jiangxi has worked out a plan for
establishing seven major bases along the section of the railway
line in the province, which is more than 800 km, one-third of the
total length of the line.
</P>
<P>
These undertakings need lots of funds from domestic and
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The newly built railway line started operation on
September 1.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor said that the railway line has profound
impact on Jiangxi's future economic development, as the line has
shortened the distance between the province and China's coastal
areas, inland provices and Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan regions and
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), Jiangxi
needs three billion U.S. dollars of overseas funds," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Jiangxi will provide foreign investors with
all conveniences, and will select a number of projects with ideal
conditions for cooperation, and will make good preparations for
the official launching of the projects.

In the meantime, the province will also work out a series of
preferential policies for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Located on the southern bank of the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River, the country's longest, Jiangxi Province is the
hinterland of Zhujiang (Pearl) River Delta, Yangtze River Delta
and Southeastern Fujian Delta.
</P>
<P>
It is also an important part for developing the open economic
belt along the Yangtze River and the economic zone along the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway Line.
</P>
<P>
The province has 96 kinds of mineral resources with proven
reserves. It also boasts China's largest fresh-water lake --
Poyang Lake, which is also considered as the biggest reservoir for
raising fresh-water fish in the country.
</P>
<P>
The commission of the railway line has put Jiangxi on an
advantageous junction of China's golden waterway of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Experts acknowledge after on-the-spot investigations in the
province that Jiangxi represents the best section of the entire
railway line for its rich resources, investment environment and
development potentials.
</P>
<P>
To make a full use of this advantage and bring it into full
play, the province has drafted an overall plan for the
development of the areas along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway Line in
the Ninth Five-Year Plan period and for the year of 2010.
</P>
<P>
The province will encourage more foreign investment in sectors
of energy, transport, basic facilities, raw materials industry,
agriculture, upgrading of large and medium-sized enterprises and
tourism, according to the plan.

CHANGSHA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central
China is making a greater effort to improve highway transportation
by investing more than 7.4 billion yuan in the last four years in
800 kilometers of high grade roads.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, few of the 40,000 kilometers of local roads
were highways, because of a shortage in funds for highways, and
there was less than six kilometers of highways in the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve the transportation bottleneck, the province
promoted highway construction on several of the best sections
linking Changsha, and called for overseas investment to ease its
fund shortage, getting more than three million US dollars in loans
from international financial organizations for highway
construction.
</P>
<P>
Local people have also raised more than 10 billion yuan for
building 30,000 kilometers of highways, 13,000 kilometers of
cement and cinder roads, and more than 600 bridges.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to build a highway network through Changsha,
Yiyang, Changde, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan and Hengyang, to improve local
transportation.

<HEADLINE> International Meeting on Power Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 21 (Xinhua) -- An international
conference on electricity supply opened here today with Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad calling for the use of
environment-friendly hydro-electric power.
</P>
<P>
Opening the five-day conference, Mahathir said hydro-electric
power must be considered the best choice for the environment if
"we want to claim electricity as the intelligent choice for the
environment."
</P>
<P>
The next choice is gas followed by fuel-oil and coal, while
wind, solar, waste and biomass are only of academic interest at
the moment, he commented.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the use of hydro power to generate electricity
would not pollute the atmosphere as compared to the use of coal or
fuel-oil.
</P>
<P>
He said hydro-electric plants could be designed to minimize
environmental damage by largely preserving the flora and fauna to
improve the attractiveness of the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
A country with cheap and abundant electric power supply can
develop very quickly, he noted. "The developed countries
invariably have huge generating capacities and they are therefore
able to make full use of their economic potentials," he said.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries, on the other hand, are faced with
many obstacles even if they have huge power generating potential
in the form of great rivers, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The obstacles include high capital cost for the construction of
hydro-electric plants and environmental issues which the developed
countries do not have to face when they are developing their huge
hydro power, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The result is that the poor countries are likely to be
deprived of cheap electrical power which will condemn them to
perpetual poverty. The saddest thing is that poor people are the
biggest destroyers of the environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
To sustain life, they often cut down the whole forest for
firewood. It "will soon destroy all our forests, besides releasing
huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the air," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said if electricity generation could be made cheap, a
greater number of people would be able to enjoy its benefits like
improving their quality of life and at the same time the
environment would be less damaged.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being attended by some 2,000 delegates from
44 countries and regions, and will discuss technical matters as
well as regulatory issues, utility pricing, power purchase
agreements and industry conditions and needs, according to
conference sources.

HARARE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 90,000 Zimbabweans

"Nationals of all countries subject to S. Africa visa controls
are now being strictly screened, not just Zimbabweans. This is in

Mongolia autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has passed laws and regulations on
protecting land, forests, grasslands, water, soil, and wild
animals and plants in recent years. It also has set up special
administrative organizations and research institutes to study and
protect the desert ecology.
</P>
<P>
The 24.71-million-hectare Qangtang Nature Reserve in Tibet is
the country's largest of its kind, with 70 species from 20
families of plants and dozens of rare animal species.
</P>
<P>
The Qidaoqiao Diversiform-leaved Poplar Nature Reserve in Ejin
Banner (county), Inner Mongolia, has succeeded in growing about
1,000 hectares of diversiform-leaved poplars, a rare tree for
desert areas. Gansu has set up a number of desert nature reserves
to grow trees and grass, and Qinghai has made progress in
controlling sandy land by using scientific methods.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserves in Qinghai, and in the Xinjiang Uygur and
Ningxia Hui autonomous regions are playing a major role in
protecting wild animals and plants, and the provinces and regions
have had tangible results in limiting the expansion of sandy areas
by planting shelter-forests and shrubs.

<HEADLINE> China's Forest Railway Out of Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The 28-ton steam locomotive
that played an important role in the history of China's lumber
industry is falling prey to quotas in the industry, which protect
forest resources, and timber price hikes, which are turning the
machine into an antique.
</P>
<P>
The declining number of forest railway lines, down from 35 to
less than 20, and the amount of track, down from more than 1,600
km to less than 500 km, means that they are now something for
tourists and sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
China's forest railways were first built by Japanese invaders
in northeast China in the early 1940s, to plunder China's forest
resources. Transportation was quite backward, and the wood-stoked
locomotives joined horses in transporting timber from deep in the
forests.
</P>
<P>
After new China was founded in 1949, the government decided to
use the forest resources, so 35 new railway lines were built in
the 1950s, greatly increasing their capacity.
</P>
<P>
The narrow gauge railways are only half the width of standard
gauge, and capacity is only a third, but it has passenger cars
that can carry 50 people each.
</P>
<P>
Railway workers still use the old-fashioned flags to signal
during the day and lamps at night, and stations communicate with
each other via hand-written notes. Many have spent years in the
forests, working 24-hour shifts, and are hard to distinguish from
the loggers.
</P>
<P>
In the Greater Hinggan Mountain Forest in Inner Mongolia alone,
the number of railway workers is 4,987, handling 20 percent of the
region's transportation volume.
</P>
<P>
When enterprising business people came to see their unique
characteristics they thought of a way to utilize the outmoded
facilities, developing forest tourism as a business, and using the
train as a convenient vehicle to carry tourists around to
different scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Three forestry departments in the Greater Hinggan Mountain
region have already gotten involved in this kind of tourism.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Falls in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
continued to fall in September with the total trade at current
prices shrinking by 1.1 percent on a three month moving average
basis, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that on a monthly basis, total trade decreased
marginally by 0.6 percent in September, while non-oil domestic
exports declined by 6.2 percent due to the continued sluggishness
in global electronics demand.
</P>
<P>
However, on a three month moving average basis, non-oil
domestic exports fell by 2.4 percent to a level of 7.3 billion
Singapore dollars (about 5.2 billion US dollars) in September.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports grew at a marginal rate of 0.5 percent on a three
month moving average basis, and at 0.1 percent on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports achieved a strong growth of 15.5 percent
on a three month moving average basis to reach 1.3 billion
Singapore dollars (about 928.6 million US dollars), thanks to the
increase in oil price in the aftermath of the US-Iraq conflict.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the growth of domestic exports of oil stood
at 26.3 percent in September, due mainly to the 18 percent rise in
oil price, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
Imports amounted to 14.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 10.57
billion US dollars) in September, marking a decrease of 2.3
percent as compared with a year ago, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the decrease was largely in integrated circuits,
computer parts and peripherals, parts of VCRs, color television
sets and radios, and other products.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, imports of crude petroleum, disk drives, other
fuel oils, blank computer tapes and discs, other machines and
appliances, cigarettes, motorized vessels, printers, tankers, high
speed diesel fuel and other electronic valves and tubes recorded
increases, it said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Plans to Crack down on Fake Healers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to crack down on the mushroom growth of fake healers who
often cheat people in the name of magic cure.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources here today, as the first step,
the Ministry of Health has drafted a proposal to reinforce a
14-year-old law to penalize the "witch doctors" advertising in the
media which borders on obscenities.
</P>
<P>
After the proposal is approved by the parliament, the fine for
the advertisers will be raised from a mere TK 25,000 (about 600 US
dollars) to TK 100,000 (about 2,400 dollars) and 2 years' rigorous
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there has been a spurt in advertisements
even in national dailies, explaining a wide variety of treatment
based on "faith healing" or traditional medicines. But they have
no approval from either the Drug Administration or the authorities
on traditional medicines and many of them contain harmful
chemicals like mercury and arsenic.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Money-Raising Race Goes on Despite Reform Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Republicans in the United
States brought in 92.5 million dollars over the last three months,
out-raising the Democrats by 2-to-1, according to the latest
election finance reports.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1995, the Republican National Committee has
collected 239 million dollars, mostly in contributions from
individuals or corporations.
</P>
<P>
The reports, which were released Sunday, show that the
Democrats are breaking their own records, too. The Democratic
National Committee took in 46.5 million dollars last quarter and
reported receipts of 177 million dollars since the start of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Campaign donations, the so-called "soft money" for political
parties in particular, have become a hot issue in the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, whose
presidential campaign has benefited from GOP funding, called for
abolishing the use of such "soft money" in the future and endorsed
other campaign financing reforms.
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to preserve the American people's confidence in
the system, we need to return campaign finance to the front
burner," The Associated Press quoted Dole as saying in Nashua, New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, too, has called for campaign financing
reform, and his campaign aides said Dole had come late to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Dole accused Clinton of fund-raising abuses
"involving the foreign corruption of America." The Clinton camp
responded that Dole has accepted "the same kind of money" from
foreigners with U.S. residence.
</P>
<P>
Reports to the Federal Election Commission show the Democrats
have doubled their fund-raising over the 1993-94 season when the
national party brought in 83.1 million dollars. And the
Republicans were also to double the 133.5 million dollars in
receipts they reported in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
Much of the money raised by the national parties is farmed out
to the states. Some also goes straight to the presidential and
congressional candidates, and millions is spent on TV
advertising.

<HEADLINE> Four EU Members' "Green Dot Measure" to Affect Thai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai exporters are expected to
be negatively affected by a recent move by four key European Union
members to force exporters to pay for environmental costs or take
their goods back.
</P>
<P>
Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands recently raised a
new environmental issue which could be considered as a non-tariff
barrier to trade under the so-called "green dot measure."
</P>
<P>
Under the new measure, which has already been implemented,
exporters would have to pay more for environmental costs incurred
from the waste treatment of packaging. Otherwise, the four
countries would ask the exporters to take their goods back.
</P>
<P>
The measure has been accepted by the World Trade Organization
as a voluntary measure.
</P>
<P>
Although this measure seems to be wrong in terms of bilateral
trade, it is right according to the GATT (General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade) principle, because it was transparent,
non-discriminatory and voluntary, according to Sitanon
Jesadapipat, director of the natural resource management project
under the Thailand Environmental Institute.
</P>
<P>
If Thailand does not want to accept the requirement, it should
reject it immediately. Otherwise it must act in line with it,
Sitanon said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the "green dot measure" is considered as being
unfair because those countries seem to be transferring their
responsibility for domestic environmental protection to exporters.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the four countries had sent letters to
the Federation of Thai Industries, Thai businessmen failed to
express any comments on the new rule within the requested 60 days,
because the letters did not go into details and were written in
the German language, which most Thai businessmen do not
understand.

<HEADLINE> Laos to Seek Voting on Location of MRC Head Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Laos will seek a vote on the
location of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) headquarters at the
MRC's second council meeting to be held in Vientiane, the Lao
capital, on October 29 and 30, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the National Mekong Committee of Laos said
that if Cambodia cannot accept a compromise on taking turns to
host the MRC headquarters with Laos, a vote by the four MRC member
states should be the means to a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Vientiane is ready to accept the outcome of the voting even if
it loses, the official said, adding that this would be better than
remaining silent and leaving the problem unresolved.
</P>
<P>
The approach by Laos is aimed at breaking the year-long
deadlock over the choice of a location for the MRC head office.
</P>
<P>
Laos had earlier reportedly offered to host the MRC
headquarters with Cambodia on a rotating basis for five or 10
years at a time with Vientiane being the first site.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh has yet to respond, but Bangkok has opposed the
offer on the grounds that moving the headquarters would
unnecessarily incur a huge budget.
</P>
<P>
Thailand dropped out of the race last year and said it would
back Vientiane while Vietnam also withdrew and the MRC member
states agreed that Laos and Cambodia should settle the matter
bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
The MRC, which groups Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, was
formed in April last year to replace the Mekong Committee. The
Mekong Secretariat office, the MRC's temporary headquarters, is
currently located in Bangkok. Laos is this year's chairman of the
Mekong Council, the MRC's decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Laos and MRC staff in Bangkok said a quick
decision is essential for reassuring the international donor
community that there is solidarity among the member states.

<P>
SEOUL, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul Air Show '96 opened
today for a seven-day run at the Seoul Airport with the
participation of 214 aerospace and defense-related companies from
21 countries.
</P>
<P>
The show, the first such international event hosted by South
Korea, will serve as a springboard for the country to become a
power in the aerospace industry, organizers here said.
</P>
<P>
Officially called the "7th Seoul International Aerospace
Symposium and Air Show," the event will also serve as a forum for
competition among foreign participants for South Korea's new
fighter acquisition program, code-named "FX," disclosed by Air
Force Chief of Staff Yi Kwang-hak early this month.
</P>
<P>
Besides, South Korean and foreign firms will also display their
defense and aerospace-related equipment and parts.
</P>
<P>
The air show includes such events as an exhibition of aerospace
and defense industries, an aerospace symposium, as well as
demonstrations and aerobatic flights by the South Korean Air
Force's "Black Eagle" team and foreign flying teams.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said that billions of U.S. dollars worth of
deals are expected to be signed during the show.
</P>
<P>
The event is also likely to serve as an occasion for
technological cooperation among the participants, they said.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft to be displayed include the F-15E, F-117 and F/A-18
from the United States, the Su-30 and Su-37 from Russia, the
Rafale from France, the Hawk from Britain, various helicopters and
other civilian and military airplanes.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Air Force officials were said to be paying keen
attention to the fighters for the FX program.
</P>
<P>
The candidates include the Rafale of the French Dassault
Aviation, the Su-37 of Russia's Sukhoi Design Bureau, the F-15E of
the U.S. McDonnell Douglas, and the Eurofighter 2000 which is
being jointly developed by Germany, Spain, Italy and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Interior Provinces Tempt Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Central and western China
provinces have listed 2,500 investment opportunities to persuade
investors of good potential returns at the ongoing 80th session of
the Chinese Export Commodities Fair.
</P>
<P>
Most of the projects proposed involved exploring for mineral
resources, harnessing hydroelectric power, agricultural
development and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Policy incentives included discount prices in land use and
cutbacks in various taxes at cost to the local treasury.
</P>
<P>
"The central and western provinces are of strategic importance
to China's industrial setup and for the well-being of the
country's export-based economy," said Pei Yingwu, vice-chairman of
the China Information Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
Restricted by geographic drawbacks, especially poor
transportation conditions, the economies of inland provinces lay
dormant while economies of coastal provinces took off.
</P>
<P>
According to Pei, inland provinces, especially those of central
China, are populated with a huge and comparatively cheap labor
supply, which is crucial for the success of labor-intensive
projects.
</P>
<P>
Rich mineral reserves are ready to generate for the provinces
their due as China liberalizes its policies to give foreign
investors access to developing them, he said.

<HEADLINE> Elections Should Not Hurt People - Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said that next year's general elections should not leave bruises
in the heart of the people but reflect the exercise of their
rights.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting marking the 32nd anniversary of the
founding of the ruling functional group Golkar last night,
Soeharto said the general elections should be aimed at
strengthening national unity and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"We hold the elections once in (every) five years to implement
the principle of people's sovereignty," said Soeharto, chairman of
the Golkar Board of Patrons.
</P>
<P>
Clad in yellow jackets, thousands of Golkar's cadres attended
the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the ruling parties from a number of
countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, China, Vietnam, the
Philippines, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the
Republic of Korea, were also present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Golkar leaders say they want to win at least 70.02 percent of
the total votes in the general elections, scheduled for June next
year.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Chairman Harmoko said in a speech that the targeted
percentage was based on a calculation of people's support for
Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Golkar leaders hope their party would retain the comfortable
majority in the 500-seat House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The party has won all the five elections held under President
Soeharto. In 1992, it took 68 percent of the votes, a big margin
but a drop from the 73 percent it won in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Golkar is contesting the elections with the United Development
Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party. Only 425 seats are up
for grabs as the other 75 are reserved for the armed forces, whose
members do not vote.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Waste in Former U.S. Military Base Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States has confirmed
the presence of hazardous military waste, including cancer-causing
asbestos, in a former U.S. airbase in the Philippines, the
Philippine daily Inquirer reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said a 32-page review prepared by the U.S. Defense
Department of the draw-down activities at the Clark Airbase
identified 10 "hazardous waste accumulation points" in the
35,000-hectare facility, which the Philippine government has
converted into a special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Clark Field, 80 kilometers north of Manila, was once the
largest American airbase outside the U.S. mainland and the U.S.
Airforce withdrew from the base in November 1991 after the
eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a statement of the People's Task Force for
Bases Cleanup as saying the report supported studies which
detected the presence of oil, grease and cadmium in Clark's ground
water.
</P>
<P>
The ground water is being used by about 6,000 families
evacuated from the Mt. Pinatubo area, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important things in the U.S. Defense Department
report is the admission by the U.S. Airforce that some of the
damaged buildings in Clark "contained asbestos," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Asbestos, used as a building material against fire and heat, is
found to be a human carcinogen and its inhalation may cause lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The paper however pointed out that the U.S. report does not
mention the location of each asbestos burial site and the amount
of asbestos buried although "records are maintained" by the
Americans.

<HEADLINE> Hebei to Make More Room for Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province is
to turn 21,000 hectares of fertile land occupied by grave mounds
into farmland this year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities said that 9.6 million grave mounds
have to be leveled within a limited period of time in a bid to
save precious land resources, the Beijing-based China Land News
said quoting a circular issued by the province's land
administration.
</P>
<P>
The move could salvage more than 440 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Ancient tombs or tombs of revolutionary martyrs, celebrities or
the ancestral grave mounds of overseas Chineses, which have been
under State protection, will remain untouched, the "China Land
News" said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1950s the Chinese Government has devoted greater effort
into encouraging people to adopt cremation instead of traditional
grave burial.
</P>
<P>
Today, cremation has been widely adopted by urban people and in
some rural areas where cremation is available. Burying the dead in
the ground is still allowed in some rural areas, but grave mounds
on farmland are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The province has attached great importance to popularizing
cremation in areas where facilities and related services are
available.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.18 million bodies were cremated by the turn of the
century, helping salvage 2,400 hectares of cultivated land in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The province constantly urges the local grassroots agencies to
improve cremation facilities and services, and encourages
construction of cinerariums for people to store ashes of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Public and paid cemeteries will be allowed in areas with barren
hills, and for the dead whose grave mounds have been leveled.

<HEADLINE> Wenzhou Stresses Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Wenzhou, a coastal city in east
China's Zhejiang Province, is winning fame as a place of quality
products thanks to strict quality control measures, "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Zhang Youyu, secretary of the Wenzhou City
Party Committee, as saying that a systematic quality-control
project launched in 1993, and the strong determination of the city
government to combat shoddy products and upgrade product quality,
have produced noticeable improvements in people's awareness of the
quality and the quality of local products.
</P>
<P>
Within three years, the city's image has been changed and its
economy has gained breakthrough progress as more enterprises take
product quality as their basic standard.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the average standard rate of
product inspection, which is rising yearly, reached 88.9 percent
last year -- higher than the provincial and national records.
</P>
<P>
Wenzhou, an open city with a population of seven million, used
to manufacture poorly copying products of other areas.
</P>
<P>
It is now producing quality leather shoes, clothes and other
products that sell well at home and abroad -- and which even
have been copied by business people in other areas, according to
sources with the State Bureau of Technical Supervision (SBTS), which
oversees the country's quality control work.
</P>
<P>
"The initial success and experience of Wenzhou shows that its
efforts to develop the economy through adopting quality-control
measures is an important way to enhance the quality and efficiency
of local economic development", said Li Chuangqing, director of the
SBTS.
</P>
<P>
He also said Wenzhou's experience shows that promoting city
development with strict quality-control measures is a systematic
project that requires both the attention of the local government
and the support and participation of all social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Wenzhou's strategy has spurred nationwide attention.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics suggest that to date, about 20 cities
around the country have introduced similar strategies that have
begun to produce benefits.

<HEADLINE> Village School Educates Rural, Urban Children (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NANJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A village elementary school in
east China's Jiangsu Province received over 200 children from its
neighboring city Wuxi when the new term began this fall.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 personal computers are available for students in
Xinkaihe Elementary School, which also has specially designed
facilities where pupils can study English, play piano and
violin, and do indoor exercises.
</P>
<P>
The school also has a swimming pool, a well-equipped dining hall
and a dormitory. The entire facility covers an area of 29,333
square meters.
</P>
<P>
But while Xinkaihe has many of the perks which often are found
only in urban high schools and universities, most of its students
say the greatest attraction is its headmaster, Ding Guyi.
</P>
<P>
Ding, 55, was formerly the headmaster of a leading elementary
school in Wuxi. After she retired early this year, she was
appointed headmaster by the village school.
</P>
<P>
Her aim as an educator, she says, is to bring up a new
generation qualified for the challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
With Ding's encouragement, a high-quality staff is taking
shape: 14 outstanding, just-retired teachers came to the school
from Wuxi, and more than ten well-trained young teachers have been
employed.
</P>
<P>
Pupils here begin studying computers in the first grade; by the
time they are in third grade, they are studying English.
</P>
<P>
Ding gives credit for the school's success to Ye Bochang, the
director of a local township factory, who holds that if rural
education cannot be lifted to a higher level, China will not
become a truly advanced country.

Ye's factory contributed 16 million yuan toward the
construction of Xinkaihe. The village government donated an
additional four million yuan.
</P>
<P>
When the school was established, Ye went to Wuxi several times
to appeal to Ding to be the first headmaster.
</P>
<P>
"I was moved by Ye's ideal. I have worked for more than 30 years
in urban schools, and I wanted to do something for the rural
education in my lifetime," Ding said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an exclusive school. It opens its door to children
of farmers, workers and other ordinary people," Ding stressed.
</P>
<P>
The school enrolls over 400 local children in addition to the
200-plus urban pupils.
</P>
<P>
"Urban children are quick-thinking, experienced and
knowledgeable, while rural children are hard-working and steady,"
Ding noted. "We hope they can learn from one another."

LANZHOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yuhua, a 27-year-old
farmer in northwest China's Gansu Province, never dreamed that one
day she would attend the Non-Government Organization Forum that
was held last fall in Beijing in conjunction with the United
Nations Fourth World Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
Wang of Cuijia Village, Cuijiaya Township, Qilihe District,
near Lanzhou, the provincial capital, has been a model in showing
her fellow villagers the way to prosperity by growing fruit trees,
and was the only rural woman in the province to attend the NGO
forum.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 women farmers like her have begun to emerge and
play an important role in Gansu's rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
Luojiabao Village, in the suburbs of Linxia, another city, used
to be so poor that young women in other villages would not even
consider marrying the young men there. Now however, residents in
Luojiabao have become more prosperous and attribute it to the
woman village leader Qi Fengmei.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Qi became secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Luojiabao Branch Committee, and decided to help her fellow
villagers live better lives, so she encouraged them to raise cows.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen families succeeded in that way the very year, and
villagers now have 257 cows bringing in 250,000 yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Qi also built a sand and stone company that generates an annual
income of 150,000 yuan, and last year, she got a construction crew
to win housing project contracts, earning 1,500,000 yuan for her
village.

The villagers in Luojiabao who are better off than before
praised Qi for being a "tireless able woman," but she herself
said, "Everyone should have a life goal. If a woman just wants to
work as a housewife, how can she realize her own value?"
</P>
<P>
More farmers in Gansu have come to see that agro-techniques are
essential to achieving prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Shi Yueying is one of those who showed fellow villagers how to
use improved techniques. The 52-year-old woman from Xintian Town,
Linyao County, simply taught herself, then helped more young female
farmers learn her crop sewing methods by holding training courses.
</P>
<P>
She has, by now, taught 7,000 students, 2,000 of whom are
engaged in the work and 200 of whom now work as tutors, just as
she did.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guilan is another capable woman in Linyao County who
breeds improved strains of winter wheat.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, she founded a breeding institute, and by relying on
local farmers, has bred over 20 improved strains of spring and
winter wheat, broad beans, and other crops.
</P>
<P>
Because of their outstanding achievements, Wang Yuhua, Shi
Yueying, Zhang Guilan have all been chosen as 'March Eighth Red

<HEADLINE> Shangdong Building More Housing after Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI. October 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,400,000 square
metres of housing are planned to resettle 288,400 people in east
China's Shangdong Province, according to China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
This year's summer floods of the Yellow River forced them to
move from now flooded areas to higher land along river banks.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the new housing will move residents beyond
flood lines for good. The construction will cost 1,600 million
yuan (192.8 million yuan US dollars), said Song Fashang, deputy
governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has distributed 310 million yuan
(37.3 million US dollars) to resettle 200 villages by
mid-1997. The rest will be in their new homes by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Platforms will be built for 176 villages who have long lived
and farmed within flood lines and were unable or unwilling to move.
</P>
<P>
Floods during June and July damaged one million hectares of
farmland, with 290,000 ha of crops completely ruined, costing the
province 9,500 million yuan (1,100 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Twenty Shangdong counties along the river were seriously
flooded and more than 800 villages were completely innundated.
</P>
<P>
About 567 million yuan (68 million US dollars) will be invested
in 221,000 water conservancy projects, compared with last year's
investment of 296 million yuan (35.7 million US dollars). Some
7,000 water conservancy projects were launched this month.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Latin American Trade Grows Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Latin American trade in
the first eight months of this year totaled 4.18 billion
U.S. dollars, a rise of 7.9 percent over the same period last
year, according to China's General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Latin American Trade may reach seven billion U.S. dollars
this year, sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the eight-month period, China exported 1.9 billion
U.S. dollars worth of commodities to Latin America, a drop of 9.2
percent from the same period last year, and imported 2.27 billion
dollars worth, up 28.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Latin American trade was 2.29 billion U.S. dollars worth
in 1990, but grew to more than 6 billion dollars worth by 1995,
hitting a record high. China has trade ties with 33 countries and
13 regions in Latin America, and has signed trade agreements with
13 countries.
</P>
<P>
Visits of high-ranking officials not only have helped the
development of political relations between China and Latin
America, but also economic, technological, and investment
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China now has 195 businesses or joint venture businesses in
Latin America, with actual investment estimated at 300 million
U.S. dollars, and Latin American business people have 200
investment projects in China, with investment reaching 300 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Latin American trade has also promoted financial
cooperation and improvement of transport conditions in both
areas. The Bank of China is planning on opening another branch in
Latin America. Its first Latin American office opened in Panama in
1994.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Massing for Major Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- An armed group of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) is massing its forces in various
areas in the southern Philippines in preparation for a large-scale
attack against government troops, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence officers said leaders of the so-called
"Lost Command" group of more than 2,000 heavily armed rebels held
a meeting over the weekend in a seaport near Zamboanga City in
Mindanao where they allegedly discussed the attack plans.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence reports pointed to a Zamboanga town as
the target of the Muslim rebels in their surprise attack,
prompting Southern Command chief Lieutenant General Ruperto Ambil
to put the military and police in the area on full alert.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that "Lost Command" is geared up for a major
attack as a "bargaining chip" in the coming exploratory peace
talks between the MILF and the government.
</P>
<P>
But earlier, General Arturo Enrile, chief of staff of the Armed
Forces, said any offensives and harassment operations would not
jeopardize the government-MILF peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Last year, "Lost Command" rebels launched a surprise attack on
Ipil Town in Mindanao, killing at least 60 people and destroying
50 million pesos' (1.9 million U.S. dollars) worth of property.
</P>
<P>
The MILF opposes the peace agreement signed by the government
and the Moro National Liberation Front. As a result, the
government is preparing for separate peace talks with the current
largest rebel group in the country.

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Efforts to Resume Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The top priority in the Middle
East peace process is to overcome the present stalemate, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini was quoted as saying by the local
press today.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy will support all forces that can help put an
end to the regional conflicts in the Middle East and push forward
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Whether the peace process can be put back on track depends, to
some extent, on Israel, said the foreign minister, who will start
a visit to Israel Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The stance of the Israeli government on the peace process is
not consistent, or at least, not fully explained, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to withdraw its decisions based on provocations,
such as the decision to open a tunnel along Jerusalem's Al Aqsa
Mosque compound, the third holiest site of Islam after Mecca and
Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed the tunnel in late September, causing
indignation and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"If they (the Israeli government) push forward the peace
process, Europe will support them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But they are doing the opposite ... the issue of dividing
residential areas, of the tunnel ... all these actions of
provocation are intended to drive the Palestinians out of
Jerusalem, to show that it is a city of Israelis," he said.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Members of Philippines' Opposition Party Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The exodus from the Philippines'
biggest opposition party, the Laban ng Demokratikong Filipino
(Laban), continued on Sunday as more than 10,000 members resigned
en masse in sympathy to ousted senate president Neptali Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that the massive defection
happened in Mandaluyong city in metro Manila. It was led by
Mandaluyong Mayor Benjamin Abalos with his 12 councilors.
</P>
<P>
Abalos said they decided to bolt the party because Laban leader
Edgardo Angara betrayed the party's interests by supporting a coup
on October 10 that installed Senator Ernesto Maceda of the
Nationalist People's Coalition as new senate president.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution, Laban leaders in Mandaluyong city denounced
Angara for engineering the plot to oust Gonzales from the senate
presidency.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn in the strongest possible terms the betrayal of the
Laban by its chairman, Senator Angara, when he, in the display of
highhandedness and arbitrariness prejudicial to the party's
interests, engineered the replacement of a Laban senate president
with a non-Laban one," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
However, Angara and his supporters responded by saying that
with more "unreal" members leaving the party, the Laban has a
chance to define itself clearly and make itself clean.

<HEADLINE> People in Tibet Learn Sense of Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Creating a "sense" of market
among Tibetan traders is the primary task of a two-week Chinese
Export Commodity Fair, the "China Daily" quoted officials from the
Tibet Autonomous Region as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Export Commodity Fair will provide a good opportunity to
learn modern business techniques, renew ideas and gather current
commercial information," said Zhang Wenyuan, vice-director of the
department of trade and economic co-operation, who lead the
delegation to the autumn fair.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 participants representing six corporations in Tibet
attendeds the semi-annual commodity fair which opened on
Tuesday. Products include Tibetan carpets, wool fabrics, cashmere,
Chinese caterpillar fungi (Cordyceps sinensis), leather and native
handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other provinces and cities, Tibet will put more emphasis
on updating and exchanging ideas than on signing trade contracts
during the trade fair. Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate the 23 import and export companies in Tibet
have yielded a business volume of 700 million US dollars during
the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), five times that of the
Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-1990). Altogether 19 foreign-funded
enterprises have been established in the autonomous region in
sectors such as beer, leather and carpet.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we will continue to strengthen our presence at the
fair and to improve our people's business sense," said Zhang who
regards professional skills as the key factor for Tibet's economic
future.
</P>
<P>
The mineral and tourist resources ensure Tibet a promising
economic future, but the current lack of professional staff has
become an obstacle to its prosperity, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,323 people who deal with foreign trade in Tibet,
college graduates account for only 30 percent. Many of them have
never been in business before.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said a blueprint has been draw by the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation to offer training to people
working in Tibet's trade sector.

<HEADLINE> Preparation for Trans-Asia Continental Bridge Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to build the
missing link in a trans-Asia railway that will stretch from Russia
to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are now underway for the construction of the major
railway line that will connect Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand,
Laos, China, Mongolia and Russia, said official sources in the
southwest China city of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
As railroads have already been built in most parts of
countries involved, experts say the trans-Asia continental bridge
can open to rail traffic once a railway line in southwest China's
Yunnan Province has been built to connect with railroads in Laos
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A railway line has been built in Chuxiong City, Yunnan
Province, more than 100 kilometers west of Kunming, the provincial
capital, and a railroad has been extended north of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
To push ahead with the Asian continental bridge project, the
Asian Development Bank, and the Southeast Asian countries
involved, are busy making preparations for the construction of a
major railway line. It will extend from Chuxiong in China's Yunnan
Province to Bangkok, the so-called Sino-Thai Railway line.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the proposal to build the
Sino-Thai railway line was put forward by representatives of
China's Yunnan Province in 1992 during the first Lancang --
Mekong river regional conference in Manila. The idea received an
immediate positive response from participating countries.
</P>
<P>
Later, the construction of the railway line was listed as a
priority communications project in the region by the Asian
Development Bank, and was later studied by participants at
ministerial level conferences in the region.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 Yunnan Railway Corporation sponsored a major survey on
the construction, and compiled a proposal for the building of the
Sino-Thai railway line. At the invitation of the Thai and Lao
governments, related departments in Yunnan Province and China's
Ministry of Railways conducted surveys of the overseas sections of
the 2,219-kilometer railway line, and reached a census after
exchanging views on the general design.
</P>
<P>
After the construction has been completed, experts say, it
will benefit Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Korea, besides China,
Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Mongolia and Russia. The
railway can connect all those countries with the rest of Asia and
Europe via the Euro-Asia Continental Bridge. It will also connect
China with the southeast and southern Asian countries, and help
promote the development of the rich resources in the
Lancang-Mekong river, experts say.

BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 officials from the
All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) and its subordinate units will
begin postgraduate study in applied sociology early next month
under the guidance of professors from Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Already equipped with diplomas from universities and colleges,
the officials began preparatory courses over the past three
weekends, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qizao, in her 60s, vice-chairperson of the ACWF, is also
attending the courses.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that modern society requires officials engaged in
the women's cause to improve themselves as social workers because
social work is becoming more like ongoing learning.
</P>
<P>
Only with modern advanced scientific theories can officials
make great progress in their research on women and help women
achieve full liberation, according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
The students are at ranks higher than section chief and are
about 40 years of age. Their study time includes Friday evening
and daytime on Saturday, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The courses have included domestic and foreign sociological
theories in addition to social investigation methods, statistics
and psychology.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 students plan to earn a master's degree upon
completion of the program courses, which are mainly designed to
enhance their knowledge and improve their skills.

<HEADLINE> Swede Sailing Solo Around the World in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A Swede aiming to sail around
the world solo in a small sailboat has been forced to call South
African rescue officials for help after suffering an arm injury
and a broken mast, according to a press report from Gothenburg on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Roger Andersson had hoped to break the world record by carrying
out the voyage in a sailboat measuring just 8.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
He left England last summer, sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
to waters off Brazil, and headed for the Cape of Good Hope which
he recently passed. The mast broke some 550-600 nautical miles
southeast of Durban.
</P>
<P>
Swedish sea rescue officials have acted as middlemen between a
Swedish radio amateur that Andersson has been in contact with and
the South African sea rescue.
</P>
<P>
"He has a hard time moving his right arm and has decided to ask
for help. He can't continue sailing," Swedish sea rescue leader
Haakan Svaerd said.
</P>
<P>
"The boat is so far from land, over 1,000 kilometers, that a
helicopter can't go out and get him. The South Africans are
therefore trying to make contact with any ships in the area,"
Svaerd said.
</P>
<P>
According to South African sea rescue officials, the weather
conditions in the area are mild, Svaerd said.

<P>
BERLIN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany topped Europe in patent
applications received by the European Patent Office (EPO) in 1995,
the newspaper Berliner Morgenpost (Berlin Morning Post) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Germany sent as many as 11,789
patent applications to the EPO, far ahead of its immediate
follower France (4,667 applications).
</P>
<P>
The next four countries are Britain (3,212 applications), the
Netherlands (2,293 applications), Switzerland (2,084 applications)
and Italy (2,071 applications).
</P>
<P>
Countries outside Europe such as the United States and Japan
also sent applications to the office. They sent 17,579 and 10,190
applications respectively.
</P>
<P>
The EPO, with its head office in Germany's Munich, was set up
on October 5, 1973. It took over the functions of the
International Patent Institute in January of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Its aims are to develop and maintain the European patent
system, providing proprietors with a single European patent with
the same effect as a portfolio of national patents, thus allowing
new technology to enjoy the protection of reliable patents,
stimulating expansion, encouraging cooperation between
undertakings and forming the basis of licensing agreements.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Briton Paul Evans clocked
two hours, eight minutes and 52 seconds to win the 19th Chicago
Marathon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His winning time posted the fastest Chicago clocking in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
In the women's section, Marian Sutton, also a Briton, kicked
hard in the final stage to win the title with a career-best
time of 2:30:41.
</P>
<P>
Evans and Sutton each won $40,000 plus time bonus money.
</P>
<P>
"I've always said to myself I could run a 2:08, and now I've
done it," said Evans, who also set a personal best time.
</P>
<P>
Evans broke from the field at the 18-mile mark and finished
comfortably ahead of American Jerry Lawson, who clocked
2:10:03. Russian Leonid Shvetsov was third and defending champion
Eamonn Martin of Britain finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Ritva Lemettinen, bidding to become Chicago's first
three-time winner, was never a threat to Sutton. She struggled
home ninth and was 13 minutes slower than her winning time of a
year ago. She also triumphed here in 1993.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Black Gold City Boosts Economy In Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hohhot, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Wuhai, located in the
southwestern part of China's Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region,
has made remarkable economic progress by taking advantage of its
abundant resources.
</P>
<P>
Known as "the Sea of Black Gold", the city abounds in natural
coal reserves, which have been proved at 4.4 billion tons,
virtually all of it coking coal which accounts for 82 percent of
the total in Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
To develop its coal-based power generating industry, the city
has set up a large power plant, and a 1.5 million-ton a year coke
chemical plant is being built in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city is also rich in other kinds of mineral resources,
including dense reserves of iron ore, Kaolin earth and limestone,
which are easy for mining.
</P>
<P>
The mineral resources have provided Wuhai with perfect
conditions for developing its energy, building materials and
chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
Wuhai, located on the Yellow River and with sufficient
sunshine, is in a good position to develop high-quality and
high-efficiency agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Grapes are a local speciality, known for a high sugar content,
unpolluted and seldom affected by plant diseases and pests because
of the unique local environment. By the end of this century, Wuhai
is expected to become a major grape producer in the autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
In recent few years Wuhai has began to develop its rich tourism
resources, mainly natural scenic sites, including the Yellow
River, mountains and grasslands. A large number of newly-found
petroglyphs have attracted many domestic and overseas tourists and
experts.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, when Wuhai was ratified by the State Council as an
experimental economic reform zone, the city has entered a new
stage of development and is now a key industrial base in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the city achieved a general domestic product of over
1.8 billion yuan, an average of 5,510 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the city government issued a series of preferential
policies to attract more domestic and foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> US Corporations Step Up Job Creation, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. corporations added jobs
at a quicker pace this past year, more than offsetting positions
cut in business makeovers, according to an annual survey released
today by the American Management Association (AMA).
</P>
<P>
The report said 68 percent of the 1,441 large and medium-sized
U.S. companies recently surveyed created jobs during the 12 months
ending June 30, up from 58 percent in the year-earlier survey.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 49 percent of the companies said they cut
jobs in the year, compared with 50 percent in the survey conducted
a year eralier.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the average work force among the responding companies
grew by 6 percent, compared with a gain of 4.5 percent in the
previous survey.
</P>
<P>
Salaried workers in general, and middle managers in particular,
continue to bear the brunt of corporate reductions, the survey
said. Middle managers represent 5 percent to 8 percent of the work
force, but typically sustain 15 percent to 20 percent of job
losses.
</P>
<P>
By region, the Southwest and West suffered the biggest hit in
jobs, with 56 percent of the firms there reporting cuts.
Fifty-three percent of companies in the mid-Atlantic region shed
jobs as did 47 percent in New England, 46 percent in the South and
45 percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The AMA's 9,500 member companies employ about a quarter of the
work force in the U.S. The group trains managers through seminars,
books, periodicals and other materials.
</P>
<P>
"Downsizing is no longer the dominant theme of change in the
U.S. work force," said Eric Rolfe Greenberg, director of
management studies for the AMA in its annual survey.
