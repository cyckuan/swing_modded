	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ In what would be a crucial victory
ahead of the 2000 presidential elections, the opposition National
Action Party captured the governor's seat in the central state of
Aguascalientes, according to television exit polls.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, however, said its
own polls showed it was hanging on to Aguascalientes by 4
percentage points.
	   The polls by Televisa and Television Azteca also showed the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, as expected, holding
onto governorships in the gulf coast state of Veracruz and the
southeastern state of Oaxaca.
	   Official preliminary results were to be released later.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the governing party, known as
the PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to compensate for the loss.
	   According to Televisa's poll, PAN candidate Felipe Gonzalez
Gonzalez captured 50 percent of the vote. The PRI's candidate,
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, had 41 percent and Alfonso Bernal
Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party had 6
percent. It did not give the margin of error in its poll.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes as the small, relatively prosperous state has become
more urban and middle class in recent years.
	   Martin Diaz de la Vega, 32, a street salesman, said he voted for
the PAN for the first time because he believes the PRI is corrupt.
	   ``We need a change. Even if it's bad, I don't think it can be
any worse,'' he said.
	   Turnout figures among Aguascalientes' 500,000 registered voters
were not immediately available, but the state electoral council
reported earlier in the day that turnout was strong and there were
no major problems.
	   In Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy businessman and the son of
a former president, said his victory was assured Sunday night after
the Televisa poll showed him winning with 52 percent of the vote.
	   Aleman promised to create ``a social alliance'' as Vercruz's new
governor during a local television interview broadcast live into
State Electoral Council headquarters as perplexed electoral
officials looked on.
	   By the time Aleman had declared his victory, the first official
numbers had not even be released.
	   Shortly after, electoral officials released the first official
numbers: with 200 of 7,046 of the polling places counted, the PRI
candidate was ahead with 53 percent, followed by Luis Pazos of
National Action with 28 percent. The Democratic Revolution
candidate trailed with 14 percent.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   If the final results reflect the showing of the exit poll, the
win could make Aleman a top contender for the PRI's presidential
nomination.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But its won two of three elections last
month, including the defeat of the PAN in Chihuahua.
	   In Oaxaca, a tighter-than-expected race _ and a possible
electoral dispute _ was shaping up.
	   The first official results, issued by Oaxaca's State Electoral
Council, showed PRI candidate Jose Nelson Murat Casab was ahead,
but with Democratic Revolution candidate Hector Sanchez trailing by
6 percentage points.
	   With the votes from 8.37 percent of polling places counted,
Murat Casab was leading with 42.77 percent of the vote, followed by
Sanchez with 36.81 percent. The National Action candidate had 17.98
percent.
	   Both the PRI and Democratic Revolution insisted that their own
polls showed each of them ahead.
	   An exit poll conducted by the Arturo Rosenbluth Foundation said
its survey showed Democratic Revolution winning the Oaxaca
governorship with 38.1 percent of the vote, followed by the PRI
with 36.9 percent and National Action with 17.8 percent.
	   The foundation said in a written statement that the exit poll
was conducted at 137 of 3,685 polling places in Oaxaca and that it
had a margin of error of 0.064 percent.
	   Representatives of several political parties complained to
electoral authorities that foundation workers conducting the survey
had entered polling booths and in some cases appeared to be trying
to influence the way people voted.
	   Foundation spokesman Daniel Ponce denied the accusations.

Vancouver police close Sikh temple because of factional feud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Police have closed one of
Canada's largest Sikh temples, fearing a clash between moderate and
fundamentalist factions.
	   Police Chief Bruce Chambers said officers acted Sunday after
failing to mediate a solution in the long-running religious dispute
at the Ross Street temple.
	   ``It was very tense for a while,'' said a police spokesman, Sgt.
Gord Elias. ``We had the two opposing sides on different sides of
the street, yelling back and forth.''
	   The streets around the temple were reopened Sunday afternoon
after the crowd of about 1,000 dispersed, but Elias said the temple
building would remain closed indefinitely.
	   The dispute revolves around an edict from the religion's ruling
body in India to remove tables and chairs, which fundamentalists
consider to be improper additions to a temple.
	   Leaders of several Sikh temples across the province of British
Columbia have refused to remove tables and chairs from temple
dining halls, despite the order from high priest Ranjit Singh.
	   Six high-ranking Canadian Sikh leaders _ including the priest,
president and secretary of the Ross Street temple _ were
excommunicated last week for failing to appear before Singh in
India to defend their decisions.
	   The excommunicated leaders have vowed to continue at the temple.
	   Two people were arrested last Sunday at the temple after a
scuffle broke out when fundamentalists tried to remove the tables
and chairs.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Three people were killed and two others
were seriously injured when a Vietnam War-era artillery shell
exploded in the central province of Ha Tinh, local police said
Monday.
	   The incident took place last Tuesday when the villagers tried to
set off the detonator so they could get to the explosives and sell
the shell for scrap iron, police said.
	   Casualties are reported virtually every week in southern and
central Vietnam, where many villagers risk their lives to collect
scrap iron from ordnance left over from the Vietnam War.

Thai consumer prices up 10 percent, wholesale up 19.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai consumer prices rose 10 percent
year-on-year for the month of July, while wholesale prices jumped
19.5 percent, the Commerce Ministry said Monday.
	   The consumer price index rose to 128.9, up 0.1 percent from
June. In June, the index was up 10.7 percent year-on-year, the
biggest increase in a decade, while the wholesale price index shot
up 20.7 percent.
	   Noting the slight slowing of inflation from June to July,
Withoon Tunnanond, deputy director general of the ministry's
Business Economics Department, said he expected the downward trend
to continue in August.
	   The float of the Thai baht on July 2, 1997, and its subsequent
depreciation by more than 36 percent has doubled the inflation rate
from levels seen in the first half of 1997.
	   Analysts said monthly year-on-year figures should begin to
decline as the comparisons will be to the months after the float of
the baht, when prices had already begun to rise.
	   Food and drink prices declined 0.1 percent from June. The
year-on-year increase in July was 11.8 percent. Food prices account
for 35.28 percent of the consumer index.
	   Rice and starch products accounted for the biggest jump in the
category, rising 27.0 percent year-on-year, but declining 0.7
percent month-on-month.
	   Non-food prices rose 9.0 percent year-on-year in July, and 0.2
percent from June. Tobacco and alcoholic beverages accounted for
the biggest increase in the category, rising 26.6 percent
year-on-year.
	   Prices of agricultural and food products in the wholesale index
also started to drop, Withoon said. The category rose 22.8 percent
year-on-year, but fell 0.2 percent from June.
	   In the manufacturing sector, wholesale prices were up 17.4
percent year-on-year in July, and recorded a 0.2 percent increase
from June.

Thai council wants doctors to renew licenses every three years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Stung by a spate of high-profile
malpractice cases, the Thai Medical Council is considering
requiring doctors to renew their licenses every three years, a
council official said Monday.
	   ``This idea is to assure quality of doctors. We want people to
be confident in our medical standard,'' said Dr. Chumsak
Pruksapong, deputy secretary-general of the Medical Council.
	   If the plan is approved, new doctors will have to renew their
licences every three years. To qualify for renewal, they will have
to take at least 50 hours of additional classes, Dr. Chumsak said.
	   Currently, Thai doctors are granted a lifetime license upon
graduation from medical school.
	   The plan, first raised three years ago, has gained new impetus
because of several recent complaints by people who say they or
their relatives were mistreated by hospitals.
	   They include the case of a retired Swiss banker who was
paralyzed after being injected with a dye for an x-ray examination
at a Bangkok hospital.
	   The victim, Earnst Wynistorf, complained to the council and
Parliament's Human Rights Committee, but did not file a malpractice
suit because he says the laws completely favor the doctors.
	   The hospital, Samitivej in Bangkok, has refused his demand that
it pay for his transport to and treatment in a European hospital,
instead offering its own free treatment.
	   Wynistorf, however, says he fears Samitivej's doctors.

Thai government will unveil plan to fix banking sector Aug. 15
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government will announce a
comprehensive package to fix the country's battered banking system
on August 15, a senior government official said Monday.
	   Kobsak Chutikul, director-general of the Department of
Information of the Foreign Ministry, said Monday that the Finance
Ministry and the Thai central bank would announce the plan to solve
problems at local banks and finance companies.
	   August 15 also marks the first anniversary of Thailand's
acceptance of the dlrs 17.2 billion rescue package from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Since Thailand's financial crisis erupted July 1997, the
government has shut down 56 insolvent finance companies and has
taken over seven weak ones. It has also taken over four banks,
writing down their capital to almost zero before appropriating
them.
	   The Bank of Thailand said earlier this year that it may take
action against banks that fail to complete a first round of
mandated capital increases by August 15.
	   Thai banks have been ordered to increase their capital funds
because their reserves dwindled when the country's currency, the
baht, was floated last July and subsequently lost more than 30
percent of its value.
	   The banking sector index plunged by 3.2 percent when the Thai
stock market opened Monday on expectations that Thai financial
authorities may take further action against weak banks.

Experts wonder if Japan is prepared for 2000 computer glitches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY110 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHISAKI WATANABE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ While much of the industrialized world frets over
the ``millennium bug'' and warns of computers gone berserk come the
year 2000, Japan is an island of tranquility.
	   Government officials and business executives insist programs for
handling the software glitch are quietly under way.
	   Too quietly, critics say.
	   ``There is no sense of crisis,'' said Takafumi Hamaguchi, chief
researcher at Tokio Marine Risk Consulting Co. ``I am pessimistic.
I think people will just begin to realize it's too late when the
day comes.''
	   The bug is nothing to shrug at: To economize, early software
engineers expressed years with just the final two digits. So when
1999 passes the scene, unfixed computers and embedded circuits in
machines won't know if it's 2000 or 1900, and they could garble
date-sensitive data or even shut down.
	   A vulnerable Japan could become a major global headache. The
country is one of the most computerized and is home to the
second-largest economy, so a computer crisis here could have
painful repercussions elsewhere.
	   Still, the millennium bug doesn't seem to have set off any
alarms in Japan.
	   A key industry with important links to the rest of the world _
banking _ is confident that everything is on track, with millennium
fix projects due to be completed by year's end and ready for test
runs by the Bank of Japan starting in December.
	   ``Preparations have been going well and on schedule,'' said
Katsumi Tsuiji, spokesman for the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. He and
others said millions of dollars have been spent getting ready for
the switch.
	   Some in the industry say they got a head-start when Emperor
Hirohito died in 1989, forcing major banks to overhaul their
computer systems to accommodate the change in the Japanese
calendar, which is based on the years of an emperor's reign.
	   Others point out, however, that international banking
transactions are not carried out on the Japanese imperial calendar.
	   Bankers are not the only ones who think they have the millennium
bug beat.
	   Tokyo Electric Power, Japan's largest private electricity
company, said it doesn't foresee any major disruption in 2000. Its
software repair project, begun in 1996, is expected to be in place
by the end of this year.
	   Kazuyoshi Takahashi, a company spokesman, said the computer
change is no big deal because unlike natural disasters that strike
without warning, the date for the needed fix is known, making it
easier to tackle.
	   ``It is unrealistic to think that your electricity will be cut
off'' because of the 2000 problem, Takahashi said.
	   Still, not everyone is convinced Japan recognizes how serious
the millennium bug can be.
	   According to a report by Merrill Lynch Japan, individual
Japanese banks' allocations for repair efforts range between dlrs
29 million and dlrs 71 million _ much less than the American banks
Citicorp and BankAmerica are spending, dlrs 600 million and dlrs
380 million, respectively.
	   The bureaucracy also might not be moving as quickly as it
should. A government report released in April found that of 395
essential computer systems used by public agencies, 141 _ or 36
percent _ won't complete the modification and test runs until
sometime in 1999, perilously close to the deadline. The laggards
include systems used for air traffic control and immigration.
	   Businesses might not be doing much better.
	   Hamaguchi of Tokio Marine said top corporate managers are often
unaware how imminent the problem is and tend to treat the
millennium bug merely as the responsibility of a company's
information system section.
	   ``I don't think companies are doing enough about the problem,''
he said. ``But they won't say so because they are not obligated to
disclose information.''
	   In fact, only the financial industry is required to disclose
2000 switch-over plans. The newly launched Financial Supervisory
Agency will review banks' projects and order those found behind
schedule to submit progress reports.
	   Part of the problem is economic. With Japan in its worst
recession since World War II and bankruptcies claiming more
companies all the time, spending money to deal with an abstract
computer problem more than a year down the road is not very
attractive.
	   ``For small and mid-sized companies in Japan, there is a more
imminent issue: whether they can survive into the next century,''
said Mahendra Negi, a senior analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``They are
having a hard time finding money just to run their companies.''

Macau police report largest seizure of pirated CDs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police in Macau have made their largest seizure
of pirated compact discs, discovering about 430,000 hidden in a
truck at the border between the Portuguese territory and the
Chinese mainland, news reports said Monday.
	   The Portuguese news agency LUSA, in a report from Macau, quoted
marine and customs police as estimating that the discs had a value
of about 5 million patacas (dlrs 645,000). It said they were found
in 400 boxes hidden under used iron plates.
	   They were seized on the border with the adjacent Zhuhai special
economic zone in China.
	   Macau and Hong Kong are regarded as important shipment and
production centers for pirated discs.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is due to
return to Chinese sovereignty on Dec. 20, 1999, after more than 400
years of Portuguese rule.

Report: Japan's prime minister wants to visit Russia in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's new prime minister wants to visit Russia as
early as November to discuss a territorial dispute that has blocked
the two countries from signing a formal peace treaty to end World
War II, a news report said Monday.
	   ``I would definitely like to use such a chance to have (the
territory) returned as soon as possible,'' Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency.
	   The dispute centers on three small islands and one group of
islets at the end of the Kuril chain off the northern coast of the
Japanese island of Hokkaido.
	   The Soviet army occupied the islands in the closing days of
World War II. Japan has refused to sign a peace treaty until the
islands are returned.
	   Obuchi's predecessor, former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
had planned to visit Russia this fall to hold talks toward signing
a treaty. But he was forced to resign in July after his party
suffered an embarrassing election defeat.
	   Obuchi, who served as Hashimoto's foreign affairs minister, had
met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin to prepare the way for
Hashimoto's visit.
	   While campaigning to replace him, Obuchi promised to continue
progress being made between the two sides in resolving the dispute.
	   Obuchi's own choice of foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, worked
with Obuchi in negotiating with Moscow and is widely seen as
knowledgeable about Russian affairs.
	   Obuchi would be only the third Japanese premier ever to visit
Russia.

Millions of Vietnamese farmers lack toilets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ About 12 million Vietnamese farmers have
no toilets and another 30 million lack proper sanitation
facilities, a Health Ministry official said Monday.
	   A survey conducted by the ministry's Preventive Medicine
Department showed that only 10 million rural residents have proper
toilets, the official said. About 80 percent of Vietnam's 78
million people live in the countryside.
	   The official said the common practice of defecating directly
into ponds to feed fish in rural areas, especially in the southern
Mekong Delta, has resulted in outbreaks of diarrhea, dysentery and
typhoid. Many farmers also use human feces as fertilizer.
	   Statistics showed that Vietnam had nearly 20,000 cases of
typhoid last year, along with more than 90,000 dysentery cases and
974,000 cases of diarrhea.
	   Last year, the government launched a clean-water campaign for
the Mekong Delta, urging people to build more septic systems.
	   The official, however, said it would be difficult to convince
farmers to change generations-old habits. A septic system costs
only about dlrs 50, but that's a huge amount for a country where
the average annual wage is under dlrs 300.
	   A pilot program run by the ministry in the Mekong Delta province
of Can Tho has achieved some good results so far in convincing
farmers to build septic systems, the official said. The ministry
hopes to expand the program to other provinces soon.

Mazar-e-Sharif tense as Taliban army nears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan was reportedly tense Monday, a day after Taliban
fighters captured a nearby town and claimed to be closing in on
their enemies' stronghold from two directions.
	   Azizullah Shasaq, a spokesman for the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia
that controls Mazar-e-Sharif, confirmed his ally warlord Rashid
Dostum had lost Shebergan, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of
Mazar-e-Sharif. Taliban sources said they captured many of Dostum's
fighters, but had no firm figures or casualty reports. They said
Taliban forces were advancing on Mazar-e-Sharif from the west.
	   Taliban radio reported Sunday that fighters also had broken
through enemy defense lines at Ahrytan, about 65 kilometers (40
miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Red Cross spokesman Michel Schaffner, speaking by telephone from
Peshawar, on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, said about 10 aid
workers in Mazar-e-Sharif had asked the Red Cross to evacuate them.
Schaffner said Monday the Red Cross would have to ``assess the
security situation'' before flying in.
	   Seven expatriate Red Cross workers flew out of Mazar-e-Sharif to
the Afghan capital of Kabul Sunday, leaving behind a handful of
Afghan staff, Schaffner said. Their departure was routine, he said.
The Red Cross has been overseeing projects in Mazar-e-Sharif from
Kabul because the security in the northern town has long been
considered unpredictable.
	   Taliban fighters briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif last May but
retreated after street battles, mostly with Hezb-e-Wahadat
fighters, that left several hundred Taliban fighters dead. It is
believed that as many as 2,000 Taliban soldiers who were taken
prisoner in that fighting were later massacred.
	   Taliban fighters, who control about 85 percent of Afghanistan,
seem on the verge of taking the rest of the country. Victories in
recent days could give them the momentum to capture the remaining
major opposition strongholds.
	   The Taliban has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory it controls. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban
officials have barred girls from school, confined most women to
their homes, forbade all music except religious songs and banned
anything published outside Afghanistan.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.

	   ``What we want for Aguascalientes is a transition that does not
hold back its progress, that does not cause a scandal,'' Felipe
Gonzalez Gonzalez of National Action told a news conference after
the nation's media declared him the winner.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the governing party, known as
the PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to compensate for the loss.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes as the small, relatively prosperous state has become
more urban and middle class in recent years.
	   Martin Diaz de la Vega, 32, a street salesman, said he voted for
the PAN for the first time because he believes the PRI is corrupt.
	   ``We need a change. Even if it's bad, I don't think it can be
any worse,'' he said.
	   Turnout figures among Aguascalientes' 500,000 registered voters
were not immediately available, but the state electoral council
reported earlier in the day that turnout was strong and there were
no major problems.
	   In Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy businessman and the son of
a former president, said his victory was assured Sunday night after
the Televisa poll showed him winning with 52 percent of the vote.
	   Aleman promised to create ``a social alliance'' as Veracruz's
new governor during a local television interview broadcast live
into State Electoral Council headquarters as perplexed electoral
officials looked on.
	   By the time Aleman had declared his victory, the first official
numbers had not even be released.
	   Shortly after, electoral officials released the first official
numbers: with 200 of 7,046 polling places counted, the PRI
candidate was ahead with 53 percent, followed by Luis Pazos of
National Action with 28 percent. The Democratic Revolution
candidate trailed with 14 percent.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   If the final results reflect the showing of the exit poll, the
win could make Aleman a top contender for the PRI's presidential
nomination.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But it won two of three elections last
month, including the defeat of the PAN in Chihuahua.
	   In Oaxaca, a tighter-than-expected race _ and a possible
electoral dispute _ was shaping up.
	   The first official results, issued by Oaxaca's State Electoral
Council, showed PRI candidate Jose Nelson Murat Casab was ahead,
but with Democratic Revolution candidate Hector Sanchez trailing by
just 6 percentage points.
	   With the votes from 8 percent of the polling places counted,
Murat Casab was leading with 42.7 percent of the vote, followed by
Sanchez with 36.8 percent. The National Action candidate had 17.98
percent.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will provide U.S. dlrs
610,000 in extra funding to Papua New Guinea following last month's
tsunami disaster, Prime Minister John Howard said Monday.
	   Howard and his Papua New Guinean counterpart, Bill Skate, held
talks Monday during Skate's official visit. Skate said the official
death toll in the July 17 tsunami was 2,134, with 9,483 people
homeless and 628 in hospital.
	   Howard said Australia would provide money to build two or three
schools, rebuild roads and to construct facilities for the many
disabled people who had lost limbs in the disaster.
	   It would also help to develop new agricultural and fishing
industries as well earthquake monitoring to try to prevent a repeat
of the disaster.

Police thwart Tamil rebel plan to attack Colombo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan police arrested 50
suspected Tamil rebels in citywide raids last week, claiming to
have thwarted a plan for terrorist attacks on the capital, a
state-run newspaper reported Monday.
	   The arrests were made last Monday, two days before the opening
of a seven-nation regional summit, said the Daily News.
	   Colombo police confirmed the arrests, but declined to give
details.
	   Following the interrogation of four Tamil rebel suspects,
arrested earlier, police picked up 50 suspects in raids on boarding
houses, construction sites, restaurants and jewelry shops, the
Daily News said.
	   It said the network had planned a series of bomb attacks and
assassinations.
	   The paper said police discovered a new strategy of the main
Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, of sending
infiltrators posing as construction workers and gold artisans. The
gold business is dominated by Tamils in Colombo.
	   The Tigers have struck in Colombo several times in the past with
car bombs and suicide squads, and have assassinated a president and
several other leading politicians.
	   Militants among Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils are fighting for
an independent Tamil homeland saying they are discriminated against
in Sri Lanka, a country of 18.5 million people off India's southern
coast. More than 54,000 people have died in the insurrection that
began in 1983.

trailed with 14 percent.
	   Aleman declared victory even before the early results were
announced and promised to create ``a social alliance'' as
Veracruz's new governor during a local television interview
broadcast live into State Electoral Council headquarters. Perplexed
electoral officials looked on.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   As governor of one of Mexico's most important states, Aleman
will automatically become a top contender for the PRI's
presidential nomination for 2000.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at cleaning up the vote and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But it won two of three elections last
month, including the defeat of the PAN in Chihuahua.
	   In Oaxaca, a tighter-than-expected race _ and a possible
electoral dispute _ was shaping up.
	   The first official results, issued by Oaxaca's State Electoral
Council, showed PRI candidate Jose Nelson Murat Casab was ahead,
but with Democratic Revolution candidate Hector Sanchez trailing by
just 6 percentage points.
	   With the votes from 8 percent of the polling places counted,
Murat Casab was leading with 42.7 percent of the vote, followed by
Sanchez with 36.8 percent. The National Action candidate had 17.98
percent.

	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Jack Cassell remembers when the
Cubans he ran with along the beach suddenly started toting
submachine guns _ the year before President Reagan sent U.S. troops
to invade Grenada.
	   ``It was very scary to be an American in Grenada then,'' said
Cassell, 44, now a neurologist living near Orlando in Eustis,
Florida.
	   He was back in Grenada, on vacation with his wife and son, when
Fidel Castro arrived Sunday on his first visit to the island where
Cuban and U.S. troops had their only confrontation during the Cold
War.
	   Forty-five Grenadians, 29 armed Cuban construction workers and
18 Americans were killed in three days of fighting around Point
Salines Airport, where Castro landed 15 years later.
	   Ending a triumphant tour that began in Jamaica and Barbados _
other islands that once shunned him _ Castro said he wanted to
avoid recriminations.
	   ``On a day like this I would rather pay my respects to all who
perished in that conflict,'' he said after unveiling a plaque
commemorating Cuba's help in building the airport which U.S.
strategists feared would give Cuban fighter planes the range to
penetrate deep into South America.
	   After the invasion, U.S. troops completed the airport. When
Reagan visited Grenada in 1986, he, too, received a hero's welcome,
and he prayed at a sculpture outside the airport honoring the U.S.
dead.
	   Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, a former foe of
Castro's, hugged the Cuban leader Sunday and said his country's
show of gratitude was ``better late than never.''
	   On his tour, the Cuban leader has attacked what he termed a
``new economic oppression'' affecting Caribbean nations.
	   He says 100,000 jobs were lost, mainly from garment factories
that moved to Mexico because it is part of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, and that small-island economies are endangered by
a successful U.S. challenge at the World Trade Organization to the
preferential tariffs Caribbean bananas receive in Europe.
	   Cassell was a student at the St. George's University School of
Medicine when Maurice Bishop assumed power and until his graduation
in 1982. He said tension was building even a year before the 1983
invasion.
	   ``People who were selling us black coral one day were waving
AK-47s in our faces the next day. My nice (Cuban) friends who used
to be running on the beach by the airport construction were
suddenly toting AKs.''
	   Cassell said he thought Grenada's failed revolution was
necessary to get rid of the corrupt government of Eric Gairy, who
died several years ago. But he said Bishop installed an overtly
hostile government.

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ In a crucial victory ahead of the
2000 presidential balloting, partial election results showed the
opposition National Action Party on Sunday capturing the governor's
seat in the central state of Aguascalientes.
	   With 40 percent of the vote counted early Monday, Felipe
Gonzalez Gonzalez of National Action was ahead with 53.12 percent
of the vote, the Aguascalientes State Electoral Council said.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's candidate, Hugo
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, trailed with 36.97. Alfonso Bernal
Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party had 6
percent.
	   ``What we want for Aguascalientes is a transition that does not
hold back its progress, that does not cause a scandal,'' Gonzalez
Gonzalez told a news conference after the nation's media declared
him the winner.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the governing party, known as
the PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to compensate for the loss.
	   The business-oriented National Action has gained strength in
Aguascalientes as the small, relatively prosperous state has become
more urban and middle class in recent years.
	   Martin Diaz de la Vega, 32, a street salesman, said he voted for
the PAN for the first time because he believes the PRI is corrupt.
	   ``We need a change. Even if it's bad, I don't think it can be
any worse,'' he said.
	   Final results for Aguascalientes' 500,000 registered voters were
not expected until sometime Monday, but the state electoral council
reported that turnout was strong and there were no major problems.
	   In Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy businessman and the son of
a former president, appeared to have won the governorship in that
Gulf state.
	   With 36 percent of the vote counted, Aleman, of the PRI, was
leading with 52 percent of the vote. Luis Pazos of National Action
trailed with 28 percent. The Democratic Revolution candidate
trailed with 14 percent.
	   Aleman declared victory even before the early results were
announced and promised to create ``a social alliance'' as
Veracruz's new governor during a local television interview
broadcast live into State Electoral Council headquarters. Perplexed
electoral officials looked on.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   As governor of one of Mexico's most important states, Aleman
will automatically become a top contender for the PRI's
presidential nomination for 2000.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of

month, including the defeat of the PAN in Chihuahua.
	   In Oaxaca, a tighter-than-expected race _ and a possible
electoral dispute _ was shaping up.
	   With 28 percent of the vote counted early Monday, PRI candidate
Jose Nelson Murat Casab widened his lead with 44.88 percent of the
vote. Democratic Revolution candidate Hector Sanchez had 35.79
percent. The National Action candidate had just under 12 percent.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Visiting Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile

nationalized in Romania, Israel Radio reported Monday.
	   Vasile, who arrived Sunday for a four-day visit to Israel said
he would introduce legislation to the Romanian parliament on the

South Korean exports record largest monthly fall in over 13 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Battered by Asia's recession, South
Korean exports suffered their largest monthly contraction in 13 1/2
years in July, the government said Monday.
	   And with imports of raw materials for its factories falling, the
nation recorded a dlrs 3.08 billion trade surplus, compared to a
dlrs 837 million deficit in the same month last year.
	   Exports dropped by 13.7 percent to dlrs 10.2 billion from the
same month last year, the third straight and the largest monthly
contraction since January, 1985.
	   The Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry attributed the
contraction to the recession in Asia, one of South Korea's main
export markets, and the appreciation of Korea's currency, which
made its products more expensive.
	   South Korea hoped a 50 percent depreciation of its currency late
last year would help it boost exports, but that hope was shattered
by the won's recent appreciation and the Japanese yen's weakness.
	   Japan and South Korea compete in key export items such as
automobiles, ships and home appliances, and the weaker yen makes
Japanese products more competitive.
	   Continuing strikes at the nation's major auto and other
manufacturing plants also helped pull down the export figure, the
ministry said.
	   The nation's imports decreased by 43.7 percent to dlrs 7.12
billion, largely due to sharp drops in international oil prices and
in domestic consumption amid the worst financial crisis in years,
it said.
	   The cumulative trade surplus during the first seven months
reached dlrs 23.13 billion, compared to a deficit of dlrs 9.99
billion during the same period last year.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian troops guarding Tajikistan's southern
border killed two suspected drug smugglers and captured four more
men in a shootout, officials said Monday.
	   The gun battle took place Sunday night on the frontier with
Afghanistan, the site of frequent clashes between Russian troops
and drug smugglers, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Russian troops also seized 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of opium
from the men, the report added.
	   The Russian border guards have seized more than 700 kilograms
(1,500 pounds) of drugs this year, the report added.
	   The 25,000 Russian troops in Tajikistan supported the government
during a five-year civil war that formally ended last year. The
troops have remained to guard against smugglers bringing drugs and
weapons from Afghanistan.

Philippine stocks fall sharply, index loses 4 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply
Monday, pulled down by a mixture of negative news, particularly the
falling Japanese yen, traders said.
	   The yen hit a seven-week low of 145 yen to the U.S. dollar in
early trading Monday, although the Philippine peso held steady on
strong dollar inflows.
	   Preliminary figures showed the 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index fell 64.54 points, or 4 percent, to 1,543.07, past
the important support level of 1,600 points. On Friday, the index
fell 5.89 points to 1,607.61.
	   The broader All Shares Index also retreated past the 500-point
support, falling 17 points to 494.05 after Friday's 0.05 point
decline.
	   Losers beat gainers 83 to 11, with 34 issues unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., shopping mall operator
SM Prime Holdings Inc. and Ayala Land Inc., all big capital stocks
that are weighted heavily on the main index, were among the victims
of Monday's across-the-board selldown.
	   ``We're following Wall Street and the yen's lead,'' said Noel
Reyes, vice president of research of Anscor Hagedorn Securities
Inc.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1.6 percent on Friday.
	   Reyes said a technical rally should emerge sometime this week,
although others said the market appeared to be heading for a
further decline.
	   The peso, meanwhile, was marginally higher against the dollar in
morning trading, buoyed by some inflows of foreign funds and slack
demand for the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   The dollar inflows managed to keep the peso stable despite the
Japanese yen's sharp fall against the dollar in early trading.
	   At late morning the dollar averaged 42.063 pesos, down from
Friday's average of 42.080 pesos.

Mother of Arnold Schwarzenegger dies at 76
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRAZ, Austria (AP) _ Aurelia Schwarzenegger, mother of action
star Arnold Schwarzenegger, died Sunday of a heart attack, the
Austrian Press Agency reported. She was 76.
	   Mrs. Schwarzenegger was visiting the grave of her husband in
nearby Weiz when she collapsed, the agency said. She was
transported by helicopter to the hospital in the provincial
hospital in Graz, where she died four days after her 76th birthday.
	   ``With the loss of my mother, my world has fallen apart,'' the
local newspaper, Kleine Zeitung, quoted Schwarzenegger as saying.
	   Mrs. Schwarzenegger had lived quietly in Weiz where her late
husband was a police chief. She was active in local wildlife
preservation programs.

Soldier seriously injured after anti-tank missile goes off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese soldier was seriously injured Monday
when an anti-tank missile mounted on an armored vehicle went off
during a training exercise, the Defense Agency said.
	   Sgt. Second Class Takahide Yoshiaki, 33, had his right arm blown
off by the blast, which occurred at a training base in the city of
Eniwa on Japan's northern main island of Hokkaido, Defense Agency
spokesman Shingo Nishi said.
	   Yoshiaki was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment, where he
remained in critical condition, Nishi said.
	   It was a second such mishap involving Ground Self-Defense Force
personnel in less than a week.
	   Last Thursday, a Japanese army sergeant was killed after a
cartridge case in the gun barrel of a military vehicle exploded at
a training facility in western Japan. That explosion also caused
slight injuries to two other soldiers.
	   In Monday's blast, Yoshiaki was checking the safety of the
firing device on the Type 89 Infantry Fighting Vehicle when the
missile suddenly shot off, the spokesman said.
	   Military officials were investigating the cause of the blast,
Nishi said.
	   Eniwa is 807 kilometers (500 miles), northwest of Tokyo.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The battered stock market nose-dived Monday
because of bad news from abroad and expectations of even tougher
times at home.
	   The key Hang Seng index was down almost 379 points, or 4.8
percent, at midday to 7,557.54. The loss followed drops of 3.89
percent last week and more than 4 percent the previous week.
	   Traders blamed a sharp fall Friday on Wall Street, the weakness
of the Japanese yen resulting from uncertainties about the new
government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, and concerns about the
domestic economy.
	   Giant HSBC Holdings and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank were to
announce their midyear earnings after the market closed Monday, and
their shares fell sharply in anticipation of poor performance. HSBC
accounts for a third of the weight of Hong Kong's benchmark stock
index.
	   Also later Monday, the government was to announce revised
economic growth figures.
	   The government already has revealed preliminary data that the
economy contracted 2 percent in the first quarter of 1998, and has
indicated that it expects a further contraction in the second
quarter.
	   Hong Kong withstood much of Asia's financial turmoil in the
first months after it began last summer, but now has been dragged
down into recession as well. Besides the negative growth,
unemployment is at a 15-year high. The economy is being slowed
further by cargo problems at the new Chek Lap Kok airport.
	   Analysts said final figures may show that gross domestic product
shrank by 3 percent in the first quarter. If it is much worse than
that, they predicted that markets may tumble again on Tuesday.
	   ``Investors are selling on the yen's weakness, and the Dow'
fall,'' said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon Securities.
	   The dollar hit a seven-week high of 145 yen early Monday in
Asia. The Dow fell 143.66 points on Friday.
	   The Hang Seng index is nearing its low for the year, 7,462.5,
which it reached in mid-June.

Hope fades for 10 men buried for 17 days in Austrian mine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Hopes are fading for 10 men buried last
month in an Austrian mine after cameras and microphones lowered
into an emergency shaft failed to detect signs of life in the
chamber where the men were believed to be trapped.
	   Members of the rescue team were to meet Monday in the mining
village of Lassing, 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna,
to decide their next moves.
	   The 10 were sent into a talc mine in Lassing on July 17 to
rescue miner Georg Hainzl, who was buried in a massive landslide
unleashed by torrential rains. But a second, larger landslide
trapped the nine miners and one geologist.
	   Talc is a soft mineral that is refined into talcum powder and
lubricants.
	   Rescue efforts intensified after Hainzl was found alive and in
relatively good condition July 26. He had taken refuge in another
chamber closer to the surface.
	   After weeks of drilling a 30-centimeter (8 inch) shaft, rescuers
broke through Sunday to the cavern where the 10 men were believed
to have been buried. Hopes increased when preliminary tests
indicated there was enough oxygen for the men to have survived.
	   Cameras and a microphone were lowered down the narrow shaft but
failed to detect any signs of life. A second camera with additional
lighting was lowered into the chamber early Monday.
	   The leader of the rescue team, Hans Dieter Faissner, said crews
``illuminated the cavern as much as possible'' but were still
unable to find the victims.
	   ``We are very disappointed because we could see nothing,'' Fritz
Stangl, deputy mayor of Lassing, told the Austrian Press Agency.
``But we are not giving up hope.''
	   The failure to detect signs of life was the latest setback in
Austria's worst mining accident since World War II.
	   Despite intensified efforts during the past week, the operation
has been delayed by numerous technical problems. The team had
planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the cavern to bring out
the men.
	   But the shaft kept filling with debris and stone and work on it
was suspended late Saturday. Engineers said it might have to be
reinforced with cement, a time-consuming process that could take
days.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one is completed.

Skate: Papua New Guinea ready for business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Bill
Skate, making his first official visit to Australia, said Monday
his country offers excellent opportunities to patient investors and
traders.
	   But he said his now 12-month-old government looks for genuine
partnerships that will contribute to nation building, not for what
he called ``spivs and profiteers.''
	   Skate admitted that economic progress in his resource-rich, but
still underdeveloped country, has been slower than he wanted, but
said that progress has been made over the past year.
	   He said his government has agreed to arrangements that will
underpin the building of a natural gas pipeline, from the rich gas
fields of his country's southern highlands, across the Torres
Strait and into the Australian state of Queensland, where it will
fuel both a power station and aluminum refinery.
	   ``My government would like to ensure that the benefits from this
project are shared fairly,'' Skate told a state luncheon with
Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
	   Skate said his own experience _ growing up in one of the large
squatter settlements that surround his country's capital of Port
Moresby _ had influenced his own approach to government.
	   He said Port Moresby had been designed, in colonial days, for
mostly Australian expatriates.
	   While involved in local government in the city, he had employed
members of the city's troublesome youth gangs _ known locally as
rascals _ to build footpaths in the city.
	   That had provided both badly needed employment and important
local facilities for his country's own people, Skate said.
	   Earlier Monday, Howard announced that Australia will provide
U.S. dlrs 610,000 in extra funding to Papua New Guinea following
last month's tsunami disaster.
	   Skate said the official death toll in the July 17 tsunami was
2,134, with 9,483 people homeless and 628 in hospital.

Australian opposition leader calls for more immigration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Labor Party leader Kim
Beazley said Monday that increased immigration levels could offer
the solution to many of Australia's long-term problems.
	   Beazley, the country's opposition leader and who would be prime
minister if his party wins the next general election, said Labor
would set up a new Office of Population and Immigration.
	   He said in a speech Monday that the continuing debate over race
and immigration was ugly and described right-wing legislator
Pauline Hanson's One Nation group as ``a racist, xenophobic
party.''
	   ``What I bring to the table is this: Labor believes that
increased immigration levels can be a solution to many of the
problems Australia faces in the long term,'' Beazley said.

Suharto relative linked to investigation of kidnappings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A son-in-law of former President
Suharto will be investigated in connection with the kidnappings of
political activists, Indonesia's armed forces chief said Monday.
	   The Suharto relative, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, was in charge
of Indonesia's special forces, which have been implicated in the
abductions of government opponents since last year.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions and have called for investigations of
Prabowo and other senior officials.
	   Under new President B.J. Habibie, the military has pledged to
pursue officers implicated in human rights abuses.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, said military
investigators will examine whether Prabowo, as well as another
general and an officer, were involved. He also said 10
lower-ranking soldiers arrested in the case will be tried in a
military court.
	   Activists who were kidnapped and later released said they were
held in cells while being tortured and questioned about their
political activities. At least 14 are still missing.
	   Prabowo has said he is ready to take responsibility for the
kidnappings, which occurred before Suharto quit in May after 32
years in power.
	   Soon after Suharto resigned amid riots and student protests,
Wiranto transferred Prabowo to a less prestigious post outside
Jakarta in what was seen as the removal of a rival. He has been
placed on leave pending the result of the investigation.
	   The ambitious and brash Prabowo is a controversial figure whose
fast-rising career was sidelined by the sudden downfall of his
father-in-law.

Butler meets Iraqi officials, Parliament in session
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos staffing &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
opened talks on Monday with Iraqi officials, who have insisted that
inspections be wrapped up and trade sanctions lifted this year.
	   Butler did not speak with reporters before his meeting with
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, and other Iraqi
officials.
	   On Sunday he told reporters that the U.N. Special Commission,
which is responsible for monitoring Iraqi weapons, wants to wrap up
its work quickly.
	   ``Our steadfast aim is to get this done as soon as possible to
get to the end of the disarmament phase so the Security Council can
consider the sanctions issue,'' Butler told reporters.
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year -- the
first time he had set a deadline. That statement later was endorsed
by the Revolutionary Command Council, which is Iraq's collective
leadership.
	   Iraq's Parliament was to meet Monday to discuss the weapons
inspections and sanctions.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions _ which ban air
travel to and from the country and limit oil sales _ after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The council has said they will not be
lifted until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq says the sanctions have caused widespread suffering among
its 22 million people.
	   During his previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a
``blueprint'' of what it must do to comply with U.N. resolutions.
On Sunday, he called the plan ``an accelerated program of work.''
	   As usual, Iraqi newspapers excoriated Butler in their editorials
on Monday.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of Saddam's ruling Baath party, said
Butler was no longer the representative of an international
organization but ``a man who implements American policies against
Iraq.''
	   Iraq has long accused the United States and Britain of
needlessly prolonging the trade sanctions.
	   Al-Thawra accused the United States of ``igniting a series of
dangerous crises,'' including a standoff earlier this year over
Iraq's refusal to open presidential sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   The United States and Britain sent warplanes and ships to the
Gulf, threatening military action to force Iraq to cooperate. The
crisis was defused in a February agreement negotiated by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The paper called Butler's commission ``not credible'' and
accused him of making statements in Iraq suggesting there was
progress in disarmament, then telling the U.N. Security Council
there were problems.
	   The state-run Al-Jumhuriya repeated allegations that depleted
uranium warheads used by U.S. forces in the Gulf War had poisoned
Iraq's environment. The government says the chemicals have
contributed to birth defects and higher rates of cancer.
	   In an unusual claim, it also accused the Americans of trying to
sabotage Iraq's grain output with rodents.
	   ``Iraqis noticed an unusual increase of mice and rats in Iraq,
which led them to think that this is (the result of) an organized
operation by a foreign side, represented by the American officers
and spies working at the Special Commission,'' Al-Jumhuriya said.
	   It termed the pest problem ``biological warfare'' against Iraq.

Official: SilkAir crash investigation to continue for 6 more months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan
said Monday that investigation of the SilkAir crash in Indonesia
last December will take at least six more months.
	   Mah was asked in Parliament to comment on an Asian Wall Street
Journal story last week listing pilot suicide as a likely cause of
the crash, but the question was ruled out of order before the
minister answered.
	   Last Dec. 19, the SilkAir Boeing 737-300 mysteriously dropped
from the sky into the Musi River in the Sumatran jungle, killing
all 104 people aboard. SilkAir is a subsidiary of the flag carrier
Singapore Airlines.
	   The investigation team is led by Indonesian officials, and
includes representatives of Singapore Airlines and Boeing.
	   Mah said the investigation has been made difficult by the damage
to the plane and the lack of data on the jetliner's cockpit voice
recorder and flight data recorder. The jet fell apart in the air
before hitting the river.
	   Further analysis is under way of aircraft systems, as well as of
``human performance aspects'' of the accident, he said.
	   Since the investigation is led by Indonesian officials, they
have the authority to release information, Mah said.
	   So far, the investigation team has examined the recovered
wreckage and a partial reconstruction of the aircraft's tail
section, he said, adding that the team has also carried out tests
in flight simulators.
	   Mah said Indonesia's current economic troubles aren't affecting
the investigation.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An antitank missile mounted on an armored vehicle
accidentally exploded during a military training exercise Monday in
northern Japan, blowing off a soldier's right arm, the Defense
Agency said.
	   Sgt. Second Class Takahide Yoshiaki, 33, was injured in the
blast at a training base in Eniwa on Japan's northern main island
of Hokkaido, and was in critical condition at a hospital, Defense
Agency spokesman Shingo Nishi said.
	   It was a second accident involving Ground Self-Defense Force
personnel in less than a week.
	   Last Thursday, a Japanese army sergeant was killed after a
cartridge case in the gun barrel of a military vehicle exploded at
a training facility in western Japan. That explosion also caused
slight injuries to two other soldiers.
	   In Monday's blast, Yoshiaki was checking the safety of the
firing device on the Type 89 Infantry Fighting Vehicle when the
missile suddenly shot off, the spokesman said. Military officials
were investigating the cause of the blast.
	   Eniwa is 807 kilometers (500 miles), northwest of Tokyo.

Hope fades for 10 men buried for 17 days in Austrian mine

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Hopes are fading for 10 men buried last
month in a talc mine after cameras and microphones lowered into an
emergency shaft failed to detect signs of life in the chamber where
the men were believed to be trapped.
	   Members of the rescue team were to meet Monday in the mining
village of Lassing, 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna,
to decide their next moves.
	   The 10 were sent into the mine in Lassing on July 17 to rescue
miner Georg Hainzl, who was buried in a massive landslide unleashed
by torrential rains. But a second, larger landslide trapped the
nine miners and one geologist.
	   Talc is a soft mineral that is refined into talcum powder and
lubricants.
	   Rescue efforts intensified after Hainzl was found alive and in
relatively good condition July 26. He had taken refuge in another
chamber closer to the surface.
	   After weeks of drilling a 30-centimeter- (8-inch-) diameter
shaft, rescuers broke through Sunday to the cavern where the 10 men
were believed to have been buried. Hopes increased when preliminary
tests indicated there was enough oxygen for the men to have
survived.
	   Cameras and a microphone were lowered down the narrow shaft but
failed to detect any signs of life. A second camera with additional
lighting was lowered into the chamber early Monday.
	   The leader of the rescue team, Hans Dieter Faissner, said crews
``illuminated the cavern as much as possible'' but were still
unable to find the victims.
	   ``We are very disappointed because we could see nothing,'' Fritz
Stangl, deputy mayor of Lassing, told the Austrian Press Agency.
``But we are not giving up hope.''
	   The failure to detect signs of life was the latest setback in
Austria's worst mining accident since World War II.
	   The team had planned to drill a second, wider shaft into the
cavern to bring out the men, but the shaft kept filling with debris
and stone, and work on it was suspended late Saturday.
	   If the men are found alive, however, rescuers said food and
water could be lowered through the narrow shaft until work on the
wider one is completed.

All-night vigil for Gypsy victims of Holocaust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Gypsy community marked the
anniversary of the Poraymos _ or the Holocaust _ with an all-night
vigil that ended at dawn Monday.
	   During the night of Aug. 2-3, 1944, the Nazis massacred 4,500
Gypsies in the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in
Poland to make room for more Jews.
	   Gypsies refer to the slaughter as the ``Poraymous,'' or
``Devouring'' in their language.
	   As dusk fell Sunday over the square in front of the Gothic
national parliament, Erika Mate sang a Gypsy lament: ``Dear God,
let the day come when all the slaves are freed. Punish, the
Germans, oh God, for they have killed the people...''
	   The vigil included the reading of a message from President Arpad
Goencz, a ecumenical religious service, and the reading of names of
thousands of Gypsy victims.
	   Speakers said that although the world has become aware of the
massacre by the Nazis of 6 million Jews, many remain unaware of the
slaughter of Gypsies, homosexuals, Marxists and the mentally
disadvantaged.
	   ``In the name of the Hungarian government, I bow before the
memory of the Roma victims of the Holocaust,'' said State Secretary
Csaba Hende of the Justice Ministry.
	   Gypsies, who call themselves the Roma, are Hungary's biggest
ethnic minority, an estimated 500,000-strong in a country of 10.2
million.
	   During the Third Reich, between 200,000 and 500,000 Gypsies were
killed. The figure is uncertain because many of the victims were
not registered and many deaths occurred in transit to concentration
camps.
	   Of the 23,000 Gypsies taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau, nearly 21,000
were killed, according to Franciszek Piper of the Auschwitz State
Museum.
	   Andras T. Hegedues, a Budapest expert on minority affairs, said
Hungarian records indicate 50,000-60,000 Hungarian Gypsies were
deported to death camps in the last two years of World War II.

Ulihrach wins Croatian Open, third career title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMAG, Croatia (AP) _ Seventh-seeded Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech
Republic cruised to his third career title Sunday defeating Swede
Magnus Norman 6-3, 7-6 (7-0) in the final of the dlrs 400,000
Croatia Open ATP tournament.
	   Ulihrach, the world's No. 43, adapted better to the sweltering
heat and controlled the 1 1/2 hour match with strong and precise
serving.
	   ``I slept like a baby last night and this is like a dream for
me,'' Ulihrach said after the match.
	   Playing in his seventh finals appearance, Ulihrach raced to a
4-0 lead in the opening minutes and calmly took the first set,
dropping only a handful of points on his serve.
	   ``I knew it would be vital to break early if I wanted to win and
fortunately I managed to do that in both sets,'' he said.
	   Norman buckled down mid-way through the second set, moving his
Czech opponent around the court with a mix of spin and slice shots.
The change of pace and variety allowed the ATP's No. 47 to level
from 3-1 down and push Ulihrach into tie break.
	   However, it was not meant to be for the Swede, who seemed more
drained and worn by the plus-30 heat in his third finals tournament
played at this Adriatic resort. Norman failed to grab even a single
point in the tie-break, going down 7-0.
	   The victory was Ulihrach's third career title and followed more
than a three year drought. He also claimed dlrs 53,000 in prize
money.

Cambodia's election committee to recount some results
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Responding to opposition complaints,
Cambodia's election commission agreed Monday to recount votes from
certain areas in last week's general election.
	   The recount was scheduled later Monday even though preliminary
totals for slightly more than half of the 23 electoral
constituencies have not yet been released.
	   Results released so far for 11 provinces show Co-Premier Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party leading in all but three of them.
	   One of the two constituencies captured by the opposition
FUNCINPEC party was the central province of Kampong Cham, the
country's biggest constituency, with 18 of the National Assembly's
122 seats.
	   While the National Election Committee has not estimated the
allocation of seats among the winners, a projection by the
Committee for Free and Fair elections in Cambodia, an independent
election monitoring group, gives the ruling Cambodian People's
Party 64 seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and its ally, the Sam Rainsy Party,
15.
	   A spokesman for the National Election Committee said Monday he
hoped preliminary tallies would be completed for all constituencies
Tuesday or Wednesday, but that the committee had not yet received
all documentation from two provinces, Battambang and Rattanakiri.
	   The spokesman also defended the committee's decision to change
the mathematical formula by which the winners of the July 26 vote
will be allocated their parliamentary seats, explaining at length
that it was approved and publicized well before the election.
	   The change in formula, which was not widely publicized until
late last week, favors the top vote-getting party in any particular
province.
	   In practice, this would work to the advantage of the ruling
party, and is significant because it could provide that party with
enough extra seats _ over the original formula _ to attain a
parliamentary majority.
	   Despite repeated questioning, the spokesman could not explain
why the change had been made, other than saying the allocation was
``done in the highest mathematical way, a very scientific one.''
	   There was no ``political intention, it is technical work,'' he
said.
	   The elections were held one year after Hun Sen ousted Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a
tense dual premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993.
	   The opposition parties, Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy
Party, alleging irregularities in voting and ballot counting, have
asked for a recount in suspect areas
	   They also asked that new votes be taken in disputed precincts if
their charges of wrongdoing were found valid, and threatened to
boycott the National Assembly if their complaints were not heeded.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.
	   Hun Sen responded by inviting the opposition to join a coalition
government, but warning that if they carried out their threat not
to attend the assembly, he could lower the constitutional minimum
for the assembly to meet and confirm a government from two-thirds
to 50 percent plus one. He also said his current government could
simply remain in power.

Philippine military releases five Saudi nationals after
</HEADLINE>
questioning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ The military has released five
Saudi Arabian men suspected of having trained Muslim guerrillas in
the southern Philippines after authorities found no evidence to
support the suspicion, an official said Monday.
	   An army spokesman said the five were taken in for questioning
Saturday in the town of Sultan Kudarat in Maguindanao province and
released the next day.
	   Army Capt. Salih Indanan said soldiers accosted the five at a
checkpoint in a village strongly influenced by guerrillas of the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front. They took the foreigners and their
guide to an army camp in Cotabato city, also in Maguindanao.
	   Indanan said they initially suspected the foreigners of being
military trainers of MILF rebel recruits but found no evidence. He
said the five have valid travel documents and were apparently in
the southern Mindanao region to help Muslim tribal families.
	   Last year, two Middle Eastern men, armed with rifles and
grenades, stormed an army camp near a domestic airport in
Maguindanao, killing two soldiers before being killed by government
troops. Military officials said then the two were seen in an MILF
camp before the attack.
	   The MILF is involved in on-and-off peace talks with the Manila
government but has been accused of continuing attacks against
military and civilian targets.

Romanian premier: Romania willing to return property to Jews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Vasile said Romania will make reparations,
UPDATES with quote, upgrades attribution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Visiting Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
said Monday that he will submit legislation in parliament next
month to return property to Jews whose property was nationalized
after World War II.
	   ``The bill presents a global solution for Romania to return
property to all former owners, not only Jews,'' said Vasile, who
arrived Sunday for a four-day visit to Israel.
	   Vasile was scheduled to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
later Monday, and with the representatives of the World Jewish
Restitution Organization on Tuesday.
	   Some 400,000 Jews _ half the Romanian Jewish population _
perished in World War II, when Romania was allied with Nazi
Germany. Many others left the country in the years after the war,
when hundreds of Jewish properties were nationalized.
	   Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said there were now only 12,000
Jews in Romania, but that Romanian Jews living outside the country
were expected to ask for the return of their property as well.
	   Romania's president, Emil Constantinescu, won praise from
Romanian Jewish leaders last year for publicly acknowledging the
country's complicity in the persecution and murder of Jews in the
Holocaust.

Butler meets Iraqi officials, Parliament in session
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
opened talks on Monday with Iraqi officials, who have insisted that
inspections be wrapped up and trade sanctions lifted this year.
	   Butler did not speak with reporters before his meeting with
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, and other Iraqi
officials.
	   On Sunday he told reporters that the U.N. Special Commission,
which is responsible for monitoring Iraqi weapons, wants to wrap up
its work quickly.
	   ``Our steadfast aim is to get this done as soon as possible to
get to the end of the disarmament phase so the Security Council can
consider the sanctions issue,'' Butler told reporters.
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year _ the
first time he had set a deadline. That statement later was endorsed
by the Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's collective leadership.
	   Iraq's Parliament was to meet Monday to discuss the weapons
inspections and sanctions.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions _ which ban air
travel to and from the country and limit sales of oil, its main
export _ after Iraq's 1990 invasion of neighboring Kuwait. The
council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N. inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq says the sanctions have caused widespread suffering among
its 22 million people.
	   During his previous visit in June, Butler gave Iraq a
``blueprint'' of what it must do to comply with U.N. resolutions.
On Sunday, he called the plan ``an accelerated program of work.''
	   As usual, Iraqi newspapers excoriated Butler in their editorials
on Monday.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of Saddam's ruling Baath party, said
Butler was no longer the representative of an international
organization but ``a man who implements American policies against
Iraq.''
	   Iraq has long accused the United States and Britain of
needlessly prolonging the trade sanctions.
	   Al-Thawra accused the United States of ``igniting a series of
dangerous crises,'' including a standoff earlier this year over
Iraq's refusal to open presidential sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   The United States and Britain sent warplanes and ships to the
Gulf, threatening military action to force Iraq to cooperate. The
crisis was defused in a February agreement negotiated by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The paper called Butler's commission ``not credible'' and
accused him of making statements in Iraq suggesting there was
progress in disarmament, then telling the U.N. Security Council
there were problems.
	   The state-run Al-Jumhuriya repeated allegations that depleted
uranium warheads used by U.S. forces in the Gulf War had poisoned
Iraq's environment. The government says the chemicals have
contributed to birth defects and higher rates of cancer.
	   In an unusual claim, it also accused the Americans of trying to
sabotage Iraq's grain output with rodents.
	   ``Iraqis noticed an unusual increase of mice and rats in Iraq,
which led them to think that this is (the result of) an organized
operation by a foreign side, represented by the American officers
and spies working at the Special Commission,'' Al-Jumhuriya said.
	   It termed the pest problem ``biological warfare'' against Iraq.

Chinese dissidents push for retrial of corrupt official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two Chinese dissidents who believe a corrupt
senior leader got off lightly with a 16-year prison sentence have
launched a petition to have him retried, a human rights group said.
	   Yu Tielong and his son Yu Yuanhong hope to gather 10,000
signatures backing their demand that the former mayor of Beijing,
Chen Xitong, go on trial again in open, televised proceedings, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said Sunday.
	   Chen was sentenced Friday after a secret trial to 16 years in
prison for corruption and dereliction of duty. Caught in a massive
graft scandal that engulfed Beijing's city government in 1995,
Chen, who also was Beijing's Communist Party boss, was the most
senior official prosecuted in a five-year government campaign
against corruption.
	   Yu Yuanhong said Chen's sentence ``made people feel that high
officials and ordinary people are not at all equal before the
law,'' the Hong Kong-based Information Center added.
	   Yu claimed the Communist Party treated Chen lightly out of
political considerations and said his sentence made people lose
faith in the government's anti-corruption campaign, the center
said. Yu and his father, from eastern Hangzhou city, are doctors of
Chinese medicine who have taken part in previous signature
campaigns, the center said.
	   A government-run newspaper said Chen's sentence showed the
Communist Party's determination to root out corrupt officials, no
matter how senior.
	   ``The verdict answered the long-lingering suspicions and worries
among ordinary people as to whether Chen ... would be punished by
law,'' the China Daily said in a commentary Monday.
	   The newspaper warned that corruption could hinder China's
economic reforms and trigger social unrest, particularly as
moribund state companies lay off millions of workers in an effort
to reform.
	   It said that simply making examples of high officials like Chen
was not enough to stop corruption. The ``power of the people'' also
was needed, along with more transparent government, stronger
supervisory bodies, and ``a more legalized society,'' it said.

Chernobyl's only working reactor shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The only working reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant shut down automatically because of an electric
transformer malfunction, officials said Monday.
	   No radiation leaks have occurred since the shutdown on Sunday
afternoon, said the state company Energoatom, which runs Ukraine's
nuclear plants. The reactor will undergo repairs until Friday,
Energoatom said.
	   The accident, albeit minor, underscored recent warnings by
Ukraine's top nuclear safety official, who recently noted the
growing number of malfunctions at the country's five atomic power
plants.
	   Oleksandr Smyshlyayev, who heads the Environment Protection
Ministry's nuclear division, blamed outdated equipment and the
failure to observe safety rules for the mounting breakdowns.
	   The Chernobyl plant originally had four working nuclear
reactors.
	   However, reactor No. 4 was destroyed in a 1986 explosion, the
world's worst nuclear accident. Another reactor was shut down after
being badly damaged by a 1991 fire, and a third is not operational.
	   Ukraine relies on nuclear plants to produce more than half of
its electricity, and says it does not have enough money to convert
to other forms of energy or make wide-ranging safety improvements.

Suharto relative linked to investigation of kidnappings of
</HEADLINE>
activists &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote, more comment from military commander &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A son-in-law of former President
Suharto will be investigated in connection with the kidnappings of
political activists, Indonesia's armed forces chief said Monday.
	   The Suharto relative, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, was in charge
of Indonesia's special forces, which have been implicated in the
abductions of government opponents since last year.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions while Suharto was in power and have called
for investigations of Prabowo and other senior officials.
	   Under new, reform-minded President B.J. Habibie, the military
has pledged to pursue officers implicated in human rights abuses.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, said military
investigators will examine whether Prabowo, as well as another
general and an officer, were involved. He also said 10
lower-ranking soldiers arrested in the case will be tried in a
military court.
	   ``Honestly, (the armed forces) will investigate the mistakes
made by individuals,'' Wiranto said at a news conference at the
Defense Ministry. A council of seven generals will handle the
probe.
	   Activists who were kidnapped and later released said they were
held in cells while being tortured and questioned about their
political activities. At least 14 are still missing.
	   Prabowo has said he is ready to take responsibility for the
kidnappings, which occurred before Suharto quit in May after 32
years in power.
	   Soon after Suharto resigned amid riots and student protests,
Wiranto transferred Prabowo to a less prestigious post in Bandung
in what was seen as the removal of a rival. He has been placed on
leave pending the result of the investigation.
	   The ambitious and brash Prabowo is a controversial figure whose
fast-rising career was sidelined by the sudden downfall of his
father-in-law.
	   At his news conference, Wiranto also said Indonesia was safe
again for tourists and investments in the wake of the political
turmoil that led to Suharto's downfall. However, fears of more
unrest linger because Indonesia's economic crisis is pushing
millions into poverty.

Estrada says Albright pledged U.S. ships won't carry nuclear

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by defense secretary in 6th graf &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has guaranteed that U.S. ships joining any future joint
military exercises in the Philippines will not carry nuclear
weapons, President Joseph Estrada said Monday.
	   Estrada said Albright made the pledge during a meeting in Manila
last week.
	   ``She guaranteed that,'' Estrada said in a radio interview.
	   He quoted Albright as saying that a policy of deploying only
ships without nuclear weapons in military exercises was adopted
during the term of President George Bush.
	   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado met later Monday
with his U.S. counterpart, William Cohen, to discuss a proposed
accord, called the Visiting Forces Agreement, that would allow a
resumption of military exercises between the Philippines and the
United States.
	   ``We feel that these exercises will be of use and benefit to our
country especially now that we are in a bind and unable to pursue
with gusto our (military) modernization program,'' Mercado said.
	   The United States halted all joint exercises on Philippine
territory and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when
the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S.
military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes
committed here.
	   The Visiting Forces Agreement, signed early this year by U.S.
and Philippines officials, would provide certain legal protections
to U.S. soldiers while on duty in the Philippines. It still must be
ratified by the Philippine Senate, which has not yet begun
deliberations.
	   Several groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, have
opposed the agreement, saying it would infringe on Philippine
sovereignty, promote prostitution and endanger Filipinos if nuclear
weapons are carried on U.S. ships or planes.
	   Critics say the accord limits the Philippine government's right
to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the country.
	   The agreement gives the United States jurisdiction over soldiers
who commit crimes while on duty, and the Philippines jurisdiction
over crimes committed while off-duty.
	   Estrada and Mercado, who as senators voted against extending the
lease on the last U.S. military base in the Philippines in 1992,
support the accord, saying the country must depend on military help
from the United States until it develops a credible deterrent of
its own.
	   ``This is different because we're fighting for the security of
our country this time. We have a very weak military and our
equipment is obsolete and antiquated,'' Estrada said, adding that
the country could be invaded by its neighbors at any time with
ease.
	   ``We can't win _ any time we could be invaded,'' Estrada said,
referring to China, Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia as possible
aggressors.
	   Estrada said the agreement would allow a U.S. military presence
only during exercises, stressing he is against any form of
permanent stationing of American troops in the country.
	   The two countries used to conduct between six and eight military
exercises a year, involving up to 3,000 U.S. troops at a time.

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's leading opposition party
captured the governor's seat in the central state of Aguascalientes
Monday, a victory that gives it fresh momentum heading toward the
2000 presidential race.
	   More than anything, the gubernatorial contests in Aguascalientes
and two other states Sunday underscored the growing competitiveness
of elections in a country where for decades one party _ the
Institutional Revolutionary Party _ easily won every vote.
	   ``Mexico has made another important step toward democracy,''
said historian Enrique Krauze, serving as an election-day analyst
for the Mexican network Televisa. ``The process was characterized
by stability and tranquility.''
	   With two-thirds of the vote counted in Aguascalientes early
Monday, Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez of National Action was ahead with
53 percent of the vote, the State Electoral Council said.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's candidate, Hugo
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, trailed with 37 percent, followed by
Alfonso Bernal Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party, with 7 percent.
	   ``What we want for Aguascalientes is a transition that does not
hold back its progress, that does not cause a scandal,'' Gonzalez
Gonzalez told a news conference after media exit polls showed him
the winner.
	   Complete preliminary results in Aguascalientes, as well as in
Oaxaca and Veracruz, were not expected until later Monday. The
final official results for all three races were not expected until
later in the week.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the ruling party, known as the
PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to offset the loss.
	   In Mexico City on Sunday evening, PAN national president Felipe
Calderon Hinojosa opened a bottle of apple cider to toast
Gonzalez's apparent win.
	   With Aguascalientes, the PAN ``advances and solidifies its
political position,'' a smiling Calderon Hinojosa said.
	   While the center-right National Action Party was headed for
victory in Aguascalientes, the PRI was virtually assured the
governorship in the Gulf state of Veracruz.
	   With 36 percent of the ballots counted, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy
businessman and the son of a former president, was leading with 52
percent of the vote.
	   Luis Pazos of National Action trailed with 28 percent. The
candidate of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party lagged
behind with 14 percent.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   Aleman late Sunday promised to create ``a social alliance'' as
Veracruz's new governor.
	   As elected leader of one of Mexico's most important states,
Aleman automatically would become a top contender for the PRI's
presidential nomination for 2000 _ even though he has claimed he is
not interested.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at stamping out vote fraud and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But it won two of three elections last
month, including in Chihuahua, where it defeated the PAN.
	   In the southern state of Oaxaca Monday, the PRI had a widening
advantage over the center-left Democratic Revolution party for the
governorship of the southern state of Oaxaca.
	   Nevertheless, Democratic Revolution did better than many
analysts had expected, showing that it, too, has become a political
force capable of seriously challenging the PRI at the ballot box.
	   With 58 percent of the vote counted Monday, PRI candidate Jose
Nelson Murat Casab widened his lead with 47.13 percent of the vote.
Democratic Revolution candidate Hector Sanchez had 36.10 percent.
The National Action candidate had just under 14.49 percent.
	   Formed in 1989, Democratic Revolution saw its first important
electoral win last year when Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the son of late
President Lazaro Cardenas, captured the mayorship of Mexico City.
	   It won its first state governorship _ in the northern state of
Zacatecas _ last month.

Gunfire rings though Kinshasa army barracks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Gunfire and rumors echoed through Congo's
capital of Kinshasa early Monday morning as rival soldiers clashed
in a military barracks and the government ordered the population
off the streets.
	   The sound of gunfire could be heard from Camp Kokolo military
base on Kinshasa's west side. It was not immediately clear who was
fighting, although tensions have been escalating in recent days
between troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila and his one-time
Rwandan allies.
	   Kabila last week ordered all Rwandan soldiers out of his
country, but did not elaborate on the reason. Rwandan troops played
an important role last year in helping Kabila oust longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   ``The government asks the people of Congo and those foreigners
here in the country to stay calm and to stay at home until order is
restored,'' said an abrupt announcement Monday morning on
state-controlled People's Radio. ``Stay at home just until that
time when the armed forces of Congo reestablish civil order.''
	   Shops throughout the capital remained closed Monday morning and
people who had headed downtown for work early in the morning were
quickly returning home.
	   Speculation was rife over the stability of Kabila's government
after weeks of growing tension between the president, his top
advisers and what now appears to be a shaky military alliance with
neighboring Rwanda.
	   In eastern Congo, meanwhile, a spokesman for a breakaway ethnic
group urged the people to oust Kabila.
	   ``We've taken the decision to no longer recognize the government
of Laurent Kabila,'' said the spokesman, who identified himself
only as Andre. ``We don't want to separate from Congo, but Kabila
must be removed from power.''
	   In a statement delivered to The Associated Press and the Voice
of America, Andre said his group, representing the Banyamulenge
ethnic Tutsis, was in control of most of Kivu province.
	   Kivu has been the scene of ongoing unrest for months.

Armed forces chief says Indonesia is safe for tourists, investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military commander called
Monday for the return of much needed foreign capital, declaring the
economically stricken nation to be safe for tourists and investors.
	   In the wake of the turmoil that forced President Suharto from
power, Indonesia has been implementing democratic reforms and
struggling to revive its shattered economy. But fears of fresh
unrest have kept many visitors and their dollars away.
	   ``I declare now that Indonesia is safe for tourists and
investments,'' Gen. Wiranto, head of the armed forces, said at a
news conference. ``This is the time to invest your money again.''
	   Many investors don't agree. The economy remains virtually
paralyzed, with millions of people out of work and prices rising
fast. About 1,200 people were killed in rioting over price
increases in Jakarta in May, and Suharto quit soon after.
	   Much of the violence targeted Indonesia's ethnic Chinese
minority, which controls much of the economy and often becomes a
scapegoat when social tension boils over.

All-night vigil for Gypsy victims of the Nazis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Gypsy community marked the
anniversary of the Poraymos _ or the Holocaust _ with an all-night
vigil that ended at dawn Monday.
	   During the night of Aug. 2-3, 1944, the Nazis massacred 4,500
Gypsies in the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in
Poland to make room for more Jews.
	   Gypsies refer to the slaughter as the ``Poraymous,'' or
``Devouring'' in their language.
	   As dusk fell Sunday over the square in front of the Gothic
national parliament, Erika Mate sang a Gypsy lament: ``Dear God,
let the day come when all the slaves are freed. Punish, the
Germans, oh God, for they have killed the people...''
	   The vigil included the reading of a message from President Arpad
Goencz, an ecumenical religious service and the reading of names of
thousands of Gypsy victims.
	   Speakers said that although the world has become aware of the
massacre by the Nazis of 6 million Jews, many remain unaware of the
slaughter of Gypsies, homosexuals, Marxists and the mentally
impaired.
	   Gypsies, who call themselves the Roma, are Hungary's biggest
ethnic minority, an estimated 500,000-strong in a country of 10.2
million.
	   During the Nazi era, between 200,000 and 500,000 Gypsies were
killed. The figure is uncertain because many of the victims were
not registered and many deaths occurred in transit to concentration
camps.
	   Of the 23,000 Gypsies taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau, nearly 21,000
were killed, according to Franciszek Piper of the Auschwitz State
Museum.
	   Andras T. Hegedues, a Budapest expert on minority affairs, said
Hungarian records indicate 50,000-60,000 Hungarian Gypsies were
deported to death camps in the last two years of World War II.

Singapore PM moves to collect damages award after defamation
</HEADLINE>
ruling &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong stepped
up efforts Monday to collect a defamation damages award from
political opponent J.B. Jeyaretnam, a move Jeyaretnam said is
likely to drive him into bankruptcy and out of Parliament.
	   The tangled case involves Jeyaretnam's campaign rally statement
that some of his supporters had filed police complaints against
Goh. Although the statement was true, Goh successfully sued
Jeyaretnam, one of only three opposition members in the 84-seat
Parliament.
	   Last month, Singapore's highest court ruled that Jeyaretnam
acted out of malice and awarded Goh 100,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
58,800) in damages. Jeyaretnam was also sentenced to pay full court
costs, estimated at about 150,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 88,000).
	   ``Mr. Goh Chok Tong has today served me with a statutory demand
demanding payment of the 100,000 (Singapore dollars) within 21
days,'' Jeyaretnam said in a statement.
	   ``The statutory demand is the first step in bankruptcy
proceedings. If I do not pay, and I have said I do not have the
money, a bankruptcy petition will be served on me,'' he added.
	   Jeyaretnam had said last month he could not pay the award.
	   He has expressed fears that he will be proclaimed bankrupt,
which under the constitution would cause him to lose his Parliament
seat.
	   Seven other senior Singapore officials, including former Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew, now a senior minister, are suing Jeyaretnam
over the same statement.
	   The case was used as an example in this year's U.S. State
Department Human Rights Report, which said the Singapore government
uses legal processes such as libel and defamation suits to stifle
freedom of speech and intimidate the political opposition.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler
opened talks on Monday with Iraqi officials, who have insisted that
inspections be wrapped up and trade sanctions lifted this year.
	   Butler did not speak with reporters before his meeting with
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, and other Iraqi
officials.
	   On Sunday he told reporters that the U.N. Special Commission,
which is responsible for monitoring Iraqi weapons, wants to wrap up
its work quickly.
	   ``Our steadfast aim is to get this done as soon as possible to
get to the end of the disarmament phase so the Security Council can
consider the sanctions issue,'' Butler told reporters.
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year -- the
first time he had set a deadline. That statement later was endorsed
by the Revolutionary Command Council, which is Iraq's collective
leadership.
	   Iraq's Parliament was to meet Monday to discuss the weapons
inspections and sanctions but delayed the special session until
Thursday to discuss the results of Butler's visit, Parliament
officials said.

Escaped fugitives still elude police in northeast Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three fugitives remained at-large Monday after
escaping from a prison and into the wilderness of Russia's far
northeast. Authorities said their search on the edge of the Arctic
Circle was hampered by snow, rain and fog.
	   Troops and local police were pursuing the fugitives on a
northern section of the Chukotka peninsula, which extends into the
Bering Strait, across from Alaska.
	   But the bad weather, including an August snow, kept military
helicopters grounded, and prevented Federal Security Service troops
from pinpointing the escapees' location, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The troops have orders to shoot the fugitives on sight.
	   A group of 11 convicts killed a police officer and stole a large
number of weapons while escaping from prison Friday and fleeing in
two stolen trucks and an armored vehicle.
	   Two convicts and two police were killed in a shootout that
followed. One escapee committed suicide and five more were
captured.
	   Authorities said they were confident they would track down the
fugitives because there are few places to hide on the tundra, and
the Chukotka Peninsula is so far north that there there is little
darkness this time of year. The nearest human settlement is a
village about 500 kilometers (300 miles) away, officials said.

Fire at Israeli toxic waste dump leads to call for investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A large-scale fire at a toxic waste dump in
southern Israel led to calls Monday for an investigation into
safety standards at the site.
	   Environment Minister Rafael Eitan said the ministry would
investigate the fire, which began Sunday night at the Ramat Hovav
dump, 7 miles (11 kms) south of the town of Beersheva in the Negev
Desert.
	   Ministry spokesman Yiftah Kramer said the fire broke out when
vats storing lithium batteries in oil fell and exploded.
	   The fire blazed all night, and the last remnants were still
being extinguished Monday morning, Kramer said.
	   Ofer Ben Dov, director of Greenpeace in Israel, said safety at
the site must be given high priority on the national agenda.
	   ``Over the past year and a half, three parliamentary committees
have discussed the subject but nothing has been done,'' he told
Israel Radio. ``The prime minister needs to take matters into his
own hands.''
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper published a list of dangerous
incidents that have taken place at the site over the last 10 years,
including several fires and chemical leaks.

Dutch team appearing before police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REIMS, France (AP) _ A day after the Tour de France ended in
Paris, members of the Dutch team TVM were being questioned by
police Monday about banned drugs found in their possession.
	   TVM team members had pulled out of the race on Friday, two days
before the ending, saying they had neither the physical nor the
mental strength to continue.
	   Six cyclists, along with other team staff members, were being
questioned Monday morning in Reims, north of Paris. Already the
team director, Cees Priem, and its doctor, Andrei Mikhailov, have
been placed under formal investigation _ a step short of being
formally charged _ on doping charges.
	   The TVM investigation actually began last March, when customs
agents found performance-enhancing drugs in a team car, seizing
about 100 doses of EPO, which increases oxygen to the red blood
cells.
	   But it wasn't until the scandal involving another team, Festina,
broke out that the TVM allegations came to light.
	   Priem and Mikhailov were arrested on July 23, and subsequent
searches of TVM hotel rooms resulted in the seizure of more drugs.
Team members were taken to a hospital in Albertville, where they
were subjected to extensive medical checks.
	   The 17th stage of the race had to be annulled when all the
cyclists, angered at the treatment of TVM members, refused to race
and merely coasted in a pack to the finish line.
	   Finally, the TVM riders quit the Tour July 30 in Switzerland,
meaning they wouldn't have to come back through France.

Ranariddh charges Khmer Rouge arrest a political ploy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The arrest of a former Khmer Rouge
guerrilla wanted for the killing of three Western tourists in 1994
is a political ploy, Cambodia's ousted co-prime minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh charged Monday.
	   The arrest of Nuon Paet on Saturday for ordering the slayings of
the young kidnapped travelers was a ``tragic comedy,'' Ranariddh
told reporters at Phnom Penh airport upon his return from a weekend
trip to Bangkok, Thailand.
	   ``Why? Because Hun Sen has known for a long time where Nuon Paet
is, but he didn't do anything,'' Ranaridddh said.
	   He did it now, Ranariddh added, because he wanted ``to please
Australia, Britain and France'' after the elections.
	   The international community provided more than dlrs 30 million
in aid for Cambodia to hold parliamentary elections July 26, and
then gave its stamp of approval, saying the polls could be
considered credible.
	   Hun Sen hopes that the elections will restore his legitimacy and
foreign aid lost after he ousted Ranariddh as his co-prime minister
in a coup last year, shattering a dual premiership formed after the
U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Nuon Paet, 52, headed a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who
halted a train in the southern province of Kampot and abducted and
killed David Wilson, 29, of Australia, Mark Slater, 28, of Britain
and Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, of France.
	   He was arrested Saturday after the government lured him to Phnom
Penh from the former guerrilla stronghold of Pailin with offers of
a bogus business deal. He is being detained at the capital's
dilapidated T-3 prison.
	   Australia's foreign minister on Sunday denied speculation that
the arrest was part of a deal for Australia's acceptance of Hun
Sen's apparent election victory.
	   The opposition has accused Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's
Party of election fraud, and appealed to international election
observers to pressure the government to investigate.
	   Alexander Downer said Australia's decision to recognize the
election outcome would be based on the assessment of the Joint
International Observers Group _ which included 22 Australians _
once all counting was complete and results announced.
	   ``The arrest of Nuon Paet doesn't play into that as far as we
are concerned,'' he said.
	   Although it was the Kampot court that issued the warrant for
Nuon Paet's arrest nearly two years ago, Hun Sen said over the
weekend that he would be tried in Phnom Penh ``for security
reasons.''
	   The deputy of the Phnom Penh municipal court, Nop Sophon, said
Monday that no trial date has been set or formal charges filed.
	   Ranariddh suggested that Nuon Paet's arrest could also be a
warning signal by Hun Sen to the former guerrillas in Pailin, which
was one of the few constituencies won by an opposition party in
last week's election.
	   The province had been expected to favor the ruling Cambodian
People's Party, but instead supported the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   ``Hun Sen is not happy with Pailin,'' Ranariddh said. ``Pailin
voted for Sam Rainsy, so Hun Sen wasn't happy.''

Row erupts over Bell helicopter deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ As Prime Minister Radu Vasile inspects
cheaper ways to purchase fighter helicopters, ministers quarreled
over a American helicopter deal which some claim will cripple the
flagging economy, papers reported Monday.
	   Newspapers said Defense Minister Victor Babiuc told Finance
Minister Daniel Daianu on Saturday to ``either sign (the deal) or
resign.'' Daianu called the deal ``immoral'' in the light of
Romania's economic woes.
	   On a four-day official visit to Israel, Vasile toured Israel
Aircraft Industries, which specializes in upgrading American Cobra
attack helicopters.
	   Ministers fought among themselves over which helicopter deal was
better for the country, the daily Ziua reported. Daianu said if
Romania bought helicopters from Israel, it would save dlrs 1.2
billion.
	   Vasile and his wife posed for photographs in a a Cobra
helicopter and the prime minister told reporters the Bell Textron
deal was ``not final.''
	   American company Bell Textron has said Romania must purchase 96
attack helicopters called ``Dracula'' as part of the
government-guaranteed loan.
	   Supporting the deal, Babiuc said Romania has to show willing to
spend on defense if it wants to join NATO. ``If we want to be
serious about entering NATO, our defense budget has to be doubled
or even tripled.''
	   The deal would increase defense spending by 20 percent a year
about dlrs 200 million a year- for the next 14 years.
	   The final deci on the helicopter purchase will be taken by
Romania's Supreme Defense Council, Petre Roman, head of
parliament's upper chamber the Senate said. No session of the
council has been scheduled.

Tokyo market's main index falls after four-day rise, dollar climbs

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fell sharply
on profit-taking Monday after a four-day rise, while the U.S.
dollar climbed to a seven-week high against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 213.89 points, or 1.31
percent, closing at 16,165.08.
	   In the previous four trading days, the Nikkei index had gained a
total of 434.61 points, or 2.8 percent, including Friday's gain of
177.37 points, or 1.09 percent.
	   ``The steep fall in financial shares damped sentiment,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   Major bank issues and brokerage stocks were sold amid renewed
worries about the health of the nation's banking system, which is
saddled with huge bad debts left from a collapsed bubble of real
estate speculation in the early 1990s.
	   Trading was light as many investors held back to see what the
administration of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, inaugurated last
week, will do in efforts to rescue Japan's economy from recession.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 823 to 274, with 170 issues
unchanged. An estimated 300 million shares changed hands on the
first section, down from Friday's 379 million.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 16.80 points, or 1.33 percent, to 1,245.24. It
had climbed 13.85 points, or 1.11 percent, on Friday.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 145.64 yen, up 1.86 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
144.65 yen on Friday. During Monday's trading, it ranged between
144.60 yen and 145.71 yen, its highest intraday level in Tokyo
since June 16.
	   The dollar advanced despite some concern among traders that
pushing the U.S. currency higher too aggressively might invite
intervention by Japan's central bank.
	   The yen has come under selling pressure amid a perception that a
turnaround in Japan's economy could take time, despite plans
unveiled recently by Obuchi.
	   Obuchi has promised 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42 billion) in income
tax cuts and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 69 billion) in stimulus
spending.
	   On Friday, the government said Japan's unemployment rate in June
rose to 4.3 percent, its highest since the government began taking
such statistics in 1953.
	   Obuchi is expected to offer some details of his economic plans
in a speech before Parliament later this week.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.225 percent from Friday's finish of 1.250
percent, driving its price up to 111.62 yen from 111.45 yen.

Trevor Rees-Jones appeals for privacy as Diana anniversary nears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo LON101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the car
crash that killed Princess Diana and two others almost a year ago,
appealed for privacy for all the families involved ``to let us mark
this tragic anniversary in our own way.''
	   Rees-Jones, who spoke to APTV, The Associated Press'
international video news agency, in a taped statement released
Monday, said he would make no further public comments until the
judicial inquiry into the Aug. 31 Paris crash concludes.
	   Also killed were driver Henri Paul, who was drunk, and Dodi
Fayed, the son of Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed and Diana's
boyfriend.
	   Rees-Jones, who has told investigators he remembers very little
about the crucial moments before the crash, was employed by Al
Fayed as a bodyguard at the time.
	   ``I've cooperated fully with the judge who's investigating the
accident and told him all I know up to this present time,''
Rees-Jones said in his statement, which marks the first time he has
spoken publicly. ``I may wish to ask to see the judge again in the
future, but I've no intention of doing so at this moment.''
	   The former bodyguard, who has livid scars marking the left side
of his face as a result of the crash, now works in a sports shop in
Oswestry, in central England.
	   His lawyer, Ian Lucas, told APTV that Rees-Jones made the
statement because he has been inundated with requests for
interviews, some with huge amounts of money attached.
	   ``I'd like everyone to appreciate this August will be a
difficult time for myself, my family and for all the families
involved in this tragic accident,'' Rees-Jones said. ``I'd like
everyone and the press to appreciate that and respect our privacy
and let us mark this tragic anniversary in our own way.''

Drug test has positive side effects for Australian player
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Former Olympic field hockey player Greg
Corbitt is thanking a drug test and astute diagnosis by national
team doctor Tony Galvin for early detection of a malignant tumor.
	   Corbitt, 26, was in a Perth hospital Monday to have the tumor
removed, a day after scoring four goals for local side Victoria
Park in his last game for the year.
	   A member of Australia's silver medal-winning 1992 Barcelona
Olympic team, Corbitt was found to have the cancer _ details of
which have not been revealed _ after a routine urine sample taken
by the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) on June 21 showed a
foreign hormone.
	   He contacted Australian team doctor Tony Galvin, who explained
that tumors could produce different types of hormones and ordered
further testing, including ultrasound.
	   ``Had they (ASDA) not asked for a urine sample I would have
continued to live my life without knowing I have cancer before it
was too late,'' Corbitt said Monday.
	   Former ASDA official Dr. Brian Corrigan said Galvin's diagnosis
had almost certainly saved Corbitt's life and described it as ``an
incredible piece of detective work.''
	   ``That's a great piece of diagnosis, especially if he (Corbitt)
was completely well,'' Corrigan said. ``For Tony Galvin to have
sorted all that out, I think is a triumph, I really do, he did it
extraordinarily well.
	   ``They test him (Corbitt) for drugs and end up saving his
life.''
	   Corbitt said he was determined to beat the cancer and return to
the game which saw him win national team honors at age 17 in 1988
and play 104 internationals up to last year, scoring 39 goals.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned it is just another challenge I have to
overcome, albeit a rather large one,'' he said.
	   ``I have no doubt I will make a full recovery and will be back
playing next year. Everything in my life, including my fight to win
national selection, pales into insignificance alongside the battle
I will have to face getting healthy again.''
	   Corrigan suggested that Corbitt had probably returned a high TE
(testosterone-epitestosterone) ratio in his urine sample.
	   The two hormones are normally produced in equal amounts in the
human body and a high TE ratio can be evidence of steroid use.
	   Up until recently a high TE ratio meant an immediate ban from
competition under International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines.
	   But since the link between tumors and high TE ratios was
established, the ban is not put in place until further
investigations are completed, Corrigan said. (djp)

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices tumbled Monday in Hong Kong, with
the key index losing 4.8 percent because of bad news both from
abroad and at home.
	   The Hang Seng index fell 383.43 points, closing at 7,552.77. The
loss followed drops of 3.89 percent last week and more than 4
percent the previous week.
	   Traders blamed a sharp fall Friday on Wall Street, the weakness
of the Japanese yen resulting from uncertainties about the new
government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, and concerns about the
domestic economy.
	   After the market closed, the government reported that the
economy shrank by 2.8 percent in the first quarter, revising an
earlier estimate of a 2.0 percent contraction.
	   Giant HSBC Holdings, Hong Kong's leading bank, also announced
that its net profit fell 16 percent to U.S. dlrs 2.40 billion in
the first half of this year. HSBC accounts for a third of the
weight of Hong Kong's benchmark stock index.
	   HSBC shares fell 10 Hong Kong dollars to 179.00.
	   Hong Kong withstood much of Asia's financial turmoil in the
first months after it began last summer, but now has been dragged
down into recession as well. Unemployment is at a 15-year high. The
economy is being slowed further by cargo problems at the new Chek
Lap Kok airport.
	   ``Investors are selling on the yen's weakness, and the Dow's
fall,'' said Michael Ng, dealing director at Sassoon Securities.
	   The dollar hit a seven-week high of 145 yen Monday in Asia. The
Dow fell 143.66 points on Friday.
	   The Hang Seng index is nearing its low for the year, 7,462.5,
which it reached in mid-June.

 &UR; GRENADA: Castro arrives amid cheers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Hundreds cheered to welcome Fidel
Castro when he arrived Sunday in Grenada, the Caribbean island that
is the only place where U.S. and Cuban forces battled it out
directly in a bloody Cold War confrontation.
	   Leaving his airplane, Castro clasped his hands over his heart as
the audience began singing a revolutionary hymn, ``Forward march,
forward march against imperialism!'' Some unfurled a gigantic
banner reading in Spanish, ``Long live the ideas of the Cuban
revolution,'' while others waved small Cuban and Grenadian flags.
	   The visit to Grenada _ a former French and British colony of
three islands tucked between Trinidad and St. Vincent _ signals
Castro's renewed acceptance among former foes in the Caribbean and
their frustration with Washington's economic policies.
	   At the airport, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell, once outspoken
against Castro, called the early 1980s when Cuba and the United
States competed for influence on the island a time of ``hatred and
divisiveness.''
	   Castro said it was time for the two countries to put the
invasion behind them.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Legislature to consider plebiscite bill
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Trying to revive a sputtering
effort to clarify Puerto Rico's relationship with the United
States, local lawmakers will begin hearings Monday over a proposed
plebiscite on the island's future.
	   Representatives from the island's justice department and its
three main political parties are to testify before the island's
legislature about a law asking Puerto Ricans to vote for
independence, statehood or continued commonwealth under the control
of the United States.
	   Pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello has been pushing a similar
bill in the U.S. Congress for two years. The U.S. House of
Representatives passed the measure by one vote in March, but Senate
leaders have been reluctant to consider the bill.
	   In a letter made public by a pro-commonwealth group Sunday,
Senate President Trent Lott said he worried the definition of
commonwealth offered to Puerto Ricans weakens islanders' U.S.
citizenship and other rights.
	   In a 1993 plebiscite, Puerto Ricans chose continued commonwealth
over statehood by two percentage points. Independence came in a
distant third.
	   Rossello wants to hold the new vote in December.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Alex dissipates before reaching islands
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tropical Storm Alex dropped below storm strength
Sunday, degenerating into a weak trough before reaching the Leeward
Islands, forecasters at the United States' National Weather Service
said Sunday.
	   Reports from an Air Force hurricane-chasing plane indicated Alex
no longer has a closed low-level circulation, producing little more
than a few showers and locally gusty winds.
	   Alex still was about 300 miles (480 kilometers) east-northeast
of the northern Leeward Islands when the storm began dissipating,
forecasters said.
	   Forecasters also were watching a large tropical wave about
midway between the Lesser Antilles and the Cape Verde islands
Sunday. The wave was moving west at about 15 mph (25 kph). Slow
development of the wave is possible in the next day or two,
forecasters said, although it has changed little since Saturday.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sluggish sales have forced Japan's top
semiconductor maker, NEC Corp., to cut capital spending on chip
production by 16.6 percent to 150 billion yen (dlrs 1.03 billion)
this year, the company said Monday.
	   The Tokyo-based NEC will also postpone its scheduled start of a
new domestic chip-manufacturing plant by one year to early 2000, a
company spokesman said.
	   The NEC spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
company will also shelve plans to rationalize its chip-production
lines at domestic plants for the fiscal year, which ends next March
31.
	   NEC originally planned a total of 180 billion yen (dlrs 1.24
billion) in capital spending on chip production.
	   The spokesman said NEC plans to raise output of 64-megabit chips
from the current monthly figure of nearly 8 million to about 10
million by December. NEC originally had planned to boost monthly
production to 15 million chips by mid-1999.
	   But the company said it will sharply slash production of
16-megabit memory chips from 6 million per month to 2 million in
December.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co. said Monday that its subsidiary
COMPASSLINK Corp. will start an information service for car
navigation in Japan on Sept. 10.
	   Drivers will use their car navigation systems or digital mobile
telephones to tell operators of the 24-hour service what
information they need. The data will then be transmitted through
mobile phone circuits. Information will include news and weather
forecasts, the company said.
	   The new service will charge a connection fee of 3,500 yen (dlrs
23.10) and a monthly fee of 2,500 yen (dlrs 17.20) per 10 uses,
with each additional 10 uses at 500 yen (dlrs 3.40).
	   COMPASSLINK was established last December with capital of 2
billion yen (dlrs 13.8 million) and is 52 percent owned by Nissan.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government will announce a
comprehensive package to fix the country's battered banking system
Aug. 15, a senior government official said Monday.
	   Kobsak Chutikul, director-general of the Department of
Information of the Foreign Ministry, said the Finance Ministry and
the Thai central bank would announce the plan to solve problems at
local banks and finance companies.
	   Aug. 15 also marks the first anniversary of Thailand's
acceptance of a dlrs 17.2 billion rescue package from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Since Thailand's financial crisis erupted in July 1997, the
government has shut down 56 insolvent finance companies and has
taken over seven weak ones. It has also taken over four banks,
writing down their capital to almost zero before appropriating
them.
	   The Bank of Thailand said earlier this year that it might take
action against banks that fail to complete a first round of
mandated capital increases by Aug. 15.
	   Thai banks have been ordered to increase their capital funds
because their reserves dwindled when the country's currency, the
baht, was floated last July and subsequently lost more than 30
percent of its value.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Battered by Asia's recession, South
Korean exports suffered their largest monthly contraction in 13 1/2
years in July, the government said Monday.
	   And with imports of raw materials for its factories falling, the
nation recorded a dlrs 3.08 billion trade surplus, compared to a
dlrs 837 million deficit in the same month last year.
	   Exports dropped by 13.7 percent from July last year to dlrs 10.2
billion, the third straight and the largest monthly contraction
since January 1985.
	   The Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry attributed the
contraction to the recession in Asia, one of South Korea's main
export markets, and the appreciation of Korea's currency, which
made its products more expensive.
	   Continuing strikes at the nation's major auto and other
manufacturing plants also helped pull down the export figure, the
ministry said.
	   The nation's imports decreased by 43.7 percent to dlrs 7.12
billion, largely due to sharp drops in international oil prices and
in domestic consumption amid the worst financial crisis in years,
it said.
	   The cumulative trade surplus during the first seven months
reached dlrs 23.13 billion, compared to a deficit of dlrs 9.99
billion for the same period last year.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar has signed an agreement with an

Nusantara Energiwere not disclosed.
	   Oil-rich Indonesia and energy-poor Myanmar are major trading

Power outages have become a daily occurrence in the capital,
Yangon.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two of Malaysia's biggest banks
are lowering their base lending rates following the central bank's
announcement last Friday that it was lowering its intervention rate
to 10.50 percent from around 11.00 percent, effective Monday.
	   Public Bank Bhd. announced over the weekend that beginning
Monday, its base lending rate, or the rate at which it lends to its
best customers, was revised to 12 percent from 12.10 percent.
	   And Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. is also lowering its BLR to
12.00 percent from 12.10 percent starting Tuesday.

Chinese military in `fight to the death' with flooded Yangtze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's military has ordered soldiers to ``fight
to the death'' to ensure that waterlogged dikes holding back the
flooded Yangtze River do not collapse, state media reported Monday.
	   More than 1 million soldiers, militiamen and reservists have
been drafted into flood control efforts in four provinces in south
and east China as flood levels on the Yangtze reached levels unseen
in more than four decades.
	   China's military, the world's largest, with 2.9 million members,
has played a prominent role in efforts to prevent the collapse of
embankments that protect millions of people and rich farmland along
the river, the world's third-longest.
	   Floods brought by rains that fell earlier and heavier than usual
have killed at least 1,268 people in China so far this year.
	   Hundreds of thousands of flood victims living in lean-tos on top
of embankments for the past six weeks may have to wait three weeks
more, until waters subside, before returning home, said Arne
Jacobsen, a Red Cross official who recently toured flooded areas.
	   Exhaustion and exposure are wearing down flood victims' health
and they also are beginning to show symptoms of mental strain, he
said.
	   Thus far, diseases have been confined to intestinal complaints
and skin infections from contact with dirty water, said Jacobsen.
Free antibiotics and water purification pills are running out in
some areas, though they remained available for sale in shops, he
added.
	   Commanders in the Nanjing Military Region, in flood-battered
Jiangsu province east of Shanghai, ordered all officers and men to
``fight to the death to protect the Yangtze River dikes, major
cities along the river and the well-being and property of local
people,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Speedy work by 500 soldiers on collapsed dikes near the city of
Yueyang in southern Hunan province last week saved the lives and
property of 100,000 people, Xinhua said.
	   Another 800 soldiers worked ``tirelessly'' for five days and
nights to reinforce a levee on Hunan's Dongting lake, which flows
into the Yangtze. Army planes, boats and trucks have ferried 160
tons of food, clothing, medicine and plastic sheeting to stricken
areas, Xinhua said.
	   Meanwhile, a man who refused to join anti-flood efforts and
attacked a village official, and another who allegedly dumped four
truck loads of soil into a river, were arrested in Jiangsu, Xinhua
said.

Militants massacre 23 in northern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Suspected Kashmiri separatists shot and
killed 23 sleeping construction workers on a remote mountain road
as part of their ongoing battle to free their predominately Muslim
territory from Indian rule, police said Monday.
	   The attack took place farther outside Kashmir than any previous
separatist attack.
	   Initial reports said the laborers from a road-widening project
were asleep Sunday when an unknown number of militants burst into
their shed after midnight and sprayed them with gunfire. Six people
were wounded.
	   The killings took place at Kalaban, 15 kilometers (10 miles)
from the nearest town, Chamba, said Mohinder Kumar, a police
officer reached in Chamba.
	   The mountainous area, 450 kilometers (270 miles) north of the
capital, New Delhi, is in the state of Himachal Pradesh a few miles
(kilometers) across the state border of Jammu-Kashmir, where
militants have become more active.
	   It was the fourth multiple killing attributed to Kashmiri
militants in just over a week. The previous attacks left 20 people
dead and five others wounded.
	   Those killings took place in mountain villages in the Udhampur
district of Kashmir, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from where
Sunday's massacre took place.
	   Islamic militants are fighting for an independent homeland or
for a merger with India's Islamic neighbor Pakistan. Mainly Hindu
India accuses Pakistan of providing material and men to the
insurgency in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. Pakistan
says it only gives moral and political support to the movement.
	   The two nations have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir
since they became independent from British rulers in 1947.
	   The separatist insurgency that erupted in 1989 has been centered
in the Kashmir Valley, where most residents are Muslim. Under
pressure from the military, the separatists have been striking more
often in the Hindu-populated area of southern Jammu-Kashmir, said
Major General P.P.S Bindra, the army commander in Udhampur.
	   On Saturday, the military announced a new offensive against the
guerrillas. The army said it would deploy heavy reinforcements
along the disputed border with Pakistan, draft new battalions for
anti-insurgency operations and speed up plans to arm villagers
against insurgents in vulnerable areas, officials said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strong earthquake caused widespread
but minor damage to buildings and houses, and aftershocks continued
to frighten residents in a central Philippine town, officials said
Monday.
	   No casualties were reported in the magnitude 5.7 quake, which
struck the island province of Masbate at dawn Sunday, knocking
objects off shelves and cutting off power, officials said.
	   The quake was centered at sea about 13 kilometers (8 miles)
northeast of the fishing town of Masbate, and was caused by a
movement in the Philippine Fault, which runs along the country's
eastern coast, seismologists said.
	   A Masbate town official said an initial inspection showed some
buildings, including some schools and many houses, had developed
cracks, and a few may have to be declared unsafe. A slab of cement
fell from a building during the quake but no one was hurt, another
official said.
	   Officials said bridges and other public works would also be
inspected.
	   An official of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology in Masbate town said eight aftershocks followed the
earthquake Sunday and three more occurred Monday, causing a deluge
of calls to her office from alarmed town residents.
	   The Philippines is located in one of the most earthquake-prone
regions in the world.

German opposition calls for abandoning atomic energy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Warning against ``economic
recklessness,'' Germany's atomic energy industry Monday attacked
plans by the Social Democrats to start closing nuclear power plants
if they succeed in unseating Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   PreussenElektra chief Hans-Dieter Harig told the Bild newspaper
that he would seek ``not insignificant'' damages from the federal
government if the Social Democrats start ordering the early closure
of the country's 19 atomic power plants.
	   ``More than a third of the power is produced in German atomic
power plants,'' he said. ``We can't just suddenly do without that.
It would be economic recklessness to shut down atomic power plants
before the end of their technical and economic lifespan.''
	   According to this week's Der Spiegel newsmagazine, if the Social
Democrats win the Sept. 27 parliamentary elections, they plan to
order the six oldest atomic power plants closed by 2002 and the
last by 2028.
	   The party's environmental policy spokesman in parliament,
Michael Mueller, said recent reports of radiation leaks during
atomic waste transports demonstrated that a basic condition is
lacking for atomic energy _ the safe disposal of the waste.
	   ``The atomic power plants are like a jumbo jet that's in the air
without a landing strip having been built,'' he told German radio.

Death toll from floods rises to 52; about 50 still missing

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES death toll to 52, ADDS details &QL; 
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Fresh rains turned mountain streams
into raging torrents Monday, hampering the search for 50 people
known missing in floods in South Korea. The death toll rose to 52
as more bodies were recovered.
	   As rescuers probed downstream river bottoms, they confronted
grim scenes from South Korea's worst natural disaster in years:
Three children trapped and killed in a submerged car; the bodies of
a grandmother and a 7-year-old boy tangled in flood debris.
	   President Kim Dae-jung urged 42,000 soldiers, police and
firefighters to step up their search and rescue efforts, and
praised them for heroism.
	   One firefighter was critically injured Monday when a helicopter
heading for the disaster scene was buffeted by a sudden rain shower
and crashed in a rice paddy. Another rescuer drowned Sunday after
jumping into a surging stream to save others.
	   Relief operations centered around scenic Mount Chiri National
Park, where all but eight of the dead and missing were lost or
stranded by floods triggered by heavy rains Saturday.
	   Rescuers, aided by helicopters, cranes and other heavy
machinery, cleared a path through landslides and reached deeper
into the park, where dozens of campers were still believed
stranded. They later used ropes and pulleys to bring 35 college
students across raging torrents to safety.
	   Officials expected the number of deaths to rise as more families
reported missing relatives.
	   ``Many people call to report missing people. But we don't count
all of them in our list because some families don't know where
their relatives went on vacation,'' said Lim Jae-woon, a Home
Ministry official.
	   A front moving east from China dumped up to 30 centimeters (12
inches) of rain in less than three hours early Saturday, engulfing
hundreds of sleeping campers in flash floods in the park 220
kilometers (135 miles) south of Seoul.
	   Police said whole families camping along normally placid streams
were swept away. Some bodies were found washed up on coastal
beaches 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, raising fears that many of
the missing will never be found.
	   ``We are expanding our search further downstream, but our
operations are slow because of occasional heavy rains. Upstream,
it's almost impossible to venture into those wild streams,'' said
Kwon Ki-hwan, an official at the government's Disaster Relief
Headquarters.
	   TV footage showed flood-swept camping sites littered with
crumpled tents, overturned cars and other debris. Family members
searched hospital morgues for missing relatives.
	   Local news media were filled with harrowing tales from
survivors. A father disappeared under floodwaters after helping his
7-year-old son cling for hours to a tree branch while friends
worked feverishly to build a makeshift bridge to the pair. The son
was saved.
	   Another man pulled two children from a flooded ravine, then was
swept away himself by the swirling waters.
	   As of Monday, 1,600 marooned people had been rescued from the
national park, police said.
	   Also Monday, President Kim ordered the Cabinet to revamp the
nation's disaster warning system. Saturday's rains had not been
forecast by the National Weather Service.
	   The downpours submerged homes and farmland, washed away roads
and triggered landslides. As communications with remote areas were
restored, property damage estimates climbed to dlrs 60 million
Monday.

Suharto relative linked to investigation of kidnappings of
</HEADLINE>
activists &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government critic saying former president should
be held responsible &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A son-in-law of former President
Suharto will be investigated in connection with the kidnappings of
political activists, the Indonesian military said Monday.
	   The Suharto relative, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, was in charge
of Indonesia's special forces, which have been implicated in the
abductions of government opponents since last year.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions and have called for investigations of
Prabowo and other senior officials.
	   Under new, reform-minded President B.J. Habibie, the military
has pledged to pursue officers implicated in human rights abuses
that have tarnished its reputation.
	   A prominent government critic, Amien Rais, said Suharto should
be held accountable for the kidnappings, which occurred while he
was still in power. The authoritarian leader quit in May amid
political turmoil.
	   ``There are others who also have to take the responsibility,
clearly Suharto,'' Rais said at a forum in Jakarta.
	   Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, said military
investigators will examine whether Prabowo, as well as another
general and an officer, were involved. He also said 10
lower-ranking soldiers arrested in the case will be tried in a
military court.
	   ``Honestly, (the armed forces) will investigate the mistakes
made by individuals,'' Wiranto said at a news conference at the
Defense Ministry. A council of seven generals will handle the
probe.
	   Activists who were kidnapped and later released said they were
held in cells while being tortured and questioned about their
political activities. At least 14 are still missing.
	   Prabowo has said he is ready to take responsibility for the
kidnappings, which occurred before Suharto quit after 32 years in
power.
	   Soon after Suharto resigned amid riots and student protests,
Wiranto transferred Prabowo to a less prestigious post in Bandung
in what was seen as the removal of a rival. He has been placed on
leave pending the result of the investigation.
	   The ambitious and brash Prabowo is a controversial figure whose
fast-rising career was sidelined by the sudden downfall of his
father-in-law.
	   At his news conference, Wiranto also said Indonesia was safe
again for tourists and investments in the wake of the political
turmoil that led to Suharto's downfall. However, fears of more
unrest linger because Indonesia's economic crisis is pushing
millions into poverty.

Thai government approves 25 measures to stimulate economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government approved 25
measures Monday to stimulate the economy and stop its steady slide
into recession despite billions of dollars in bailout money from
the International Monetary Fund.
	   The unveiling of the package came on the first day of talks with
an IMF team visiting Bangkok for a quarterly review of its rescue
program.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern
times.
	   The measures approved Monday include pumping dlrs 600 million
into the agricultural sector, spending dlrs 122 million to
restructure the country's manufacturing base and allowing the
government to run a deficit equivalent to 3.5 percent of gross
domestic product.
	   The Finance Ministry will be responsible for obtaining funding
from bond issues or international agencies for many of the
projects.
	   More than 60 percent of Thais work in agriculture, and the
government is counting on the sector to soak up workers laid off in
construction and manufacturing. Unemployment is expected to climb
to 2.8 million from around 1 million last year.
	   It was burgeoning manufacturing relying on cheap labor that
fueled Thailand's 1985-95 economic boom. The manufacturing package
is designed to improve production efficiency and the skills of Thai
labor, develop small- and medium-scale industry, and relocate
industrial plants from Bangkok to the provinces to improve wealth
distribution.
	   Thailand's boom went bust when the central bank depleted foreign
reserves in a failed defense of the country's currency, the baht,
which lost more than 30 percent of its value after being floated in
July 1997.
	   The baht float also triggered attacks on other Asian currencies,
and economic problems roiled across the continent, deeply affecting
Indonesia and South Korea.
	   All three hardest-hit nations were forced to seek IMF bailouts.
	   Although the government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has
adhered to the austerity measures required by the IMF package,
Thailand's economy has yet to rebound.
	   Government Spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said the government will
be allowed to run a budget deficit equivalent to 1.5 percent of
GDP, while the state enterprise investment budget will be in
deficit up to 2 percent.
	   Although the IMF had demanded that Thailand post a budget
surplus of 1 percent of GDP, the agency has relaxed its
requirements.
	   The IMF agreed that it was time to stimulate the economy after
the baht stabilized at around 40-42 to the dollar during the second
quarter of 1998, and the economy was sinking more deeply into
recession than anticipated.
	   An IMF projection for a 1998 contraction in GDP of 4 to 5.5
percent is expected to be revised toward 6-7 percent.
	   The Finance Ministry also said Monday it will make public a
rescue plan for the banking and finance sector on Aug. 15.
	   Four Thai banks have been taken over by the government and 56
insolvent finance companies shut down in the wake of the economic
crisis.

Iranian president outlines economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iran-Khatami's First Year &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami has called for
reducing government monopolies on goods and services, eliminating
the red tape holding back foreign investment and cutting the
country's reliance on oil revenues.
	   The moderate cleric, who took office one year ago, said Iran's
``sick'' economy has suffered from several decades of mismanagement
and needs fundamental changes, such as reducing government
intervention.
	   He outlined his long-awaited economic proposals in a speech
broadcast on state radio late Sunday. The remarks were reported
Monday in the Iran News.
	   In his speech, Khatami also called for full implementation of
Islamic banking principles, which forbid interest payments, and
scheduled repayment of Iran's foreign debt, estimated at around
dlrs 15 billion.
	   The paper quoted him as saying that high unemployment and
inflation had cut into the public's purchasing power. Meanwhile, he
said, dependence on oil revenues, a shortage of capital, cumbersome
laws hindering investment and lack of competitiveness were hurting
development.
	   Iran and other Gulf oil producers have been grappling with
rising budget deficits because of low world prices for oil, a main
source of government revenues.
	   Khatami said that despite the economic problems, the government
would maintain subsidies on basic commodities such as rice, cooking
oil and meat.
	   The president also reiterated a commitment to reducing the gap
between rich and poor, a cherished tenet of the 1979 Islamic
revolution, the paper said.
	   Khatami said social justice would prevail over development if a
choice had to me made between the two, it added.
	   Khatami acknowledged that he was unable to give full attention
to economic policy during his first year in office because of
political distractions. Khatami, a reformist, has been involved in
a power struggle with Iran's powerful hard-line clerics since his
elections last year.

Taiwan reportedly fired missile interceptors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan has successfully test fired a
missile interceptor, part of its defense buildup against Chinese
missile attacks, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The ATBM anti-missile system, developed by Taiwan's military-run
Chinese Institute of Science and Technology, was test fired two
weeks ago, the China Times quoted unidentified military officials
as saying.
	   The radar-guided interceptor, a conversion of the locally
developed Tien Kung surface-to-air missile, successfully
intercepted a target missile off a base in southern Pingtung, it
said.
	   It said the military would further improve the speed of the
interceptor for use against China's M-type missiles when the ATBM
is deployed in two years.
	   The Defense Ministry refused to comment on the report, which
said Taiwan was the first nation in Asia to have home-developed
anti-missile defense capability.
	   Taiwan has placed orders for 200 PAC-2 missiles, an upgraded
version of the Patriots used by U.S. forces against Iraqi Scuds
during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   China test-fired the M-type missiles into waters near the island
in 1995 and 1996 in response to a Taiwanese campaign to gain
international recognition.
	   China claims Taiwan is a renegade province, and threatens to use
force to bring the island back into the fold.

Serbs press attacks in Kosovo after vowing that offensive is over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serbs reportedly overrunning another KLA
village; Albanians reporting continued fighting; TRIMS outdated
material; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces overran another
ethnic Albanian stronghold Monday and pressed their attacks
elsewhere in Kosovo despite Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
pledge that the offensive was over.
	   Serb military sources said police entered Smonica early Monday
after shelling the village near the Albanian border for days. The
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least a dozen
Kovoso Liberation Army fighters were killed.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued Monday to lay siege to
another border village, Junik. Independent media in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade said most KLA fighters had slipped out of the
village for sanctuaries in nearby Albania, leaving a few dozen
insurgents who have encircled their positions with land mines.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. But Albanian
sources said fighting was continuing Monday in at least three areas
of the rebellious province, scenes of heavy clashes during the
weekend.
	   During the weekend, government forces systematically targeted
homes of Albanian civilians, driving them away by gunfire and then
torching and looting the abandoned dwellings.
	   The campaign to drive Albanian civilians from their homes is
reminiscent of ``ethnic cleansing'' _ the forcible removal of rival
ethnic groups that marked conflicts in the former Yugoslav
republics of Bosnia and Croatia earlier this decade.
	   On Sunday, the KLA said Serb police shelled about 13 ethnic
Albanian villages in the Drenica region west of Pristina, forcing
civilians to flee for their lives and then setting their houses on
fire.
	   Eight Albanians were reported killed, the Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center said Sunday. Serb sources said two policemen
were killed and two others wounded in fighting at Prilep near the
Albanian border.
	   Witnesses said police used 20-millimeter antiaircraft guns to
fire on Albanian houses in the Prilep fighting.
	   The clashes occurred just three days after Milosevic told a
European Union delegation that the offensive, which began July 24,
was over. He later assured U.S. envoy Christopher Hill that tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians displaced by the fighting could
return to their homes and international relief organizations could
assist them.
	   But in Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party
courted by the United States accused the Serb-led Yugoslav
government of trying ``to make it impossible for thousands of
Albanians to return to their homes.''
	   The statement was issued by the Albanian Democratic Movement,
whose leader, Mehmet Hajrizi, has been mentioned as a key figure in
a planned Albanian team that U.S. diplomats hope can negotiate the
future of the majority Albanian province with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has promised to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
canceled in 1989. But he and major world powers oppose independence
for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in the province
by 9-to-1.
	   Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics that make up the remainder of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and European nations fear independence could
lead to demands by Albanian-speaking communities in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, to establish a ``Greater
Albania'' in the southern Balkans.
	   KLA leaders are expected to announce this week whether they will
accept a U.S. plan for Albanian politicians to enter peace talks
with Milosevic. The current Serb offensive appears designed to
deliver a strong blow against the rebels and force them to
negotiate from a position of weakness.
	   In a lengthy commentary Sunday, the government's Tanjug news
agency said the ``efficient action'' by Serb forces had ``almost
entirely broken down terrorist gangs of the so-called Liberation
Army of Kosovo.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Responding to opposition complaints,
Cambodia's election commission said Monday it had agreed to recount
votes from certain areas in last week's general election.
	   But the procedure still had not begun 1 1/2 hours after it was
scheduled, with no explanation for the delay.
	   It was not even clear whether there would be an actual recount
of votes, or merely a reconciliation of locally compiled tallies
with provincial totals announced by the National Election
Committee.
	   A reconciliation would be unlikely to satisfy opposition demands
for votes to be recounted from areas where it had alleged fraud in
voting or ballot-counting.
	   As of Monday afternoon, preliminary totals for half of the
country's 23 electoral districts had yet to be released.
	   Results announced so far for 11 provinces show Co-Premier Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party leading in all but three of them.
	   One of the two districts captured by the opposition FUNCINPEC
party was the central province of Kampong Cham, the country's
biggest constituency, with 18 of the National Assembly's 122 seats.
	   FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Monday that an
offer by Hun Sen _ the apparent winner of the July 26 election _ to
form a coalition government would not be considered until after
ballots in disputed areas were recounted.
	   ``We have to wait for the final decision because counting and
recounting are delayed. It's better to wait a few more days,''
Ranariddh said after returning from a weekend trip to Bangkok,
Thailand.
	   Ranariddh, who was ousted by Hun Sen as the country's co-premier
in a coup last year, denied rumors that members of his party had
already met with Hun Sen's party to discuss the proposed
partnership.
	   Over the weekend, Hun Sen called for the speedy formation of a
new government so Cambodia would win back its seat at the United
Nations.
	   The seat has remained vacant since last year's coup.
	   The National Election Committee has not yet announced how votes
won by the parties would translate into parliamentary seats. But a
projection by the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia, an independent election monitoring group, gives the
Cambodian People's Party 64 seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and the Sam Rainsy
Party 15.
	   A spokesman for the committee said Monday he hoped preliminary
tallies would be completed for all districts Tuesday or Wednesday,
but that the committee had not yet received all documentation from
two provinces, Battambang and Rattanakiri.
	   The spokesman, Im Suordei, also defended the committee's
decision to change the formula for allocating parliamentary seats
based on the vote, saying that it was approved and circulated well
before the election.
	   The change in formula, which was not widely publicized until
late last week, favors the top vote-getting party in any particular
province.
	   In practice, this would work to the advantage of the ruling
party, and is significant because it could provide that party with
enough extra seats _ over the original formula _ to attain a
parliamentary majority.
	   Im Suordei did not explain why the change had been made, other
than to say the allocation was ``done in the highest mathematical
way, a very scientific one.''
	   There was no ``political intention, it is technical work,'' he
said.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   The opposition parties have asked for a recount in areas where
they suspect irregularities.
	   They also asked that new votes be taken in disputed precincts if
their charges of wrongdoing were found valid, and threatened to
boycott the National Assembly if their complaints were not heeded.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.
	   Hun Sen responded by inviting the opposition to join a coalition
government, but warning that if they carried out their threat not
to attend the assembly, he could lower the constitutional minimum
for the assembly to meet and confirm a government from two-thirds
to 50 percent plus one. He also said his current government could
simply remain in power.

Forest fire sends cloud over Athens

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 150 firefighters struggled
Monday to control a wind-whipped forest fire that threatened a
German World War II cemetery and sent a cloud of reddish smoke over
central Athens.
	   The blaze began late Sunday at the foot of a mountain about four
kilometers (2 1/2 miles) northeast of Athens' northern suburbs,
officials said.
	   Four planes and a Chinook helicopter assisted 155 firefighters
battling the blaze as it swept towards the village of Rapentosa and
a cemetery for German soldiers killed during World War II.
	   No injuries due to the fire were reported. Blazes in the area in
past years have left much of the mountainside a landscape of
charred stumps.
	   Several other fires also raged around Greece, with a blaze on
the 2,900-meter (9,570-foot) Mount Olympus in northern Greece
entering its third week. The fire on the legendary home of the
ancient gods has destroyed 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) of forest
so far, local media reported.
	   Two weeks ago, three firefighters and a volunteer firefighter
were killed battling a blaze that scorched the eastern edge of
Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades, with fires burning daily for the past month.

Taiwan reportedly fired missile interceptors

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan has successfully test fired a
missile interceptor, part of its defense buildup against Chinese
missile attacks, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The ATBM anti-missile system, developed by Taiwan's military-run
Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, was test fired two
weeks ago, the China Times quoted unidentified military officials
as saying.
	   The radar-guided interceptor, a conversion of the locally
developed Tien Kung surface-to-air missile, successfully
intercepted a target missile off a base in southern Pingtung, it
said.
	   It said the military would further improve the speed of the
interceptor for use against China's M-type missiles when the ATBM
is deployed in two years.
	   The Defense Ministry refused to comment on the report, which
said Taiwan was the first nation in Asia to have home-developed
anti-missile defense capability.
	   Taiwan has placed orders for 200 PAC-2 missiles, an upgraded
version of the Patriots used by U.S. forces against Iraqi Scuds
during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   China test-fired the M-type missiles into waters near the island
in 1995 and 1996 in response to a Taiwanese campaign to gain
international recognition.
	   China claims Taiwan is a renegade province, and threatens to use
force to bring the island back into the fold.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Uzbekistan has cut gas supplies to its Central
Asian neighbor, Kyrgyzstan, citing an overdue bill of dlrs 2.5
million, a news report said Monday.
	   The cutoff was affecting Kyrgyzstan's capital, Dushanbe, and
other northern regions of the country, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The government in Kyrgyzstan, a small, mountainous agricultural
nation, held an emergency meeting Monday to try to solve the
problem, the report said.
	   Kyrgyzstan has been unable to make payments because it needed
extra money to cope with a series of floods in the south of the
country during the spring, officials told Interfax.

Police report increase of crime in Singapore

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Crime increased in Singapore in the first half
of the year, continuing a worsening trend in the affluent, tightly
run island republic that has prided itself on low crime and safe
streets, television reported Monday.
	   The report, citing official statistics, said the biggest
increase came in violent crime, with 12 more murders in
January-June than in the same period last year, while rape jumped
by 30 percent.
	   The worsening trend in violent crime trend began last year. In
1997, the number of murders jumped by 23 percent, to 38 cases from
31 the previous year. The number of rape cases rose by 4 percent,
from 99 to 103.
	   Only 15 murders and 61 rapes committed in 1997 were solved.
	   Housebreaking, car theft and robbery have marginally increased
between January and June 1998.
	   Police are focusing on the crimes that have significantly
increased, officer Khoo Boon Hui was quoted as saying.

Israel displays anti-missile missile for first time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel put the Arrow anti-missile
missile it is developing jointly with the United States on display
for the first time Monday.
	   An orange-and-black nose cone peeked out of a cluster of six
gray tubes that pointed skyward from a mobile launcher at the Tel
Aviv Fair Grounds. A sign described the system as the ``defense
wall of Israel.''
	   The Arrow was deployed for the first time as part of a Jubilee
exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of Israel's founding.
	   Brig. Gen. Zion Sapir gave reporters a tour of the military
exhibit and estimated that the Arrow would be deployed within two
years.
	   The Arrow system, which was originally scheduled to become
operational this year, is scheduled for a further test firing this
fall, officials said.
	   The United States has so far contributed about dlrs 250 million
toward the joint U.S.-Israeli program, which is intended to defend
against Scud missile attacks like those Iraq unleashed on Israel in
the Persian Gulf War.
	   Total system costs are estimated at dlrs 1.6 billion, with the
United States picking up two-thirds of the tab.
	   In March, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen announced the
United States would help pay for a third anti-missile defense
battery in Israel because of ``growing missile proliferation'' in
the Middle East.
	   Last month, Iran successfully tested a Shihab 3 missile capable
of reaching Israel.
	   Also on display for the first time Monday was the Gil antitank
rocket, a television-guided weapon with a range of 2.5 kilometers
(1.5 miles), and the Tabor, or Bull Pup, assault rifle that is
lighter and shorter than its predecessors.

Georgian president wants Russian peacekeepers to stay in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's president said Monday he
favored keeping Russian peacekeepers in the country's breakaway
Abkhazia region.
	   The peacekeeping force's mandate to monitor the region expired
July 31. It can be extended by a vote of leaders of all the
countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), but
Georgia has ultimate control over whether the troops stay or leave.
	   If Russian peacekeepers leave Abkhazia, ``certain forcers might
attempt to again drag Georgia into a full-scale war,'' Georgian
president Eduard Shevardnadze said in a Monday radio address.
	   ``I think it is unreasonable to withdraw Russian peacekeepers
unless the question of their replacement is cleared up,'' he said.
	   The Russian peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea
province of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war in which Abkhazian
separatists drove out Georgian government troops. Sporadic violence
keeps tensions in the region high.
	   Shevardnadze has often criticized the Russian troops for not
doing enough to help ethnic Georgian refugees move back into
Abkhazia. But he said the Russian troops were needed to maintain
safety for thousands of refugees beginning to return home.
	   More than 40,000 ethnic Georgians fled Abkhazia's Ghali region
during fighting in May between separatists and pro-government
militants.
	   The United Nations agreed last week to keep unarmed military
observers in Georgia for another six months and urged both sides in
the conflict to continue negotiating for a long-term peace.

Most Asian stock markets close sharply lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Monday, with the key index tumbling 4.8 percent in Hong Kong
because of bad news both from abroad and at home.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 383.43 points, closing at 7,552.77. The loss
followed drops of 3.89 percent last week and more than 4 percent
the previous week.
	   Traders blamed a sharp fall Friday on Wall Street, the weakness
of the Japanese yen resulting from uncertainties about the new
government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, and concerns about the
domestic economy.
	   The U.S. dollar hit a seven-week high of 145 yen Monday in Asia.
The Dow fell 143.66 points on Friday.
	   After the market closed, the Hong Kong government reported that
the economy shrank by 2.8 percent in the first quarter, revising an
earlier estimate of a 2.0 percent contraction.
	   Giant HSBC Holdings, Hong Kong's leading bank, also announced
that its net profit fell 16 percent to U.S. dlrs 2.40 billion in
the first half of this year. HSBC accounts for a third of the
weight of Hong Kong's benchmark stock index.
	   Philippine shares also closed sharply lower, pulled down by
Friday's fall on Wall Street and the weakening Japanese currency.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks closed
down 64.54 points, or 4 percent, at 1,543.07.
	   The Malaysian market was battered mainly by the selling of
shares by local banks to recover some of their loans, dealers said.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 16.38
points, or 4.1 percent, closing at 386.27.
	   In Tokyo, share prices fell on profit-taking. The 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average lost 213.89 points, or 1.31 percent, closing
at 16,165.08.
	   In the previous four trading days, the Nikkei index had gained a
total of 434.61 points, or 2.8 percent, including Friday's gain of
177.37 points, or 1.09 percent.
	   Major bank issues and brokerage stocks were sold amid renewed
worries about the health of Japan's banking system, which is
saddled with huge bad debts left from a collapsed bubble of real
estate speculation in the early 1990s.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 145.64 yen, up
1.86 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
rate of 144.65 yen on Friday.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower amid concerns over the
future of the country's banking and finance sector. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand Index fell 5.83 points, or 2.2 percent, to
260.89.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower in reaction to the falling
Japanese currency. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 8.02
points, or 2.4 percent, to 329.47.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, although the fall
in the index wasn't as severe as some had feared after Friday's
losses on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries Index fell 30.8 points,
or 1.13 percent, to 2,673.8.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower amid lingering concerns over
regional economies. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index
fell 23.64 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,599.04.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers
saying the market suffered from falls on overseas markets and a
rise in local short-term interest rates. The NZSE-40 Capital Index
fell 18.26 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,104.05.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mixed, but the key index rose on
last-minute institutional buying in index-linked stocks. The
Straits Times Industrials Index rose 10.56 points, or 1.0 percent,
to 1,074.76.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower in line with regional
markets. The Composite Index fell 6.459 points, or 1.3 percent, to
475.258.

Butler meets Iraqi officials on weapons inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Aziz criticism of Butler, PIKS UP As usual, 16th
graf. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos staffing &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi official on Monday accused chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler of ``serving the American
policy'' by trying to prolong punishing trade sanctions on Iraq.
	   Using unusually harsh language, Iraq's deputy prime minister,
Tariq Aziz, told reporters after a three-hour session with Butler
that the U.N. Special Commission was ``back to its old games, to
its old tricks.''
	   The commission, which Butler heads, is responsible for ensuring
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as
required by U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that trade sanctions _
including a ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will
not be lifted until the commission ensures the weaponry has been
destroyed.
	   Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's headway in
eliminating its weaponry and, instead, focusing on ``minor issues
which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   He concluded: ``Since this is the wish of the American
administration to perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current
situation, to keep the sanctions on the people of Iraq .... as long
as this is the American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American
policy.''
	   Butler did not hear Aziz's remarks and, when asked about them,
said only that ``work is in progress.''
	   On Sunday, Butler had told reporters: ``Our steadfast aim is to
get this done as soon as possible to get to the end of the
disarmament phase so the Security Council can consider the
sanctions issue.''
	   The two sides were to meet again later Monday for further talks.
	   Neither Aziz or Butler gave specifics on what was discussed at
the morning session, but the ``blueprint'' Butler presented the
Iraqis during his last visit in June calls for further disclosures
about the country's missile program as well as biological and
chemical weaponry.
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''
	   Aziz is under pressure to produce results during the current
talks, which are to conclude Wednesday.
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year -- the
first time he had set a deadline. That statement later was endorsed
by the Revolutionary Command Council, which is Iraq's collective
leadership.
	   Iraq's Parliament was to meet Monday to discuss the weapons
inspections and sanctions but delayed the special session until
Thursday to discuss the results of Butler's visit, Parliament
officials said.
	   Iraq says the sanctions have caused widespread suffering among
its 22 million people.
	   As usual, Iraqi newspapers excoriated Butler in their editorials
on Monday.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of Saddam's ruling Baath party, said
Butler was no longer the representative of an international
organization but ``a man who implements American policies against
Iraq.''
	   Iraq has long accused the United States and Britain of
needlessly prolonging the trade sanctions.
	   Al-Thawra accused the United States of ``igniting a series of
dangerous crises,'' including a standoff earlier this year over
Iraq's refusal to open presidential sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   The United States and Britain sent warplanes and ships to the
Gulf, threatening military action to force Iraq to cooperate. The
crisis was defused in a February agreement negotiated by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The paper called Butler's commission ``not credible'' and
accused him of making statements in Iraq suggesting there was
progress in disarmament, then telling the U.N. Security Council
there were problems.
	   The state-run Al-Jumhuriya repeated allegations that depleted
uranium warheads used by U.S. forces in the Gulf War had poisoned
Iraq's environment. The government says the chemicals have
contributed to birth defects and higher rates of cancer.
	   In an unusual claim, it also accused the Americans of trying to
sabotage Iraq's grain output with rodents.
	   ``Iraqis noticed an unusual increase of mice and rats in Iraq,
which led them to think that this is (the result of) an organized
operation by a foreign side, represented by the American officers
and spies working at the Special Commission,'' Al-Jumhuriya said.
	   It termed the pest problem ``biological warfare'' against Iraq.

Serbs press attacks in Kosovo after vowing that offensive is over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbs reportedly overrunning another KLA village;
Albanians reporting continued fighting; TRIMS outdated material &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces overran another
ethnic Albanian stronghold Monday and pressed their attacks
elsewhere in the separatist Kosovo province.
	   Serb military sources said police entered Smonica early Monday
after shelling the village near the Albanian border for days. The
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least a dozen
rebel fighters were killed.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued to lay siege to another
border village, Junik. Independent media in the Yugoslav capital
Belgrade said most Kovoso Liberation Army fighters had slipped out
of the village for sanctuaries in nearby Albania, leaving a few
dozen insurgents who have encircled their positions with land
mines.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. But Albanian
sources said fighting continued Monday in at least three areas of
the rebellious province, scenes of heavy clashes during the
weekend.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told a European Union
delegation Thursday that the government's latest offensive against
separatists in the Kosovo province was over.
	   However, over the weekend, government forces systematically
targeted homes of Albanian civilians, driving them away with
gunfire and then torching and looting the abandoned dwellings.
	   The campaign to drive Albanian civilians from their homes is
reminiscent of ``ethnic cleansing'' _ the forcible removal of rival
ethnic groups that marked conflicts in the former Yugoslav
republics of Bosnia and Croatia earlier this decade.
	   Milosevic has promised to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
canceled in 1989. But he and major world powers oppose independence
for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1.
	   Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics that make up the remainder of Yugoslavia.
	   On Sunday, the KLA said Serb police shelled about 13 ethnic
Albanian villages in the Drenica region west of Pristina, forcing
civilians to flee for their lives and then setting their houses on
fire.
	   Eight Albanians were reported killed, the Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center said Sunday. Serb sources said two policemen
were killed and two others wounded in fighting at Prilep near the
Albanian border.
	   On Friday, Milosevic assured U.S. envoy Christopher Hill that
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians displaced by the fighting
could return to their homes and international relief organizations
could assist them.
	   In Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party accused
the Serb-led Yugoslav government of trying ``to make it impossible
for thousands of Albanians to return to their homes.''
	   The statement was issued by the Albanian Democratic Movement,
whose leader, Mehmet Hajrizi, has been mentioned as a key figure in
a planned Albanian team that U.S. diplomats hope can negotiate
Kosovo's future with Milosevic.
	   KLA leaders are expected to announce this week whether they will
accept a U.S. plan for Albanian politicians to enter peace talks
with Milosevic. The current Serb offensive appears designed to
deliver a strong blow against the rebels and force them to
negotiate from a position of weakness.

Breathing problems force tracheotomy for Czech president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
underwent a tracheotomy Monday to fix a lung problem that developed
after he was taken off a respirator.
	   A tracheotomy is routine surgery during which a small artifical
hole is made in the throat to facilitate breathing.
	   Havel had been taken off a respirator on Sunday. There was no
immediate word on how the latest procedure, which began around
midday, was faring.
	   ``Last night a small inflammation occurred in the right lung,
and we have decided to perform a tracheotomy after all,'' Miroslav
Cerbak, the head of Havel's medical team, told Czech radio.
	   Havel had abdominal surgery July 26 designed to restore his
digestive tract following the ruptured colon he suffered in April.
	   That operation was declared successful, but Havel's overall
recovery is hindered by breathing problems.
	   ``The president suffered a renewed attack of atelectasis in the
right lung, accompanied by mild fever,'' an official statment from
the medical team said.
	   Atelectasis means the lung has collapsed, fails to perform
properly and bring enough oxygen into the patient's bloodstream.
	   The 61-year-old president, formerly a chain smoker has been
hospitalized five times since December 1996, when he had a third of
his lung and a tumor removed.
	   According to doctors Havel will need six to eight weeks before
he can return to office. He is scheduled for an official visit to
the United States in September.

Gunfire rings though Kinshasa army barracks

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Gunfire and rumors echoed through Congo's
capital of Kinshasa early Monday morning as rival soldiers clashed
in a military barracks and the government ordered the population
off the streets.
	   The sound of gunfire could be heard from Camp Kokolo military
base on Kinshasa's west side. It was not immediately clear who was
fighting, although tensions have been escalating in recent days
between troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila and his one-time
Rwandan allies.
	   Kabila last week ordered all Rwandan soldiers out of his
country, but did not elaborate on the reason. Rwandan troops played
an important role last year in helping Kabila oust longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The country's finance minister, who was arrested last week and
then released, said he was questioned about whether Rwandan
soldiers still in Kinshasa had been planning a coup against Kabila.
	   ``I was questioned about rumors of a putsch attempt,'' said
former Finance Minister Ferdinand Tala-Ngai.
	   Kabila has been growing anxious about the presence of Rwandan
forces in Kinshasa and weeks before ordering them to leave he
increased security around government buildings.
	   Tanks were deployed in front of the presidential residence and
office compound while troops were stationed at key ministry
buildings.
	   The sound of fighting Monday triggered an order by the
government to clear the streets.
	   ``The government asks the people of Congo and those foreigners
here in the country to stay calm and to stay at home until order is
restored,'' said an abrupt announcement Monday morning on
state-controlled People's Radio. ``Stay at home just until that
time when the armed forces of Congo reestablish civil order.''
	   Shops throughout the capital remained closed Monday morning and
people who had headed downtown for work early in the morning were
quickly returning home.
	   Speculation was rife over the stability of Kabila's government
after weeks of growing tension between the president, his top
advisers and what now appears to be a shaky military alliance with
neighboring Rwanda.
	   In eastern Congo, meanwhile, a spokesman for a breakaway ethnic
group urged the people to oust Kabila.
	   ``We've taken the decision to no longer recognize the government
of Laurent Kabila,'' said the spokesman, who identified himself
only as Andre. ``We don't want to separate from Congo, but Kabila
must be removed from power.''
	   In a statement delivered to The Associated Press and the Voice
of America, Andre said his group, representing Banyamulenge ethnic
Tutsis, was in control of most of Kivu province.
	   Kivu has been the scene of ongoing unrest for months.

East Timor rebel leader vows to fight as peace talks due to start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rebels struggling for independence for
East Timor say they will continue to fight Indonesian troops
despite fresh diplomatic efforts to bring peace to the troubled
territory.
	   ``We've never lost hope. We will stand firm. We'll fight on
until the independence of East Timor is won,'' guerrilla commander
Taur Matan Ruak said in an interview released by Associated Press
Television on Monday.
	   Ruak took command of rebel forces earlier this year in Timor's
mountainous interior, where several hundred rebels have waged a
hit-and-run war since Indonesian troops invaded in 1975.
	   However, the Indonesian military says there have been no clashes
in more than two months. It estimates the number of rebels at about
200.
	   Ruak's words of defiance came ahead of talks between the foreign
ministers of Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's former colonial
master, to be held at the United Nations in New York Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   Discussion at the meeting, to be chaired by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, is expected to be dominated by an
offer from Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to grant a form of
autonomy, but not outright independence, to East Timor.
	   Habibie replaced former autocratic leader Suharto as president
in May.
	   Suharto ordered Indonesia's 1975 invasion and annexed East Timor
as Indonesia's 27th province the following year.
	   U.N. officials hope that the change in Indonesia's leadership
will lead to a breakthrough for East Timor, a half-island territory
about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   In a gesture of good will, Indonesia withdrew about 400 of its
12,000 troops from the territory last week. Another 600 are
scheduled to leave this month.
	   However, Ruak described the partial pullout as ``possibly just a
publicity stunt.''
	   ``Until now, Indonesians have never shown good faith when it
comes to withdrawing their troops,'' he said.
	   Instead, he called for U.N. supervision of troop withdrawals.
	   ``It would be better for Indonesia to accept the presence of the
United Nations and U.N. observers, and that the withdrawal was done
under their supervision. It shouldn't be left to the Indonesians
alone,'' he said.
	   Ruak welcomed greater political freedoms granted by Habibie but
indicated they would not be enough to solve East Timor's conflict.
	   ``You can see there are still political prisoners throughout
Indonesia and East Timor. There are still many problems to resolve,
but we should be very happy with the amount of freedom of
expression, freedom of association and a free press decreed by
Habibie,'' he said.

Nine cases of anthrax in Kyrgyzstan, village quarantined
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nine villagers from southern Kyrgyzstan have been
hospitalized with anthrax, and their village has been quarantined,
the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
	   The Emergencies Ministry of the former Soviet republic said that
some 300 other residents of a village in the Jalal-Abad region of
the Central Asian country had eaten contaminated beef, Interfax
reported.
	   The bacteria that causes anthrax is common among domesticated
livestock and can be transferred to humans. When it infects, the
bacteria produces a toxin, or poison, that attacks cells.
	   Thorough cooking is believed to kill the bacteria.

Breathing problems force tracheotomy for Czech president

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
underwent a tracheotomy Monday to fix a lung problem that developed

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's leading opposition party
captured the governor's seat in the central state of Aguascalientes
Monday, a victory that gives it fresh momentum heading toward the
2000 presidential race. More than anything, the gubernatorial
contests in Aguascalientes and two other states Sunday underscored
the growing competitiveness of elections in a country where for
decades one party _ the Institutional Revolutionary Party _ easily
won every vote. With two-thirds of the vote counted in
Aguascalientes early Monday, Felipe Gonzalez of National Action was
ahead with 53 percent of the vote, the State Electoral Council
said. (Mexico-Elections)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Gunfire and rumors of government
instability echoed through Congo's capital of Kinshasa early Monday
morning as rival soldiers clashed in a military barracks and the
government ordered the people off the streets. The sound of gunfire
could be heard from Camp Kokolo military base on Kinshasa's west
side. It was not immediately clear who was fighting, although
tensions have been escalating in recent days between troops loyal
to President Laurent Kabila and his one-time Rwandan allies. Kabila
last week ordered all Rwandan soldiers out of his country without
explanation. Rwandan troops played an important role last year in
helping Kabila oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. (Congo)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Suspected Kashmiri separatists shot and
killed 23 sleeping construction workers on a remote mountain road
as part of their ongoing battle to free their predominately Muslim
territory from Indian rule, police said Monday. The attack took
place farther outside Kashmir than any previous separatist attack.
Initial reports said the laborers from a road-widening project were
asleep Sunday when an unknown number of militants burst into their
shed after midnight and sprayed them with gunfire. Six people were
wounded. The killings took place at Kalaban, 15 kilometers (10
miles) from the nearest town, Chamba, said Mohinder Kumar, a police
officer reached in Chamba. (India-Massacre)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the car
crash that killed Princess Diana and two others almost a year ago,
appealed for privacy for all the families involved ``to let us mark
this tragic anniversary in our own way.'' Rees-Jones, who spoke to
APTV, The Associated Press' international video news agency, in a
taped statement released Monday, said he would make no further
public comments until the judicial inquiry into the Aug. 31 Paris
crash concludes. Also killed were driver Henri Paul, who was drunk,
and Dodi Fayed, the son of Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed and
Diana's boyfriend. (Britain-Diana-Bodyguard)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Responding to opposition complaints,
Cambodia's election commission said Monday it had agreed to recount
votes from certain areas in last week's general election. But the
procedure still had not begun 1 1/2 hours after it was scheduled,
with no explanation for the delay. It was not even clear whether
there would be an actual recount of votes, or merely a
reconciliation of locally compiled tallies with provincial totals
announced by the National Election Committee. A reconciliation
would be unlikely to satisfy opposition demands for votes to be
recounted from areas where it had alleged fraud in voting or
ballot-counting. (Cambodia-Election)

Official: SilkAir crash investigation to continue for 6 more

months &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with investigation team's report, RECASTS throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Indonesian-led team investigating the
SilkAir crash in Indonesia last December said Monday it has found
``no indication that air traffic control, weather or maintenance
was a factor in the accident.''
	   Other aspects of investigation, including the examination of
human factors, are continuing, the team said in a statement. It
added that the investigation is likely to continue for the next six
to eight months.
	   Last Dec. 19, a SilkAir Boeing 737-300 mysteriously dropped from
the sky into the Musi River in the Sumatran jungle, killing all 104
people aboard. SilkAir is a subsidiary of the flag carrier
Singapore Airlines.
	   Supporting a theory that the crash of flight MI 185 may have
been a case of pilot suicide, The Asian Wall Street Journal last
week cited the debt-ridden captain's last-minute life insurance
policy and his tampering with a cockpit tape to hide a previous
flying error.
	   The investigation team said its Human Factors Group still was
``acquiring factual information for the study of the background of
the flight crew members, their professional proficiencies, their
career, private lives, and their actions and interactions before
and during the accident flight. This will continue for the next two
to three months.''
	   It said that ``numerous rumors about the cause of the MI 185
accident ... are all speculation. The investigation team is still
trying to determine the cause or causes of the accident.''
	   Besides Indonesian officials, the team includes representatives
of Singapore Airlines and Boeing.
	   The investigation remains unaffected by the economic crisis in
Indonesia, the statement said.
	   Earlier Monday, Singapore Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan
also said the investigation would take at least six more months.
	   Mah was asked in Parliament to comment on the Asian Wall Street
Journal story last week listing pilot suicide as a likely cause of
the crash, but the question was ruled out of order before the
minister answered.

Managing director of Gay Games dismissed for overspending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Just as the 1998 Gay Games got
under way, the managing director of the event was dismissed for
overspending.
	   The board of directors for the quadrennial Olympics-style
homosexual sports and cultural festival issued a terse statement
Monday, saying it had ``revoked the mandate'' of Dutchman Marc
Janssens on Sunday, the day after the opening ceremonies.
	   ``The reason is that Mr. Janssens made commitments outside the
approved budget, commitments that were also bigger than his
authority,'' the statement said. It did not elaborate.
	   ``We have no overview of the complete situation,'' said Games
spokesman Paul van Yperen, adding the directors are still
investigating the extend of the financial problem.
	   The Gay Games, which began on Saturday and runs through Aug. 8,
is expected to attract 15,000 participants and 200,000 visitors
from 66 countries.
	   The event is costing 14 million guilders (dlrs 7 million), but
organizers have received 3 million guilders (dlrs 1.5 million) in
government subsidies.

heavyweight corporate sponsors such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and

Official: SilkAir crash investigation to continue for 6 more
</HEADLINE>
months &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Indonesian-led team investigating the
SilkAir crash in Indonesia last December said Monday it has found
``no indication that air traffic control, weather or maintenance
was a factor in the accident.''
	   Other aspects of investigation, including the examination of
human factors, are continuing, the team said in a statement. It
added that the investigation is likely to continue for the next six
to eight months.
	   Last Dec. 19, a SilkAir Boeing 737-300 mysteriously dropped from
the sky into the Musi River in the Sumatran jungle, killing all 104
people aboard. SilkAir is a subsidiary of the flag carrier
Singapore Airlines.
	   Supporting a theory that the crash of flight MI 185 may have
been a case of pilot suicide, The Asian Wall Street Journal last
week cited the debt-ridden captain's last-minute life insurance
policy and his tampering with a cockpit tape to hide a previous
flying error.
	   The investigation team said its Human Factors Group still was
``acquiring factual information for the study of the background of
the flight crew members, their professional proficiencies, their
career, private lives, and their actions and interactions before
and during the accident flight. This will continue for the next two
to three months.''
	   It said that ``numerous rumors about the cause of the MI 185
accident ... are all speculation. The investigation team is still
trying to determine the cause or causes of the accident.''
	   Besides Indonesian officials, the team includes representatives
of Singapore Airlines and Boeing.
	   The investigation remains unaffected by the economic crisis in
Indonesia, the statement said.
	   Earlier Monday, Singapore Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan
also said the investigation would take at least six more months.
	   Mah was asked in Parliament to comment on the Asian Wall Street
Journal story last week listing pilot suicide as a likely cause of
the crash, but the question was ruled out of order before the
minister answered.

Luo Jingyi, Stanford student, clandestine Communist, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Luo Jingyi, a former Stanford University student
who worked as an underground agent for China's Communist Party and
rose to the top ranks of the nation's security agency, has died at
age 93, state media said Monday.
	   Luo, who was from Shanghai and studied at Stanford in 1925, died
of illness July 27 in Beijing and was cremated Friday at a cemetery
for venerated revolutionaries on the city's outskirts, the Xinhua
News Agency said.
	   Luo also studied in Moscow and, after returning to China, did
clandestine work for the Communist Party for 13 years until it
seized power in 1949, Xinhua said without providing details.
	   After the Communist takeover, Luo worked in foreign trade and
other fields and rose to vice ministerial rank in the Ministry of
State Security before retiring in 1983, Xinhua said.
	   It did not give details about Luo's work in the Security
Ministry, China's equivalent of the KGB in the former Soviet Union.

Indonesian troops in East Timor now carrying human rights booklets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-East Timor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Long accused of abuses, Indonesian
soldiers in East Timor are carrying a new aid: booklets that tell
how to respect human rights.
	   The 12-page publication forbids rape and torture and requires
soldiers to protect civilians, said Lt. Col. Supadi, military chief
of staff in the former Portuguese colony.
	   The book, which is being distributed to the 11,000 Indonesian
soldiers in East Timor, is based on U.N. guidelines on human
rights.
	   International rights groups say the Indonesian military, which
invaded East Timor in 1975, has committed widespread abuses while
seeking to quell separatist rebels and their civilian sympathizers.
	   Tens of thousands of people died in fighting and of disease and
famine in the years following the invasion and 1976 annexation,
which has not been recognized by the United Nations.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has pledged democratic reform and has
offered autonomy for East Timor, ruling out the desire of many
activists there: a vote on independence.
	   Talks on East Timor are scheduled Tuesday and Wednesday at U.N.
headquarters in New York. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal are taking part.
	   It is not the first time that the Indonesian military has
distributed human rights booklets. Soldiers in the eastern province
of Irian Jaya, also home to a small band of separatist rebels, were
given the publications last year.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower
Monday, with the key index tumbling 4.8 percent in Hong Kong
because of bad news both from abroad and at home. The Hang Seng
Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips, fell
383.43 points, closing at 7,552.77. The loss followed drops of 3.89
percent last week and more than 4 percent the previous week.
Traders blamed a sharp fall Friday on Wall Street, the weakness of
the Japanese yen resulting from uncertainties about the new
government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, and concerns about the
domestic economy. The U.S. dollar hit a seven-week high of 145 yen
Monday in Asia. The Dow fell 143.66 points on Friday. (Asian
Markets)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government approved 25
measures Monday to stimulate the economy and stop its steady slide
into recession despite billions of dollars in bailout money from
the International Monetary Fund. The unveiling of the package came
on the first day of talks with an IMF team visiting Bangkok for a
quarterly review of its rescue program. Thailand is in the midst of
its worst economic crisis in modern times. The measures approved
Monday include pumping dlrs 600 million into the agricultural
sector, spending dlrs 122 million to restructure the country's
manufacturing base and allowing the government to run a deficit
equivalent to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product.
(Thailand-Economic Plan)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Battered by Asia's recession, South
Korean exports suffered their largest monthly contraction in 13 1/2
years in July, the government said Monday. And with imports of raw
materials for its factories falling, the nation recorded a dlrs
3.08 billion trade surplus, compared to a dlrs 837 million deficit
in the same month last year. Exports dropped by 13.7 percent to
dlrs 10.2 billion from the same month last year, the third straight
and the largest monthly contraction since January, 1985. The
Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry attributed the contraction
to the recession in Asia, one of South Korea's main export markets,
and the appreciation of Korea's currency, which made its products
more expensive. (SKorea-Trade)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sluggish sales have forced Japanese semiconductor
maker NEC Corp. to cut capital spending on chip production by 16.6
percent to 150 billion yen (dlrs 1.03 billion) this year, the
company said Monday. The Tokyo-based NEC will also postpone its
scheduled start-of a new domestic chip-manufacturing plant by one
year to early 2000, a company spokesman said. The NEC spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the company will also
shelve plans to rationalize its chip-production lines at domestic
plants for the fiscal year, which will end March 31, 1999.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co., Japan's struggling No. 2
automaker, may stop producing and marketing 200SX subcompact coupes
at its Tennessee plant in 1999, a company spokeswoman said Monday.
Tokyo-based Nissan is considering the move as part of efforts to
restructure its debt-ridden North American operations, said Nissan
spokeswoman Ritsuko Harimoto. The two-door cars are the first
models affected by Nissan's group-wide restructuring program,
announced in May, that calls for a 30 percent reduction in the car
maker's 50-model lineup, Harimoto said. (Japan-US-Nissan)

Singer shot in celebratory gunfire at wedding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A singer performing at a wedding was
accidentally shot and killed by the groom's brother, who was firing
an automatic rifle in celebration of the marriage, police said
Monday.
	   The victim was identified as Ayman Abdel-Wahab, 22.
	   Police said he died Saturday after he was shot accidentally by
Gamal Abdel-Gawad, who was firing in the air to celebrate the
wedding of his brother in the village of Mir in southern Egypt.
Abdel-Gawad was taken into custody, police said.
	   Firing weapons at weddings is still common practice in the
south, despite a government ban on the practice.
	   The singer was the third person to died in celebratory gunfire
in recent days. Last week, a bride and groom were shot dead at
their wedding when a guest misjudged his aim while trying to fire
over their heads. The bride's mother is recovering in hospital from
a gunshot wound.

Radio: rebels attack second mining town, 20 killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels based in eastern Congo have
attacked a second mining town in western Uganda, killing 20 people,
an independent radio station said Monday.
	   Central Broadcasting Service (CBS) said Allied Democratic Forces
rebels struck an army post and a police station in Kilembe, 400
kilometers (248 miles) west of Kampala Sunday afternoon.
	   It was not immediately possible to contact the Ugandan army
spokesman for confirmation.
	   On Saturday, ADF rebels attacked Kasese, 20 kilometers (12
miles) east of Kilembe, setting fire to two hotels and 20 vehicles.
The army says eight died in the attack, but newspapers and radio
stations put the death toll at as many as 17.
	   The Alliance of Democratic Forces is made up of remnants of the
former Ugandan army which was defeated by President Yoweri
Museveni's guerrilla forces in 1986. Analysts say the rebels come
from several tribes but say the ADF is dominated by members of a
Muslim missionary movement known as Jamiat al-Tabliq.
	   But Tabliq movement leaders in Kampala on Sunday distanced
themselves from armed rebellion.
	   There have also been reports that some members of the army of
the former Zaire (now Congo) and the former Rwandan Hutu army have
joined the ADF, which has bases in the foothills of the Rwanzori
Mountains and also in Congo.
	   It is not known whether the ADF has a formal ideology, other
than wanting to destabilize Museveni's government. They are
believed to receive arms and supplies from the Islamic Front
government in neighboring Sudan.
	   Until the Kasese attack, the rebels hit isolated civilian
targets in rural areas. Two months ago they set fire to a technical
training school outside Fort Portal, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north
of Kasese, killing at least 80 students and carrying off about 100
others.

Gas flowing from Myanmar to Thailand through pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Natural gas from Myanmar is already
flowing to Thailand through a controversial dlrs 1.2 billion
pipeline, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand said Monday.
	   Gas started entering the Thai section of the pipeline last
Thursday, a PTT spokesman said, but hasn't yet reached the power
station in Ratchaburi, 95 kilometers (59 miles) west of Bangkok,
where it will be converted into energy.
	   That will take about seven days if all goes well, he said. The
gas is being permitted to flow in more sections of the
240-kilometer (148-mile) Thai portion of the pipeline each day so
PTT officials can make sure there are no leaks or other problems.
	   The pipeline is owned by Total of France, Unocal of the United
States, Myanmar's military government and PTT.
	   Thai environmentalists have protested against the pipeline,
saying its construction has damaged rain forests and displaced
wildlife, including elephants, the national symbol of Thailand.
	   Democracy and human rights activists have charged that its
profits will fund Myanmar's military regime, which, although in
poor financial shape, spends more than half its budget on weapons
while suppressing the country's democracy movement and ethnic
minorities.
	   They have also charged that the Myanmar military used forced
labor to build infrastructure for the project.
	   Although all parties in the consortium deny the charge, Myanmar
citizens have testified in a U.S. court that they were used as
forced labor to build pipeline infrastructure.
	   The consortium has spent several million dollars on social
welfare projects along the Myanmar section of the pipeline route to
improve the lives of people in the area.

Polish foreign minister stays out of Auschwitz cross controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's government indicated Monday it
would stay out of a controversy over crosses placed near the former
Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.
	   Catholics from a nationalist movement in Silesia erected a
three-meter (10-foot) cross over the weekend near a cluster of
crosses that surround a larger cross outside the Auschwitz memorial
in southern Poland.
	   The crosses have angered Jewish organizations, who want them
removed. But Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said the government
would leave the matter to proper authorities, meaning the Roman
Catholic church in Poland.
	   ``The Polish government hopes that the cross in Poland will
always be a uniting symbol and will not be used for political
manifestations,'' he said Monday.
	   The largest cross _ eight meters (26 feet) tall _ was erected in
1988 to commemorate a 1979 mass conducted in the area by Pope John
Paul II, who is Polish. It is outside Auschwitz, on neighboring
land that used to be a Carmelite cloister.
	   Jewish organizations complain the cross, which is visible from
the former death camp, violates the memory of Jews who died at
Auschwitz and want it removed.
	   But some Polish Catholics, many linked to a conservative
Catholic radio station, have in the last week placed about 50
smaller crosses around the larger one, and the Silesian Catholics
put up their cross over the weekend.
	   Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial on Sunday demanded the
removal of the crosses, calling them a provocation that ``may
prevent further dialogue between the sides about the future of the
site.''
	   The local Catholic archbishop, Damian Zimon, has called placing
more crosses at Auschwitz ``unnecessary manipulation.'' But Zimon
has yet to say if the church would remove the crosses.
	   Many Poles consider the large cross _ located where 152 Nazi
resisters were murdered in 1941 _ a symbol of the nation's
martyrdom under German occupation.
	   The government took over the grounds of the former cloister in
March, but the land continues to be rented to a war victims' group.
	   Church officials say they have no plans to make any decision on
the matter in the near future.

Dispute between Malaysia, Singapore turns bitter

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with response from Singapore trade minister, grafs
7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A row between Malaysia and
Singapore over the shift of a joint customs and immigration post
got uglier Monday with more Malaysian officials joining in a tirade
against their neighbor to the south.
	   Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat accused Singapore's media of
launching a ``hate campaign,'' while Education Minister Najib Abdul
Razak described Singapore as ``arrogant,'' newspapers reported
Monday.
	   Singapore relocated its railroad immigration facility Saturday,
despite Malaysia's refusal to go along. Train services are running
smoothly between the two countries, but Malaysian officials
complain it takes longer because passengers now have to get off
twice for immigration checks.
	   ``Why did they find a time such as now, when the country is
facing an economic slowdown and other problems?'' Malaysian
Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik was quoted as asking in the Star.
	   Information Minister Mohamed held out the threat of Malaysia
turning off its water supply to Singapore. About half of the water
consumed daily by Singaporeans comes from its Southeast Asian
neighbor.
	   ``Malaysians are still able to control their emotions, but I
won't be surprised if they come to a point where they cannot take
it any more and want the government to stop supplying water to
Singapore,'' he said.
	   In a Parliament session in Singapore, Minister for Trade and
Industry Lee Yock Suan said Malaysia will only hurt itself if it
decides to stop selling water to Singapore.
	   ``If they don't sell it to us, they don't have anybody to sell
it to,'' Lee said. He added that the water deal and the dispute
over Malaysia's immigration checkpoint are two separate issues.
	   Malaysian Education Minister Najib said, ``Singapore must act as
a gentleman would in resolving this problem or the republic would
be held responsible for any deterioration in relations between the
two countries.''
	   Malaysia's main opposition leader Monday urged restraint.
	   ``Singapore and Malaysian ministers and leaders should observe a
moratorium and stop mutual bashing,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the
opposition leader in Parliament.
	   Relations between the two countries have swung from diplomatic
tolerance to hostility in recent weeks.
	   In 1963, Singapore was incorporated into Malaysia, an experiment
that failed two years later after wrangling between Singapore
senior minister Lee Kwan Yew and the late Malaysian Prime Minister
Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Singapore still remains Malaysia's third-largest trade partner
and an important gateway into Malaysia.
	   More than 200,000 Malaysians cross over to Singapore each day to
work. Twenty-seven trains run daily between the two countries for
passenger, freight and a golf shuttle service.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will resume his vacation
in northwestern Russia this week, the presidential press service
said Monday.
	   On Wednesday, the president abruptly interrupted his stay in the
Russian republic of Karelia, near the Finnish border, citing urgent
business in Moscow.
	   He has spent the last few days in his country residence near the
Russian capital, conferring with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
and other top officials and signing several economic bills into
law.
	   Yeltsin will go to the lake resort area of Valdai, about 400
kilometers (230 miles) north of Moscow, on Tuesday or Wednesday,
the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies said.

Singapore Jehovah's Witness sues to get job back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Jehovah's Witness, dismissed from his tenured
teaching job for refusing to sing the national anthem and recite
the national pledge, went to court Monday to get his job back,
citing constitutional protection of individuals to practice their
faith.
	   During the first day of trial in his civil suit against the
vocational institute that employed him to teach English and
mathematics, Peter Nappalli, 37, hesitated several times to answer
questions that would identify acquaintances as Jehovah's Witnesses,
a denomination banned in 1972.
	   The Jehovah's Witness version of the Bible and other literature
is banned, proselytizing is prohibited, and police are permitted to
raid homes to break up Bible studies of three or more people.
	   It is legal for individuals to be Jehovah's Witnesses, under a
constitutional clause guaranteeing the right to profess and
practice religion.
	   But there are many restrictions under other laws in Singapore,
where the ruling party, fearful of any religious or racial
disharmony, propagates a nationalist ideology that leaves little
room for dissent.
	   Jehovah's Witness adherents such as Nappalli run into trouble
when they obey the tenets of their faith by refusing to do military
service, pledge allegiance to the national flag or sing the
national anthem.
	   Nappalli, who had served a three-year prison term for refusing
the national service required of all Singaporean males, lost his
teaching job after 10 years when the school began enforcing a
requirement for students and faculty to recite the pledge and sing
the anthem at daily assemblies.
	   Asked why he had ever applied for a teaching job, when he knew
this was a requirement, Nappalli said that in 1984 Jehovah's
Witnesses were not being dismissed for refusing to comply with
those rituals.
	   ``I was protected by a higher law: the constitution,'' Nappalli
answered. ``As a citizen of Singapore I believed the constitution
would balance out that situation.''
	   In fact, Nappalli testified that during the 1,600 assemblies he
attended, most of those around him did not sing out loud or recite
the pledge.
	   ``The taped music was louder than anything anyone was singing,''
he said. He said the students _ aged 14 to 20 _ only started
reciting the pledge en masse in 1988, when a new code required them
to place clenched fists over their hearts as they spoke.
	   Nappalli stood silently during the assemblies. But in 1991, he
was warned of disciplinary action if he did not begin singing and
reciting the pledge. Three years later he was fired.
	   The Institute of Technical Educations argued in court documents
that review boards were never told of Nappalli's refusal to recite
the pledge and sing the anthem, and therefore continued to promote
him. The institute said his failure to participate set a bad
example to students and breached discipline.
	   In a 2 1/2-hour opening cross-examination, the institute's
attorney, Tang Khin Wei, brought out Nappalli's admission that when
he applied for the teaching post he answered ``no'' when asked if
he had ever served time in prison.
	   Nappalli said he thought the question applied to a criminal
offense.
	   More than 30 members of the public, many of them Jehovah's
Witnesses, filled the courtroom. The audience gasped at one point
when Tang asked Nappalli directly if a woman who had recommended
him for the teaching job was a Jehovah's Witness.
	   Nappalli said the lawyer needed to ask her.
	   Later, he was asked how many working teachers he knew of were
Jehovah's Witnesses who did not recite the pledge or sing the
anthem. Nappalli gave an indirect answer, and his attorney objected
to the question, as well as another asking what Nappalli did as a
Jehovah's Witness. Some of the common practices, such as going
door-to-door to share their faith, are illegal in Singapore,
although Nappalli admitted he does that.
	   Nappalli, who supports his wife and children as a tutor, is
suing for reinstatement to his job, back pay and annual raises and
bonuses, and compensation for denial of his constitutional rights.
	   Testimony was expected to last until Friday.

Israel displays anti-missile missile for first time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel put the Arrow anti-missile
missile it is developing jointly with the United States on display
for the first time Monday.
	   An orange-and-black nose cone peeked out of a cluster of six
gray tubes that pointed skyward from a mobile launcher at the Tel
Aviv Fair Grounds. A sign described the system as the ``defense
wall of Israel.''
	   The Arrow was deployed for the first time as part of a Jubilee
exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of Israel's founding.
	   Brig. Gen. Zion Sapir gave reporters a tour of the military
exhibit and estimated that the Arrow would be deployed within two
years.
	   The Arrow system, which was originally scheduled to become
operational this year, is scheduled for a further test firing this
fall, officials said.
	   The United States has so far contributed about dlrs 250 million
toward the joint program, which is intended to defend against Scud
missile attacks like those Iraq unleashed on Israel in the Gulf
War.
	   Total system costs are estimated at dlrs 1.6 billion, with the
United States picking up two-thirds of the tab.
	   In March, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen announced the
United States would help pay for a third anti-missile defense
battery in Israel because of ``growing missile proliferation'' in
the Middle East.
	   Last month, Iran successfully tested a Shahab 3 missile capable
of reaching Israel.
	   Also on display for the first time Monday was the Gil anti-tank
rocket, a television-guided weapon with a range of 2.5 kilometers
(1.5 miles), and the Tabor, or Bull Pup, assault rifle that is
lighter and shorter than its predecessors.

Protesters threaten to block Russian-U.S. military maneuvers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 200 demonstrators in Russia's eastern port
city of Vladivostok staged a protest Monday and said they would try
to disrupt military maneuvers this week involving Russian forces
and the U.S. Marines, news reports said.
	   The protesters called on anybody with a boat to block the August
6 and 7 maneuvers, which involve training for a response to a
natural disasters, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Among other exercises, U.S. Marines are to conduct mock landings
on the outskirts of Vladivostok.
	   The protesters also said they would stage a rally coinciding
with the arrival of U.S. ships on Tuesday, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Protesters have picketed outside the American consulate, and
regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko has called the maneuvers
inappropriate.

Inflation soars in crisis-ridden Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Dramatic rises in basic food prices
have pushed up the inflation rate in crisis-ridden Indonesia to
almost 60 percent in this year's first seven months, a government
official said Monday.
	   Dow Jones Newswires quoted the official as saying the consumer
price index rose 8.56 percent in July from June, compared with an
increase of 4.64 percent in June from May.
	   The inflation rate for the first seven months of the year
reached an estimated 59.1 percent, he said.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said sharp
price increases for rice, cooking oil, wheat flour and spices were
to blame.
	   The Indonesian government forecasts inflation at 80 percent by
the end of the year.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The value of the rupiah has plunged, unemployment is growing
fast and the economy is in deep recession.
	   On Sunday, the newspaper Kompas quoted President B.J. Habibie as
saying the government would need three years to restore economic
growth.
	   Habibie took power after his autocratic predecessor Suharto quit
May 21 amid widespread student-led protests against his 32-year
authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie has pledged to carry out painful economic changes
required under a dlrs 43 billion International Monetary Fund rescue
plan.
	   He has also promised to make sweeping political reforms and to
hold elections in 1999.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Attackers shot and killed the president of a gas
company early Monday morning in Moscow, a news report said.
	   Yuri Bezruchenko, head of Promstroigaz, was found dead inside
his Mercedes with two bullet wounds to the head, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Police were trying to determine whether the shooting was related
to Bezruchenko's business activities, the report said.
	   Many of Russia's contract killings involve business rivals
seeking to settle scores. Few of the cases are ever solved.

Another German hooligan arrested in beating of French officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ German police have arrested another
suspect in the brutal beating of a French police officer during the
World Cup, and said Monday their investigation was not yet over.
	   Christopher R., 23, of Erkner, was arrested over the weekend in
Berlin and was being transferred to Hanover, where the
investigation is centered, the Hanover prosecutor's office said in
a statement.
	   Like the three other suspects still in custody, he was charged
with joint attempted murder and causing serious bodily harm as well
as disturbing the peace.
	   Prosecutors said they believed they had most of the suspects,
but added that their investigation remained open.
	   The June 21 clash in Lens, France, between German soccer
hooligans and French police left 44-year-old officer Daniel Nivel
in a coma.
	   Last week prosecutors dropped charges of joint attempted murder
against another suspect, Daniel K., 23, of Herne, after a witness
confirmed he was among the initial attackers, but later tried to
stop the escalating violence.
	   He still faces the lesser charges.
	   Of two men arrested by French police shortly after the attack,
one remains jailed and the other has been released.

Indian prime minister introduces tough anti-corruption bill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
introduced a tough anti-corruption bill Monday creating a watchdog
agency with sweeping powers to clean up India's scandal-ridden
politics.
	   The bill to set up the three-person office of the Lok Pal, or
Keeper of the People, provides for a chairperson and two other
judges with unprecedented authority to probe allegations of
corruption against government officials, members of Parliament and
Cabinet members, including the prime minister.
	   Sources in India's Supreme Court said former Chief Justice
Jagdish Sharan Verma, noted for his tough stand on corruption
issues, was likely to be made the first Lok Pal.
	   The three members would be appointed by India's president _ a
largely ceremonial position _ on the recommendation of a panel of
government and Parliament leaders. They can be removed by the
president only for proven misconduct after an independent inquiry
by the chief justice.
	   Several top political leaders, including former Prime Minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao, are currently under indictment on corruption
charges. Other powerful figures are implicated in some of the
biggest corruption scandals in the country's history.

Gunfire rings though Kinshasa army barracks

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Gunfire and rumors echoed through Congo's
capital of Kinshasa early Monday morning as rival soldiers clashed
in a military barracks and a nearby base while the government
ordered the population off the streets.
	   The sound of gunfire could be heard from Camp Kokolo military
base and the Tshatshi barracks on Kinshasa's west side.
	   The clashes apparently involved troops loyal to President
Laurent Kabila and his one-time Rwandan allies. The fighting comes
amid growing suspicions within Kabila's government that the Rwandan
troops had been plotting against the regime.
	   Kabila last week ordered all Rwandan soldiers out of his
country, but did not elaborate on the reason.
	   Although Rwandan troops played an important role last year in
helping Kabila oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, relations
between the central African countries have soured in recent months.
	   According to a defense ministry official, more than 1,000
Rwandan Tutsi soldiers fled the Kokolo base and are hiding in a
forest just outside of Kinshasa.
	   Kabila's loyalist troops have erected roadblocks in Kinshasa and
are searching for the renegade Rwandans, said the defense ministry
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The government forces have been given orders to kill the Rwandan
soldiers, the official said.

10 killed, 20 wounded in latest massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed men in military fatigues stopped a
bus at a fake roadblock, then slit the throats of passengers and
the driver, hospital officials said Monday. Ten people were killed
and 20 wounded.
	   The attack Sunday afternoon took place near Saida, 400
kilometers (250 miles) southwest of the capital, Algiers.
	   When the armed group signaled the bus to stop, the suspicious
driver speeded up instead, but was forced off the road by a volley
of machine-gun fire. Once the bus was stopped, the attackers moved
in, slitting the throats of some passengers.
	   An official source in Saida, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the attackers were later caught.
	   They weren't identified, but such attacks are usually blamed on
Islamic militants waging a violent insurgency against the
military-backed government.
	   A U.N. panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares,
is currently in Algeria to look into the massacres and bombings
that have killed an estimated 75,000 people since the insurgency
began.
	   The insurgency was sparked in 1992 after the government canceled
parliamentary elections an Islamic party was set to win.

Ammunition seized in northern Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Police have seized about 150,000 rounds
of sm,all arms ammunition in the northern town of Bajram Curri in
an area used by Kosovo Albanian rebels as a sanctuary, the Interior
Ministry said Monday.
	   Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said that two people were
arrested after the police stopped their truck carrying the
ammunition Sunday. The two were not identified.
	   Serbian authorities have often accused the Albanian government
of complicity in weapons smuggling to KLA fighters in Kosovo.
	   Albania has denied the allegations. Last week, Albanian Prime
Minister Fatos Nano ordered the government to prepare a plan to
halt ``unlawful and criminal activity'' in the northeast of the
country.

Singer shot in celebratory gunfire at wedding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A singer performing at a wedding was
accidentally shot and killed by the groom's brother, who was firing
an automatic rifle in celebration of the marriage, police said
Monday.
	   The victim was identified as Ayman Abdel-Wahab, 22.
	   Police said he died Saturday after he was shot by Gamal
Abdel-Gawad, who was firing in the air to celebrate the wedding of
his brother in the village of Mir in southern Egypt. Abdel-Gawad
was taken into custody, police said.
	   Despite a government ban, firing guns is a still common way to
celebrate weddings in southern Egypt.
	   The singer was the third person to died in celebratory gunfire
in recent days. Last week, a bride and groom were shot dead at
their wedding when a guest misjudged his aim while trying to fire
over their heads. The bride's mother is recovering in a hospital
from a gunshot wound.

Cambodian fearful of revenge not assured by strongman's appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen's weekend
appeal to his security forces not to terrorize members of the
opposition following last week's elections has done little to ease
fears among those who fled their homes to escape persecution.
	   Threats, intimidation and attacks on Hun Sen's political
opponents have continued, say the victims, who scoffed Monday at
Hun Sen's assurances of safety, broadcast on state-run television
and radio.
	   Human rights workers said complaints of harassment and even
attempted killings are still flooding into their offices, although
they applauded Hun Sen's appeal.
	   Chum Sarath, 20, a member of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party,
pointed to a three-inch (8-centimeter) gash on his skull. The day
after ballots were cast, he said, a group of about 15 thugs kicked
and beat him unconscious with a wooden club.
	   ``Hun Sen can say whatever he wants, but that does not mean the
people below him listen,'' said the political activist, who has
spent the past week in a safe house and has no intention to return
home any time soon.
	   The elections were held one year after Hun Sen ousted Prince
Norodom Ranariddh in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. As many
as 100 of Ranariddh's supporters were killed by Hun Sen's forces in
the months after his takeover.
	   Election officials have not yet announced the winners of last
week's parliamentary election, blaming delays on difficulties in
verifying results from the country's remote provinces. According to
unofficial projections, Hun Sen appears likely to win at least half
of the seats in the National Assembly.
	   Following charges by opposition parties of election fraud, the
National Election Committee said Monday it had agreed to a recount
of ballots in areas where FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party
suspect irregularities.
	   Though election day proceeded peacefully, with only minor
complaints reported by party activists, those who voted against Hun
Sen's ruling party say they fear retaliation and retribution. They
began fleeing to provincial capitals and to Phnom Penh last week.
	   Scores of Hun Sen's political opponents say they are afraid
ruling party members will carry out death threats made before the
polls. Several politicians in Phnom Penh told human rights workers
that after election day, they had received anonymous phone calls,
sometimes playing funeral dirges and then hanging up.
	   Nieng Pha, an activist from Prey Veng province for Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party, fled to Phnom Penh after being shot in the leg by
unknown assailants last month. He said he is still being followed
and that family members have warned that it is too early to come
home.
	   A woman activist for the Sam Rainsy Party, who had to be sedated
when she arrived in the capital last Friday because she was so
upset, appealed to the international community for help at a news
conference Monday.
	   Two days after the election, she slipped away from home in the
central province of Kampong Cham after a friend warned her of
threats and police came to her home.
	   The woman, who asked that her name not be used, lost her husband
to political violence last year when unknown assailants threw hand
grenades into a demonstration led by Sam Rainsy. Sixteen people
were killed and more than 100 injured, but no one has yet been
brought to justice for the attack.
	   ``I request the international community to help find justice,''
she said. ``If the situation continues, everyone will die and the
nation will never see peace.''

	   REIMS, France (AP) _ A day after the Tour de France ended in
Paris, members of the Dutch team TVM were being questioned by
police Monday about banned drugs found in their possession.
	   TVM team members had pulled out of the race on Friday, two days
before the ending, saying they had neither the physical nor the
mental strength to continue.
	   Six cyclists, along with other team staff members, were being
questioned Monday morning in Reims, north of Paris. Already the
team director, Cees Priem, and its doctor, Andrei Mikhailov, and a
masseur have been placed under formal investigation _ a step short
of being formally charged _ on doping charges.
	   The TVM investigation actually began last March, when customs
agents found performance-enhancing drugs in a team car, seizing
about 100 doses of EPO, which increases oxygen to the red blood
cells.
	   But it wasn't until the scandal involving another team, Festina,
broke out that the TVM allegations came to light.
	   Priem and Mikhailov were arrested on July 23, and subsequent
searches of TVM hotel rooms resulted in the seizure of more drugs.
Team members were taken to a hospital in Albertville, where they
were subjected to extensive medical checks.
	   The 17th stage of the race had to be annulled when all the
cyclists, angered at the treatment of TVM members, refused to race
and merely coasted in a pack to the finish line.
	   Finally, the TVM riders quit the Tour July 30 in Switzerland,
meaning they wouldn't have to come back through France.
	   Tour de France organizer Jean-Claude Killy, the former ski star,
said Monday that cyclists who had taken drugs were not the only
guilty party.
	   ``They're certainly guilty because you can't dope somebody
without them knowing, but they're also victims because they're at
the bottom of the chain,'' he said, referring to the suppliers.
	   Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet warned that doping among
athletes was also frequent at the junior and regional levels, where
drugs are seen by some as a guarantee of getting to the top.
	   In an interview with French daily Le Monde, she said 221
athletes tested positive for drugs in France in 1997, of whom just
27 were ``at the top level.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces overran another
ethnic Albanian stronghold Monday and pressed their attacks
elsewhere in Kosovo despite Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
pledge that the offensive was over.
	   Relief agencies said tens of thousands of civilians had been
displaced by fighting which flared over the weekend. The U.N.
relief agency estimated 35,000 people had fled their homes during
the weekend.
	   But the International Committee of the Red Cross reported
finding twice that number in one area alone.
	   Albanian sources reported widespread fighting Monday throughout
the rebellious province. The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
said four people were killed and several others, including an
80-year-old man, were wounded in shelling Monday.
	   Six villages had been ``nearly leveled to the ground,'' the
Albanian center said.
	   Meanwhile, the government's Tanjug news agency said police
entered Smonica early Monday. Serb military sources said troops
shelled the village near the Albanian border for days and killed at
least a dozen Kovoso Liberation Army fighters.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued Monday to lay siege to
another border village, Junik. Independent media in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade said most KLA fighters had slipped out of the
village for sanctuaries in nearby Albania, leaving a few dozen
insurgents who have encircled their positions with land mines.
	   The latest fighting broke out only days after Milosevic promised
a European Union delegation last week that the latest offensive
against the KLA was over.
	   He also promised that international aid organizations would be
granted access to the refugees and that diplomatic observers could
escort them back to their homes.
	   But an official of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Mons
Nyberg, 55id access had been ``on and off,'' with police sometimes
holding his teams at checkpoints for hours before allowing them to
proceed.
	   He said it was unclear whether this was due to a ``lack of
communication or a systematic plan to stop of slow access.'' Nyberg
estimated at least 35,000 people had fled the weekend fighting,
swelling the total number of refugees to about 180,000 since the
government launched its crackdown on Albanian militants in
February.
	   In Geneva, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the
Red Cross, Amanda Williamson, said an ICRC team found between
60,000 and 80,000 refugees hiding on the slopes of Mount Berisa
south of Pristina.
	   She said the ICRC in Belgrade was trying to organize an aid
convoy.
	   The campaign against Albanian civilians was reminiscent of
``ethnic cleansing'' _ the forcible removal of rival ethnic groups
that marked conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia
and Croatia earlier this decade.
	   On Thursday, Milosevic told a European Union delegation that a
government offensive launched July 24 was over. He later assured
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill that refugees could return to their
homes and international relief organizations could assist them.
	   In Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party courted by
the United States accused the Serb-led Yugoslav government of
trying ``to make it impossible for thousands of Albanians to return
to their homes.''
	   The statement was issued by the Albanian Democratic Movement,
whose leader, Mehmet Hajrizi, has been mentioned as a key figure in
a planned Albanian team that U.S. diplomats hope can negotiate the
future of the majority Albanian province with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has promised to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
canceled in 1989. But he and major world powers oppose independence
for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in the province
by 9-to-1.
	   Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics that make up the remainder of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and European nations fear independence could
lead to demands by Albanian-speaking communities in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, to establish a ``Greater
Albania'' in the southern Balkans.
	   KLA leaders are expected to announce this week whether they will
accept a U.S. plan for Albanian politicians to enter peace talks
with Milosevic. The current Serb offensive appears designed to
deliver a strong blow against the rebels and force them to
negotiate from a position of weakness.

German software giant debuts on Wall Street
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ SAP AG, Germany's biggest software
company and one of the stars on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, hoped
to repeat that success in its Monday debut on Wall Street.
	   SAP, based in Walldorf in southwest Germany, hoped to raise its
international profile by becoming the eighth German firm to be
listed in the United States.
	   At present, 21 percent of SAP's freely floated stock is in the
hands of U.S. investors, said chief executive Henning Kagermann in
a weekend interview with Germany's financial daily Boersen-Zeitung.
	   The stock has risen some 115 percent this year alone on the
Frankfurt exchange.

Cohen pledges U.S. ships won't carry nuclear weapons in exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen guaranteed Monday that U.S. ships joining any future joint
military exercises in the Philippines will not carry nuclear
weapons.
	   An agreement that would allow a resumption of joint exercises
has been opposed by several influential Philippine groups,
including the Roman Catholic Church. Critics say it would infringe
on Philippine sovereignty, promote prostitution and endanger
Filipinos if nuclear weapons are carried on board U.S. ships or
planes.
	   As Cohen met Monday with his Philippine counterpart, Orlando
Mercado, about 25 activists demonstrated outside the military
headquarters to protest the pact, called the Visiting Forces
Agreement.
	   Cohen said he told Philippine officials that no ships or
submarines in the exercises would carry nuclear weapons, and that
the training would focus initially on humanitarian aid such as
flood control or disaster relief.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending close to a
century of American military presence in its former colony.
	   The United States halted all joint exercises in the Philippines
and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when the Manila
government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed
here.
	   The Visiting Forces Agreement, signed early this year by U.S.
and Philippine officials, would provide certain legal protections
to U.S. soldiers while on duty in the Philippines. It still must be
ratified by the Philippine Senate, which has not yet begun
deliberations.
	   Critics say the accord limits the Philippine government's right
to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the country. It
generally gives the United States jurisdiction over soldiers who
commit crimes while on duty, and the Philippines jurisdiction over
crimes committed while off-duty.
	   Both Mercado and President Joseph Estrada voted as senators for
the expulsion of the last U.S. base. Both now support the new
accord, saying the country must depend on military help from the
United States until it develops a credible deterrent of its own.
	   ``This is different because we're fighting for the security of
our country this time. We have a very weak military and our
equipment is obsolete and antiquated,'' Estrada said Monday, adding
that the country could be invaded by its neighbors with ease.
	   ``We can't win _ any time we could be invaded,'' Estrada said,
referring to China, Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia as possible
aggressors.
	   The Philippines has one of the weakest militaries in Southeast
Asia. It, like much of the region, has had to cut back on purchases
of military hardware because of the impact of Asia's financial
crisis.
	   Cohen said he was pleased by Estrada's and Mercado's support.
	   ``We would like to continue to have a strong relationship with
the Philippine people,'' he said. ``But it's up to the Philippines
to decide.''
	   The two countries used to conduct between six and eight military
exercises a year, involving up to 3,000 U.S. troops at a time.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first made-in-Malaysia
aircraft took off from a Kuala Lumpur airport Monday, the national
news agency Bernama reported.
	   The two-seat sports plane would be sold at about 80,000 ringgit
(dlrs 20,000), Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said after he
inaugurated the airplane.
	   Work on Langkawi 1, designed from blueprints purchased from
Zenith Air of Canada, started in 1996. It was a cooperative effort
of private and public companies.
	   It was not known when the plane would be on the market.
	   ``The aircraft, which is attractively priced, will make flying
affordable to Malaysians,'' Ling said. ``This will eventually help
to introduce and popularize the flying culture in Malaysia and
neighboring countries.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Visiting Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
said Monday that he will submit legislation in parliament next
month to return property to Jews whose property was nationalized
after World War II.
	   ``The bill presents a global solution for Romania to return
property to all former owners, not only Jews,'' said Vasile, who
arrived Sunday for a four-day visit to Israel.
	   Vasile was meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Monday afternoon, and was scheduled to meet with representatives of
the World Jewish Restitution Organization on Tuesday.
	   The Romanian premier toured Jerusalem's walled Old City with his
wife Maricua on Monday morning. The couple visited the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre, the traditional site of Jesus' crucifixion and
resurrection, and the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and
window-shopped in the Muslim Quarter.
	   ``It's wonderful, unbelievable,'' Mrs. Vasile said. ``It's like
a dream because of all this history.''
	   Some 400,000 Jews _ half the Romanian Jewish population _ died
in World War II, when Romania was allied with Nazi Germany. Many
others left the country in the years after the war, when hundreds
of Jewish properties were nationalized by Romania's communist
government.
	   Vasile said five houses belonging to Jews had already been
returned to their owners this year, and that another three or four
would be returned soon.
	   Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said there were now only
12,000 Jews in Romania, but that Romanian Jews living outside the
country were expected to ask for the return of their property as
well.
	   More than 450,000 Jews of Romanian origin live in Israel,
according to Israel's Foreign Ministry.
	   Romania's president, Emil Constantinescu, won praise from
Romanian Jewish leaders last year for publicly acknowledging the
country's complicity in the persecution and murder of Jews in the
Holocaust.

 &UR; Agency: eastern Congo in open rebellion against Kabila &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ North Kivu Province in eastern Congo is in
open rebellion against the government of President Laurent Kabila,
the Rwandam News Agency said Monday.
	   ``We, the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
taken the decision to remove President Laurent Desire Kabila from
power,'' said a communique read Sunday in French and Swahili over
Radio Goma, according to the private news agency.
	   The communique was signed by Sylvain Mbuchi, commander of the
10th batallion of the Congolese army based in Goma, the provincial
capital, RNA said.
	   The communique called on the local population to remain calm and
go about their daily business and assured residents that the goal
of the rebels was to ``preserve the unity and security of the whole
nation.''
	   The communique called on politicians in the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, to meet urgently and find a way of organizing good
leadership.
	   RNA said the airport in Goma was closed Monday and that a call
went out to residents and aid workers in the town just across from
the Rwandan city of Gisenyi to hand over all radio communications
equipment to security posts.
	   The agency said there were unconfirmed reports of similar
rebellions in Bukavu, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Goma and
the capital of South Kivu province, and in Kindu, the capital of
Maniema province, 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Bukavu.

Giants, Tigers coaches fined, suspended for three games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese professional baseball's Central League
fined two coaches 300,000 yen (dlrs 2,100) each Monday and
suspended them for three games for their parts in melees that broke
out after batters were hit by pitches.
	   The Yomiuri Giants and the Hanshin Tigers also issued a joint
apology to fans for the violence in Sunday night's game between the
two clubs, won by the Tigers 6-3.
	   The punishment was ordered for Shiro Takegami, a 57-year-old
batting coach of the Giants, and Tadayoshi Ookuma, a 55-year-old
outfielder and base running coach for the Tigers, said Masaaki
Nagino, an official of the Central League.
	   In a televised game before 54,000 spectators at Koshien Stadium,
Takegami pushed Tigers catcher Akihiro Yano in a melee after Giants
rookie Yoshinoru Takahashi was hit by a pitch on his right arm in
the top of the eighth inning.
	   Takegami was ejected immediately.
	   In the bottom of the eighth, Yano was hit in the back by a pitch
thrown by ace reliever Hiromi Makihara, and Ookuma kicked Makihara.
Ookuma also was ejected.
	   The melees erupted two days after the league had suspended
Giants pitcher Balvino Galvez for the remainder of the season for
violence against an umpire during the Giants 6-1 loss to the Tigers
Friday night.
	   Galvez (9-7), formerly with Texas Rangers, was knocked out in
the sixth after giving up six runs. On his way to the bench,
apparently angry over the plate umpire's calls, he suddenly hurled
a ball at the umpire.
	   No games were scheduled Monday in either of Japan's two
professional leagues.

Dispute between Malaysia, Singapore turns bitter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Malaysian deputy minister's advice to travelers,
last 3 grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A row between Malaysia and
Singapore over the shift of a joint customs and immigration post
got uglier Monday with more Malaysian officials joining in a tirade
against their neighbor to the south.
	   Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat accused Singapore's media of
launching a ``hate campaign,'' while Education Minister Najib Abdul
Razak described Singapore as ``arrogant,'' newspapers reported
Monday.
	   Singapore relocated its railroad immigration facility Saturday,
despite Malaysia's refusal to go along. Train services are running
smoothly between the two countries, but Malaysian officials
complain it takes longer because passengers now have to get off
twice for immigration checks.
	   ``Why did they find a time such as now, when the country is
facing an economic slowdown and other problems?'' Malaysian
Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik was quoted as asking in the Star.
	   Information Minister Mohamed held out the threat of Malaysia
turning off its water supply to Singapore. About half of the water
consumed daily by Singaporeans comes from its Southeast Asian
neighbor.
	   ``Malaysians are still able to control their emotions, but I
won't be surprised if they come to a point where they cannot take
it any more and want the government to stop supplying water to
Singapore,'' he said.
	   In a Parliament session in Singapore, Minister for Trade and
Industry Lee Yock Suan said Malaysia will only hurt itself if it
decides to stop selling water to Singapore.
	   ``If they don't sell it to us, they don't have anybody to sell
it to,'' Lee said. He added that the water deal and the dispute
over Malaysia's immigration checkpoint are two separate issues.
	   Malaysian Education Minister Najib said, ``Singapore must act as
a gentleman would in resolving this problem or the republic would
be held responsible for any deterioration in relations between the
two countries.''
	   Malaysia's main opposition leader Monday urged restraint.
	   ``Singapore and Malaysian ministers and leaders should observe a
moratorium and stop mutual bashing,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the
opposition leader in Parliament.
	   Relations between the two countries have swung from diplomatic
tolerance to hostility in recent weeks.
	   In 1963, Singapore was incorporated into Malaysia, an experiment
that failed two years later after wrangling between Singapore
senior minister Lee Kwan Yew and the late Malaysian Prime Minister
Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Singapore still remains Malaysia's third-largest trade partner
and an important gateway into Malaysia.
	   More than 200,000 Malaysians cross over to Singapore each day to
work. Twenty-seven trains run daily between the two countries for
passenger, freight and a golf shuttle service.
	   Train travelers from Singapore need not worry if their passports
are not stamped on entering Malaysia, Malaysian Deputy Home
Minister Ong Ka Ting said.
	   He said their particulars are recorded into computers by
Malaysian immigration officers when they board the train at Tanjong
Pagar station and their entry is perfectly legal.
	   ``What is important is to facilitate travel of the visitors.
That's the duty of immigration officers. We leave other matters to
the governments of both countries,'' he said.

English clubs and RFU agree on European tournament.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After months of feuding with the Rugby Football
Union over its decision to quit the European competition, the
English First Division Rugby Union scored a breakthrough and could
form a new tournament by October.
	   The EFDR and the RFU released a joint statement Monday saying
the two bodies were prepared to work in partnership to set up a new
cross-border tournament to replace the existing European club
competition.
	   ``The clubs are keen to institute a new tournament this season
and, while concerned about the practicality and mindful of time
constraints, the RFU has no objection in principle to this,'' the
statement said.
	   The RFU plans to open urgent negotiations with the unions in
other European countries in a bid to get the tournament up and
running by October.
	   The move is the latest development in a battle between the first
division clubs and the RFU which has been ongoing since the top 14
English clubs withdrew from the Europan tournament due to
structural concerns about the event.
	   Leading English club Bath won the European title in January
before the English clubs shunned the tournament.
	   Last week the top nine clubs in France also decided to pull out
in favor of forming a new championship with the English clubs.
	   EFDR chief executive Doug Ash said there was no definite
structure for the proposed tournament, although it would be
organized by European Rugby Cup _ the organization which ran the
first three European competitions.
	   ``It was a key breakthrough when the RFU agreed that we should
try to organize European rugby this coming season, when until now
it looked as though that would not be possible,'' he said.
	   Ash said the competition could start in October and the EFDR
would be pushing for all 14 English first division clubs to be
involved in the top tier of the tournament.
	   Under previous guidelines, only the top four English clubs
contested the main European tournament while the remaining teams
competed in a second conference.

Latest statistics indicate economy getting worse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Already mired in recession, Hong Kong received
a battering of bad economic news Monday _ new figures indicating a
sharp economic contraction, bad earnings reports and a steep drop
on the stock market.
	   Officials predicted more trouble was ahead.
	   The gross domestic product fell 2.8 percent in this year's first
quarter due to ``a significant downturn'' in domestic demand and
fewer tourists, the Census and Statistics Department said in a
statement.
	   The fall in GDP was sharper than the 2 percent the government
had estimated previously, and a result of more specific numbers,
officials said. Unemployment is at a 15-year high, and tourism is
off more than 20 percent this year.
	   No figures are available yet for the second quarter, which ended
in June, but senior officials already have indicated that it is
likely to show further contraction. The government economist, K.Y.
Tang, said Monday that when the numbers do come out, the second
quarter probably will be worse than the first.
	   He declined to predict what might happen in the second half of
the year, but said the economy, which is driven by exports and
services, is unlikely to improve until the rest of Asia does.
	   The latest figures also indicated that total exports decreased
by 1 percent from the same period last year.
	   Hong Kong initially withstood much of Asia's financial turmoil,
but now has been dragged down into recession as well.
	   In a survey conducted by the Home Affairs Bureau of more than
1,500 respondents last month, 66 percent said the state of the
economy was their biggest worry.
	   Meanwhile, HSBC Holdings, which has the largest capitalized
stock on the Hong Kong stock exchange, announced late Monday that
its net profit for 1998's first six months amounted to U.S. dlrs
2.40 billion, down 16 percent from dlrs 2.87 billion a year
earlier.
	   Group Chairman John Bond said the fall reflected ``the impact of
a deteriorating economy environment in Asia.''
	   The group's principal unit, Hong Kong Bank, posted a 41 percent
profit decline to U.S. dlrs 787 million from dlrs 1.3 billion a
year earlier.
	   It also announced a bad debt provision of more than dlrs 1
billion because of Asia's economic problems.
	   ``There is considerable uncertainty about the duration of the
downturn,'' Bond said in a statement. ``We do not know when the
recovery will start.''
	   Dragged down by lackluster performance of HSBC shares, the Hang
Seng index, the market's key indicator of blue chips, lost 383.43
points, or nearly 5 percent, closing at 7,552.77.

Fashion chain closes 23 outlets in Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fashion retailer Theme International Holdings
Ltd. announced Monday that it was closing 23 outlets in Hong Kong
and laying off 86 employees because of the economic downturn.
	   The Hong Kong company said the outlets belonged to its wholly
owned subsidiary, The Shop Clothing Ltd.
	   ``In view of the severe retail downturn in Hong Kong, the
directors regrettably decided that the closure of the shops was the
only sensible option we could take to enable us to return the group
to profitability,'' chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lai
Hin-fung said.
	   The company earlier had to seek an 80 million Hong Kong dollar
(U.S. dlrs 10.2 million) loan from its major shareholder, China
Everbright Ltd., and is currently restructuring its operations.
	   Theme said its flagship stores in two major shopping malls and
10 other shops in Hong Kong and Macau are operating normally, as
are its shops and department store concessions in China and Taiwan.

Memorial service set for old revisionist communist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Karl Schirdewan, a communist imprisoned by the
Nazis for treason and later victimized by former East Germany's
hardline Stalinists, has died at age 91.
	   Schirdewan, who had been ill for some time, died July 15 in a
hospital in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, said Baerbel Ritter, a
spokeswoman for the party of former east German communists.
	   A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday at the Old City
Hall in Potsdam, she said Monday.
	   Born on May 14, 1907, in Koenigsberg _ now Kaliningrad in Russia
_ Schirdewan was an early communist youth group functionary and in
the 1920s was a close colleague of Ernst Thaelmann, then leader of
Germany's communist party.
	   Later as a resistance fighter against the Nazis, Schirdewan was
sentenced to three years in prison in 1935 for high treason,
serving the time in Sachsenhausen, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg
concentration camps.
	   After the war, when East Germany formed a government in 1949,
Schirdewan rose to become a Central Committee secretary and a
member of the Politburo starting in 1953.
	   In 1958 he fell from favor with hardline Communist leader Walter
Ulbricht for comments ``contradictory to official party policy''
and was demoted to manage the party's state archives in Potsdam.
	   He remained a member of the communist party and was
rehabilitated and appointed to its Council of Elders when it was
renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism in 1990.
	   Shortly before his death, Schirdewan completed his memoirs,
which are to be published later this month, the spokeswoman said.
	   He is survived by his widow Giesela.

Russian govt. to sell 5 percent of country's largest company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government plans to sell off another 5
percent of the country's largest company, Gazprom, in order to
raise much-needed cash, officials said Monday.
	   The sale would reduce the government's share in the company from
40 percent to 35 percent, and could bring protests from Communist
lawmakers who oppose the sale of many state assets.
	   With nearly 400,000 employees, Gazprom controls production and
distribution of Russia's vast natural gas supplies and is one of
Western Europe's largest suppliers.
	   The gas monopoly is revered as a symbol of national strength,
but the government has targeted Gazprom recently as part of a drive
to get companies to pay overdue taxes.
	   The results of the tender, which will be open to foreigners,
will be announced in September, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   In other economic developments Monday:
	   _ Two oil companies that are behind in their tax payments will
have reduced access to the country's oil export pipeline. The
Sidanko and Onako oil companies will have their monthly exports
reduced by one-third until they pay their taxes, the Interfax news
agency said. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes is
one of its most serious problems.
	   _ The Finance Ministry said it may issue dlrs 2 billion in
Eurobonds later this year, but emphasized it would wait until
``market conditions allow the lowest costs.'' Russia is under less
pressure to sell the bonds now because of recent infusions of cash
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   _ President Boris Yeltsin promised to pay all back wages to the
military by early September, ITAR-Tass reported. Soldiers, like
many people are paid by the state, often receive their salaries
months late. The president has frequently pledged to pay wage
arrears, but the government often lacks the money to deliver.

EU clears dlrs 68 million for Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union has cleared 62
million European currency units (dlrs 68 million) for projects in
Greece aimed at improving roads and the environment, it said
Monday.
	   In a statement, the EU executive Commission said dlrs 30 million
will help finance a road-building project. A further dlrs 38
million will go to several environmental programs, it said.
	   The funds are part of the EU's so-called cohesion funds for
those countries in the 15-nation bloc that have weaker economies
than the others.
	   For the 1993-1999 period the recipients are Ireland, Spain,
Portugal and Greece.

Gunmen rob maternity hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Three gunmen robbed an Athens maternity
hospital Monday, slightly injuring a doctor who attempted to stop
them, local media said.
	   The gunmen entered the accounting office of Iaso hospital, one
of the capital's largest private maternity facilities, fired three
shots into the ceiling and took 100,000 drachmas (dlrs 339).
	   They then stole 10 million drachmas (dlrs 33,900) from a
National Bank of Greece branch located inside the hospital and next
door to the accounting office. They fled the hospital in a car.
	   A doctor, Antonis Mitsis, was slightly injured when one of the
robbers hit him on the head with a gun as he tried to stop them
from leaving the hospital.
	   The hospital is located next door to the Athens Olympic Sports
Complex, where the World Basketball Championships are being held.

Montenegro stops all contacts with Milosevic's government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Montenegro's reformist government
stopped all contacts Monday with the government of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and a minister said a referendum on
secession could be held.
	   The Montenegrin government said they would not communicate with
the Yugoslav government until its premier, Momir Bulatovic, steps
down, and a successor from Montenegro is named.
	   Bulatovic, a former Montenegrin president, is a staunch ally of
Milosevic.
	   Montenegro and the much larger Serbia are the only two republics
that remained part of Yugoslavia as the country crumbled in the
early 1990s.
	   Bulatovic's party had lost out in May voting to a coalition led
by pro-Western Milo Djukanovic, a reformist who now is president of
Montenegro. Milosevic and Djukanovic have clashed over economic and
other issues.
	   Milosevic, who became Yugoslav president last year, wants to
completely dominate Montenegro. He named Bulatovic as federal
premier, despite his party's loss at home.
	   Predrag Drecun, labor minister in Montenegro's government, said
his party will propose a resolution next month giving Milosevic an
ultimatum to name a new federal premier from among Montenegro's
reformers.
	   ``If Milosevic rejects this, a referendum should be held in
Montenegro to decide whether it wants to stay in a country where
the will of the majority is not respected,'' Drecun said.

Artificially inseminated panda gives birth to cub
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An 8-year-old panda has given birth to a cub in
captivity after becoming pregnant through artificial insemination,
China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
	   The mother, named Number 28, gave birth to her second baby after
a four-month pregnancy at a panda research center at Wolong Nature
Preserve in southwestern Sichuan province, the agency said.
	   The cub was the 21st baby panda born at the research center, the
report said, and so far 15 have survived to adulthood.
	   Poaching and loss of habitat have reduced the number of pandas
in the wild to fewer than 1,000, and any confirmed birth is
considered significant. Pandas are notoriously difficult to breed
in captivity, forcing many zoos to rely on methods like artificial
insemination. Chinese scientists announced last month they were
experimenting with techniques to clone pandas.
	   The animal also suffers from a low reproductive rate. Scientists
believe only a quarter of female pandas are able to conceive,
Xinhua said.
	   The panda is native only to China, where it is a national
symbol.
	   Xinhua also reported three Siberian tiger cubs were born at a
zoo in the northeastern city of Changchun July 3. It was the ninth
litter born to a 13-year-old tigress named Yanchun, Xinhua said.
	   Because of poaching for pelts and body parts used in Chinese
medicine, fewer than 500 Siberian tigers are believed to survive in
the wild.

Brother of British javelin champion jailed for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) _ A judge on Monday jailed the
brother of British Olympic javelin gold medallist Tessa Sanderson
for 18 months for manslaughter.
	   Eric Sanderson was working as a nighclub bouncer when he punched
Martin Leaver, 36, in the face, causing him to fall and hit his
head on a sidewalk. Leaver sustained serious brain damage and died
later in hospital.
	   Sanderson, 35, who admitted manslaughter, gave himself up to
police the day after the attack.
	   Tessa Sanderson, the 1984 Olympic javelin champion, was at
Wolverhampton Crown Court to hear judge Francis Allen say he
accepted her brother was ``gravely upset'' at the result of his
actions. She later refused comment.
	   Prosecutor Melbourne Inman told the court that Leaver, of
Wolverhampton, central England, died in the town's New Cross
Hospital on April 20 after being struck a single blow outside the
Chicago Rock Cafe, a pub which also functions as a club.
	   Inman said Leaver, a local council worker, and his brother
became abusive after failing to gain entry to the venue.
	   Managers asked Sanderson, also of Wolverhampton, to go outside
to clear the area, but he ''lost his temper'' after being pushed,
Inman said.
	   Sanderson admitted later that he punched the victim in the face
''hard enough to shut him up.''
	   Patrick Harrington, Sanderson's lawyer, said Leaver and his
brother had abused and taunted bouncers and witnesses saw Leaver
push Sanderson in an aggressive manner.
	   The judge agreed that Leaver's ``own behaviour undoubtedly gave
rise to this incident.''
	   ''That is very relevant in mitigating what you did but the fact
remains that you lost your temper and that was a direct cause of
his death,'' he said.

Jonk joins Sheffield Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Dutch World Cup midfielder Wim Jonk
will join Premier League soccer team Sheffield Wednesday in a 2.5
million-pound (dlrs 4.1 million) transfer from PSV Eindhoven, the
English club said Monday.
	   Sheffield Wednesday secretary Graham Mackrell confirmed Monday
that Jonk had signed a three-year contract and would arrive at
Hillsborough on Tuesday.
	   Jonk was a key member of the Netherlands' World Cup squad _
semifinalists at France 98 _ and had been linked with moves to
Tottenham and Nottingham Forest before signing with the Owls.
	   The 31-year-old Dutch international is Danny Wilson's first
major signing since he became manager at Hillsborough last month.
	   Mackrell said Wilson would be given more funding to recruit more
top line players before the start of the season.
	   ``Naturally, we're delighted to have landed Wim,'' he said.
	   Jonk signed after a delegation from Sheffield Wednesday flew to
the Netherlands to finalize a deal with PSV Eindhoven.

NATO General Secretary comes to Poland on vacation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ NATO's secretary general said Monday he
decided to vacation in Poland, the biggest of the three former
Warsaw Pact countries to be invited to join the alliance, as a way
of promoting friendly ties.
	   After a breakfast meeting with the Polish foreign minister,
Secretary General Javier Solana said he hoped his visit would help
make ``relations between the countries of Europe not just a
formality,'' but rather a deeper ``human relationship.''
	   Solana reiterated that Poland will become a full NATO member in
April 1999, but that it will take part in NATO discussions before
that to ``land softly'' in the Alliance.
	   Poland, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, are expected
to become NATO members at its 50th anniversary meetings on April
24-25, 1999.
	   Solana arrived in Warsaw on Saturday with his wife, Conchita
Gimenez, and their 23-year old daughter Vega and 21-year-old son
Diego for a nine-day vacation.
	   He will visit the historical city of Krakow in southern Poland
and northern Gdansk, the birthplace of Solidarity trade union. He
also will meet with Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski on the
Baltic coast.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces overran another ethnic
Albanian stronghold Monday and pressed their attacks elsewhere in
Kosovo, after a weekend of fighting that displaced tens of
thousands of people.
	   The U.N. relief agency estimated 35,000 people had fled their
homes during the weekend, but the Red Cross reported finding twice
that number in one area alone.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources reported widespread fighting Monday
throughout Kosovo and said six villages had been leveled in the
rebellious province, where ethnic Albanian militants are fighting
for independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo's population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   Meanwhile, the government's Tanjug news agency said police
entered Smonica early Monday. Serb military sources said troops
shelled the village near the Albanian border for days and killed at
least a dozen Kovoso Liberation Army fighters.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued Monday to lay siege to
another border village, Junik. Independent media in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade said most KLA fighters had slipped out of the
village for sanctuaries in nearby Albania, leaving a few dozen
insurgents who have encircled their positions with land mines.
	   The latest fighting broke out only days after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic promised a European Union delegation last week
that the latest offensive against the KLA was over.
	   Milosevic also promised that international aid organizations
would be granted access to the refugees and that diplomatic
observers could escort them back to their homes.
	   But an official of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Mons
Nyberg, said access had been ``on and off,'' with police sometimes
holding his teams at checkpoints for hours before allowing them to
proceed.
	   He said it was unclear whether this was due to a ``lack of
communication or a systematic plan to stop of slow access.'' Nyberg
estimated at least 35,000 people had fled the weekend fighting,
swelling the total number of refugees to about 180,000 since the
government launched its crackdown on Albanian militants in
February.
	   In Geneva, Red Cross spokeswoman Amanda Williamson said a team
found between 60,000 and 80,000 refugees hiding on the slopes of
Mount Berisa south of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   She said the Red Cross was trying to organize an aid convoy from
Belgrade.
	   The campaign against Albanian civilians was reminiscent of
``ethnic cleansing'' _ the forcible removal of rival ethnic groups
that marked conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia
and Croatia earlier this decade.
	   In Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party courted by
the United States accused the Serb-led Yugoslav government of
trying ``to make it impossible for thousands of Albanians to return
to their homes.''
	   The statement was issued by the Albanian Democratic Movement,
whose leader, Mehmet Hajrizi, has been mentioned as a key figure in
a planned Albanian team that U.S. diplomats hope can negotiate the
future of the majority Albanian province with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has promised to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
canceled in 1989. But he and major world powers oppose independence
for Kosovo.
	   The United States and European nations fear independence could
lead to demands by Albanian-speaking communities in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, to establish a ``Greater
Albania'' in the southern Balkans.
	   KLA leaders are expected to announce this week whether they will
accept a U.S. plan for Albanian politicians to enter peace talks
with Milosevic. The current Serb offensive appears designed to
deliver a strong blow against the rebels and force them to
negotiate from a position of weakness.

Kosovo Albanians caught at Hungarian-Serb border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Forty-five Kosovo Albanians were
detained after entering Hungary illegally Monday in an attempt to
get to Austria and Germany, the state news agency MTI reported.
	   The group of 19 women, 15 men and 11 children was caught between
Morahalom and Asotthalom, two small settlements 160 kilometers (100
miles) southeast of Budapest.
	   They claimed they had paid 300 to 2,000 German marks (dlrs
150-1,000) to unidentified helpers to get to the West.
	   The illegal aliens were taken into border guards' custody.
Authorities have yet to decide their fate.
	   If they are determined to be war refugees, they will be given
haven at least for the duration of the conflict.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government forces overran another
ethnic Albanian stronghold Monday, pressing attacks which have
forced tens of thousands from their homes since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic declared the offensive over.
	   Senior U.S. envoy Christopher Hill called the offensive a
setback to American and European peace efforts and declared ``we
are on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   Serb and Albanian sources reported continued fighting Monday in
central and southern parts of the rebellious province. The
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said four people were killed
and several others, including an 80-year-old man, were wounded in
shelling Monday.
	   Six villages had been ``nearly leveled to the ground,'' the
Albanian center said.
	   Meanwhile, the government's Tanjug news agency said police
entered Smonica early Monday. Serb military sources said troops
shelled the village near the Albanian border for days and killed at
least a dozen Kovoso Liberation Army fighters.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued Monday to lay siege to

insurgents who have encircled their positions with land mines.
	   The latest fighting broke out only days after Milosevic promised
a European Union delegation last week that the latest offensive
against the KLA was over.
	   On Friday, Milosevic assured Hill that he would take ``personal
responsibility'' for assuring that international aid organizations
could deliver relief supplies to the refugees and that diplomatic
observers could escort them back to their homes.
	   Speaking to reporters in Pristina, Hill said he was waiting for
signs those promises would be fulfilled.
	   ``I'm not interested in anyone's assurances,'' he said. ``We
don't have facts on the grounds as far as I can see.''
	   An official of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Mons
Nyberg, said access had been ``on and off,'' with police sometimes
holding his teams at checkpoints for hours before allowing them to
proceed.
	   It was uncertain, he added, whether this was due to a ``lack of

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia International Shipping
Corp. Berhad said Monday it will launch service to Chittagong,
Bangladesh, this week.
	   MISC, Malaysia's leading international shipping line will send

Saturday. The ship is due in Chittagong Aug. 13 and back in Port
Klang Aug. 24, the company said in a statement.
	   The service is jointly operated with Xpress Feeders Group Ltd.,
with both providing one compatible geared vessel each.
	   Apart from promoting direct trade between Malaysia and
Bangladesh, the Chittagong-Port Klang service will encourage main
line operators to use Port Klang to transship cargo bound for

Spanish police detain 83 would-be immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Police detained 83 would-be immigrants
Monday including 57 they believed were trying to enter Spain
clandestinely after crossing the often treacherous Strait of
Gibraltar by night in rudimentary single-engine boats.
	   Police said they found between five and 10 kilograms of hashish
in one of the boats which was carrying 30 men. The 30 were brought
before court while police investigated who was responsoible for
smuggling the drug.
	   Twenty five men and two women traveled in the other boat. Both
vessels were spotted just off the coast from Carnero Point on
Spain's southern tip before 2 a.m. (0000 gmt), the police spokesman
said. He added that all 57 were Moroccan.
	   In a separate incident, police detained 22 Algerians and four
Moroccans found hidden in an Italian truck traveling towards the
French border early Monday.
	   Fleeing poverty at home, thousands of people attempt each year
to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa and enter unseen
into Europe. Almost all the would-be immigrants are men and most
are from Morocco.
	   Some 20 would-be immigrants are believed to have drowned when
their boat overturned close to the Spanish coast last week.
	   Those caught in Spain or trying to make the crossing are
repatriated.

Obese Chinese youngsters being shipped off to fat farms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Children in Shanghai are six times more likely to
be obese than their counterparts a decade ago, and many are being
shipped off to slimming camps for the summer, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported Monday.
	   The typical 10-14-year-old in China's largest city eats too much
junk food and watches too much television, while rarely exercising,
Xinhua said.
	   New statistics show one out of 100 children in Shanghai is
obese, 6.24 times the rate of a decade ago, Xinhua said.
	   During the weeklong slimming camps, children are roused at 6
a.m. for strenuous exercise in the stifling summer heat of China's
largest city, the agency said. Children are served special diets
planned by professional nutritionists, and junk food is banned at
the camps, it said.
	   Doctors lecture kids on the dangers of obesity and children are
required to wash their own clothes and make their own beds, chores
few are required to perform at home, it said.
	   China's policy of permitting most families just one child has
created a generation of overindulged only children, frequently
referred to as ``little emperors'' because of their tyrannical hold
on the affections of parents and grandparents.

Serbs press attacks in Kosovo after vowing that offensive is over

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces overran another ethnic
Albanian stronghold Monday and pressed their attacks elsewhere in
Kosovo, after a weekend of fighting that displaced tens of
thousands of people.
	   Senior U.S. envoy Christopher Hill called the offensive a
setback to American and European peace efforts and declared ``we
are on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   The U.N. relief agency estimated 35,000 people had fled their
homes during the weekend, but the Red Cross reported finding twice
that number in one area alone.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources reported widespread fighting Monday
throughout Kosovo and said six villages had been leveled in the
rebellious province, where ethnic Albanian militants are fighting
for independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo's population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   Meanwhile, the government's Tanjug news agency said police
entered Smonica early Monday. Serb military sources said troops
shelled the village near the Albanian border for days and killed at
least a dozen Kovoso Liberation Army fighters.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued Monday to lay siege to
another border village, Junik. Independent media in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade said most KLA fighters had slipped out of the
village for sanctuaries in nearby Albania, leaving a few dozen
insurgents who have encircled their positions with land mines.
	   The latest fighting broke out only days after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic promised a European Union delegation last week
that the latest offensive against the KLA was over.
	   On Friday, Milosevic assured Hill that he would take ``personal
responsibility'' for assuring that international aid organizations
could deliver relief supplies to the refugees and that diplomatic
observers could escort them back to their homes.
	   Speaking to reporters in Pristina, Hill said he was waiting for
signs those promises would be fulfilled.
	   ``I'm not interested in anyone's assurances,'' he said. ``We
don't have facts on the grounds as far as I can see.''
	   An official of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Mons
Nyberg, said access had been ``on and off,'' with police sometimes
holding his teams at checkpoints for hours before allowing them to
proceed.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Gunfire and rumors of government
instability echoed through Congo's capital of Kinshasa early Monday
morning as rival soldiers clashed in a military barracks and at a
second base while the government ordered the people off the
streets.
	   In eastern Congo, military leaders have reportedly revolted
against President Laurent Kabila and called for his ouster.
	   A dawn-to-dusk curfew has been imposed on Kinshasa and troops
loyal to Kabila began a massive search for Rwandan Tutsi soldiers,
who were the president's one-time allies.
	   A defense ministry official said loyalist troops had been
ordered to kill any Rwandan soldiers found hiding in and around the
city.
	   The sound of gunfire was heard coming from Camp Kokolo military
base and the Tshatshi barracks on Kinshasa's west side.
	   The clashes apparently pitted Kabila's troops against Rwandan
mercenaries, who last year helped the president oust longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The fighting comes amid growing suspicions within Kabila's
government that the Rwandan troops had been plotting against the
regime.
	   In the Rwandan capital, Kigali, a private news agency reported
an open rebellion against Kabila had been launched in North Kivu
province in eastern Congo.
	   ``We, the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
taken the decision to remove President Laurent Desire Kabila from
power,'' said a communique read Sunday in French and Swahili over
Radio Goma, according to the private Rwandan News Agency.
	   The communique was signed by Sylvain Mbuchi, commander of the
10th battalion of the Congolese army based in Goma, the provincial
capital, RNA said.
	   The communique called on the local population to remain calm and
go about their daily business and assured residents that the goal
of the rebels was to ``preserve the unity and security of the whole
nation.''
	   The crisis comes one week after Kabila ordered all Rwandan
soldiers out of his country without explanation. Earlier, Kabila
sacked James Kabari, a Rwandan Tutsi who had been the president's
top military commander.
	   Although Rwandan troops played an important role last year in
helping Kabila oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, relations
between the central African countries have soured in recent months.
	   According to a defense ministry official, more than 1,000
Rwandan Tutsi soldiers fled the Kokolo base and are hiding in a
forest just outside of Kinshasa.
	   The country's finance minister, who was arrested last week and
then released, said he was questioned about whether Rwandan
soldiers still in Kinshasa had been planning a coup against Kabila.
	   ``I was questioned about rumors of a putsch attempt,'' said
former Finance Minister Ferdinand Tala-Ngai.
	   Kabila has been growing anxious about the presence of Rwandan
forces in Kinshasa, and weeks before ordering them to leave he
increased security around government buildings.
	   Tanks were deployed in front of the presidential residence and
office compound while troops were stationed at key ministry
buildings.
	   The sound of fighting Monday triggered an order by the
government to clear the streets.
	   ``The government asks the people of Congo and those foreigners
here in the country to stay calm and to stay at home until order is
restored,'' said an abrupt announcement Monday morning on
state-controlled People's Radio. ``Stay at home just until that
time when the armed forces of Congo reestablish civil order.''
	   Shops throughout the capital remained closed Monday morning, and
people who had headed downtown for work early in the morning were
quickly returning home.
	   Speculation was rife over the stability of Kabila's government
after weeks of growing tension between the president, his top
advisers and what now appears to be a shaky military alliance with
neighboring Rwanda.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Ending months of political
wrangling and speculation, ministers of the Netherlands' new
coalition government were sworn in Monday and introduced to the
nation.
	   Signaling the beginning of their administration, giddy new
Cabinet ministers posed for photos with Dutch Queen Beatrix outside
her Noordeinde Palace in The Hague.
	   Prime Minister Wim Kok returns for a second term to lead the
so-called Purple Coalition, referring to the spectrum of political
colors that make up the alliance.
	   The new team has two female deputy prime ministers, marking the
the first time in Dutch political history that women have held that
position. They are former Transport Minister Annemarie Jorritsma,
who will serve as economic affairs minister, and Els Borst, a
veteran politician who will serve a second term as health minister.
	   The coalition, which includes Kok's left-leaning Labor Party,
the right-leaning Liberal Party and the centrist Democrats 66
party, has governed for the last four years.
	   Coalition governments have ruled for the past 80 years in the
Netherlands, where there are a dozen sizable parties, none of which
has been able to garner enough votes to take control outright.
	   Since general elections in May, leaders of the three top parties
had huddled in talks to formulate a new blueprint for the
government and reshuffle the 15-member Cabinet to bring in new
leaders.
	   Missing from the new team are some of the most visible ministers
from the last government, including former Foreign Minister Hans
van Mierlo and Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager.
	   But the Cabinet has some familiar faces. In addition to Borst
and Jorritsma, Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm _ credited by many for
helping the Netherlands' cut its budget deficit and qualify to join
Europe's single currency _ returns to his old job.
	   Former Agriculture Minister Jozias van Aartsen, who oversaw the
country's efforts to contain an economically devastating outbreak
of swine fever, was promoted as the new foreign minister.
	   The trouble-ridden Justice Ministry portfolio was handed to
newcomer Benk Korthals, who faces a slew of leftover controversies
from the last administration, including a Dutch child pornography
ring operating on the Internet.
	   ``I see it as a challenge,'' said Korthals, a lawyer.

Indian shelling kills three more people in Pakistani Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Shelling by Indian troops killed
three more people, including two children, in the
Pakistan-controlled area of Kashmir on Monday, raising the number
of Pakistanis killed in the shelling during the last five days to
54, army officials said.
	   Two children were killed when Indian forces launched shells at
Atmaqam in Neelam Valley, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
Muzaffarabad, the capitol of Pakistan-held Kashmir. Another man was
killed in shelling in Bhimber sector near the border, they said.
	   The number of deaths were low because most people had fled from
the border villages and the intensity of India's shelling has
eased, the officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Indian army officials say 34 Indians, most of them civilians,
were killed by Pakistani forces. Pakistan says most of its
casualties were civilian.
	   Witnesses say dozens of people have also been wounded and
thousands displaced on both sides of Kashmir. India and Pakistan
each accuse the other of starting the bombardment.
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir, the
Himalayan territory divided between them, since the countries
gained independence in 1947 from British rule.
	   Pakistan demands a right of self determination for Kashmiri
people, which is the only Muslim majority area in Hindu dominated
India.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming Muslim militants fighting for
Kashmir's independence. Pakistan denies the charge and say it
offers only moral and political help.

Agency: eastern Congo in open rebellion against Kabila
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Diplomatique in 9th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ North Kivu Province in eastern Congo is in
open rebellion against the government of President Laurent Kabila,
the Rwandan News Agency said Monday.
	   ``We, the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
taken the decision to remove President Laurent Desire Kabila from
power,'' said a communique read Sunday in French and Swahili over
Radio Goma, according to the private news agency.
	   The communique was signed by Sylvain Mbuchi, commander of the
10th batallion of the Congolese army based in Goma, the provincial
capital, RNA said.
	   Officers and troops from the Rwandan Patriotic Army were
instrumental in launching and carrying out the eight-month
rebellion that brought Kabilia to power in the former Zaire in May
1997 and ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   In Kigali, Rwandan government spokesman Maj. Wilson Rutaisire
told The Associated Press no Rwandan troops were involved in the
current rebellion because they had all left the Congo last week at
Kabila's request.
	   However, he acknowledged that the departure of the unspecified
number of Rwandan troops may have played a role in the current
unrest.
	   ``The departure of our troops from Congo may have removed the
control that they had so that the conflict and the difference
(among ethnic groups in eastern Congo) could surface,'' Rutasire
said. ``This might have really contributed to the escalation of
conflicts they had there.''
	   Analysts have been predicting major problems in North and South
Kivu for some time because of the competition for land and power
among the Banyamulenge and other ethnic Tutsis who have lived in
the region for generations with ethnic Hutus _ also originally from
Rwanda _ and the so-called indigenous tribes like the Bahunde, the
Banyanga and the Babembe.
	   Writing in the July issue of Le Monde Diplomatique, French
researcher Gerard Prunier said Kivu was on the verge of explosion,
``and no one is looking for scissors to cut the fuse.''
	   The rebel communique called on the local population to remain
calm and go about their daily business and assured residents that
the goal of the rebels was to ``preserve the unity and security of
the whole nation.''
	   The communique called on politicians in the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, to meet urgently and find a way of organizing good
leadership.
	   RNA said the airport in Goma was closed Monday and that a call
went out to residents and aid workers in the town just across from
the Rwandan city of Gisenyi to hand over all radio communications
equipment to security posts.
	   The agency said there were unconfirmed reports of similar
rebellions in Bukavu, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Goma and
the capital of South Kivu province, and in Kindu, the capital of
Maniema province, 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Bukavu.

Israel considering release of Palestinian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Dozens of families of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails marched in the Gaza Strip on Monday,
chanting ``No peace without the release of our sons.''
	   The march came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
reportedly met with Cabinet ministers to discuss the possibility of
releasing 100 Palestinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat, said he had given Netanyahu a list of 120 prisoners the
Palestinian Authority wanted released as soon as possible.
	   About 100 relatives of prisoners marched from the offices of the
Red Cross to Arafat's office in Gaza City on Monday, carrying
posters of their sons and chanting ``No peace without the release
of our sons,'' and ``Netanyahu, you cannot humiliate us.''
	   Hisham Abdel Razig, a Palestinian legislator who deals with the
prisoner issue, headed a small delegation that met with Arafat
following the march.
	   ``President Arafat ... told us that there cannot be a
comprehensive peace without the release of all the Palestinian and
Arab prisoners in the Israeli jails,'' he said.
	   According to the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Netanyahu
supports the prisoner release and has asked police minister Avigdor
Kahalani to draw up a list of prisoners to be freed.
	   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were scheduled to meet later
Monday to continue discussing the long overdue Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and other unresolved issues.

News agency says Odai's attackers captured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi security forces have captured the men
who shot and seriously wounded President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son Odai in 1996, the official Iraqi News Agency reported Monday.
	   The agency said the General Directorate of Security would issue
a statement later in the day with ``the details of this criminal
operation ... as it was revealed by the criminals themselves.''
	   INA said the statement will show how the assailants pursued Odai
and then shot him in his car.
	   The agency did not say how many assailants were taken into
custody or when and where they were apprehended. Nor did it give
any details of their identities.
	   Odai, 34. was shot about 10 times on Dec. 12, 1996, while he
waited alone in his car in the upscale Al-Mansoura neighborhood in
the capital Baghdad.
	   In April last year, surgeons operated on his shattered left leg.
He has since been shown on state-run television walking with the
aid of a cane.
	   Iraq blamed Iran for the attack. Iran denied involvement.
	   Two opposition groups claimed responsibility for the attack: the
Iranian-backed Al-Dawa Party, a Shiite opposition group, and the
Mohammed Madhlum al-Dulaimi Group, named after an Iraqi air force
general executed for plotting against Saddam.

Philippine judge fixes execution date despite court prohibition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Despite Supreme Court orders, a judge
has set a date this week for the first execution under a 1994 law
that restored the death penalty in the Philippines, the justice
secretary said Monday.
	   The judge set Friday for a lethal injection for Leo Echegaray,
who was convicted of twice raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter in
1994, said Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas.
	   Cuevas said, however, the government could not carry out the
execution until the Supreme Court lifts an indefinite prohibition
it imposed while considering a petition questioning the
constitutionality of the death penalty law.
	   No reason was mentioned for setting the Friday execution date.
	   The current Philippine constitution, adopted in 1987, abolished
the death penalty, but a law that took effect in January 1994
restored it for 13 ``heinous crimes'' including rape, murder and
drug trafficking.
	   Echegaray's lawyers have petitioned the Supreme Court to declare
the law unconstitutional, arguing that lethal injection, the chosen
mode of execution, is inhuman.
	   Death sentences are automatically reviewed by the Supreme Court,
which so far has affirmed only a few of the more than 600 handed
down by lower courts.
	   Last year, the Supreme Court approved Echegaray's execution
between February and August this year. In February, however, it
stopped a lower court from fixing a specific date until it has
ruled on the petition.
	   Cuevas said the Supreme Court could issue a ruling on the
petition before the end of the month to satisfy the deadline it set
for Echegaray's execution.
	   Several groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, have
opposed the death penalty, saying the crime rate has not declined
despite the restoration of capital punishment. The groups say the
death penalty also discriminates against the poor, and that many
death-row inmates may have been convicted because they could not
afford good lawyers.
	   Proponents, however, say the penalty has not yet sent its
message to would-be criminals because no one has been executed
under the 1994 law. They also say the law has enough legal
safeguards to prevent the execution of innocent people.

Gillespie transfer falls through
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Northern Ireland international
Keith Gillespie's proposed 3.5 million pound (dlrs 5.75 million)
transfer from Newscastle to Middlesbrough fell through Monday when
he failed a medical.
	   Gillespie had agreed terms for a five-year deal with 'Boro but
the club withdrew its offer due to concerns over an ankle injury
the player sustained before last season's FA Cup final.
	   The 23-year-old had planned to partner ex-England international
Paul Gascoigne in midfield for Middlesbrough but will now stay with
Newcastle.
	   Newcastle criticized Middlesbrough's handling of the proposed
transfer after news of the deal was released before Newcastle boss
Kenny Dalglish had been notified or Gillespie had undertaken the
medical.

Death toll from floods rises to 59; about 60 still missing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number of deaths, missing in 1st graf, more details in
grafs 15-16 &QL; 
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Fresh rains turned mountain streams
into raging torrents Monday, hampering the search for 60 people
known missing in floods in South Korea. The death toll rose to 59
as more bodies were recovered.
	   As rescuers probed downstream river bottoms, they confronted
grim scenes from South Korea's worst natural disaster in years:
Three children trapped and killed in a submerged car; the bodies of
a grandmother and a 7-year-old boy tangled in flood debris.
	   President Kim Dae-jung urged 42,000 soldiers, police and
firefighters to step up their search and rescue efforts, praising
them for heroism.
	   One firefighter was critically injured Monday when a helicopter
heading for the disaster scene was buffeted by a sudden rain shower
and crashed in a rice paddy. Another rescuer drowned Sunday after
jumping into a surging stream to save others.
	   Relief operations centered around scenic Mount Chiri National
Park, where all but eight of the dead and missing were lost or
stranded by floods triggered by heavy rains Saturday.
	   Rescuers, aided by helicopters, cranes and other heavy
machinery, cleared a path through landslides and reached deeper
into the park, where dozens of campers were still believed
stranded. They later used ropes and pulleys to bring 35 college
students across raging torrents to safety.
	   Officials expected the number of deaths to rise as more families
reported missing relatives.
	   ``Many people call to reports missing people. But we don't count
all of them in our list because some families don't know where
their relatives went on vacation,'' said Lim Jae-woon, a Home
Ministry official.
	   A front moving east from China dumped up to 30 centimeters (12
inches) of rain in less than three hours early Saturday, engulfing
hundreds of sleeping campers in flash floods in the park 220
kilometers (135 miles) south of Seoul.
	   Police said whole families camping along normally placid streams
were swept away. Some bodies were found washed up on coastal
beaches 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, raising fears that many of
the missing will never be found.
	   ``We are expanding our search further downstream, but our
operations are slow because of occasional heavy rains. Upstream,
it's almost impossible to venture into those wild streams,'' said
Kwon Ki-hwan, a official at the government's Disaster Relief
Headquarters.
	   TV footage showed flood-swept camping sites littered with
crumpled tents, overturned cars and other debris. Family members
searched hospital morgues for missing relatives.
	   Local news media were filled with harrowing tales from
survivors. A father disappeared under floodwaters after helping his
7-year-old son cling for hours to a tree branch while friends
worked feverishly to build a makeshift bridge to the pair. The son
was saved.
	   Another man pulled two children from a flooded ravine, then was
swept away himself by the swirling waters.
	   State-run KBS-TV showed an injured camper in hospital uniform
nervously following rescuers and bursting into tears when he found
his wrecked car, which had been swept away with his wife in it.
	   The body of his wife was found later and taken to a hospital
morgue. The man, identified only by his surname Park, collapsed on
to the body, crying along with his relatives there.
	   As of Monday, 1,600 marooned people had been rescued from the
national park, police said.
	   Also Monday, President Kim ordered the Cabinet to revamp the
nation's disaster warning system. Saturday's rains had not been
forecast by the National Weather Service.
	   The downpours submerged homes and farmland, washed away roads
and triggered landslides. As communications with remote areas were
restored, property damage estimates climbed to dlrs 60 million
Monday.

Spain rejects asylum petition from Honduran fugitive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain has turned down a petition for
political asylum from an ex-Honduran military officer wanted at
home for his alleged links to a death squad blamed for
assassinating hundreds of suspected rebel sympathizers in the
1980s, the Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   Former army captain Billy Joya arrived in Spain last week and
sought asylum to avoid being deported to Honduras, a ministry
spokesman, customarily not identified, said. He added that Joya
would not be deported immediately as his lawyers had appealed the
decision.
	   Joya has evaded capture since a Honduran judge ordered his
arrest in 1995 on charges of kidnapping and torturing six
university students in 1982. Other police officers suspected in the
same kidnap-torture case are also on the run.
	   The case is a landmark in civilian efforts to assert control
over the military, which ruled Honduras from 1963 to 1981 and
retained great autonomy afterwards.
	   The Foreign ministry spokesman said Honduras had not yet asked
for Joya's extradition.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with AIDS and other immune disease
sufferers accustomed to boiling water; increases safe water zone &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ More than 3 million Sydney residents
have learned what it's like to have to boil water to make it safe
to drink _ but people with immune systems weakened by AIDS and
other diseases have been doing it for years.
	   An outbreak of the potentially deadly microscopic parasites
giardia and cryptosporidium detected last week panicked
Sydneysiders, who are boiling drinking water or buying bottled
water.
	   It was a severe embarrassment for the city that will be host to
the 200 Summer Olympics in just two years.
	   Fear and anger among city residents has continued since the
dangerous parasites were found.
	   ``Opening the tap and drinking water is something we take for
granted, and what has happened with the water makes me understand
what people in Third World countries go through,'' said Sydney
resident Rick Turansky.
	   The Health Department said so far there had been no reported
cases of illness from water contamination, but the parasites have
an incubation period of a week or more.
	   The water treatment plant that had spread the parasites has been
cleaned up and the city's water system is being flushed with clean
water.
	   By Monday night, 104 suburbs in the west and south of the city,
housing more than 600,000 of the city's 3.7 million people, had
been given the all-clear to resume drinking tap water.
	   But Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles could not say when the
rest of Sydney would be able to stop boiling drinking water or
relying on bottled water.
	   Giardia and cryptosporidium are most dangerous to people who
already have weakened immune systems.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee in 1993,
contributing to the deaths of about 100 people. More than 400,000
others became ill.
	   Those who died were mostly the elderly, infants, people
recovering from surgery and those with immune systems weakened by
AIDS, the HIV virus, lymphoma, cancer chemotherapy or hepatitis.
	   Many people in Sydney with those problems had already been
taking precautions against water contamination even before the
parasite crisis struck.
	   ``There are obviously special problems for people with any
compromised immune system, but we have taken precautions for a long
time before this. The threat of cryptosporidium has been around for
a long time,'' said Jo Watson, a research officer with the group
People Living with HIV/AIDS.
	   ``As far as we're aware, there hasn't been any increase in
reports of people with HIV/AIDS being affected by giardia or
crypto.
	   ``There's no need to go into a panic about this. Giardia is
easily treated with antibiotic tablets, and our community has been
aware of crypto for a long time,'' she said.
	   Cryptosporidium does not respond to antibiotics.
	   There are some 6,000 to 7,000 AIDS/HIV positive people in the
state of New South Wales, and the great majority live in Sydney,
the heart of Australia's gay community, Watson said.
	   Authorities found a number of dead dogs and foxes in canals near
the water plant, but Knowles said it was not clear if they caused
the problem.
	   ``It may be the case that we never find the source of
contamination,'' he said.
	   The runoff of polluted water from farms in the water catchment
area has also been proposed as a possible source of the
contamination.
	   Giardia can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms. Both are naturally
occurring parasites in the intestinal tracts of mammals, and are
normally spread through fecal matter.

Forest fire sends cloud over Athens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with children's home, military hospital evacuated. No
pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 150 firefighters struggled
Monday to control a wind-whipped forest fire that threatened a
German World War II cemetery and sent a cloud of reddish smoke over
central Athens.
	   The blaze began late Sunday at the foot of Mount Pendeli about
four kilometers (2 1/2 miles) northeast of Athens' northern
suburbs, officials said.
	   Authorities evacuated a home for disabled children and an army
hospital. A main road in the area was closed, reports said.
	   Four planes and a Chinook helicopter assisted 155 firefighters
battling the blaze as it swept towards the village of Rapentosa,
and a cemetery for German soldiers killed during World War II.
	   But strong winds hampered firefighting efforts from the air,
local media reported, with planes unable to continue flights for
long.
	   No injuries due to the fire were reported. Blazes in the area in
past years have left much of the mountainside a landscape of
charred stumps.
	   Several other fires also raged around Greece, with a blaze on
the 2,900-meter (9,570-foot) Mount Olympus in northern Greece
entering its third week. The fire on the legendary home of the
ancient gods has destroyed 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) of forest
so far, local media reported.
	   Two weeks ago, three firefighters and a volunteer firefighter
were killed battling a blaze that scorched the eastern edge of
Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades, with fires burning daily for the past month.

forced their way into the embassy Saturday.
	   The 12 were among a group of some 300 Africans who occupied the
Saint Bernard church in Paris for two months in 1996. The Africans
were without residence permits.
	   Police stormed the church and expelled the group, but many have
since become legal residents of France.
	   The Saint Bernard group now serves as a model for other illegal
immigrants seeking papers to remain in France.
	   The Vatican said its embassy was asking French authorities ``to
review the cases'' of the occupiers.

King Fahd undergoing tests, reported in stable condition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ King Fahd was to undergo tests in a
Riyadh hospital on Monday, a day after he was admitted for
observation, a medical official said.
	   ``The king is in a stable condition and there is nothing to
worry about,'' said the official, who spoke only on condition his
name not be used.
	   The official said a medical team at the King Faisal Specialist
Hospital in Riyadh would perform tests on the monarch later Monday.
	   After the test results are in, the team will decide when the
king can be discharged, the official said. He added that King Fahd
was not expected to remain in the hospital for long.
	   He did not reveal the nature of the king's medical problems.
	   Diplomats in Saudi Arabia had said Sunday that the king was
taken to the hospital for treatment of an illness. But the medical
official said the king merely was undergoing routine medical tests.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to Crown Prince Abdullah, his
half-brother.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was admitted to the hospital on
Sunday after being flown to Riyadh from from the Red Sea city of
Jiddah.
	   He was accompanied by two of his sons and his brothers, Prince
Sultan and Prince Salman. They later were joined by Crown Prince
Abdullah. State-run television showed Fahd shaking hands with
relatives.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   Fahd has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   He was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

New case of mad cow disease in France; 127 cattle destroyed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities slaughtered a herd of 127 cattle
over the weekend, after detecting a new case of mad cow disease,
the Agriculture Ministry said Monday.
	   The infected animal was a milk cow on a farm in the Manche
region, on France's northern coast. It was born in July 1989.
	   The ministry said in a statement that it was the 38th case of
mad cow disease discovered in France since 1990, and the seventh
this year.
	   The disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was first
detected in 1985. The ailment eats holes in the brain, causing
cattle to stagger and drool. There is no cure.
	   Scientists believe the mad cow disease may be linked to an
equally fatal human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

German opposition calls for abandoning atomic energy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with government reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Warning of dire economic consequences,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government and Germany's atomic energy
industry Monday attacked plans by the Social Democrats to start
closing nuclear power plants if they win national elections this
fall.
	   Government spokesman Otto Hauser said SPD demands for pulling
out of atomic energy as quickly as possible were ``not thought
through and besides that, damaging to Germany's business climate.''
	   Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt warned such a move would mean
``a withdrawal of German business from the technological
world-league and endanger a massive number of jobs.''
	   According to this week's Der Spiegel newsmagazine, if the Social
Democrats win the Sept. 27 parliamentary elections, they plan to
order the six oldest of Germany's 19 atomic power plants closed by
2002 and the last by 2028.
	   Michael Donnermeyer, a spokesman for the Social Democrats,
refused to comment on the timetable, noting only that the party's
campaign platform calls for ending the use of atomic power ``as
quickly as possible.''
	   PreussenElektra chief Hans-Dieter Harig told the Bild newspaper
that he would seek ``not insignificant'' damages from the federal
government if the Social Democrats start ordering the early closure
of atomic power plants.
	   ``More than a third of the power is produced in German atomic
power plants,'' he said. ``We can't just suddenly do without that.
It would be economic recklessness to shut down atomic power plants
before the end of their technical and economic lifespan.''
	   Hauser noted that the Social Democrats' chancellor candidate,
Gerhard Schroeder, sits on the board of PreussenElektra as governor
of Lower Saxony state, which gets 60 percent of its electricity
from nuclear power.
	   Technology Minister Juergen Ruettgers added Germany needs atomic
power to meet clean-air goals.
	   But the Social Democrats' environmental policy spokesman in
parliament, Michael Mueller, said recent reports of radiation leaks
during atomic waste transports demonstrated that a basic condition
is lacking for atomic energy _ the safe disposal of the waste.
	   ``The atomic power plants are like a jumbo jet that's in the air
without a landing strip having been built,'' he told German radio.

Poll finds low support for new Japanese Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The newly formed Cabinet of Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi was supported by less than one-third of voters questioned in
a weekend poll, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The poll, by the newspaper Asahi, found 32 percent support for
Obuchi's Cabinet, with 47 percent of those polled saying they do
not support the new administration. That figure was the worst
disapproval rating for a new Cabinet since the paper began taking
polls on the subject in 1955, excluding the brief, scandal-tainted
government of Prime Minister Sousuke Uno in 1989.
	   ``I am taking (the results) seriously,'' Obuchi was quoted as
saying by Kyodo News service.
	   Obuchi said, however, it is more important to study what the
government can do for the public than seeking ways to raise
popularity ratings, Kyodo added.
	   Obuchi, president of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
unveiled his Cabinet last Thursday after winning an election in
Parliament to become Japan's next leader.
	   He faces immediate pressure to quickly pull Japan's struggling
economy out of recession.
	   Separately, Chief Cabinet Spokesman Hiromu Nonaka was quoted as
saying that a popularity rating of around 30 percent gives the
Cabinet more incentive to ``do our best.''
	   ``The government, with Prime Minister Obuchi at the head, will
try to meet public expectations and get through the current
difficulties to raise public support,'' Nonaka was quoted as saying
by Kyodo.
	   The paper surveyed 1,130 registered voters Saturday and Sunday.
It provided no margin of error.
	   The Asahi survey follows one published Sunday by the Yomiuri,
Japan's largest newspaper, which put the Cabinet's approval rating
at a slightly higher 33.1 percent.

Right-wing paper loses second printer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHUR, Switzerland (AP) _ A newspaper owned by the leader of a
far-right Swiss Italian party on Monday lost its second printer in
a week over allegations of anti-Semitism.
	   Gasser Print AG of Chur, which was due to start printing Il
Mattino della Domenica, said it decided over the weekend to cancel
its contract to print the paper.
	   Giuliano Bignasca, leader of the Lega dei Ticinesi, is currently
under investigation for alleged anti-Semitic articles in the
free-distribution Sunday paper, which he claims has a circulation
of 40,000 in the southern canton (state) of Ticino.
	   The contract was entered into before the charges emerged, Gasser
Print said in a statement.
	   Last week, the previous printer, Vogt Schild of Solothurn, said
it had pulled out its contract. The firm cited the charges against
Bignasca as the reason.
	   Bignasca has railed in recent weeks against threats of sanctions
by U.S. states and cities against Switzerland over its handling of
Holocaust victims' assets.
	   The paper has said the U.S. policy is being directed by Jews who
hold key positions in the Clinton administration. The July 5
edition listed 60 U.S. officials whom it identified as being
Jewish.
	   The regional anti-immigrant party has one seat in the 200-member
lower house of parliament. It received some 12 percent of the vote
in the most recent regional vote in Ticino, Switzerland's only
Italian-speaking state.
	   Over the years Bignasca has been sentenced a number of times for
slander and drug-related offenses.
	   Last month, a Swiss court ordered fines and prison terms under
Switzerland's 1995 anti-racism law for an author and his publisher
for producing books denying the existence of the Nazi gas chambers.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed men in military fatigues stopped a
bus at a fake roadblock, then slit the throats of passengers and
the driver, killing 12 people, authorities announced Monday.
	   After the attack Sunday afternoon, at least 12 suspected Islamic
militants were killed by the army as it searched for the attackers,
authorities said in a statement. Although some attackers were
caught, they said, a search operation was continuing Monday.
	   The attack came as a U.N. panel continued its mission in
Algeria, looking into the massacres and bombings that have killed
an estimated 75,000 people since the Islamic insurgency began in
1992.
	   The mission, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares,
met Monday with President Liamine Zeroual. No details of the
meeting were immediately available.
	   Six people were wounded in Sunday's massacre near Saida, 400
kilometers (250 miles) southwest of the capital, Algiers.
	   It began when the armed group signaled the bus to stop. The
suspicious driver speeded up instead, but was forced off the road
by a volley of machine-gun fire, according to witnesses and
hospital sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Once the bus was stopped, the attackers moved in, slitting the
throats of some passengers, according to the sources.

Rescue workers fight against time to save trapped workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Rescue efforts were underway Monday to
save more than 20 workers trapped underneath a collapsed building
near the Nigerian capital Abuja.
	   At least one dead body had already been removed from the site of
the accident which occurred Sunday when the first floor of a
building under construction suddenly collapsed and trapped workers
on the ground floor, witnesses told reporters.
	   The collapsed building was part of a huge housing complex
sponsored by the state-owned Federal Housing Estate, about 20
kilometers (12 miles) from Abuja.
	   At the time of the incident, independent sub-contractors were
overseeing construction work going on simultaneously on both the
ground and first floors.
	   One survivor, James Okolo, who was in the bathroom when the
accident occurred, told reporters he went along to the site to
``earn a little bit of money instead of sitting at home.''
	   ``Suddenly the top platform collapsed. It happened with such
speed that those on the ground floor did not have a chance at
all,'' Okolo said.
	   Despite the involvement of leading construction companies in
Abuja, rescue efforts Monday morning were being hampered by a lack
of heavy duty cranes to lift the huge concrete slabs under which
the men were buried.
	   Officials for the firm who allegedly bolted from the site
immediately after the incident, were unavailable for comment.
	   Construction accidents are fairly common in Nigeria, where
corruption and incompetence have led to a lack of accountability
within the sector.

Disgraced by drug scandal, cycling ponders its future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Flat tire or broken frame?
	   The scandal-plagued Tour de France is over. Now the sport of
cycling is coming to terms with the task of rebuilding its tattered
image.
	   Other sports, like track and swimming, have been rocked by drug
revelations. But none depends so heavily on a single event for its
global reputation: for many, the Tour de France IS cycling.
	   Right now, the sport is in a state of shock. The question is:
Can it bounce back?
	   ``In the short term, we will suffer badly from this crisis and
our image will suffer,'' says Daniel Baal, vice president of the
International Cycling Union (UCI), the sport's governing body.
``But we can rebound positively. The sport is strong enough.''
	   Aware that the sponsors bankrolling cycling could turn their
backs on the sport, governing federations are pledging to redouble
their efforts to stamp out the use of illegal substances.
	   They hope that now that the problem is public, it will be easier
to tackle.
	   But at the same time, cycling officials recognize that
eradicating doping is virtually impossible. Drugs like EPO, which
increases oxygen to red blood cells, can't be detected, and new
substances are being developed faster than ever.
	   Organizers insist there is no thought of canceling next year's
race, or even making any major changes for the moment.
	   They reject suggestions that cyclists need to use illegal
substances because the course is too grueling.
	   ``The tour will continue as normal,'' said John Lelangue,
spokesman for the Tour. I've heard the cyclists say that if
anything, some of the stages are too easy.''
	   But the Tour's travails have already sparked wider debate, with
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
calling for a reduction in the number of banned substances in
sports, and proposing an international conference to seek new ways
of tackling the problem.
	   The UCI also said Monday that it will hold a ``brainstorming
conference'' this week between some of its top officials, cyclists
and team managers to examine the issue of doping.
	   Cycling is already as thorough as any other sport in testing
competitors _ it was the first to introduce blood tests, for
instance.
	   ``Drug controls in cycling are already stronger than for any
other sport. That's the worrying thing,'' said Alan Rushton,
managing director of Sport For TV, which organized the Irish leg of
the 1998 Tour de France.
	   ``I would estimate that 50 percent of all global sports testing
is carried out on cyclists.''
	   Tour de France drug scandals are nothing new. Back in 1967,
British cyclist Tommy Simpson died on a climb up Mont Ventoux after
taking amphetamines.
	   ``The problem has been known within cycling for a long time. It
is part of its history,'' James Startt, a former member of the U.S.
cycling team, told The Associated Press.
	   But the problem clearly has gotten worse in recent years.
	   From day one, the 1998 Tour was dominated by drug revelations.
	   Six teams pulled out, protesting police tactics, while one,
Festina, was expelled after admitting systematic doping.
	   Italian cyclist Rodolfo Massi became the seventh person _ and
the first cyclist _ to be placed under formal investigation during
the Tour.
	   Infighting hasn't helped.
	   In a column for the German daily Bild last Friday, 1997 Tour
champion Jan Ullrich attacked some of his fellow pros, including
Laurent Jalabert and Luc Leblanc, for pulling out of the race once
they had no chance of winning.
	   ``A great race has been stolen from all of us,'' he said.
``Inside, I'm deeply angry at Festina, at the justice, and also at
pros like Jalabert and Leblanc. They failed at the Tour and now
they're stirring up trouble prematurely.''
	   Teams are aware of the impact of this year's scandal.
	   ``It's a shame for the audience, it's a shame for the cyclists,
it's a shame for everyone involved,'' said Dan Osipow, director of
operations for Montgomery Sports, which runs and manages the U.S.
Postal Service team.
	   Startt called it ``one of the darkest periods in the history of
cycling.''
	   But he added: ``Some good will come out of this. If it doesn't,
we really are in a sorry state.''

	   REIMS, France (AP) _ A day after the Tour de France ended in
Paris, members of the Dutch team TVM were being questioned by
police Monday about banned drugs found in their possession.
	   TVM team members had pulled out of the race on Friday, two days
before the ending, saying they had neither the physical nor the
mental strength to continue.
	   Six cyclists, along with other team staff members, were being
questioned Monday morning in Reims, north of Paris. Already the
team director, Cees Priem, and its doctor, Andrei Mikhailov, and a
masseur have been placed under formal investigation _ a step short
of being formally charged _ on doping charges.
	   Team official Guido Calster emerged early afternoon after being
questioned, and said the team had been ``treated well.'' He said
they were being asked ``personal questions.''

Iraq says attackers of son of Saddam Hussein captured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi security forces have captured the men
who shot and seriously wounded President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son Odai in 1996, the official Iraqi News Agency reported Monday.
	   The agency said the General Directorate of Security would issue
a statement later with ``the details of this criminal operation ...
as it was revealed by the criminals themselves.''
	   The Iraqi agency said the statement will show how the assailants
pursued Odai and then shot him in his car. The agency did not say
how many assailants were taken into custody or when and where they
were apprehended. Nor did it give any details of their identities.
	   Odai, 34, was shot about 10 times on Dec. 12, 1996, while he
waited alone in his car in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.
	   In April 1997, surgeons operated on his shattered left leg. He
has since been shown on state-run television walking with the aid
of a cane.
	   Iraq blamed Iran for the attack. Iran denied involvement.
	   Two opposition groups claimed responsibility for the attack: the
Iranian-backed Al-Dawa Party, a Shiite opposition group, and the
Mohammed Madhlum al-Dulaimi Group, named after an Iraqi air force
general executed for plotting against Saddam.

South Africa prepared for Angola peacekeeping if asked
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Defense Minister Joe Modise on
Monday accused Angola's UNITA movement of resuming hostilities and
said South Africa was willing to participate in a U.N. peacekeeping
operation in Angola.
	   Tensions between UNITA and the Angolan government have surged in
recent weeks, culminating in the massacre of more than 100
civilians in a remote northern village.
	   ``The information we are getting is to the effect that both
sides are preparing for conflict,'' Modise said. ``I think it's no
secret that UNITA has been on the offensive in some towns.''
	   Regional leaders last week demanded that Angola's UNITA movement
complete demobilizing their forces and take all their elected
positions in government, as set out in a 1994 peace accord.
	   Modise said that if the United Nations asked South Africa to
send troops, the government would consult with fellow Southern
African Development Community member countries and, if the SADC
agreed, would send its forces.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils faulted the Organization
for African Unity and SADC states for their weak response todate to
the Angola crisis.
	   ``One doesn't see that energetic a role in terms of these
countries, with all due respect,'' Kasrils told reporters.
	   U.N. special envoy to Angola Lakhdar Brahimi was due to leave
the southwest African country Wednesday for a tour of neighboring
states and talks with leaders close to President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   Soon after it won independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola
plunged into civil war. It became a Cold War battlefield, pitting
UNITA _ backed by the United States and former apartheid South
Africa _ against the then-Marxist government, supported by Cuba and
other left-wing governments.
	   Recalling those times, a Johannesburg daily reported Monday that
300 South African mercenaries are supporting UNITA, a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
	   The Star quoted unnamed intelligence sources in South Africa and
abroad as saying that the mercenaries were working for a new,
unnamed security group in South Africa.
	   ``We don't have any facts on this, '' Kasrils told The
Associated Press, adding that the government would move against
anyone breaking the law.
	   South Africans are banned from acting as mercenaries and must
obtain approval of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee
to offer military-related services abroad.
	   A Portuguese weekly newspaper, Independente, on Saturday
reported that South Africa's best-known private military company,
Executive Outcomes, has provided the Angolan government with pilots
to fly new planes bought from Russia.

Latest statistics indicate economy getting worse

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with financial secretary's remarks in grafs 8-9 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Already mired in recession, Hong Kong received
a battering of bad economic news Monday _ new figures indicating a
sharp economic contraction, bad earnings reports and a steep drop
on the stock market.
	   Officials predicted more trouble was ahead.
	   The gross domestic product fell 2.8 percent in this year's first
quarter due to ``a significant downturn'' in domestic demand and
fewer tourists, the Census and Statistics Department said in a
statement.
	   The fall in GDP was sharper than the 2 percent the government
had estimated previously, and a result of more specific numbers,
officials said. Unemployment is at a 15-year high, and tourism is
off more than 20 percent this year.
	   No figures are available yet for the second quarter, which ended
in June, but senior officials already have indicated that it is
likely to show further contraction. The government economist, K.Y.
Tang, said Monday that when the numbers do come out, the second
quarter probably will be worse than the first.
	   He declined to predict what might happen in the second half of
the year, but said the economy, which is driven by exports and
services, is unlikely to improve until the rest of Asia does.
	   The latest figures also indicated that total exports decreased
by 1 percent from the same period last year.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said he expected Hong Kong's
economy to recover at a faster pace than other economies in the
region.
	   He said Hong Kong's economic fundamentals remain strong and many
of the territory's largest companies remain profitable.
	   Hong Kong initially withstood much of Asia's financial turmoil,
but now has been dragged down into recession as well.
	   In a survey conducted by the Home Affairs Bureau of more than
1,500 respondents last month, 66 percent said the state of the
economy was their biggest worry.
	   Meanwhile, HSBC Holdings, which has the largest capitalized
stock on the Hong Kong stock exchange, announced late Monday that
its net profit for 1998's first six months amounted to U.S. dlrs
2.40 billion, down 16 percent from dlrs 2.87 billion a year
earlier.
	   Group Chairman John Bond said the fall reflected ``the impact of
a deteriorating economy environment in Asia.''
	   The group's principal unit, Hong Kong Bank, posted a 41 percent
profit decline to U.S. dlrs 787 million from dlrs 1.3 billion a
year earlier.
	   It also announced a bad debt provision of more than dlrs 1
billion because of Asia's economic problems.
	   ``There is considerable uncertainty about the duration of the
downturn,'' Bond said in a statement. ``We do not know when the
recovery will start.''
	   Dragged down by lackluster performance of HSBC shares, the Hang
Seng index, the market's key indicator of blue chips, lost 383.43
points, or nearly 5 percent, closing at 7,552.77.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium - The European Union welcomed a pledge Monday
by 13 countries to commit to an EU code of conduct to curb arms
sales to countries with poor human rights records or aggressive
designs on their neighbors.
	   ``The European Union takes note of this commitment and welcomes
it,'' the EU said in a joint statement with the 13 countries.
	   These are 11 countries that have applied for EU membership -
Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia - as well as
Iceland and Norway.
	   They declared that they ``share the objectives of the EU code of
conduct on arms exports.'' The 15 EU countries formally approved
the code, which is not legally binding, on June 8.
	   The code sets out criteria that should govern arms sales and
rules out exports to nations that might use weapons for attacking
other states, internal repression or support of terrorism.
	   But it is not legally binding in that it gives individual
governments leeway to determine when a prospective arms-buying
nation meets the criteria.
	   Six candidate countries to the EU - Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia opened membership talks with
the EU this year. The EU says the other five need more time to
prepare for such talks.

Philippine president describes economy as toothless paper tiger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Monday
the Philippines, described by his predecessor as an emerging
economic tiger, was actually a toothless paper tiger, and that the
ugly truth about Manila's economy should not be concealed.
	   Estrada has been criticized, mostly by business leaders, for
portraying the Philippines as a country on the edge of bankruptcy.
They said this could scare off investors and alarm international
creditors.
	   Estrada said Filipinos have a right to know the true state of
the country's finances and economy to forestall surprises.
	   ``We should not always hide and window-dress a serious condition
because in the end people get shocked when they find out the
truth,'' Estrada said in a radio interview.
	   ``They said we're the new tiger of Asia but it turned out we're
a paper tiger without a tooth,'' Estrada said, alluding to the
country's economy.
	   In his first state-of-the-nation address last week, Estrada said
Asia's year-old financial crisis has slowed the Philippine economy
and lowered labor productivity, causing inflation, unemployment and
crime to rise.
	   While the budget deficit is forecast to climb as high as 70
billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion), corruption and foreign debt
payments continue to drain the government's coffers, he said.
	   Businessmen said Estrada's description of the economy as nearing
bankruptcy could jeopardize Manila's chances of tapping the
international capital market at a time when it is preparing to
launch an international bond of at least dlrs 500 million to ease
its budget deficit.
	   Estrada said that while he pointed out the economy's weaknesses,
he stressed that the Philippines was better off than Indonesia,
Malaysia and Thailand, which are projecting recessions because of
continued financial difficulties from the regional crisis.
	   Despite financial constraints, Estrada said he would give
priority to food security and ensure that basic services to
Filipinos continue.
	   Estrada won the May 11 presidential elections by a wide margin
on a pro-poor platform.

Kohl's party says rebuilding east Germany will retain priority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ Rebuilding Germany's former communist
east will continue to have priority if Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
re-elected to a fifth term, his parliamentary leader said Monday.
	   Although unemployment in the struggling east remains twice that
of western Germany, Wolfgang Schaeuble said east Germany's economy
was stabilizing.
	   He credited the greater flexibility and innovation of business,
labor and government in the east, and said Kohl's government wanted
to spread those advantages to all of Germany to fight unemployment,
currently at 10.5 percent nationwide.
	   Schaeuble was in northeastern Schwerin presenting the second
part of a three-part campaign platform for Kohl's Christian
Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social
Union.

Hand-picked Cambodian premier accepts crushing election defeat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The man who replaced Prince Norodom
Ranariddh as Cambodia's co-premier after last year's bloody coup
gracefully conceded his election defeat Monday, saying he had no
regrets.
	   Despite an aggressive election campaign and predictions by Ung
Huot that his Reastr Niyum party would win up to 50 of the 122
seats in parliament, it failed to capture a single one.
	   ``I am willing to transfer my power to the new government, the
next government,'' Ung Huot, who is also foreign minister, said in
an address to be aired on state-run television. ``I appeal to all
Cambodians, whatever their political aspiration, to accept the
result.''
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-prime
minister in last year's violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. At
least 100 supporters of Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party were killed by
Hun Sen's forces in the months that followed.
	   The prince and his loyalists spent months in exile before
returning with international backing to participate in elections.
	   Ung Huot and a handful of other FUNCINPEC members, several of
them ministers in Ranariddh's government, stayed behind to give
their support to Hun Sen, lending his administration a stamp of
legitimacy. Ung Huot was appointed Hun Sen's new co-premier.
	   Though he was sharply criticized by loyal FUNCINPEC members and
by ordinary Cambodians who saw his actions as a betrayal, Ung Huot
defended the move at the time as necessary to bring a return to
political stability.
	   ``I think what I did was right for the moment,'' he said Monday.
``I never thought it was a mistake.''
	   When elections were called earlier this year, Ung Huot formed
his own party. Despite what he thought was a sure fire campaign
pledge _ to shoot violent criminals on sight _ he failed to capture
the public's loyalty.
	   Ung Huot has now joined FUNCINPEC in complaining about
irregularities in the counting of ballots, but he said Monday that
if the National Election Committee determines that the polls were
free, fair and credible, he will step aside gracefully.
	   ``I feel sad, but that is the verdict of the people,'' he said,
adding that he intends to remain politically active. ``We will have
to look at our shortfalls, strengths and weaknesses, and after a
period of political stability will rethink our strategy.''

King Fahd undergoing tests, reported in stable condition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ King Fahd was to undergo tests in a
Riyadh hospital on Monday, a day after he was admitted for
observation, a medical official said.
	   ``The king is in a stable condition and there is nothing to
worry about,'' said the official, who spoke only on condition his
name not be used.
	   He did not reveal the nature of the king's medical problems. He
added that Fahd was not expected to remain in the hospital for
long.
	   Diplomats in Saudi Arabia had said Sunday that the king was
taken to the King Faisal Specialist Hospital for treatment of an
illness. But the medical official said the king merely was
undergoing routine medical tests.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to Crown Prince Abdullah, his
half-brother. The crown prince has essentially remained in command
since then.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, has suffered for years from
diabetes and arthritis.

Ukrainian Cabinet prepares to slash government spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet has prepared a draft
presidential decree on slashing government spending and sent it to
President Leonid Kuchma for signing, the finance minister said
Monday.
	   The measure is part of Cabinet efforts to adopt a new 1998
budget that will meet the demands of international financial
organizations.
	   Ukraine's parliament last month failed to discuss the budget,
leaving it to the government to adopt the required changes.
Officials have said the new budget would be implemented by a
presidential decree in early August.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which is considering a new loan
to Ukraine, has made adoption of a more frugal budget a key
requirement.
	   An IMF mission which visited Kiev last week said it would
recommend the disbursement of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan for the
cash-strapped former Soviet republic.
	   Finance Minister Ihor Mityukov said the decree would only
address spending, leaving revenues for parliament to discuss, the
Interfax news agency reported. Mityukov did not provide concrete
figures.
	   An earlier draft provided for revenues of 17.9 billion hryvna
(dlrs 8.95 billion), spending of 20.24 billion hryvna (dlrs 10.12
billion) and a deficit of 2.34 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.17 billion),
or 2.3 percent of GDP.

Pilot faces jail for helping businessman Nadir escape Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A man who helped indicted businessman Asil Nadir
escape Britain in a sensational flight to northern Cyprus was
convicted Monday of obstructing justice and now faces a likely jail
sentence.
	   Judge Michael Hyam told Peter Dimond he will probably go to
prison for enabling Nadir, the former chairman of collapsed food
and electronics conglomerate Polly Peck, to flee Britain in 1993.
	   ``The real question is how long and I will need a social inquiry
report to help me,'' Hyam told Dimond, who showed no emotion in
court.
	   Dimond, 56, is free on bail while the judge has time to obtain
and study a report on his background. It was not immediately clear
when he will be sentenced.
	   After deliberating for five hours, a jury of eight women and
three men at the Old Bailey convicted Dimond of charges that he
perverted the course of justice between January and May 1993, when
Nadir began planning his flight and then took off.
	   Nadir's escape was a wild climax to one of Britain's more
dramatic boom-and-bust stories.
	   Polly Peck grew dramatically in the early 1980s, but eventually
collapsed in 1991 with debts of dlrs 2.1 billion after
investigators began probing irregularities in Nadir's finances.
	   Nadir claimed he could not get a fair trial in Britain and in
May 1993 he jumped dlrs 5.2 million bail to flee to northern
Cyprus, a self-proclaimed nation recognized only by Turkey.
	   He still faces 13 charges of theft in Britain involving 30
million pounds, or about dlrs 48 million, from his companies. But
Britain has little chance of bringing Nadir to trial _ it has no
extradition treaty with northern Cyprus and Turkey has refused to
send him.
	   The prosecution said Dimond arranged the light aircraft that
spirited Nadir to northern France, where he boarded an executive
jet bound for Cyprus via Vienna and Istanbul.
	   Dimond is a pilot but did no flying on the journey. He
accompanied Nadir and remained with him in Cyprus until January
1998, when he returned to Britain on business and was arrested.
	   Dimond testified he believed Nadir had been unfairly treated by
British authorities and needed a chance to prepare his case before
returning to Britain to face trial.
	   ``I always thought it would be sorted. I never doubted his
integrity,'' Dimond testified.
	   A spokesman for Nadir refused comment on the verdict.

Taiwanese protest atrocities in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ About 200 Taiwanese, shouting
``murderers,'' protested outside the Indonesian mission Monday to
denounce atrocities against ethnic Chinese.
	   They burned incense sticks and set up an altar to mourn the
ethnic Chinese killed during the May uprising that brought down
Indonesian President Suharto.
	   Lawmaker Lee Ching-hua, who led the protesters, demanded that
the Indonesian government apologize, compensate the victims and
reassure the world that similar incidents will never happen again.
	   More than 1,000 people died in Jakarta alone in rioting over
price increases. Women's groups say at least 168 women were raped
by rioters.
	   Many of the victims were members of the ethnic Chinese minority,
which controls much of the economy and often is made a scapegoat in
difficult times. Indonesia is undergoing its worst economic crisis
in decades.
	   Human rights activists have widely accused the military, and a
government inquiry is under way.
	   Protesters later moved to the Foreign Ministry to demand that
the Taiwan government suspend planned economic aid and order a
pullout of Taiwanese investment from Indonesia.
	   In response, Foreign Minister Jason Hu said Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie has assured Taiwanese officials that authorities will
severely punish those responsible.
	   Meanwhile, organizers of a world conference of Chinese writers
said five ethnic Chinese writers were barred from leaving for
Taiwan. The writers were to report on the atrocities in Indonesia
at the meeting that opened Monday, they said.
	   Taiwan does not have diplomatic relations with Indonesia. But
Taiwanese have invested U.S. dlrs 13.2 billion in Indonesia, and
several Taiwanese factories were ransacked during the May uprising.

As many as 80 people dying daily due to hunger in Wau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An estimated 70 to 80 people are dying
daily in the government-held town of Wau in southwestern Sudan
because of hunger and disease brought on by war-induced famine, an
aid agency said Monday.
	   ``Children are falling dead in the streets from hunger,'' CARE
International official Bob LaPrade said. ``It's gotten so bad that
we had to lease extra vehicles to transport bodies to the
graveyard.''
	   LaPrade, CARE's director in Sudan, returned to Khartoum from Wau
on Sunday, said CARE spokeswoman Wendy Driscoll in Nairobi.
	   Driscoll said CARE workers said the death rate was being pushed
higher by heavy rains that have recently begun in Bahr al-Ghazal
province.
	   CARE says in the feeding centers it runs in Wau, it has managed
to lower the death rate from 40 to 50 a day to 12 to 26.
	   CARE said there was a high morbidity rate among the general
population due to diarrhoeal diseases, malaria, respiratory
infections, eye infections and tuberculosis.
	   It said between 400 and 600 hungry people are arriving in Wau
daily, and the number is expected to reach 70,000 by the end of the
month.
	   Wau is the capital of Bahr al-Ghazal, the province worst-hit in
southern Sudan by famine caused mainly by fighting in a 15-year
civil war.
	   Earlier this year, thousands of people fled out of Wau into the
countryside when the Sudan People's Liberation Army tried to
capture Wau from government troops.
	   Aid agencies say most of these people are now returning to Wau
to escape fighting in the countryside.
	   Last week, SPLA spokesman Pa'gan Amum said people are returning
to Wau because the U.N. World Food Program is shipping more food
into the town than to the rebel-held areas.
	   But WFP spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said the agency is using
more aircraft to send more food to rebel-held areas ``because
people there are in worse conditions.''
	   WFP is dropping 9,500 tons of food per month _ at a cost of dlrs
30 million _ into government and rebel-held areas on southern Sudan
in the largest international aid operation currently underway.

Trial of Turkish human rights activist assailants opens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The trial of 11 Turkish defendants accused
of trying to murder a leading human rights activist opened under
high security here Monday.
	   The May 12 attack on Akin Birdal, president of Turkey's Human
Rights Foundation, left him hospitalized in serious condition for
weeks.
	   It was a major embarrassment for Turkish authorities who
admitted that a right-wing terrorist, formerly employed by the
state to kill people seen as threats to national security, was
probably behind the assassination attempt.
	   But one of the defendants, accused of ordering the attack, said
his aim was not to kill Birdal.
	   ``I did not give instructions for the murder or wounding of Akin
Birdal. My instruction was to have him kidnapped and then get him
to make a press statement saying he regretted his pro-separatist
speeches,'' a former army sergeant Cengiz Ersever, was quoted by
Anatolia news agency as saying.
	   Birdal, who was present in court in a wheelchair, is a prominent
campaigner against torture and the army's forced evacuation of
Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey. He has been repeatedly
charged with inciting racial hatred or separatism for his speeches
in favor of a peaceful solution of the war opposing
autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels and government troops.
	   ``If I had such an intention (of murdering Birdal), I bet, I
would have his brain splattered on the wall in 24 hours,'' Ersever
told the judges, prompting vivid protests from Birdal's lawyers who
asked the court to put the defendant's words on record.
	   According to the indictment, the 11 defendants, including two
who have reportedly confessed to the shooting, belonged to the
Turkish Revenge Brigade, formed by Ersever to fight Kurdish
separatism and pro-Islamic movements.
	   Monday's hearing was adjourned for a few hours when police
dragged the defendants out of court for verbally attacking Birdal's
lawyers.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gunmen ambushed a police patrol car in Georgia's
breakaway Abkhazia region, killing one person and injuring three, a
news report said Monday.
	   Pro-government militants opened fire with automatic weapons and
a grenade launcher on the car patrolling the restive Ghali district
Sunday evening, the interior minister of the separatist region,
Asmabei Kchach, told the Interfax new agency.
	   Police officer Alexander Mikadze died on the scene, and three
other soldiers were taken to the hospital, Interfax said.
	   Ghali has been the site of heated clashes recently between
pro-government militants and Abkhazian separatists.
	   The separatists have controlled the Black Sea province since a
1992-93 war, and tensions remain high.

Georgian president wants Russian peacekeepers to stay in Abkhazia

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's president said Monday he
favored keeping Russian peacekeepers in the country's breakaway
Abkhazia region.
	   The peacekeeping force's mandate to monitor the region expired
July 31. It can be extended by a vote of leaders of all the
countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), but
Georgia has ultimate control over whether the troops stay or leave.
	   If Russian peacekeepers leave Abkhazia, ``certain forces might
attempt to again drag Georgia into a full-scale war,'' Georgian
president Eduard Shevardnadze said in a Monday radio address.
	   ``I think it is unreasonable to withdraw Russian peacekeepers
unless the question of their replacement is cleared up,'' he said.
	   The Russian peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea
province of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war in which Abkhazian
separatists drove out Georgian government troops. Sporadic violence
keeps tensions in the region high.
	   Shevardnadze has often criticized the Russian troops for not
doing enough to help ethnic Georgian refugees move back into
Abkhazia. But he said the Russian troops were needed to maintain
safety for thousands of refugees beginning to return home.
	   More than 40,000 ethnic Georgians fled Abkhazia's Ghali region
during fighting in May between separatists and pro-government
militants.
	   The United Nations agreed last week to keep unarmed military
observers in Georgia for another six months and urged both sides in
the conflict to continue negotiating for a long-term peace.

Iranian interior minister handed security forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's newly appointed interior minister, an
ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was given control of
the powerful police forces by the country's top religious leader,
Iran newspaper reported Monday.
	   The move signals a small victory for Iran's moderate faction,
locked in a power struggle with hard-liners in the ruling clergy.
	   Although Khatami is the elected leader, the constitution gives
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, control of such key
instruments of power as the police, army and judiciary.
	   In a letter to Khamenei, Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi
Lari asked that ``control of the security forces be placed with the
Interior Ministry, which is charged with maintaining security,''
the newspaper said. It did not say when the letter was written.
	   Control of Iran's police forces is traditionally in the hands of
the interior minister. But that responsibility was withheld from
Lari's predecessor, who was impeached last month by the hard-line
parliament for attempting to ease the strict Islamic social code
and promote public freedoms.
	   The police are in charge of security in the streets, enforcing
the strict Islamic dress code on women and ensuring that unmarried
couples do not mingle.
	   The handover followed the attack on the editor of the liberal
newspaper Toos and two Associated Press reporters Saturday. In
another victory for the moderate faction, the newspaper, which was
banned from publishing by the hard-line clergy on Saturday, was
being distributed again Monday.
	   The judiciary, which has the power to close down newspapers,
yielded to the urging of officials from the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance for the paper to continue publishing, Iran News
reported Monday. The Culture Ministry, run by a Khatami loyalist,
issues permits for newspapers.

Iranian president outlines economic plan

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 4th graf with Khamenei approving plan

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami has called for
reducing government monopolies on goods and services, eliminating
the red tape holding back foreign investment and cutting the
country's reliance on oil revenues.
	   The moderate cleric, who took office one year ago, said Iran's
``sick'' economy has suffered from several decades of mismanagement
and needs fundamental changes, such as reducing government
intervention.
	   He outlined his long-awaited economic proposals in a speech
broadcast on state radio late Sunday. The remarks were reported
Monday in the Iran News.
	   Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved Khatami's
economic plan and wished the president success in implementing the
reforms, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   In his speech, Khatami also called for full implementation of
Islamic banking principles, which forbid interest payments, and
scheduled repayment of Iran's foreign debt, estimated at around
dlrs 15 billion.
	   The paper quoted him as saying that high unemployment and
inflation had cut into the public's purchasing power. Meanwhile, he
said, dependence on oil revenues, a shortage of capital, cumbersome
laws hindering investment and lack of competitiveness were hurting
development.
	   Iran and other Gulf oil producers have been grappling with
rising budget deficits because of low world prices for oil, a main
source of government revenues.
	   Khatami said that despite the economic problems, the government
would maintain subsidies on basic commodities such as rice, cooking
oil and meat.
	   The president also reiterated a commitment to reducing the gap
between rich and poor, a cherished tenet of the 1979 Islamic
revolution, the paper said.
	   Khatami said social justice would prevail over development if a
choice had to be made between the two, it added.
	   Khatami acknowledged that he was unable to give full attention
to economic policy during his first year in office because of
political distractions. Khatami, a reformist, has been involved in
a power struggle with Iran's powerful hard-line clerics since his
elections last year.

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's leading opposition party
captured the governor's seat in the central state of Aguascalientes
on Monday, a victory that gives it fresh momentum heading toward
the 2000 presidential race.
	   More than anything, the gubernatorial contests in Aguascalientes
and two other states Sunday underscored the growing competitiveness
of elections in a country where for decades one party _ the
Institutional Revolutionary Party _ easily won every vote.
	   ``Mexico has made another important step toward democracy,''
said historian Enrique Krauze, serving as an election-day analyst
for the Mexican network Televisa. ``The process was characterized
by stability and tranquility.''
	   With two-thirds of the vote counted in Aguascalientes early
Monday, Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez of National Action was ahead with
53 percent of the vote, the State Electoral Council said.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's candidate, Hector
Hugo Olivares Ventura, trailed with 37 percent, followed by Alfonso
Bernal Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party, with
7 percent.
	   ``What we want for Aguascalientes is a transition that does not
hold back its progress, that does not cause a scandal,'' Gonzalez
Gonzalez told a news conference after media exit polls showed him
the winner.
	   Complete preliminary results in Aguascalientes, as well as in
Oaxaca and Veracruz, were not expected until later Monday. The
final official results for all three races were not expected until
later in the week.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the ruling party, known as the
PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to offset the loss.
	   In Mexico City on Sunday evening, PAN national president Felipe
Calderon Hinojosa opened a bottle of apple cider to toast
Gonzalez's apparent win.
	   With Aguascalientes, the PAN ``advances and solidifies its
political position,'' a smiling Calderon Hinojosa said.
	   While the center-right National Action Party was headed for
victory in Aguascalientes, the PRI was virtually assured the
governorship in the Gulf state of Veracruz.
	   With 36 percent of the ballots counted, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy
businessman and the son of a former president, was leading with 52
percent of the vote.
	   Luis Pazos of National Action trailed with 28 percent. The
candidate of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party lagged
behind with 14 percent.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   Aleman late Sunday promised to create ``a social alliance'' as
Veracruz's new governor.
	   As elected leader of one of Mexico's most important states,
Aleman automatically would become a top contender for the PRI's
presidential nomination for 2000 _ even though he has claimed he is
not interested.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at stamping out vote fraud and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But it won two of three elections last
month, including in Chihuahua, where it defeated the PAN.
	   In the southern state of Oaxaca Monday, the PRI had a widening
advantage over the center-left Democratic Revolution party for the
governorship.
	   The PRD was challenging the count, arguing that the computer
system reporting results crashed for 40 minutes and when it
returned to service, the results had been altered.
	   PRD national director Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the party
would not validate an election ``plagued by irregularities, that
was not clean nor free and in which the vote was manipulated,'' the
daily Reforma reported Monday.
	   Nevertheless, many analysts said the PRD did better than
expected, showing that it, too, has become a political force
capable of seriously challenging the PRI.

Businessman gets three years in jail, may lose seat in legislature

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An eight-year veteran of Hong Kong's
legislature famous for his outspoken and high-spending ways was
sentenced Monday to three years in prison for plotting forgery in a
land deal.
	   Chim Pui-chung could have received up to 14 years in prison on
the charge stemming from a 350 million Hong Kong dollar (dlrs 44.8
million) land deal in 1992. He said he would appeal.
	   Under the basic law, Hong Kong's constitution after it was
returned to China last year, members may be removed from the
legislature by a two-thirds vote of its 60 members if they are
found guilty of crimes and sentenced to more than a month in jail.
	   Some legislators have said that the body risks its reputation if
it allows Chim to stay.
	   Chim, who rides around Hong Kong in a gold Rolls Royce, was
found guilty by a nine-member jury Saturday. He was found innocent
of five other charges stemming from the same land deal.
	   In the legislature, he represents the financial services
industry, and was re-elected in May in balloting by only about 300
people _ members of the financial services industry.
	   Chim's case could tarnish the reputation of the majority of the
legislature that is not chosen by direct, popular vote at a time
when there are increasing calls for broadening democracy in Hong
Kong.
	   Legislative officials called a meeting for Wednesday to discuss
his case.
	   If Chim is removed, a new election would be held to fill his
post.
	   The South China Morning Post on Sunday quoted Martin Lee, leader
of the largest party, the Democrats, and Emily Lau of the Frontier
movement as saying there was no need for the legislature to wait
for the result of Chim's appeal before it acted.
	   Lee was quoted as saying that it would ``discredit the
legislature if a convicted ... member is not disqualified.''
	   Only 20 members of the legislature were chosen by direct,
popular vote in May 24 elections. The number is to increase slowly
in the next 10 years.
	   Thirty members, including Chim, were chosen by elections within
specified professions, and the final 10 by an 800-member election
committee. Those 40 seats are dominated by pro-Beijing elites.

Rugova group criticizes leadership of Kosovo Liberation Army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The information outlet controlled
by Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova for the first time
criticized the leadership of the Kosovo Liberation Army in what
appeared to be a bid to marginalize extremists in the group.
	   A statement by the Kosovo Information Center said Albanians
``who respect institutions'' headed by Rugova ``are revolted by the
careerism of those who have shabbily headed the KLA.''
	   The United States and European powers are urging the KLA to
approve formation of a committee under Rugova to enter talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the future of the majority
Albanian province.
	   KLA officials are expected to give their answer this week.
	   The statement carefully avoided criticizing the KLA as a whole
and instead was directed against radicals who reject Rugova because
of his non-violent stand.
	   The divisions come as Serb forces have dealt a severe setback to
the KLA, overruning several key villages and splitting
KLA-controlled territory.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Though the Taliban army met little
resistance when it took a key town nearby, the religious militia
will not have such an easy time in the opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif, a northern alliance spokesman said Monday.
	   ``Our forces are ready to defend Mazar-e-Sharif. If the Taliban
try to capture Mazar-e-Sharif, they will face heavy resistance,''
said Zabet Saliy, spokesman for anti-Taliban military leader Ahmed
Shah Masood. ``They will repeat the mistake they committed last
year.''
	   Taliban fighters briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif last May,
retreating after street battles that left several hundred Taliban
soldiers dead. It is believed that as many as 2,000 Taliban
prisoners of war were later massacred.
	   Taliban fighters have been bolstered by a series of recent
victories and appear poised to capture all of Afghanistan. They
claim to be closing in on Mazar-e-Sharif from two directions, and
also claim to have gained ground in eastern Afghanistan on Monday.
	   Taliban leaders have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban
officials have barred girls from school, confined most women to
their homes, and declared that time once spent watching now-banned
television should be devoted to prayer.
	   The fractious anti-Taliban coalition is made of mostly of
Afghanistan's minority ethnic and religious groups.
	   Wekil Ahmad Muttawkil, a Taliban spokesman at the militia's
headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, said leaders had not
yet decided whether to attack Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Last year's tough battle for Mazar-e-Sharif contrasts with
sketchy descriptions of Sunday's fall of Shebergan, the stronghold
of warlord Rashid Dostum that is located 100 kilometers (60 miles)
west of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Dostum has joined Masood and the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia that
controls Mazar-e-Sharif against the Taliban, but his fighters also
clashed with Hezb-e-Wahadat in Mazar-e-Sharif last year.
	   Taliban officials said casualties were low and a large number of
prisoners of war were captured. Dostum's forces reportedly set fire
to Shebergan airport as they left, destroying several fighter jets.
	   Saliy, speaking by satellite telephone from northern
Afghanistan, said Dostum's men put up little resistance after some
of their commanders were paid off by the Taliban. Such mercenary
switching of loyalties has long been a hallmark of the Afghan civil
war.
	   After fleeing Shebergan on Sunday, Dostum retreated to Hayratan,
about 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif on
Afghanistan's border with Uzbekistan and was trying to reorganize
his forces, Saliy said. Other members of the northern-based
anti-Taliban alliance met in Mazar-e-Sharif on Monday to assess the
military situation, Saliy said.
	   In neighboring Pakistan on Monday, Red Cross spokesman Michel
Schaffner said about 10 international aid workers in Mazar-e-Sharif
had asked the Red Cross to evacuate them, but no plane was able to
travel there because the airport was closed. Schaffner said it was
not clear why the airport was closed, and called the security
situation unpredictable.
	   Seven expatriate Red Cross workers flew out of Mazar-e-Sharif to
the Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday, leaving behind a handful of
Afghan staff, Schaffner said. Their departure was routine, he said.
The Red Cross has been overseeing projects in Mazar-e-Sharif from
Kabul for safety reasons.
	   Independent sources speaking on condition of anonymity said
civilians were fleeing Mazar-e-Sharif in anticipation of fighting,
but the city was fairly calm Monday.

Appeals court upholds death sentences; police crack heroin ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Vietnam appeals court has upheld the
death penalty for three men, including a Taiwanese, for involvement
in drug trafficking, a court official said Monday.
	   Last November, a preliminary court sentenced Chen Chi-tien of
Taiwan and associates Tram Huy and Phung Phu to death on charges of
illegal manufacture, trade and possession of drugs. A fourth man
was sentenced to life in prison for possession.
	   Police raided Tai's house in Ho Chi Minh City in May 1995 and
found 170.5 kilograms (376 pounds) of high-quality methamphetamine.
The defendants reportedly confessed they had produced the same drug
three other times over the previous year.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper Youth reported that police in Ho Chi
Minh City last week arrested 13 heroin dealers who were supplying
about 2,000 addicts.
	   Drug use is a rising problem for Vietnam, where more than 30
traffickers have been condemned to death since early this year.

Gunmen rob maternity hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Three gunmen robbed an Athens maternity
hospital Monday, slightly injuring a doctor who attempted to stop
them, local media said.
	   The gunmen entered the accounting office of Iaso hospital, one
of the capital's largest private maternity facilities, fired three
shots into the ceiling and took 100,000 drachmas (dlrs 339).
	   They then stole 10 million drachmas (dlrs 33,900) from a
National Bank of Greece branch located inside the hospital. They
fled the hospital in a car.
	   A doctor, Antonis Mitsis, was slightly injured when one of the
robbers hit him on the head with a gun as he tried to stop them
from leaving.
	   The hospital is located next door to the Athens Olympic Sports
Complex, where the World Basketball Championships are being held.

Minister: China has promised not to devalue currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ China has promised not to devalue
its currency so as not to exacerbate the Asian economic crisis,
Malaysia's foreign minister said Monday after talks with Chinese
officials.
	   The commitment to maintain the yuan at its current levels was
conveyed to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad by visiting Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, said Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.
	   The move by China is important to countries in the region,
Abdullah told reporters.
	   Tang met Mahathir a few hours before he ended his four-day stay
in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Asian nations have repeatedly sought assurances from Beijing on
its currency. A devalued currency would make Chinese exports
cheaper, hurting neighboring economies that are already reeling
from last year's currency battering.
	   China has been losing money in trade because its non-convertible
currency has not been devalued.
	   Tang also confirmed President Jiang Zemin's participation in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit scheduled in Kuala Lumpur
in November, Abdullah said.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has approved
a national program aimed at lowering Vietnam's growing crime rate,
local press reported Monday.
	   A circular, signed by Khai on Friday, said efforts will be
concentrated on fighting corruption, organized criminal gangs, drug
trafficking and addiction, and trade in women and children. The
national program will be headed by a deputy prime minister.
	   Crime has been rising since the communist country launched an
economic reform program in the mid-1980s.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan announced Monday a unilateral
cease-fire throughout southern Sudan, where war has caused a
worsening famine. The government urged rebels to follow suit.
	   ``The announcement comes as a further measure in the continuing
effort by the government to contain the humanitarian situation in
southern Sudan,'' a government statement said.
	   The declaration expands the scope of a limited three-month
cease-fire reached between the government and the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army in July. It comes on the eve of peace
talks between the warring parties in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Atabani was quoted as saying by the official Sudan News Agency.
	   The talks in Addis Ababa will be the first negotiations between

Polish farmers block border crossing to demand ban on grain
</HEADLINE>
imports &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Dozens of farmers spilled about 1,200 tons
of imported grain at the Polish-Czech border Monday in a protest
demanding a ban on grain imports.
	   The 60 farmers from the Solidarity trade union unlatched rail
freight cars at Muszyna, 370 kilometers (230 miles) south of
Warsaw, spilling the grain imported from Hungary and Slovakia
across the rail line to block traffic, PAP news agency reported.
	   The farmers want a total ban on imported grain and for the
government to prosecute anyone responsible for permitting imports.
It was the latest in a series of farmers' protests this summer to
demand more government protection of the agriculture industry.
	   In response, the government has promised to triple state
purchases of Polish grain and increase custom fees on grain imports
beginning Thursday.
	   ``That should discourage importers or at least reduce imports,''
said Krzysztof Trawinski of the Agriculture Ministry. He said a
total ban demanded by the farmers would violate international trade
agreements signed by Poland.
	   But farmers' leader Marian Zagorny said protests against grain
imports would spread across the country if the government fails to
meet farmers' demands immediately.
	   The farmers' Solidarity trade union has some 400,000 members in
the 4-million strong farmer lobby.
	   Polish agriculture remains hobbled by small, poorly equipped
farms unable to compete with larger, more modern farms in Western
Europe. Calls for reforms to consolidate farms and make them more
efficient in preparation for Poland's bid to join the European
Union have been resisted by farmers, who fear losing control of
their land and having to work for others.

Indian shelling kills three more people in Pakistani Kashmir

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report Indian brigade headquarters hit in new
graf 2, reported Indian casualties to 30 in graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Shelling by Indian troops killed
three more people, including two children, in the
Pakistan-controlled area of Kashmir on Monday, raising the number
of Pakistanis killed in the shelling during the last five days to
54, army officials said.
	   Associated Press of Pakistan added that Pakistani shells hit an
Indian brigade headquarters in the Kargil district of Indian-held
Kashmir. The news agency, quoting unnamed sources, said that
casualties were believed to be high. But India's defense ministry
reported no firing in Kargil on Monday, saying Pakistani attacks
had subsided.
	   The two children were killed when Indian forces launched shells
at Atmaqam in Neelam Valley, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
Muzaffarabad, the capitol of Pakistan-held Kashmir. Another man was
killed in shelling in Bhimber sector near the border, they said.
	   The number of deaths were low because most people had fled from
the border villages and the intensity of India's shelling has
eased, the officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In a statement Monday, the India Ministry of Defense said eight
soldiers and 22 civilians were killed by Pakistani forces, a
slightly lower toll than army sources had reported previously.
Pakistan says most of its casualties were also civilian.

Report: Taiwan to honor former general
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party will
honor former Gen. Ho Sai-lai for his contributions to the country,
the official news agency reported Monday.
	   It will present national and party flags to the relatives of Ho,
who died in Hong Kong July 26, for use at his funeral scheduled
Wednesday, the Central News Agency said. Ho was 92.
	   Ho was the son of Robert Hotung, the comprador for Jardine's,
one of the first and largest of the foreign trading houses in Hong
Kong. Compradors were Chinese who served as middlemen between the
traders and the Chinese bureaucracy.
	   He attended military academies in Britain and France, and served
in the Nationalist army, which was defeated by the Communists and
fled the Chinese mainland for Taiwan in 1949.
	   Ho headed the Nationalist military delegations in Japan and
later in the United Nations between 1950 and 1962 before he retired
and settled in Hong Kong, the report said. He later was appointed a
Taiwanese presidential adviser.

Chinese top brass visit North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Senior Chinese military officials traveled to
Pyongyang Monday for exchanges with their North Korean
counterparts, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of staff of the People's
Liberation Army, led a delegation of officers on a goodwill visit
at the invitation of North Korea's military, Xinhua said.
	   High-level exchanges between the former comrades in arms
continue despite Beijing's growing closeness to South Korea.
	   China opened formal diplomatic relations with Seoul in 1992 and
trade between the two has since flourished.
	   At the same time, China has been a source of urgently needed
food and fuel for isolated North Korea and has encouraged its
communist ally to adopt reforms similar to Beijing's own
market-oriented policies to revive its failing economy.
	   China fought on the North's side in the 1950-53 Korean War and
Chinese leaders still profess to a ``profound friendship'' between
Beijing and Pyongyang.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Italian oil giant ENPPI and Egypt's Petrojet
are building a new pipeline that will transport natural gas from
northern Egypt to the Sinai peninsula, the daily Al-Ahram said
Monday.
	   The pipeline, which will extend from the Bahariya gas fields
north of Port Said to the Sheikh Zweid region in northern Sinai, is
part of a government plan to increase natural gas production from
112 million cubic meters per day to 463 million, Oil Minister Hamdy
el-Banbi was quoted as saying by the paper.
	   The dlrs 164 million pipeline, which will cross under the Suez
Canal, will be linked to the national gas grid.
 &UR; __
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a bid to end a shortage of cement, a
Cabinet ministerial committee ordered the doubling of production to
3 million tons this month, the daily Al-Ahram reported Monday.
	   The decision by the Ministerial Committee on Cement, headed by
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury, also allows the public and
private sectors to purchase cement directly from the factory
instead of going through licensed traders, said the paper, quoting
Minister of Cabinet Affairs Talaat Hammad.
	   The decision comes at a time when the government has accused a
group of traders of monopolizing the market by purchasing cement,
holding on to their stock and thereby inflating the price to nearly
300 pounds per ton (dlrs 85).
	   The decree also orders the tax authority to investigate traders
and collect outstanding taxes on profits. It said traders who
withheld the sale of cement would be fined. It did not give a
figure.
	   Egypt produced about 20.772 million tons of cement in 1997-98
and imported 2.9 million tons to meet local demands, the paper
said.
	   Cement shortages are common during the months of July and August
when construction projects increase.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Some 80 South African companies will exhibit their
products and services in Kuwait for the first time later this year,
the organizer of the trade show said Monday.
	   ``The whole idea is to increase export from South Africa to
Kuwait,'' said Emiranda Coetzer of South Africa's Challenge
Exhibition Group. She said Kuwait imports fruits and vegetables
from the African nation and is South Africa's second largest oil
supplier, providing 16 percent of its oil imports.
	   Coetzer said the three-day show will open Nov. 3 and will
include seminars on investment opportunities in South Africa. The
companies will show clothes, jewelry, military equipment and
furniture. Tourist and construction companies will also be
represented.

	   KUWAIT (AP) - Parliament approved Monday a government request to
reschedule the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bad
debts owed by private investors to the Central Bank.
	   Twenty-six of the 39 legislators and ministers who attended the
session voted for the amendment to the bad debts law. Thirteen
voted against.
	   The 6.7 billion dinars (dlrs 21.89 billion) in debts soured
after a 1982 crash of an unofficial stock market and were
aggravated by Iraq's 1990 invasion of this oil-rich state. After
the 1991 liberation, the government took over debts owed by 10,400
individuals from private banks in a debts-for-bonds deal.
	   The amendment will allow defaulters to rejoin the program and
pay their dues by the end of June 1999. Debtors who had to make two
more major payments, the first of which was due Sept. 6, can now
pay in three installments instead of two _ the first on Sept. 6,
1999 and the last on Sept. 6, 2000.
	   The government believes the rescheduling will increase chances
of payment, but many lawmakers accused it of favoring wealthy
merchant debtors at the expense of public money.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Iraq have agreed to upgrade
commercial and economic ties, an official said Monday.
	   A joint Jordanian-Iraqi higher committee held several meetings
here in the past two days and was expected to complete trade talks
on Tuesday, said Haidar Murad, Chairman of Jordanian Chamber of
Commerce Federation.
	   He said the volume of trade exchange between Jordan and Iraq
exceeded dlrs 250 million last year.
	   Zuhair Abdul Ghafour Yunis, head of the Iraqi delegation to the
talks said efforts were underway to increase trade to dlrs 400
million.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian and foreign investors based at an
industrial free trade zone in the northern city of Irbid have
complained that Israel's 11.7 percent input that makes it benefit
from U.S. concessions is too high and should be lowered to 8
percent, the chairman of the Century Investment Group said Monday.
	   Omar Salah said heavy weight industrialists are not willing to
apply for a duty free status in U.S. markets before Israel lowers
its input.
	   Salah said the U.S. Trade Department is surprised that since the
creation of the zone in March no one had applied for a duty free
entry to U.S. markets.
	   Under the zone agreement signed between Jordan and Israel last
November, Jordanian and Israeli manufacturers should each
contribute an input of at least 11.7 percent from the minimum 35
percent.
	   Both manufacturers could also contribute 20 percent of the total
cost of production, Salah said.
	   ``The Israelis are showing some flexibility and are expected to
cooperate because they do not want to hinder the growth of
Jordan,'' Salah said.

<TEXT>
	   OLIVA, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge opened an investigation
Monday into the cause of a collision in which five young British
tourists were killed a day earlier.
	   The tourists, two women and three men aged between 18 and 25,
were returning to the holiday resort town of Benidorm from Valencia
city Sunday when their hired car collided with a truck close to the
town of Oliva. The five were killed instantly.
	   They were identified as Samuel Otaimaga, 23, of Kent, and Vivian
Obleajula, 21, Ian Boatswain, 21, Kara Jaimimi, 21 and Falelat
Oluremelekun, 24, all from London, a British Foreign Office
spokeswoman said.
	   The truck driver was unhurt in the accident.
	   Traffic was diverted around the accident for two hours while
firemen pried open the wreckage to remove the bodies. Fifty people
were killed in road accidents across the country in what was
Spain's busiest holiday weekend.
	   The remains of the five Britons were being kept at a morgue in
the coastal town of Gandia, just north of Oliva, before being
repatriated.

Auto sales slump in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's sluggish economy and rising unemployment
took its toll on auto sales in July, pushing them down for the 16th
straight month, producers announced Monday.
	   The Japan Automobile Dealers Association said sales of new cars,
trucks and buses, as measured by registrations, fell 8.4 percent in
July from the year-earlier month to 432,221.
	   Passenger car sales slipped 0.5 percent to 323,881, truck sales
dropped 26 percent to 107,210 and bus sales dipped 15 percent to
1,130. The figures don't include sales of mini-cars and
mini-trucks.
	   A spokesman for the association said the payment of summer
bonuses by Japanese companies to their employees failed to boost
sales much. He said a weak labor market with a record level of
unemployment of 4.3 percent for June may have been a reason for
that.
	   The association didn't make a forecast for the full year, but
the spokesman said that with sales down 18 percent in the
January-June period, it couldn't be expected that full-year sales
would surpass those of the previous year.
	   Analysts forecast that sales for the full fiscal year ending
March 31 will decline.
	   The spokesman for the association said he hoped the new
government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would move quickly to
implement new economic stimulus measures, including tax cuts.
	   By maker, sales of three companies rose in July: Honda's
increased 3.7 percent to 44,191 vehicles, Mazda's grew 4.5 percent
to 26,983 and Daihatsu's expanded 14 percent to 4,113.
	   Among other makers, Toyota's July sales fell 6.3 percent to
173,486 vehicles, Nissan's dropped 9.1 percent to 94,907,
Mitsubishi Motors' declined 22 percent to 31,603 and Isuzu's fell
31 percent to 6,724.
	   Sales of imported vehicles in Japan fell 20 percent in July to
25,145.

Havel undergoes tracheotomy, doctors fear pneumonia developing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, additional information
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
underwent a tracheotomy Monday amid fears he might be developing
pneumonia eight days after serious abdominal surgery.
	   ``We're looking at a lung inflammation here. You could call it a
potential pneumonia,'' Boris Stastny, a member of Havel's medical
team, said after Monday's operation at Prague's military hospital.
	   Doctors performed a tracheotomy, a routine surgery during which
a small artificial hole is made in the throat to facilitate
breathing.
	   Following the operation, Havel was in the hospital's
intensive-care unit.
	   Doctors said Havel's temperature was back to normal but he will
be kept sedated till Tuesday.
	   ``The only problem ... is that we have already carried out a
tracheotomy for the fourth time in the same place, which is very
scarred by now,'' said Professor Ernst Bodner of the Innsbruck
University Clinic, who performed the 90-minute surgery.
	   Havel has had tracheotomies three times previously.
	   Bodner operated on Havel in April when the president's colon
ruptured while he was vacationing in Austria.
	   Bodner was part of a Czech-Austrian team of doctors who operated
on Havel in Prague to restore his digestive tract July 26.
	   The surgery had been declared successful, but Havel's overall
recovery was hindered by breathing problems.
	   The 61-year-old president, formerly a chain smoker, has been
hospitalized five times since December 1996, when he had a third of
his lung and a tumor removed.
	   Last week, Havel's lungs collapsed briefly, forcing the use of
respirator, common after all of his surgeries.
	   Feeling optimistic, doctors took Havel off the respirator
Saturday night and waited to see if the president could breathe
without help.
	   Late Sunday, Havel's temperature shot up to 39 degrees Celsius
(102 degrees Fahrenheit), his heartbeat went up and laboratory
findings indicated a lung inflammation, doctors said.
	   According to experts, Havel will need a minimum of six weeks to
fully recover. He is scheduled for an official visit to the United
States in September.

Top banker warns of weak yen, possible yuan devaluation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The government is worried that the weak
Japanese yen could force devaluation of the Chinese yuan, with
unpredictable dangers for Vietnam's economy, the newspaper
Investment reported Monday.
	   ``If the Japanese yen continues to be unstable, the Chinese yuan
will be devalued, and we just cannot foresee what happens next,''
state bank Governor Nguyen Tan Dung, who also is a deputy prime
minister, was quoted as saying.
	   The paper also quoted Nguyen Dong Tien, of the state bank's
Economic Research Department, as saying Japanese economic policies,
especially those related to currency, have a huge impact on
Vietnam's economy and financial system. Japan is Vietnam's major
donor, investor and importer.
	   ``The weaker yen putting pressure on the Chinese yuan creates
some danger to Vietnam's monetary system and economy,'' Tien said.
	   An unidentified state bank official was quoted as saying
devaluation of the yuan is only a matter of time.
	   Even as other currencies plunged during the Asian economic
crisis, Vietnam has kept tight reins on the dong, permitting only
three 5 percent drops over the last year.
	   As a result, Vietnam's exports have become relatively more
expensive than those of its regional competitors. But the
government worries that a major cut in the currency's value will
make much-needed imports more expensive and its dollar-denominated
debts more difficult to repay.

Sudan declared unilateral truce in southern Sudan

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan announced Monday a unilateral
cease-fire throughout southern Sudan, where war has caused a
worsening famine. The government urged rebels to follow suit.
	   ``The announcement comes as a further measure in the continuing
effort by the government to contain the humanitarian situation in
southern Sudan,'' a government statement said.
	   Aid workers estimate that about 1.5 million people are facing
starvation in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr al-Ghazal province, as
a result of drought and the fighting.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is air-dropping 9,500 tons of food a
month _ at a cost of dlrs 30 million _ into the south in the
world's largest aid operation.
	   The cease-fire declaration expands the scope of a limited
three-month truce reached in July between the government and the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. It comes on the eve of peace
talks between the warring parties in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
	   The government did not say how long the truce would last.
	   ``The cease-fire ... is to demonstrate the keenness of the
Sudanese government to prepare the ground for the success of the
peace talks,'' government spokesman Ghazi Salah Eddin Atabani said.
	   ``We hope the rebel movement will listen to the voice of reason
and declare on its part a comprehensive cease fire as well,''
Atabani was quoted as saying by the official Sudan News Agency.
	   A rebel official in Cairo, Egypt, dismissed the announcement.
	   ``This cease-fire is just a maneuver for the talks tomorrow,''
said Daniel Kodi Angelo, an SPLA representative in Cairo, Egypt.
	   But he said he could not comment on the leadership's response.
	   The talks in Addis Ababa will be the first negotiations between
the government and the SPLA since May when the two sides met in
Nairobi, Kenya. They are expected to deal with the issue of
self-determination for the people of southern Sudan and the
relationship between religion and the state.
	   The SPLA has fought since 1983 for autonomy for the south's
Christian and animist peoples from the Islamic north. An estimated
1.5 million have died in the fighting and war-induced famines.

Thai education officials to delay buying pricey signal receivers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai Education Ministry has delayed
plans to buy 6,775 signal receivers for its satellite classroom
program after the price became unusually high, a senior ministry
official said Monday.
	   The delay came after the government's Budget Bureau suspected
that the private company controlling the educational broadcasting
and the equipment, headed by telecommunications magnate Thaksin
Shinawatra, was pushing up the prices of the receivers.
	   The bureau wants to pay 16,000 baht (dlrs 400) per receiver
while the distributor is offering them at 25,000 to 26,500 baht
(dlrs 625 to dlrs 662) each, the official said.
	   The bureau commented that the price is still extremely high for
the imported receivers, made by the France-based Thomson Co., even
considering the falling value of the baht over the past year, which
has made imports more expensive.
	   The ministry may have to scrap the deal unless it can be
concluded before the end of the fiscal year in two months.
	   The receivers are imported into Thailand solely by Shinawatra
Satellite, which also controls distribution. Shinawatra owns the
Thaicom satellite, which has allowed the ministry to broadcast
educational programs to isolated areas free for four years.
	   The original deal on the project was made when Thaksin, who
entered politics a few years ago, was a Cabinet minister. Officials
from his company refused to comment. Thaksin was not available.

Romanian premier: Romania willing to return property to Jews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more on confiscated Jewish property, quotes from
WJRO official in grafs 7-10 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Visiting Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
said Monday that he will submit legislation in parliament next
month to return property to Jews whose property was nationalized
after World War II.
	   ``The bill presents a global solution for Romania to return
property to all former owners, not only Jews,'' said Vasile, who
arrived Sunday for a four-day visit to Israel.
	   Vasile was meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Monday afternoon, and was scheduled to meet with representatives of
the World Jewish Restitution Organization on Tuesday.
	   The Romanian premier toured Jerusalem's walled Old City with his
wife Maricua on Monday morning. The couple visited the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre, the traditional site of Jesus' crucifixion and
resurrection, and the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and
window-shopped in the Muslim Quarter.
	   ``It's wonderful, unbelievable,'' Mrs. Vasile said. ``It's like
a dream because of all this history.''
	   Some 400,000 Jews _ half the Romanian Jewish population _ died
in World War II, when Romania was allied with Nazi Germany. Many
others left the country in the years after the war, when hundreds
of Jewish properties were nationalized by Romania's communist
government.
	   Naftali Lavi, vice-chairman of the World Jewish Restitution
Organization, said that several thousand public properties and as
many as hundreds of thousands of private properties were seized
from Jews by the Nazis and the communists.
	   ``We were singled out for the confiscation of our property,''
Lavi said. ``Therefore we have to be singled out for restitution as
well.''
	   Lavi said that if property cannot be returned, the owners should
be fully compensated.
	   A joint WJRO-government committee working to restore public
Jewish properties met for the second time Monday in Bucharest, Lavi
said. ``The property that the Nazis took from the Jews is still in
the Romanian government's hands,'' he said.
	   Vasile said five houses belonging to Jews had already been
returned to their owners this year, and that another three or four
would be returned soon.
	   Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said there were now only
12,000 Jews in Romania, but that Romanian Jews living outside the
country were expected to ask for the return of their property as
well.
	   More than 450,000 Jews of Romanian origin live in Israel,
according to Israel's Foreign Ministry.
	   Romania's president, Emil Constantinescu, won praise from
Romanian Jewish leaders last year for publicly acknowledging the
country's complicity in the persecution and murder of Jews in the
Holocaust.

With Iran-Khatami's First Year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Iranian president outlines economic plan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami has called for
reducing government monopolies on goods and services, eliminating
the red tape holding back foreign investment and cutting the
country's reliance on oil revenues.
	   The moderate cleric, who took office one year ago, said Iran's
``sick'' economy has suffered from several decades of mismanagement
and needs fundamental changes, such as reducing government
intervention.
	   He outlined his long-awaited economic proposals in a speech
broadcast on state radio late Sunday. The remarks were reported
Monday in the Iran News.
	   Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved Khatami's
economic plan and wished the president success in implementing the
reforms, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   In his speech, Khatami also called for full implementation of
Islamic banking principles, which forbid interest payments, and
scheduled repayment of Iran's foreign debt, estimated at around
dlrs 15 billion.
	   The paper quoted him as saying that high unemployment and
inflation had cut into the public's purchasing power. Meanwhile, he
said, dependence on oil revenues, a shortage of capital, cumbersome
laws hindering investment and lack of competitiveness were hurting
development.
	   Iran and other Gulf oil producers have been grappling with
rising budget deficits because of low world prices for oil, a main
source of government revenues.
	   Khatami said that despite the economic problems, the government
would maintain subsidies on basic commodities such as rice, cooking
oil and meat.
	   The president also reiterated a commitment to reducing the gap
between rich and poor, a cherished tenet of the 1979 Islamic
revolution, the paper said.
	   Khatami said social justice would prevail over development if a
choice had to be made between the two.
	   He acknowledged that he was unable to give full attention to
economic policy during his first year in office because of
political distractions. Khatami, a reformist, has been involved in
a power struggle with Iran's powerful hard-line clerics since his
elections last year.

Sudan declares unilateral truce in south
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan announced Monday a unilateral
cease-fire throughout the south, where war has caused a worsening
famine. The government urged rebels to follow suit.
	   ``The announcement comes as a further measure in the continuing
effort by the government to contain the humanitarian situation in
southern Sudan,'' a government statement said.
	   Aid workers estimate that 1.5 million people are facing
starvation, mainly in Bahr al-Ghazal province, as a result of
drought and the fighting.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is air-dropping 9,500 tons of food a
month _ at a cost of dlrs 30 million _ into the south in the
world's largest aid operation.
	   The cease-fire declaration expands the scope of a limited
three-month truce reached in July between the government and the
rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. It comes on the eve of peace
talks between the warring parties in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
	   The government did not say how long the truce would last.
	   ``The cease-fire ... is to demonstrate the keenness of the
Sudanese government to prepare the ground for the success of the
peace talks,'' government spokesman Ghazi Salah Eddin Atabani said.
	   ``We hope the rebel movement will listen to the voice of reason
and declare on its part a comprehensive cease-fire as well,''
Atabani was quoted as saying by the official Sudan News Agency.
	   A rebel official in Cairo, Egypt, dismissed the announcement.
	   ``This cease-fire is just a maneuver for the talks tomorrow,''

the government and the SPLA since May when the two sides met in
Nairobi, Kenya. They are expected to deal with the issue of
self-determination for the people of southern Sudan and the

Chinese military in `fight to the death' with flooded Yangtze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS warning about Yellow River flooding in grafs 5-6,
CLARIFIES that embankments are on Yangtze in graf 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's military has ordered soldiers to ``fight
to the death'' to ensure that waterlogged dikes holding back the
flooded Yangtze River do not collapse, state media reported Monday.
	   More than 1 million soldiers, militiamen and reservists have
been drafted into flood control efforts in four provinces in south
and east China as flood levels on the Yangtze reached levels unseen
in more than four decades.
	   China's military, the world's largest, with 2.9 million members,
has played a prominent role in efforts to prevent the collapse of
embankments that protect millions of people and rich farmland along
the river, the world's third-longest.
	   Floods brought by rains that fell earlier and heavier than usual
have killed at least 1,268 people in China so far this year.
	   Most of the deaths have occurred along the Yangtze, but
authorities in northern China warned Monday that heavy rains could
also cause catastrophic flooding along the Yellow River.
	   Sandbags and other supplies have been stockpiled and 2.5 million
people alerted to fight high waters if they come, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Hundreds of thousands of flood victims living in lean-tos on top
of Yangtze embankments for the past six weeks may have to wait
three weeks more, until waters subside, before returning home, said
Arne Jacobsen, a Red Cross official who recently toured flooded
areas.
	   Exhaustion and exposure are wearing down flood victims' health
and they also are beginning to show symptoms of mental strain, he
said.
	   Thus far, diseases have been confined to intestinal complaints
and skin infections from contact with dirty water, said Jacobsen.
Free antibiotics and water purification pills are running out in
some areas, though they remained available for sale in shops, he
added.
	   Commanders in the Nanjing Military Region, in flood-battered
Jiangsu province east of Shanghai, ordered all officers and men to
``fight to the death to protect the Yangtze River dikes, major
cities along the river and the well-being and property of local
people,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Speedy work by 500 soldiers on collapsed dikes near the city of
Yueyang in southern Hunan province last week saved the lives and
property of 100,000 people, Xinhua said.
	   Another 800 soldiers worked ``tirelessly'' for five days and
nights to reinforce a levee on Hunan's Dongting lake, which flows
into the Yangtze. Army planes, boats and trucks have ferried 160
tons of food, clothing, medicine and plastic sheeting to stricken
areas, Xinhua said.
	   Meanwhile, a man who refused to join anti-flood efforts and
attacked a village official, and another who allegedly dumped four
truck loads of soil into a river, were arrested in Jiangsu, Xinhua
said.

Aziz criticizes U.N. weapons inspectors after talks

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Dimming prospects for progress in talks
with the United Nations, a top Iraqi official accused the chief
U.N. weapons inspector Monday of ``serving the American policy'' by
trying to prolong punishing sanctions on Iraq.
	   Using harsh language, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said
after a three-hour session with Richard Butler that the U.N.
Special Commission was ``back to its old games, to its old
tricks.''
	   The commission, which Butler heads, is responsible for ensuring
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as
required by U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War. The
comments followed some optimism that the two sides were on track to
ending the inspections, which began after the war.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.
	   Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's progress in
eliminating its weaponry and instead focusing on ``minor issues
which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq .... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   Butler did not hear Aziz's remarks and, when asked about them,
said only that ``work is in progress.''
	   On Sunday, Butler told reporters: ``Our steadfast aim is to get
this done as soon as possible to get to the end of the disarmament
phase so the Security Council can consider the sanctions issue.''
	   The two sides were to meet again Monday night for further talks.
Butler will remain in Baghdad until Wednesday.
	   Neither Aziz or Butler gave specifics on what was discussed
Monday, but the ``blueprint'' Butler presented the Iraqis during
his last visit in June calls for further disclosures about the
country's missile program and biological and chemical weaponry.
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said that the sanctions
must be lifted this year _ the first time he had set a deadline.
Iraq says the sanctions have caused widespread poverty,
malnutrition and illnesses among its 22 million people.
	   Iraqi newspapers excoriated Butler in their editorials Monday.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath party, said Butler
was no longer a representative of an international organization but
``a man who implements American policies against Iraq.''
	   Iraq has long accused the United States and Britain of
needlessly prolonging the sanctions.

Miners maintain blockade in Russian Far East, power cuts loom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nemtsov comments in grafs 3-4, legislature
decision in 7th graf, Partizansk miners' threats in 11th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With an electricity blackout looming, striking
coal miners maintained a railroad blockade for a 10th day Monday
outside the main power station on the eastern Russian island of
Sakhalin.
	   The protesters have prevented coal from reaching the power
plant, and officials have begun to ration electricity on the
island, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. One of the plant's
generators already has been shut down, and the second only has
enough coal for a few more days.
	   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Monday that
regional and federal officials would join forces to pay the miners,
but only if they get off the rails.
	   ``The government will not succumb to blackmail,'' Nemtsov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Meanwhile, Ivan Malakhov, the first deputy governor of Sakhalin,
said the blockade was illegal and hinted that authorities could use
force to remove the miners.
	   ``We will not allow (the miners) to put out the second
generator,'' Malakhov was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   But in an emergency session, Sakhalin legislators unanimously
voted against using force to remove miners from the rails, though
they agreed the blockade was unacceptable, Interfax reported.
	   The miners have vowed not to lift the blockade until they are
paid eight months of overdue wages.
	   The strike is one of many periodic miners protests that have
taken place across Russia since May to demand overdue wages.
However, the protests have been largely uncoordinated and have not
inflicted significant damage on the economy.
	   Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national power grid, so
much of the island is dependent on the plant for electricity. About
650,000 people live on the island.
	   In a related developments, miners outside the Far Eastern city
of Vladivostok sent a letter to Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
threatening to block a nearby section of the Trans-Siberian
railway, ITAR-Tass said. Some of the miners from mines in the town
of Partizansk have been on a hunger strike.
	   Many of Russia's coal mines have been losing money for years,
and the government has been trying to shut them down. Many coal
companies have been nominally privatized, but still depend on
significant government subsidies in order to pay their workers.

Managing director of Gay Games dismissed for overspending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The managing director of the 1998
Gay Games was fired for overspending just after the Olympics-style
event began.
	   The board of directors for the quadrennial homosexual sports and
cultural festival issued a statement Monday, saying it had
``revoked the mandate'' of Dutchman Marc Janssens on Sunday, the
day after the opening ceremonies.
	   ``The reason is that Mr. Janssens made commitments outside the
approved budget, commitments that were also bigger than his
authority,'' the statement said. It did not elaborate.
	   ``We have no overview of the complete situation,'' said Games
spokesman Paul van Yperen, adding the directors are still
investigating the extent of the financial problem.
	   The Gay Games, which began on Saturday and run through Aug. 8,
are expected to attract 15,000 participants and 200,000 visitors
from 66 countries.
	   The event is costing 14 million guilders (dlrs 7 million).
Organizers received 3 million guilders (dlrs 1.5 million) in
government subsidies and another 3 millions guilders (dlrs 1.5
million) from corporate sponsors such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
and Kodak.

Spanish court gives Australian fugitive week to leave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Madrid, Spain (AP) _ A court has given fugitive Australian
businessman Christopher Skase a week to leave Spain after it
overturned a stay he had won on a deportation order, an official at
the Australian Embassy in Madrid said Monday.
	   Christopher Skase fled to the Spanish Mediterranean island of
Mallorca in 1991 to avoid charges relating to the collapse of his
Qintex business which left him bankrupt in 1991 with debts
amounting to over U.S. dlrs. 1 billion. His extradition was turned
down by Spain in 1994.
	   The latest ruling came after Spanish authorities ordered Skase's
deportation last month when his residency papers expired. Skase's
lawyers then temporarily won a stay on the order.
	   An embassy official, who asked not to be named, said the ruling
was delivered to Skase on Friday and gave him seven days to leave
the country or appeal.
	   With most Spanish courts on vacation in August, the case is not
expected to be resolved until next month.
	   Lawyers for Skase could not be contacted for comment Monday.
	   Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone welcomed the ruling
this weekend but acknowledged that Skase would almost certainly
continue to use all legal means available to him to avoid
deportation.
	   In an interview with a Mallorca newspaper this weekend, Skase
was cited as saying he was confident of staying in Mallorca.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Now it's Lord Byron's turn to get a long
overdue scrubbing.
	   Restorers are at work on the statue of the English poet as part
of an effort to wash away the blemishes of age and pollution from
the 14 statues on the walkways outside the Zappeion Hall, the 19th
century mansion-turned-public landmark in central Athens.
	   ``They are cleaned by hand. It is a special method. It needs
concentration,'' Katerina Daskalaki, director of the preservation
team of Athens' national monuments, said Monday.
	   It is the first cleaning of the nearly 140-year-old marble
statue of Byron, who is depicted dying in the arms of a goddess
representing Greece. Scaffolding and cloth coverings now surround
the seven-meter-high (23-foot-high) statue.
	   Byron died in 1824 at Missolonghi, where he had taken command of
a Greek brigade during the fight for independence from Ottoman
rule.
	   Other statues around the Zappeion have already been cleaned.
They include the founders of the modern Greek state and ancient
athletes. The Zappeion served as the residence for competitors in
the first modern Olympiad in 1896.
	   In September, officials plan to expand the cleaning effort to
most other major statues around Athens, said Zeta Andronopoulou, an
archeologist at City Hall.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces overran another ethnic
Albanian stronghold Monday and pressed their attacks elsewhere in
Kosovo, after a weekend of fighting that displaced tens of
thousands of people.
	   The U.N. relief agency estimated 35,000 people fled their homes
during the weekend. The Red Cross reported finding twice that
number in one area alone.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill called the offensive a setback to
American and European peace efforts and declared ``we are on the
verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   In Geneva, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, Kris Janowski, said the upsurge in clashes had so
disrupted transport and communications that ``we are back to square
one,'' unable to reach pockets of refugees cut off by the fighting.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources reported widespread fighting Monday
throughout Kosovo and said six villages had been leveled in the
rebellious province, where ethnic Albanian militants are fighting
for independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo's population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said police entered Smonica
early Monday. Serb military sources said troops shelled the village
near the Albanian border for days and killed at least a dozen
Kovoso Liberation Army fighters.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued Monday to lay siege to
another border village, Junik. Independent media in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade said most KLA fighters had slipped out of the
village for sanctuaries in nearby Albania, leaving a few dozen
insurgents who have encircled their positions with land mines.
	   The latest fighting broke out after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic promised a European Union delegation last week that the
latest offensive against the KLA was over.
	   Milosevic also promised that international aid organizations
would be granted access to the refugees and that diplomatic
observers could escort them back to their homes.
	   In Pristina, Hill said he was waiting for signs those promises
would be fulfilled. ``I'm not interested in anyone's assurances,''
he said. ``We don't have facts on the grounds as far as I can
see.''
	   Another UNHCR official, Mons Nyberg, said access had been ``on
and off,'' with police sometimes holding his teams at checkpoints
for hours before allowing them to proceed.
	   He said it was unclear whether this was due to a ``lack of
communication or a systematic plan to stop of slow access.'' Nyberg
estimated at least 35,000 people fled the weekend fighting,
swelling the total number of refugees to about 180,000 since the
government launched its crackdown on Albanian militants in
February.
	   In Geneva, Red Cross spokeswoman Amanda Williamson said a team
found between 60,000 and 80,000 refugees hiding on the slopes of
Mount Berisa south of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   She said the Red Cross was trying to organize an aid convoy from
Belgrade.
	   The campaign against Albanian civilians was reminiscent of the
forcible removal of rival ethnic groups that marked conflicts in
the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Croatia earlier this
decade.
	   In Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party courted by
the United States accused the Serb-led Yugoslav government of
trying ``to make it impossible for thousands of Albanians to return
to their homes.''
	   The statement was issued by the Albanian Democratic Movement,
whose leader, Mehmet Hajrizi, has been mentioned as a key figure in
a planned Albanian team that U.S. diplomats hope can negotiate
Kosovo's future with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has promised to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
canceled in 1989. But he and major world powers oppose independence
for Kosovo.
	   The United States and European nations fear independence could
lead to demands by Albanian-speaking communities in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, to establish a ``Greater
Albania'' in the southern Balkans.
	   KLA leaders are expected to announce this week whether they will
accept a U.S. plan for Albanian politicians to enter peace talks
with Milosevic. The current Serb offensive appears designed to
deliver a strong blow against the rebels and force them to
negotiate from a position of weakness.

Opposition seeks introduction of abortion pill in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By UTA WINKHAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats are
working toward introduction of the French abortion pill RU-486 in
Germany if they are victorious in September's national elections.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative government so far has
declined to back the drug, which has been resisted in Germany by
abortion opponents.
	   Social Democratic lawmaker Marliese Dobberthien said Monday that
she has contacted the pill's French patent holder to urge him to
seek European Union approval for marketing the pill in Germany.
	   Edouard Sakiz, the patent holder, said in a telephone interview
from Paris that he would seek approval from EU regulators only if
Germany's federal government backs the plan.
	   The Social Democrats and their chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder, who is leading Kohl in opinion polls, have not taken a
formal position on the abortion pill during the election campaign.
	   But Social Democrats in parliament traditionally have supported
RU-486's introduction, party spokesman Michael Donnermeyer said in
Bonn.
	   The abortion pill, known chemically as mifepristone and
introduced on the market in France in 1988, is available in Europe
only in France, Sweden and Britain.
	   It is 95.5 percent effective in causing abortion when taken
within the first 49 days of pregnancy.
	   The German chemicals and pharmaceuticals company Hoechst
originally owned the RU-486 patent through its French subsidiary
Roussel Uclaf and considered marketing the drug in Germany.
	   But the company said at the time it would do so only with the
backing of Kohl's government, which withheld support. Under
pressure from anti-abortion groups, the company transferred the
patent in April 1997 to Sakiz, one of the developers of the drug.
	   Sakiz produces the drug under a small company in France whose
name he keeps secret, fearing reprisals from abortion opponents.
	   Sakiz said he planned to apply in September to market RU-486 in
further European countries as of Jan. 1. He said Germany was not
yet on the list, but that if Schroeder wins the Sept. 27 election
and announces his government's support for RU-486, he would add
Germany.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Doctors removed fluid from the
stomach of King Fahd Monday and he was recovering in a Riyadh
hospital, a royal statement said.
	   A medical team at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in the
capital Riyadh ``removed a pussy fluid from the stomach after one
of the colons became inflamed,'' the official Saudi Press Agency
quoted the statement as saying.
	   It said the king was not operated on and the procedure was
conducted under local anesthesia. It did not elaborate.
	   ``The king is very well and will spend a few days at the
hospital before being discharged,'' the statement said.
	   Saudi officials said earlier that the king was admitted to
hospital on Sunday to undergo medical tests but diplomats in the
kingdom said he was suffering from an undisclosed illness.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to Crown Prince Abdullah, his
half-brother.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was admitted to the hospital on
Sunday after being flown to Riyadh from the Red Sea city of Jiddah.
	   He was accompanied by two of his sons and his brothers, Prince
Sultan and Prince Salman. They later were joined by Crown Prince
Abdullah. State-run television showed Fahd shaking hands with
relatives.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   Fahd has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   He was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Feuding neighbors Eritrea and
Ethiopia failed to reach a formula to end their tense border
standoff after two days of separate weekend talks with mediators in
Burkina Faso.
	   The rival Horn of Africa nations pledged not to resume
hostilities until they have held another round of peace
negotiations that have yet to be scheduled.
	   Fighting which flared in early May subsided in mid-June,
following a U.S.-brokered deal to stop deadly air raids. Several
hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished before the stalemate.
	   Breaking from the country's past stance, Eritrea's foreign
minister proposed to withdraw his country's forces from the region
if Ethiopia did the same to create a demilitarized zone.
	   ``We don't need a war to solve a border problem,'' Eritrean
Foreign Minister Haile Woldetensae said.
	   Eritrea had previously refused to consider moving its troops
from land it considers its own. Ethiopia, however, insists on a
pullout before face-to-face talks could proceed.
	   Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin, however, said later
he was ``not optimistic'' despite the withdrawal offer.
	   The developments came after the opposing ministers met
separately with Burkina Faso's President Blaise Campaore who was
hosting the mediation efforts led by OAU secretary-general Salim
Ahmed Salim.
	   The Eritrean and Ethiopian ministers later held separate talks
with the OAU secretary-general and the foreign ministers of
Zimbabwe and Djibouti.
	   Both parties in the conflict have refused meet face-to-face.
	   Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo said Campaore
would meet soon with the heads of state of Djibouti and Zimbabwe to
discuss the latest developments.
	   The antagonists would subsequently attend another round of
meetings, although no date or venue had been decided on, Ouedraogo
added.
	   Eritrea, which claims rights to the disputed areas under
colonial-era agreements, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

Montenegro stops all contacts with Milosevic's government

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Montenegro's reformist government
stopped all contacts Monday with the government of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and a minister said a referendum on
secession could be held.
	   The Montenegrin government said they would not communicate with
the Yugoslav government until the federal premier, Momir Bulatovic,
steps down, and another successor from Montenegro is named.
	   Bulatovic, a former Montenegrin president, is a staunch ally of
Milosevic.
	   Montenegro and the much larger Serbia are the only two republics
that remained part of Yugoslavia as the country crumbled in the
early 1990s.
	   Bulatovic's party lost out in May voting to a coalition led by
pro-Western Milo Djukanovic, a reformist who now is president of
Montenegro. Milosevic and Djukanovic have clashed over economic and
other issues.
	   Milosevic, who became Yugoslav president last year, wants to
dominate Montenegro. He named Bulatovic as federal premier despite
his party's loss at home.
	   Predrag Drecun, labor minister in Montenegro's government, said
his party will propose a resolution next month giving Milosevic an
ultimatum to name a new federal premier from among Montenegro's
reformers.
	   ``If Milosevic rejects this, a referendum should be held in
Montenegro to decide whether it wants to stay in a country where
the will of the majority is not respected,'' Drecun said.

	   REIMS, France (AP) _ A day after the Tour de France ended in
Paris, members of the Dutch team TVM were being questioned by
police Monday about banned drugs found in their possession.
	   TVM team members had pulled out of the race on Friday, two days
before the ending, saying they had neither the physical nor the
mental strength to continue.
	   Six cyclists, along with other team staff members, were being
questioned Monday morning in Reims, north of Paris. Already the
team director, Cees Priem, and its doctor, Andrei Mikhailov, and a
masseur have been placed under formal investigation _ a step short
of being formally charged _ on doping charges.
	   Team official Guido Calster emerged early afternoon after being
questioned, and said the team had been ``treated well.'' He said
they were being asked ``personal questions.''

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese government declared a
unilateral cease-fire Monday throughout southern Sudan, where a
15-year war has aggravated a worsening famine.
	   The announcement expands the scope of a limited three-month
truce reached in July between the government and the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army. It comes on the eve of peace talks
between the warring parties in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
	   The cease-fire will take effect Tuesday, but the government did
not say how long it would last.
	   ``The announcement comes as a further measure in the continuing
effort by the government to contain the humanitarian situation in
southern Sudan,'' a government statement said.
	   Aid workers estimate that about 1.5 million people are facing
starvation in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr al-Ghazal province, as
a result of drought and the fighting.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is dropping 9,500 tons of food a
month _ at a cost of dlrs 30 million _ into the south in the
world's largest aid operation.
	   The last major cease-fire in Sudan, brokered by former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, was signed in March 1995 and lasted two
months. The government then extended it another two months.
	   Sudanese officials said the announcement Monday should aid
negotiations with the rebels.
	   ``The cease-fire ... is to demonstrate the keenness of the
Sudanese government to prepare the ground for the success of the
peace talks,'' government spokesman Ghazi Salah Eddin Atabani said.
	   ``We hope the rebel movement will listen to the voice of reason
and declare on its part a comprehensive cease-fire as well,''
Atabani was quoted as saying by the official Sudan News Agency.
	   A rebel official in Cairo, Egypt, dismissed the announcement.
	   ``This cease-fire is just a maneuver for the talks tomorrow,''
said Daniel Kodi Angelo, an SPLA representative in Cairo, Egypt.
	   But he said he could not comment on the leadership's response.
	   The talks in Addis Ababa will be the first negotiations between
the government and the SPLA since May when the two sides met in
Nairobi, Kenya. They are expected to deal with the issue of
self-determination for the people of southern Sudan and the
relationship between religion and the state.
	   The SPLA has fought since 1983 for autonomy for the south's
Christian and animist peoples from the Islamic north. An estimated
1.5 million have died in the fighting and war-induced famines.

U.S. Filter says low ringgit makes this good time to invest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Filter, a water and
wastewater treatment company, feels the weak Malaysian currency is
providing American investors with a good opportunity, its president
said Monday.
	   The national news agency Bernama quoted the president, Richard
J. Heckmann, as saying he would call on chief executive officers of
other U.S. companies to invest in Malaysia.
	   The ringgit has lost about 40 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar in the last year.
	   Bernama said Heckmann added that U.S. media had given a negative
impression of the situation in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia.
	   U.S. Filter's fourth plant in Malaysia was opened last Friday by
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz. The company
employs 50,000 employees in 94 countries.
	   Heckmann said U.S. Filter opened the plant based on Malaysia's
potential to become an international center for industrial
development despite the economic downturn, Bernama reported.
	   ``We know where we want to be. ... Not all countries are
suitable for manufacturing,'' said Heckmann.
	   ``We are here to stay, and we definitely want to be here to meet
the requirements of a fast-developing industrial manufacturing
community when its economy recovers,'' he said.

American rattles over roller coaster rails for more than 1,000
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Richard Rodriguez greeted fans on shaky ``sea
legs'' Monday after riding for 47 days _ not the turbulent waves of
the ocean, but a wooden roller coaster.
	   The 39-year-old New York City native spent just more than 1,013
hours on the Big Dipper roller coaster in the English resort town
of Blackpool, beating his 1994 record of 549 hours.
	   Rodriguez outlasted Canadian rival Normand St. Pierre, who
stopped riding a Montreal roller coaster after 670 hours last
month.
	   ``I wanted to put the record out of reach,'' Rodriguez said
Monday, after surpassing his goal of 1,000 hours.
	   The Miami University lecturer and graduate student followed the
strict guidelines imposed by the Guinness Book of Records before it
stopped tracking the roller coaster competition several years ago.
He eat, slept and drank in his favorite carriage in the middle of
the roller coaster, taking off two hours each day to shower and eat
a hot meal.
	   Although Rodriguez said he is ``very attached to the ride,'' he
admitted ``missing interaction with people'' while he was going
around and around.
	   ``During the World Cup, I wanted to get out and have a lager
with people,'' he said. Alas, stopping for a few beers wasn't on
the schedule.
	   From the time he first experienced the ups and downs of the
Coney Island Cyclone as a child, Rodriguez has enjoyed ``the
adventure of riding a roller coaster and the cultural experience of
meeting new people everyday.''
	   The Cyclone remains one of his two favorites _ along with the
75-year old Big Dipper at Blackpool's amusement park.
	   ``They are very different,'' Rodriguez said. ``The Big Dipper is
a smooth-riding wooden coaster you can sleep on. The Cyclone has
steep inclines and rattles around.''
	   Rodriguez, a diabetic who survived the summer on a diet of fish
and chips, pasta and hot dogs, is donating the money he collected
from sponsors to diabetes research.
	   Before returning to school, he plans to tour England _ on his
two shaky feet.

Gunfire rings though Kinshasa army barracks

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Gunfire and rumors of a coup d'etat
echoed through Congo's capital of Kinshasa early Monday morning as
rival soldiers clashed in a military barracks and at a second base
while the government ordered people off the streets.
	   In eastern Congo, military leaders reportedly revolted against
President Laurent Kabila and called for his ouster, while a senior
cabinet minister from the eastern ethnic Banyamulenge group failed
to return to Congo after a trip to South Africa.
	   A dawn-to-dusk curfew has been imposed on Kinshasa and troops
loyal to Kabila began a massive search for Rwandan Tutsi soldiers,
who were the president's one-time allies.
	   A defense ministry official said loyalist troops had been
ordered to kill any Rwandan soldiers found hiding in and around the
city.
	   The sound of gunfire was heard coming from Camp Kokolo military
base and the Tshatshi barracks on Kinshasa's west side.
	   The clashes apparently pitted Kabila's troops against Rwandan
mercenaries, who last year helped the president oust longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The fighting comes amid growing suspicions within Kabila's
government that the Rwandan troops had been plotting against the
regime.
	   In the Rwandan capital, Kigali, a private news agency reported
an open rebellion against Kabila had been launched in North Kivu
province in eastern Congo.
	   ``We, the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
taken the decision to remove President Laurent Desire Kabila from
power,'' said a statement read Sunday in French and Swahili over
Radio Goma, according to the private Rwandan News Agency.
	   The statement was signed by Sylvain Mbuchi, commander of the
10th battalion of the Congolese army based in Goma, the provincial
capital, RNA said.
	   The statement called on the local population to remain calm and
go about their daily business and assured residents that the goal
of the rebels was to ``preserve the unity and security of the whole
nation.''
	   A spokesman for a breakaway ethnic group in North Kivu urged the
people to rise up against Kabila.
	   ``We've taken the decision to no longer recognize the government
of Laurent Kabila,'' said the spokesman, who identified himself
only as Andre. ``We don't want to separate from Congo, but Kabila
must be removed from power.''
	   In a statement delivered to The Associated Press and the Voice
of America, Andre said his group, representing Banyamulenge ethnic
Tutsis, was in control of most of North Kivu province.
	   Congo's Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha, a Tutsi from the
Banyamulenge group, failed to returned to Congo on Saturday from a
trip to South Africa. His absence has triggered speculation that he
may be linked to the uprising.
	   The crisis comes one week after Kabila ordered all Rwandan
soldiers out of his country without explanation. Earlier, Kabila
sacked James Kabari, a Rwandan Tutsi who had been the president's
top military commander.
	   Although Rwandan troops played an important role last year in
Kabila victory over Mobutu, relations between the central African
countries have soured in recent months.
	   According to a defense ministry official, more than 1,000
Rwandan Tutsi soldiers fled the Kokolo base and are hiding in a
forest just outside of Kinshasa.
	   Kabila has been growing anxious about the presence of Rwandan
forces in Kinshasa, and weeks before ordering them to leave he
increased security around government buildings.
	   Tanks were deployed in front of the presidential residence and
office compound while troops were stationed at key ministry
buildings.
	   The sound of fighting Monday triggered an order by the
government to clear the streets.
	   ``The government asks the people of Congo and those foreigners
here in the country to stay calm and to stay at home until order is
restored,'' said an abrupt announcement Monday morning on
state-controlled People's Radio. ``Stay at home just until that
time when the armed forces of Congo re-establish civil order.''
	   Shops throughout the capital remained closed Monday morning, and
people who had headed downtown for work early in the morning
quickly returned home.
	   Speculation was rife over the stability of Kabila's government
after weeks of growing tension between the president, his top
advisers and what now appears to be a shaky military alliance with
neighboring Rwanda.

remarks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan urged
Indonesia Monday to punish rioters who brutalized the country's
ethnic Chinese minority during disturbances in May.
	   Tang told reporters that the Chinese government had ``expressed
concern'' about the violence against ethnic Chinese women to the
Indonesian government.
	   He had raised the issue with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas when the two met at a session of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations in Manila last week, he said.
	   Tang said that ``the Chinese people and all the Chinese overseas
are furious and indignant'' over the recent violence in Indonesia.
	   He added that he hoped the Indonesian government would
investigate and ``take proper measures so that the safety of the
ethnic Chinese would be guaranteed.''
	   Tang made his remarks after arriving in Hong Kong for an
overnight stop en route to Beijing. He was scheduled to have a
private dinner with Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Earlier, the Chinese Communist Party newspaper People's Daily
said that justly treating ethnic Chinese and safeguarding their
lives and property would help restore Indonesia's international
prestige and attract investment, speeding economic recovery.
	   Indonesian authorities ``should look squarely at the facts with
a serious attitude, take genuinely strong steps as soon as
possible, sternly punish lawbreakers,'' the newspaper said in a
front-page commentary.
	   About 1,200 people died in the riots in May that led to the
downfall of former President Suharto after 32 years in power.
Women's groups say at least 168 women were raped by rioters. Many
of the victims were from the ethnic Chinese minority, who often are
scapegoats in difficult times. Indonesia is undergoing its worst
economic crisis in decades.
	   The Chinese, who make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's 200
million people, are resented in part because they control much of
the economy and enjoy relative wealth.
	   The People's Daily said ethnic Chinese were continuing to make
``unremitting efforts'' to help Indonesia's economy recover.
	   ``As positive, important members of Indonesian society, their
legal rights should be respected, their lives and property should
be protected effectively,'' the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Feuding neighbors Eritrea and
Ethiopia failed to reach a formula to end their tense border
standoff after two days of separate weekend talks with mediators in
Burkina Faso.
	   The rival Horn of Africa nations pledged not to resume
hostilities until they have held another round of peace
negotiations that have yet to be scheduled.
	   Fighting which flared in early May subsided in mid-June,
following a U.S.-brokered deal to stop deadly air raids. Several
hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished before the stalemate.
	   Breaking from the country's past stance, Eritrea's foreign
minister proposed to withdraw his country's forces from the region
if Ethiopia did the same to create a demilitarized zone.
	   ``We don't need a war to solve a border problem,'' Eritrean
Foreign Minister Haile Woldetensae said.
	   Eritrea had previously refused to consider moving its troops
from land it considers its own. Ethiopia, however, insists on a
pullout before face-to-face talks could proceed.
	   Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin, however, said later
he was ``not optimistic'' despite the withdrawal offer.
	   The developments came after the opposing ministers met
separately with Burkina Faso's President Blaise Campaore who was
hosting the mediation efforts led by OAU secretary-general Salim
Ahmed Salim.
	   The Eritrean and Ethiopian ministers later held separate talks
with the OAU secretary-general and the foreign ministers of
Zimbabwe and Djibouti.
	   Both parties in the conflict have refused meet face-to-face.
	   Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo said Campaore
would meet soon with the heads of state of Djibouti and Zimbabwe to
discuss the latest developments.
	   The antagonists would subsequently attend another round of
meetings, although no date or venue had been decided on, Ouedraogo
added.
	   Eritrea, which claims rights to the disputed areas under
colonial-era agreements, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

Turkey keeps Chechen president at a distance during visit

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey kept Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov at a distance Monday, insisting that his four-day visit
was a private one that did not include official meetings with
Turkish leaders.
	   Maskhadov, who has been seeking support for Chechnya's
recognition as an independent state, arrived in Istanbul Sunday.
	   Although many here sympathize with largely Muslim Chechnya's
demands for independence, Turkey, which is fighting
autonomy-seeking Kurdish insurgents itself, does not recognize
Chechnya's independence.
	   Turkey is also said to be weary of damaging its ties with
Moscow, which insists that Chechnya is part of Russia.
	   Chechnya claimed independence at the end of the 1994-1996
Chechen war. But its political status remains unresolved.
	   The Turkish foreign ministry said Monday that the leader of the
breakaway state was not going to visit Ankara or meet with Turkey's
government leaders.
	   Still, Maskhadov, accompanied by his family, held talks Monday
with junior coalition party leader Husamettin Cindoruk.
	   ``The Chechen people have received the greatest support for
their rightful struggle from Turkey,'' Maskhadov was quoted as
saying during the meeting.
	   Mashkadov was due to meet with a delegation of Turkish
businessmen.
	   Turkey and Chechnya are competing for the transport of Azeri oil
to Europe. Turkey plans to build a new oil pipeline linking Baku to
the Mediterranean Turkish port city of Ceyhan to replace the
existing line that passes through troubled Chechnya.

Sailor attacks captain and crew member, then sets himself ablaze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A sailor aboard a luxury yacht Monday used
a hatchet to injure his captain and another crew member, before
dousing himself with gasoline and setting his body ablaze.
	   According to the Merchant Marine Ministry, four Greek and seven
Canadian passengers aboard the yacht Thelginos used fire
extinguishers to put out Robert Giannousis. The passengers were not
identified. The yacht had three crew members.
	   Giannousis seriously injured Capt. Nicolas Klaromenos, 56, and
sailor Vasilis Hasandras, 45, before setting himself ablaze.
	   The ministry said Giannousis was listed in serious condition at
a health center on the Aegean Sea island of Alonissos. The captain
and sailor were also hospitalized.
	   The ministry said it had no further information on the incident,
which occurred while the yacht was anchored off a bay in Alonissos.
	   An investigation was underway to determine the reasons which led
Giannousis to go on a rampage in the early morning hours, the
ministry said.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Kashmiri guerrillas killed 34 sleeping
construction workers in two pre-dawn attacks Monday along a remote
mountain road, police said.
	   Militants burst into a shed in Kalaban, 10 miles (16 kilometers)
from Chamba in northern Himachal Pradesh state, and sprayed gunfire
on laborers. Twenty-six people were killed and eight wounded.
	   As the gunmen headed back to Jammu-Kashmir state, they attacked
a second group of construction workers in the village of Shatrundi,
killing eight people and wounding three, officials said.
	   The attacks occurred 270 miles (430 kilometers) north of New
Delhi, a few miles (kilometers) from the border between Himachal
Pradesh state and Jammu-Kashmir.
	   Militants have become more active in the area, and the attacks
mark the farthest Kashmiri rebels have ventured from the Muslim
heartland they want to free from Indian rule.
	   In Pakistani-controlled Kashmir on Monday, shelling by Indian
troops killed three people _ including two children _ Pakistani
officials said.
	   Islamic militants are fighting for an independent homeland or
for a merger with Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of providing
material and men to the insurgency in Kashmir, India's only
Muslim-majority state. Pakistan says it only gives moral and
political support to the movement.
	   The two nations have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir
since 1947.

Hand-picked Cambodian premier accepts crushing election defeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO RESTORE CYCLE DESIGNATOR &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The man who replaced Prince Norodom
Ranariddh as Cambodia's co-premier after last year's bloody coup
gracefully conceded his election defeat Monday, saying he had no
regrets.
	   Despite an aggressive election campaign and predictions by Ung
Huot that his Reastr Niyum party would win up to 50 of the 122
seats in parliament, it failed to capture a single one.
	   ``I am willing to transfer my power to the new government, the
next government,'' Ung Huot, who is also foreign minister, said in
an address to be aired on state-run television. ``I appeal to all
Cambodians, whatever their political aspiration, to accept the
result.''
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-prime
minister in last year's violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. At
least 100 supporters of Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party were killed by
Hun Sen's forces in the months that followed.
	   The prince and his loyalists spent months in exile before
returning with international backing to participate in elections.
	   Ung Huot and a handful of other FUNCINPEC members, several of
them ministers in Ranariddh's government, stayed behind to give
their support to Hun Sen, lending his administration a stamp of
legitimacy. Ung Huot was appointed Hun Sen's new co-premier.
	   Though he was sharply criticized by loyal FUNCINPEC members and
by ordinary Cambodians who saw his actions as a betrayal, Ung Huot
defended the move at the time as necessary to bring a return to
political stability.
	   ``I think what I did was right for the moment,'' he said Monday.
``I never thought it was a mistake.''
	   When elections were called earlier this year, Ung Huot formed
his own party. Despite what he thought was a sure fire campaign
pledge _ to shoot violent criminals on sight _ he failed to capture
the public's loyalty.
	   Ung Huot has now joined FUNCINPEC in complaining about
irregularities in the counting of ballots, but he said Monday that
if the National Election Committee determines that the polls were
free, fair and credible, he will step aside gracefully.
	   ``I feel sad, but that is the verdict of the people,'' he said,
adding that he intends to remain politically active. ``We will have
to look at our shortfalls, strengths and weaknesses, and after a
period of political stability will rethink our strategy.''

International authorities turn back Albanian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Italian and Albanian patrol boats turned
back more than 600 Albanians trying to flee across the Adriatic Sea
early Monday, the interior ministry said.
	   Italian border authorities stopped 17 dinghies a few miles off
of the Albanian coast, then assisted them back to the Albanian port
of Vlora, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Tirana.
	   According to police sources, around 52 dinghies carrying 1,500
people, most of them women and children, have been returned to
Albania in the past 20 days.
	   Some of the people who wanted to leave Albania were refugees
who'd fled Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians are fighting government forces for independence.

Dutch striker remaining with AC Milan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert has turned
down an offer from Manchester United to remain with AC Milan, the
Italian soccer club reported Monday.
	   The 22-year-old forward reached his decision during a meeting in
Amsterdam with his agent and Milan's director-general, Ariedo
Bradia.
	   Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards said Thursday that
Milan had accepted an offer, worth a reported 9 million pounds
(dlrs 14.8 million), for the the Dutchman, who starred for his
country during the World Cup in France.
	   Kluivert's contract with Milan, linking him to the club through
June 30, 2001, remains unchanged, the team said.
	   He reportedly received a small increase in his compensation.

Breathing problems force tracheotomy for Czech president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with details, fears Havel may be
developing pneumonia. CHANGES overline. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
underwent a tracheotomy Monday amid fears he might be developing
pneumonia eight days after serious abdominal surgery.
	   Doctors performed the procedure, in which a small hole is cut
into the throat to facilitate breathing, because of a lung
inflammation, said Boris Stastny, of member of the medical team
treating Havel at Prague's military hospital. ``You could call it a
potential pneumonia,'' he said.
	   After the operation, Havel was in the hospital's intensive care
unit. Doctors said Havel's temperature was back to normal but he
would be kept sedated until Tuesday.
	   Dr. Ernst Bodner, who performed the 90-minute surgery, said it
was complicated by scarring from Havel's three previous
tracheotomies.
	   Bodner, of the Innsbruck University Clinic, operated on Havel in
April when the president's colon ruptured while he was vacationing
in Austria.
	   Bodner was also part of the Czech-Austrian team who operated on
Havel on July 26 in Prague to restore his digestive tract.
	   The surgery had been declared successful, but Havel's overall
recovery was hindered by breathing problems.
	   The 61-year-old president, formerly a chain smoker, has been
hospitalized five times since December 1996, when he had a third of
his lung and a tumor removed.
	   Last week, Havel's lungs collapsed briefly, forcing the use of a
respirator. Doctors took Havel off the respirator Saturday, but
late Sunday, his temperature shot up to 39 degrees Celsius (102
degrees Fahrenheit), his heartbeat went up and laboratory findings
indicated a lung inflammation, doctors said.
	   According to experts, Havel will need at least six weeks to
fully recover. He is scheduled for an official visit to the United
States in September.

Chernobyl's only working reactor shut down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, comment from Chernobyl director in new
grafs 3-4. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The only working reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant shut down automatically because of an electric
transformer malfunction, officials said Monday.
	   No radiation leaks have occurred at the reactor No. 3 since the
shutdown on Sunday afternoon, said the state company Energoatom,
which runs Ukraine's nuclear plants. The reactor will undergo
repairs until Friday, Energoatom said.
	   Chernobyl officials later said the shutdown was caused by short
circuit in the external electric cables leading to the transformer.
	   Chernobyl director Vitaly Tolstonohov said Monday that
malfunctions at reactor No. 3 this year were due to bad repairs,
but added that the reactor's equipment generally was in good
condition, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Sunday's accident at the Chernobyl plant, albeit minor,
underscored recent warnings by Ukraine's top nuclear safety
official, who recently noted the growing number of malfunctions at
the country's five atomic power plants.
	   Oleksandr Smyshlyayev, who heads the Environmental Protection
Ministry's nuclear division, blamed the breakdowns on outdated
equipment and the failure to observe safety rules.
	   The Chernobyl plant originally had four working nuclear
reactors. Reactor No. 4 was destroyed in a 1986 explosion, the
world's worst nuclear accident. Another reactor was shut down after
being badly damaged by a 1991 fire, and a third is not operational.
	   Ukraine relies on nuclear plants to produce more than half of
its electricity, and says it does not have enough money to convert
to other forms of energy or make safety improvements.

German-Russian composer Alfred Schnittke dies at 63
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Alfred Schnittke, one of the former
Soviet Union's most prolific composers whose works ranged from
symphonies to movie themes, died Monday in Hamburg. He was 63.
	   Schnittke, the son of a Russian mother and a German-Jewish
father, died at Hamburg's University Hospital, where had been
admitted after suffering his fourth stroke over a period of many
years, his wife, Irina, said.
	   A creator of ``polystylism,'' or mixture of musical forms, he
was spurned in his homeland at the beginning of his career, but by
the 1980s had won over Soviet cultural authorities.
	   The unorthodox composer was among five winners in 1992 of the
prestigious Praemium Imperiale for lifetime achievement in the
arts, given by the Japan Art Association.
	   Schnittke was born on November 24, 1934, in Engels, a small town
on the Volga River in what was then called the Volga German
Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, an area that had been settled
by Germans in the 18th century.
	   The son of Harry Schnittke, a German-born Jew of Latvian
descent, and Maria Vogel, a Volga-German Catholic, he was
influenced by both the Russian and German cultures.
	   Music did not play a big role in his life until 1946, the year
his family moved to Vienna, where his father began working for a
Soviet German-language paper.
	   One of the first pieces Schnittke heard on the radio in Vienna
was Shostakovich's Ninth Symphony, which he found, in his words,
``very refreshing, but also very strange.''
	   Increasingly obsessed with music, he started taking piano
lessons with a local teacher, Charlotte Ruber, and he soon
developed an interest in composition.
	   The two years his family spent in Vienna were of ``decisive
importance'' in his life, he once wrote.
	   ``I recall a basic musical tone, a certain Mozart-Schubert sound
which I carried within me for decades and which was confirmed upon
my next stay in Austria some 30 years later,'' he said.
	   Returning to the Soviet Union with his parents in 1948,
Schnittke enrolled at the Institute of the October Revolution, a
music preparatory school in Moscow.
	   Five years later, he entered the Moscow Conservatory, where the
composers Nicolai Rakov and Evgeny Golubev were among his
instructors.
	   As part of his graduation requirements, he composed an oratorio,
Nagasaki, that included an atomic blast as part of the score,
offering an early glimpse of the unorthodox musical approach he
would adopt in later years.
	   In 1961 he joined the faculty himself, and for the next 10 years
taught instrumentation, polyphony, and composition at the
conservatory.
	   Schnittke's long list of compositions includes five symphonies,
a piano concerto, four violin concertos, five concerto grossos, two
concertos each for viola and cello, two oratorios, six ballets,
numerous choral, chamber, and instrumental pieces, and arrangements
of works by Shostakovich, Berg, Scott Joplin, and others.
	   He also has about 60 Soviet film scores to his credit, most of
them written between 1961 and 1984.
	   Schnittke is survived by his wife, Irina Katayeva, and a son.
The couple divided their time between homes in Moscow and Hamburg.
	   Funeral plans were incomplete.

Oliver aiming for another NBA shot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Jimmy Oliver is after the gold, certainly,
but some green would be nice, too.
	   The joint leading scorer for the U.S. team at the World
Basketball Championship is keenly aware that good shooting here
could translate into another shot at an NBA contract.
	   ``I know there's a lot of NBA people over here looking at games
so I go out and try to do what coach (Rudy) Tomjanovich asks me to
do,'' said Oliver, the Purdue product whose 12.3-point average
through four games tied him with Wendell Alexis. ``He's
constructing things where it makes all players on his team look
good. It benefits all the players.''
	   Tomjanovich, for his part, acknowledges that he is using the
players' individual aims as motivation.
	   ``We talked a little about us representing the United States and
also what this can do for these players personally,'' the Houston
Rockets coach said.
	   Oliver has played a total of 76 NBA games with Boston, Cleveland
and Toronto, but spent last season with Ciudad de Huelva in the
Spanish League.
	   The 6-foot-7 (1.99-meter) guard insists, though, that he'll be
all right if he does not get back to the NBA.
	   ``I'm not going to be sad,'' he said, ``if I don't get the
opportunity to return. Unfortunately, a lot of people get a couple
of years in the league and then don't get back in.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LUCKY 13: &LR;  Nigeria overcame a drug suspension, a slew of
injuries and an 0-3 start to win two straight consolation games and
finish 13th out of 16 teams at the tournament.
	   ``From the point of view of what we had to work with, the
players reached 110 percent. It's not been a happy tournament for
us,'' coach Ayo Bakare said after Nigeria beat Japan 70-60 Monday.
``I'm relieved we don't have to play any more games, or the coaches
would have had to dress up to play.''
	   Center Julius Nwosu was handed a two-month ban by FIBA after
testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine last week, and
with former New Jersey Net Yinka Dare (shoulder), Emeke Okenwa
(broken foot) and others injured, only seven players were available
for Monday's game.
	   Guard Kingsley Ogwudire led Nigeria with 19 points.
	   Bakare said African basketball can only improve if more
countries from the continent are invited to the Olympics.
	   ``FIBA needs to help out. Africa has just one spot in the
Olympics,'' the coach said. ``There's a lot of talent, a lot of
interest in basketball in Africa, but we need to let in more teams
at the top level. That's the only way for the game to improve back
home.''
	   The other African team at the worlds, Senegal, beat South Korea
75-72 Monday in the 15th-place game.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ANTSY ANSTEY &LR; : The lone NBA player in Athens, Chris Anstey of
the Dallas Mavericks, has not exactly been a star.
	   Coming off the bench for Australia, he's averaging 9.5 points
and 5.5 rebounds in 20 minutes per game.
	   ``Going to Dallas I had a point to prove to myself. It's the
best league in the world, and was where I wanted to be, and my
challenge was to prove I belonged there,'' the 7-foot (2.13-meter)
center said. ``Now I've also got to prove I belong here, and prove
that I can play at this level, and in this type of game.''

Aziz criticizes U.N. weapons inspectors after talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with next round of talks. TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Dimming prospects for progress in talks
with the United Nations, a top Iraqi official accused the chief
U.N. weapons inspector Monday of serving American interests by
trying to prolong punishing trade sanctions on Baghdad.
	   Using harsh language, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said
after a three-hour session with chief inspector Richard Butler that
the U.N. Special Commission was ``back to its old games, to its old
tricks.''
	   The commission is responsible for ensuring that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as required by U.N.
resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War. The comments followed
some optimism that the two sides were on track to ending the
inspections, which began after the war.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.
	   Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's progress in
meeting the goal and, instead, focusing on ``minor issues which
make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq .... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   When asked about Aziz's remarks, Butler said only that ``work is
in progress.''
	   On Sunday, Butler told reporters: ``Our steadfast aim is to get
this done as soon as possible to get to the end of the disarmament
phase so the Security Council can consider the sanctions issue.''
	   The two sides were to meet again Monday night for further talks.
Butler will remain in Baghdad until Wednesday.
	   Neither Aziz nor Butler gave specifics on what was discussed
Monday, but the ``blueprint'' Butler presented the Iraqis during
his last visit in June calls for further disclosures about the
country's missile program and biological and chemical weaponry.
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said that the sanctions
must be lifted this year _ the first time he had set a deadline.
Iraq says the sanctions have caused widespread poverty,
malnutrition and illnesses among its 22 million people.
	   Iraqi newspapers excoriated Butler in their editorials Monday.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath party, said Butler
was no longer a representative of an international organization but
``a man who implements American policies against Iraq.''
	   Iraq has long accused the United States and Britain of
needlessly prolonging the sanctions.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After months of foot-dragging, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat is expected to present his new Cabinet to the
legislature for approval on Wednesday.
	   ``There will be a special session of the legislative council
this Wednesday to listen to the names of the new Cabinet members
and to give them a vote of confidence,'' council speaker Ahmed
Qureia told The Associated Press.
	   The council has demanded reforms since issuing a report on
widespread corruption in the Palestinian Authority more than a year
ago, and has repeatedly threatened to hold a vote of no-confidence
in Arafat's government.
	   Assad Abdel Rahman, a member of the PLO Executive Committee,
said Arafat's list includes 10 new names _ most of them members of
the Palestinian Legislative Council.
	   At least two of the proposed new ministers _ Saad Kurunz and
Yusif Abu Safiya _ are independents sympathetic to the ideology of
the militant Islamic group Hamas.
	   A new ministerial position will be created to serve as a liaison
between the legislature and the executive branch.
	   In August, all but two of the 24 Cabinet ministers offered their
resignations, but Arafat did not accept them until a few weeks ago.
However the Cabinet has continued functioning despite the
resignations.
	   Abdel Rahman said Arafat plans to swap the portfolios of some
ministers, while others will leave the Cabinet entirely.
	   Some ministers named in the council's report on corruption
report, such as Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, will retain their
positions, he said.
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
others named in the report, such as Civil Affairs Minister Jamil
Tarifi and Transport Minister Ali Qawasmeh, will remain
ministers-at-large, but will lose their portfolios.
	   Five Cabinet slots are vacant because two ministers have died
this year, one resigned, one is terminally ill, and the appointment
of another was never approved by the legislature.

Compromise in Protestant march; IRA dissidents claim bomb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant marchers and
Catholic protesters struck a compromise Monday designed to prevent
direct clashes this weekend in Londonderry, the crucible of
Northern Ireland's conflict.
	   The announcement by Bogside Residents Group protesters and
Apprentice Boys marchers eased fears that the Protestants' annual
parade would trigger violence Saturday as has happened in previous
years. The parade will be permitted, but with few marchers allowed
near the town's main Catholic neighborhood.
	   IRA dissidents, meanwhile, claimed responsibility for a car bomb
on Saturday that injured 35 people in the predominantly Protestant
town of Banbridge, 22 miles (35 kms) southwest of Belfast. The
group, called ``Real IRA'' by local media, also claimed
responsibility for fires at three Belfast businesses early Sunday.
	   The dissidents, opposed to the Irish Republican Army's July 1997
cease-fire, claimed responsibility for all the attacks in coded
statements to Belfast and Dublin newsrooms.
	   In Londonderry, 70 miles (110 miles) northwest of Belfast, the
march compromise fueled hopes of a peaceful resolution to the
province's ``marching season,'' when more than 100,000 Protestants
in various groups march across this British-ruled province.
	   ``The accommodation reached today shows what can result when the
will to reach agreement exists,'' said Donncha MacNiallais, leader
of the Catholic protesters who called off plans to block the
parade.
	   ``A small but significant step has been taken for the better
future of the city and for all our communities this weekend,'' said
Apprentice Boys leader Alistair Simpson.
	   Simpson never spoke directly with the Catholic protesters, but
through moderate intermediaries.
	   Normally up to 20,000 Apprentice Boys and band members parade
within a few hundred yards (meters) of the main Catholic Bogside
neighborhood.
	   But under terms of the agreement, only 13 Protestant marchers
will enter the Diamond _ the center of the walled downtown _ where
they will lay wreaths of remembrance at the monument to local dead
from the World Wars.
	   The number 13 is symbolic of the number of teen-age Protestant
apprentices in Londonderry trades guilds _ who bolted the city's
gates in the face of an approaching Catholic army in December 1688.
	   Northern Ireland's ``troubles'' began in August 1969 after
Bogside Catholics stoned the Londonderry marchers in the Diamond.
This triggered three days of rioting between Protestant police and
Catholics that led the British government to deploy troops.

India tests surface-to-air missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Monday tested a surface-to-air
missile that can deliver conventional explosives up to a range of
25 kilometers (15 miles), Press Trust of India news agency said.
	   The indigenous 650 kilograms (1,444 pounds) missile was fired
from a mobile launcher at a test site in India's eastern Orissa
state, PTI said. The missile has been named ``Akash,'' which means
sky.
	   India already has tested ``Trishul'' missiles that can be used
as a surface-to-air missile against aircraft and as a counter to
sea-skimming missiles.
	   Trishul, or Trident, uses solid fuel and has a range of up to
nine kilometers (5.5 miles) and can carry a warhead of 15 kilograms
(33 pounds).
	   India tested five underground nuclear devices May 11-13 and is
perfecting a delivery system.
	   The Indian government also has approved increasing the range of
the intermediate-range Agni missile, which it had previously
tested, but halted two years ago following pressure from the United
States.
	   India says it needs a nuclear defense against China and its
other neighbor Pakistan, both nuclear powers. India has fought
Pakistan in three wars since 1948 and still engages in frequent
border skirmishes. India and China fought a war in 1962.

Serb sources: one hundred-eighteen still missing in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo have
kidnapped 171 people, mostly Serbs, since fighting escalated
earlier this year in the restive Serbian province. Most of them are
still missing or presumed dead, Serb sources said Monday,
	   The total of 171 included 125 Serbs, 37 ethnic Albanians who
were loyal to the authorities, six Gypsies, one ethnic Bulgarian,
one Muslim and one citizen of neighboring Macedonia.
	   Thirty-one have been released by the Kosovo Liberation Army,
upon insistence from international humanitarian organizations and
seven managed to escape, which left 133 still missing.
	   The summary released by Media Center, based in Kosovo capital
Pristina and close to the authorities, said 25 are presumed dead -
15 civilians and 10 policemen - but fears increase with time about
all others who may have long been dead.
	   An Albanian source, gathering information mostly on the other
side of the conflict, among Kosovo's idependence-seeking ethnic
Albanians, has said that a total of 400 people, mostly Kosovo
Albanians, have gone missing since the fighting escalated in
February.

Prosecutors admit truth behind Ustica crash may never emerge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Prosecutors admitted Monday the truth may never
emerge about the 1980 crash into the Mediterranean of an Italian
airliner which killed all 81 people aboard.
	   Theories on what caused the Itavia DC-9 to blow apart on a
domestic flight near the tiny island of Ustica have ranged from a
bomb placed in a airline lavatory to a missile from aerial dog
fights possibly involving Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi's
plane.
	   But after an 18-year inquiry, Rome prosecutor Giovanni Salvi
said there was still ``deep uncertainty'' on the cause of the
accident.
	   Salvi said he and two other prosecutors working on the case had
found evidence to support both the bomb and missile theory, but had
also found evidence knocking down each.
	   For example, he said, traces of explosives found on two shards
from the plane's rear, where the bathroom is located, pointed to a
bomb. But the parts proved to consist of a slightly different medal
alloy than the rest of the plane, raising the possibility that they
did not come from the DC-9.
	   ``The truth is that this accident had characteristics never
encountered before,'' making it extremely difficult to resolve,
Salvi said. The wreckage, 90 percent of which was recovered and
reconstructed, is in one of the Mediterranean's deepest points and
the area was not completely covered by radar.
	   Investigators also said a gas tank and witness accounts suggest
U.S. jets were flying in the area when the DC-9 crashed June 27,
1980. Salvi, however, said they found no evidence to link the crash
to American presence.
	   Although the crash cause remains unknown, the prosecutors have
asked for the indictment of four retired Italian air force generals
and six other officers for an alleged cover-up. The investigators
suspect the generals failed to provide military information vital
to the probe.

Palestinians say latest round of talks could be the last
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night in a round of talks the Palestinians said would be the last
if no progress was made toward an overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat, said that if the Israelis did not bring new ideas, ``this
kind of meeting cannot continue.''
	   ``We are waiting to see a change in the attitude of the
Israelis,'' Tibi said.
	   ``If not, this means (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu has
said no to the last chance to revive the peace process.''
	   Senior negotiators from the two sides have been meeting for the
past two weeks, after months without direct talks, in an effort to
come to an agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal. Talks resumed
Monday night in Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians have complained that no progress has been made,
and that Israel has continued to resist an American proposal for a
13 percent withdrawal.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said on the Voice of
Palestine radio station that if Monday's meeting failed to produce
results, ``We will go to the United States and tell Mrs. Albright
that we have not only gone the extra mile, but 200 miles in our
attempt to put the peace process back on track.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in turn, warned the
Palestinians that ultimatums would lead nowhere.
	   ``The Palestinians would be ill-advised to create an artificial
crisis,'' he told reporters Monday night, adding that the talks so
far had been ``businesslike,'' and ``constructive,'' and that the
Israelis had been showing much goodwill.
	   ``My advice to all parties is to engage in negotiations
constructively in order to bring to their conclusion ... and I
think this is possible,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said the Israelis were considering releasing 100
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails as a goodwill gesture, but
that no decision was taken in Monday's Cabinet meeting.
	   In the Gaza Strip, about 100 relatives of prisoners marched
Monday, chanting ``No peace without the release of our sons.''
	   Hisham Abdel Razig, a Palestinian legislator who deals with the
prisoner issue, headed a small delegation that met with Arafat
following the march.
	   ``President Arafat ... told us that there cannot be a
comprehensive peace without the release of all the Palestinian and
Arab prisoners in the Israeli jails,'' he said.

Eastern Kivu region in open rebellion against Kabila
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Rwandan official; details; ADDS

 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The Kivu region of eastern Congo is in
open rebellion against the government of President Laurent Kabila,
a Rwandan official said Monday.
	   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be further
identified, said the 700-kilometer (435-mile) stretch between
Kalemie and Beni in South and North Kivu provinces was up in arms.
	   The private Rwandan News Agency said earlier that the radio
station in Goma, capital of North Kivu province, had broadcast a
communique from mutineers signed by Sylvain Mbuchi, the commander
of the 10the batallion of the Congolese army.
	   ``We, the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
taken the decision to remove President Laurent Desire Kabila from
power,'' said the communique read Sunday in French and Swahili.
	   Officers and troops from the Rwandan Patriotic Army were
instrumental in launching and carrying out the eight-month
rebellion that brought Kabilia to power in the former Zaire in May
1997 and ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The rebellion began in October 1996 around Uvira, 200 kilometers
(125 miles) south of Goma, at the head of Lake Tanganyika.
	   In Kigali, Rwandan government spokesman Maj. Wilson Rutaisire
told The Associated Press no Rwandan troops were involved in the
current rebellion because they had all left the Congo last week at
Kabila's request.
	   However, he acknowledged that the departure of the unspecified
number of Rwandan troops may have played a role in the current
unrest.
	   ``The departure of our troops from Congo may have removed the
control that they had so that the conflict and the difference
(among ethnic groups in eastern Congo) could surface,'' Rutasire
said. ``This might have really contributed to the escalation of
conflicts they had there.''
	   Analysts have been predicting major problems in North and South
Kivu for some time because of the competition for land and power
among the Banyamulenge and other ethnic Tutsis who have lived in
the region for generations with ethnic Hutus _ also originally from
Rwanda _ and the so-called indigenous tribes like the Bahunde, the
Banyanga and the Babembe.
	   Writing in the July issue of Le Monde Diplomatique, French
researcher Gerard Prunier said Kivu was on the verge of explosion,
``and no one is looking for scissors to cut the fuse.''
	   The rebel communique called on the local population to remain
calm and go about their daily business and assured residents that
the goal of the rebels was to ``preserve the unity and security of
the whole nation.''
	   The communique called on politicians in the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, to meet urgently and find a way of organizing good
leadership.
	   RNA said the airport in Goma was closed Monday and that a call
went out to residents and aid workers in the town just across from
the Rwandan city of Gisenyi to hand over all radio communications
equipment to security posts.
	   The agency said there were unconfirmed reports of similar
rebellions in Bukavu, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Goma and
the capital of South Kivu province, and in Kindu, the capital of
Maniema province, 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Bukavu.
	   Another unconfirmed report said mutineers had opened Bukavu
prison and set free Banymulenge officers and troops from the
Congolese army who had been convicted of mutiny several months ago.

	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in turn, warned the
Palestinians that ultimatums would lead nowhere.
	   ``The Palestinians would be ill-advised to create an artificial
crisis,'' he told reporters Monday night, adding that the talks so
far had been ``businesslike,'' and ``constructive,'' and that the
Israelis had been showing much goodwill.
	   ``My advice to all parties is to engage in negotiations
constructively in order to bring to their conclusion ... and I
think this is possible,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said the Israelis were considering releasing 100
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails as a goodwill gesture, but
that no decision was taken in Monday's Cabinet meeting.
	   In the Gaza Strip, about 100 relatives of prisoners marched
Monday, chanting ``No peace without the release of our sons.''
	   Hisham Abdel Razig, a Palestinian legislator who deals with the
prisoner issue, headed a small delegation that met with Arafat
following the march.
	   ``President Arafat ... told us that there cannot be a
comprehensive peace without the release of all the Palestinian and
Arab prisoners in the Israeli jails,'' he said.

Trevor Rees-Jones appeals for privacy as Diana anniversary nears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING for all needing &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo LON101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the car
crash that killed Princess Diana and two others almost a year ago,
appealed for privacy for all the families involved ``to let us mark
this tragic anniversary in our own way.''
	   Rees-Jones, who spoke to APTV, The Associated Press'
international video news agency, in a taped statement released
Monday, said he would make no further public comments until the
judicial inquiry into the Aug. 31 Paris crash concludes.
	   Also killed were driver Henri Paul, who was drunk, and Dodi
Fayed, the son of Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed and Diana's
boyfriend.
	   Rees-Jones, who has told investigators he remembers very little
about the crucial moments before the crash, was employed by Al
Fayed as a bodyguard at the time.
	   ``I've cooperated fully with the judge who's investigating the
accident and told him all I know up to this present time,''
Rees-Jones said in his statement, which marks the first time he has
spoken publicly. ``I may wish to ask to see the judge again in the
future, but I've no intention of doing so at this moment.''
	   The former bodyguard, who has livid scars marking the left side
of his face as a result of the crash, now works in a sports shop in
Oswestry, in central England.
	   His lawyer, Ian Lucas, told APTV that Rees-Jones made the
statement because he has been inundated with requests for
interviews, some with huge amounts of money attached.
	   ``I'd like everyone to appreciate this August will be a
difficult time for myself, my family and for all the families
involved in this tragic accident,'' Rees-Jones said. ``I'd like
everyone and the press to appreciate that and respect our privacy
and let us mark this tragic anniversary in our own way.''

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Ending months of political
wrangling and speculation, ministers of the Netherlands' new
coalition government were introduced to the nation Monday.
	   Slots in the 15-member Cabinet and the goals of the new
government had been under negotiation among the three top parties
in the coalition since general elections in May.
	   Monday, the giddy new Cabinet ministers were sworn in and
unveiled in a photo shoot with Dutch Queen Beatrix outside her
palace in The Hague.
	   The coalition, which is of such mixed political colors they call
it the Purple Coalition, includes Prime Minister Wim Kok's
left-leaning Labor Party, the right-leaning Liberal Party and the
centrist Democrats 66 party.
	   Kok again leads the coalition.
	   The new Cabinet has two female deputy prime ministers _ the
first time women have held the positions. Annemarie Jorritsma, will
also serve as economic affairs minister, and Els Borst, will serve
a second term as health minister.
	   Missing from the new team are some of the most visible ministers
from the last government, including former Foreign Minister Hans
van Mierlo.
	   Jozias van Aartsen, the former agriculture minister, is the new
foreign minister.
	   A newcomer, Benk Korthals, takes over the Justice Ministry,
which is embroiled in a scandal over child pornography.
	   Coalition governments have ruled for the past 80 years in the
Netherlands, where there are a dozen sizable parties, none of which
has been able to garner enough votes to take control outright.

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ With his party's thin hold on power
threatened, Prime Minister Alfred Sant on Monday announced
elections Sept. 5, three years ahead of schedule.
	   The Labor Party was returned to power on this Mediterranean
island nation in October 1996, but the government has recently been
rocked by resignations and embarrassing defeats in parliament.
	   Sant is seeking to strengthen the Labor Party's one-vote
majority, which has been undermined by former Labor Prime Minister
Dom Mintoff. He defied the party, although claiming he did not want
to bring down the government.
	   Mintoff twice voted with the opposition Nationalists over a
development plan in his district.
	   Labor won the last election after nine years in the opposition.
	   The upcoming elections will again pit Sant against Eddie Fenech
Adami, who survived calls for his resignation as Nationalist leader
after the 1996 vote.

Every fifth draftee uses drugs, report states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Twenty percent of the country's
military draftees regularly consume some sort of illegal drug,
according to a study released Monday.
	   Interviews and random drug tests conducted by the Hungarian
Armed Forces Health Institute showed one-fifth of the country's
27,000 draftees used drugs regularly.
	   For draftees returning from leave, nearly half tested positive
for drug use, Col. Andras Gacsalyi said at a conference unveiling
the results, the state news agency MTI reported.
	   Gacsalyi said new legislation will be adopted to allow mandatory
drug testing, but MTI did not specify under what circumstances the
testing would be conducted.
	   Once Hungary becomes a NATO member _ expected to take place next
year _ drug use will have to be more vigorously combated, Gacsalyi
said.
	   According to the survey, fewer soldiers in the eastern half of
the country use drugs. But those who use drugs often chose opiates,
which can rapidly lead to dependency.
	   In the western half of the country, the drug of choice is
amphetamines and similar ``disco drugs.''

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's leading opposition party
captured the governor's seat in the central state of Aguascalientes
on Monday, a victory that gives it fresh momentum heading toward
the 2000 presidential race.
	   More than anything, the gubernatorial contests in Aguascalientes
and two other states Sunday underscored the growing competitiveness
of elections in a country where for decades one party _ the
Institutional Revolutionary Party _ easily won every vote.
	   ``Mexico has made another important step toward democracy,''
said historian Enrique Krauze, serving as an election-day analyst
for the Mexican network Televisa. ``The process was characterized
by stability and tranquility.''
	   With 79 percent of the vote counted in Aguascalientes on Monday,
Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez of National Action was ahead with 53
percent of the vote, the State Electoral Council said.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's candidate, Hector
Hugo Olivares Ventura, trailed with 36 percent, followed by Alfonso
Bernal Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party, with
7 percent.
	   ``What we want for Aguascalientes is a transition that does not
hold back its progress, that does not cause a scandal,'' Gonzalez
Gonzalez told a news conference after media exit polls showed him
the winner.
	   Complete preliminary results in Aguascalientes, as well as in
Oaxaca and Veracruz, were not expected until later Monday. The
final official results for all three races were not expected until
later in the week.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the ruling party, known as the
PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to offset the loss.
	   In Mexico City on Sunday evening, PAN national president Felipe
Calderon Hinojosa opened a bottle of apple cider to toast
Gonzalez's apparent win.
	   With Aguascalientes, the PAN ``advances and solidifies its
political position,'' a smiling Calderon Hinojosa said.
	   While the center-right National Action Party was headed for
victory in Aguascalientes, the PRI was virtually assured the
governorship in the Gulf state of Veracruz.
	   With 54 percent of the ballots counted, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy
businessman and the son of a former president, was leading with 49
percent of the vote.
	   Luis Pazos of National Action trailed with 28 percent. The
candidate of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party lagged
behind with 17 percent.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   Aleman late Sunday promised to create ``a social alliance'' as
Veracruz's new governor.
	   As elected leader of one of Mexico's most important states,
Aleman automatically would become a top contender for the PRI's
presidential nomination for 2000 _ even though he has claimed he is
not interested.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at stamping out vote fraud and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But it won two of three elections last
month, including in Chihuahua, where it defeated the PAN.
	   In the southern state of Oaxaca Monday, the PRI had a widening
advantage over the center-left Democratic Revolution party for the
governorship.
	   The PRD was challenging the count, arguing that the computer
system reporting results crashed for 40 minutes and when it
returned to service, the results had been altered.
	   PRD national director Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the party
would not validate an election ``plagued by irregularities, that
was not clean nor free and in which the vote was manipulated,'' the
daily Reforma reported Monday.
	   Nevertheless, many analysts said the PRD did better than
expected, showing that it, too, has become a political force
capable of seriously challenging the PRI.
	   With 70 percent of the vote counted Monday, PRI candidate Jose
Nelson Murat Casab widened his lead with 48 percent of the vote.
Democratic Revolution candidate Hector Sanchez had 37 percent. The
National Action candidate had just under 12 percent.
	   Formed in 1989, Democratic Revolution saw its first important
electoral win last year when Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the son of late
President Lazaro Cardenas, captured the mayorship of Mexico City.
	   It won its first state governorship _ in the northern state of
Zacatecas _ last month.

Aziz criticizes U.N. weapons inspectors after talks

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Dimming prospects for progress in talks
with the United Nations, a top Iraqi official accused the chief
U.N. weapons inspector Monday of ``serving the American policy'' by
trying to prolong punishing sanctions on Iraq.
	   Using harsh language, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said
after a three-hour session with Richard Butler that the U.N.
Special Commission was ``back to its old games, to its old
tricks.''
	   The commission, which Butler heads, is responsible for ensuring
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as
required by U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War. The
comments followed some optimism that the two sides were on track to
ending the inspections, which began after the war.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.
	   Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's progress in
eliminating its weaponry and instead focusing on ``minor issues
which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq .... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   Butler did not hear Aziz's remarks and, when asked about them,
said only that ``work is in progress.''
	   On Sunday, Butler told reporters: ``Our steadfast aim is to get
this done as soon as possible to get to the end of the disarmament
phase so the Security Council can consider the sanctions issue.''
	   The two sides met again Monday night for further talks. Butler
will remain in Baghdad until Wednesday.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government soldiers and Tamil Tiger
rebels clashed in northern Sri Lanka on Monday, leaving more than

miles) north of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
	   The military repulsed the attack, which killed 15 soldiers and
37 rebel fighters, the statement said. At least 16 soldiers were
seriously wounded.
	   The military has been trying to capture the 70 kilometer
(45-mile) highway that passes through rebel-held territory that
could provide a land link to Jaffna Peninsula. It has gained
control of nearly two-thirds of the road link.
	   The peninsula is at present accessible only by air and sea, an
expensive means of transporting food and supplies.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the nation's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese. The government
denies the charge.
	   At least 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.

Russia's state nuclear power company announces construction
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Expressing hope that nuclear energy will
experience a ``second wind'' in Russia, a top nuclear power
official outlined plans Monday to construct 15 nuclear reactors,
including two offshore floating stations, by 2010.
	   Yevgeny Ignatenko, managing director of the state-run
Rosenergoatom company that runs Russia's nuclear power plants,
called the plans modest.
	   Despite his optimism, critics say they could be scuttled by the
country's dire economic situation and continuing doubts about
nuclear safety after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
	   ``It's not just controversial. It's absurd,'' said Igor
Forofontov, an anti-nuclear campaigner for the Greenpeace
environmental organization. He said that Russia's nuclear industry
had left too many vital questions open, including plant safety and
nuclear waste disposal.
	   The clearest argument against the nuclear construction is
economic, he said.
	   ``In most countries, they know that nuclear power can't compete
with other energy sources,'' Forofontov said. ``For us, it's
catastrophically unprofitable.''
	   Russia currently has 29 nuclear reactors in operation at nine
stations, and last year they provided 13 percent of the nation's
electricity. Ignatenko said that nine reactors will have reached
the end of their service life by 2010 and should be closed.
	   Rosenergoatom plans to build three nuclear reactors by 2000,
another six by 2005 and six more by 2010. All are to be constructed
on or near the sites of existing reactors, Ignatenko said.
	   However, two of the new reactors are to be built on floating
platforms off Russia's Pacific coast. Ignatenko said that offshore
reactors are particularly suited to hard-to-reach areas, where
construction and fuel delivery are especially expensive.
	   Ignatenko said Russia was hoping for credits from the European
Union to meet construction costs. International nuclear experts
have approved the plans for construction of a new,
water-pressurized VVER-1000 reactor at Voronezh, about 475
kilometers (300 miles) south of Moscow, he said.
	   ``It's very important that in the future no one have doubts''
that Russia's nuclear reactors are up to the world standard,
Ignatenko said.
	   He claimed international experts who examined Russia's new
generation of reactors have rated them the third safest in the
world _ behind Japan and Germany but ahead of the United States.
	   The Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine created widespread
public distrust of nuclear energy and gave impetus to the
development of Russia's huge natural gas deposits as the key fuel
for power generation.
	   But energy experts argue that new nuclear plants are necessary
to guarantee the country's energy self-sufficiency.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Dimming prospects for progress in talks
with the United Nations, a top Iraqi official accused the chief
U.N. weapons inspector Monday of serving American interests by
trying to prolong punishing trade sanctions on Baghdad.
	   Using harsh language, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said
after a three-hour session with chief inspector Richard Butler that
the U.N. Special Commission was ``back to its old games, to its old
tricks.''
	   The commission is responsible for ensuring that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as required by U.N.
resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War. The comments followed
some optimism that the two sides were on track to ending the
inspections, which began after the war.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.
	   Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's progress in
meeting the goal and, instead, focusing on ``minor issues which
make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq .... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   When asked about Aziz's remarks, Butler said only that ``work is
in progress.''
	   On Sunday, Butler told reporters: ``Our steadfast aim is to get
this done as soon as possible to get to the end of the disarmament
phase so the Security Council can consider the sanctions issue.''
	   The two sides met again Monday night for further talks. Butler
will remain in Baghdad until Wednesday.

Iranian interior minister handed security forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's newly appointed interior minister, an
ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was given control of
the powerful police forces by the country's top religious leader,
Iran newspaper reported Monday.
	   The move signals a small victory for Iran's moderate faction,
locked in a power struggle with hard-liners in the ruling clergy.
	   Although Khatami is the elected leader, the constitution gives
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, control of such key
instruments of power as the police, army and judiciary.
	   In a letter to Khamenei, Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi
Lari asked that ``control of the security forces be placed with the
Interior Ministry, which is charged with maintaining security,''
the newspaper said. It did not say when the letter was written.
	   Control of Iran's police forces is traditionally in the hands of
the interior minister. But that responsibility was withheld from
Lari's predecessor, who was impeached last month by the hard-line
parliament for attempting to ease the strict Islamic social code
and promote public freedoms.
	   The police are in charge of security in the streets, enforcing
the strict Islamic dress code on women and ensuring that unmarried
couples do not mingle.
	   In another victory for the moderate faction, liberal newspaper
Toos, which was banned from publishing by the hard-line clergy on
Saturday, was being distributed again Monday.
	   The judiciary, which has the power to close down newspapers,
yielded to the urging of officials from the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance for the paper to continue publishing, Iran News
reported Monday. The Culture Ministry, run by a Khatami loyalist,
issues permits for newspapers.

Every fifth draftee uses drugs, report states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Twenty percent of Hungary's military
draftees regularly consume some sort of illegal drug, according to
a study released Monday.
	   Interviews and random drug tests conducted by the Hungarian
Armed Forces Health Institute showed one-fifth of the country's
27,000 draftees used drugs regularly.
	   For draftees returning from leave, nearly half tested positive
for drug use, Col. Andras Gacsalyi said at a conference unveiling
the results, the state news agency MTI reported.
	   Gacsalyi said new legislation will be adopted to allow mandatory
drug testing, but MTI did not specify under what circumstances the
testing would be conducted.
	   Once Hungary becomes a NATO member, a move expected by next
year, drug use will have to be more vigorously combated, Gacsalyi
said.
	   According to the survey, fewer soldiers in the eastern half of
the country use drugs. But those who use drugs often chose opiates,
which can rapidly lead to dependency.
	   In the western half of the country, the drug of choice is
amphetamines and similar ``disco drugs.''

Blood-spattered actors rub entrails in artistic happening
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note nature
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRINZENDORF, Austria (AP) _ After a bull was slaughtered at
sunrise to a cacophony of bells and brass, naked people strapped
onto crosses were fed and spattered with blood.
	   The bloody scenes marked the bizarre start Monday of a six-day
artistic happening conceived and directed by Austrian Hermann
Nitsch, a self-described action painter whose works are on display
in art galleries around the world.
	   Nitsch's extravaganza aroused widespread outrage before it
began. His chief critics are right-wing politicians, a Vienna
tabloid, animal rights activists and Catholic bishops.
	   But the 1,000 paying guests watching at dawn apparently did not
mind. They included friends, art students, artists and
intellectuals from several European countries and the United
States.
	   A total of 100 actors, all dressed in white before some of them
were blood-stained _ hair, face and body _ and 180 musicians,
including two Czech brass bands, are lined up to perform according
to a 1,595-page script of the ``Orgy Mystery Theater'' festival.
	   The script also provides for body and other painting, the
display of thousands of flowers and chamber music played under
lines of chestnut trees in a park. It also features Gregorian
chants as well as bucolic scenes with lots of wine _ 13,000 liters
(3,500 U.S. gallons) in all.
	   Some may question whether this is art, but not fans of
actionism, which has a small but devoted following in Austria and
elsewhere in Europe.
	   A summary of Nitsch's artistic intentions said the various
``stages of (human) existence are to be shown in their polarity
between the greatest happiness ... and the lowest chasm, the
revulsion, the bestial destructiveness of the darkest desires.''
	   In terse comments to The Associated Press, Nitsch defended his
artistic concept he said has a great many historic roots and is
designed to show the ``highest intensity'' of feeling, ``down to
cruelty.''
	   The site of the artistic happening Nitsch says represents his
life's work were his castle grounds outside this small village,
some 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Vienna.
	   Preceded by an earsplitting cacophony of rattles, coach
whistles, bass drums and other noise-making instruments, three
professional butchers slaughtered and skinned a bull at daybreak.
	   After being hoisted on a wall in the large castle courtyard, the
bull was disemboweled with the help of the actors.
	   What followed was an orgy of blood. About ten white-clad
participants frantically rubbed animal bowels and other organs
against the dead bull, while some of them poured blood onto it all
until everyone was soaked.
	   In between, several blindfolded, naked men and women, strapped
onto wooden crosses, were carried to the scene and fed blood, most
of which was streaming down their body.
	   More bowel-rubbing _ this time involving a slaughtered pig _
took place some two hours later.
	   A handful of protesters who blocked some of the cars from
reaching Nitsch's castle held up a streamer saying: ``The animals'
dignity is untouchable.''
	   But Nitsch dismissed criticism. Referring to opposition by the
bishops, he said: ``The Catholics must realize that they are no
longer a stat relgion, that they cannot manipulate any more.''

German-Russian composer Alfred Schnittke dies at 63
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Yeltsin's comments, background on premiere of
Schnittke's final composition. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Alfred Schnittke, one of the former
Soviet Union's most prolific composers whose works ranged from
symphonies to movie themes, died Monday in Hamburg. He was 63.
	   Schnittke, the son of a Russian mother and a German-Jewish
father, died at Hamburg's University Hospital, where had been
admitted after suffering his fourth stroke over a period of many
years, his wife, Irina, said.
	   A creator of ``polystylism,'' or mixture of musical forms, he
was spurned in his homeland at the beginning of his career, but by
the 1980s had won over Soviet cultural authorities.
	   The unorthodox composer was among five winners in 1992 of the
prestigious Praemium Imperiale for lifetime achievement in the
arts, given by the Japan Art Association.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a telegram Monday to Irina
Schnittke in Hamburg saying he shared her family's ``huge grief.''
	   ``A great composer of modern times has departed. With his
creation, Alfred Schnittke carried out a genuine revolution in
music,'' Yeltsin wrote. ``He brought glory to the culture of his
homeland and enriched the tradition of the Russian classical music
school with his unique, innovative ideas.''
	   Schnittke's final composition, the Ninth Symphony, had its world
premiere this spring in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory.
Schnittke was seriously ill, unable to talk or move much, by the
time he composed it; the right-handed composer wrote the piece with
his left hand.
	   Schnittke was born on November 24, 1934, in Engels, a small town
on the Volga River in what was then called the Volga German
Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, an area that had been settled
by Germans in the 18th century.
	   The son of Harry Schnittke, a German-born Jew of Latvian
descent, and Maria Vogel, a Volga-German Catholic, he was
influenced by both the Russian and German cultures.
	   Music did not play a big role in his life until 1946, the year
his family moved to Vienna, where his father began working for a
Soviet German-language paper.
	   One of the first pieces Schnittke heard on the radio in Vienna
was Shostakovich's Ninth Symphony, which he found, in his words,
``very refreshing, but also very strange.''
	   Increasingly obsessed with music, he started taking piano
lessons with a local teacher, Charlotte Ruber, and he soon
developed an interest in composition.
	   The two years his family spent in Vienna were of ``decisive
importance'' in his life, he once wrote.
	   ``I recall a basic musical tone, a certain Mozart-Schubert sound
which I carried within me for decades and which was confirmed upon
my next stay in Austria some 30 years later,'' he said.
	   Returning to the Soviet Union with his parents in 1948,
Schnittke enrolled at the Institute of the October Revolution, a
music preparatory school in Moscow.
	   Five years later, he entered the Moscow Conservatory, where the
composers Nicolai Rakov and Evgeny Golubev were among his
instructors.
	   As part of his graduation requirements, he composed an oratorio,
Nagasaki, that included an atomic blast as part of the score,
offering an early glimpse of the unorthodox musical approach he
would adopt in later years.
	   In 1961 he joined the faculty himself, and for the next 10 years
taught instrumentation, polyphony, and composition at the
conservatory.
	   Schnittke's long list of compositions includes five symphonies,
a piano concerto, four violin concertos, five concerto grossos, two
concertos each for viola and cello, two oratorios, six ballets,
numerous choral, chamber, and instrumental pieces, and arrangements
of works by Shostakovich, Berg, Scott Joplin, and others.
	   He also has about 60 Soviet film scores to his credit, most of
them written between 1961 and 1984.
	   Schnittke is survived by his wife, Irina Katayeva, and a son.
The couple divided their time between homes in Moscow and Hamburg.
	   Funeral plans were incomplete.

Gunfire rings though Kinshasa, revolt reported in eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS lead to RAISE reference to Kabila's alliance
unraveling. Edits throughout to conform. No pickup.
 &UR; With BC-Rwanda-Congo-Rebellion &QL; 
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Gunmen loyal to President Laurent Kabila
patrolled Kinshasa's rutted streets on Monday in search of
allied-turned-enemy Rwandan mercenaries who are suspected of
plotting against the government.
	   The capital awoke to the sound of gunfire as rival soldiers
clashed inside their base compounds in the city's west end. A
dawn-to-dusk curfew was imposed on the city, while in eastern
Congo, military officers appeared to be in open revolt against
Kabila.
	   About 14 months after charging victoriously into Kinshasa, the
rebel alliance that carried Kabila to power appears to be
unraveling in a trend that threatens to plunge this central African
country back into chaos.
	   ``The government asks the people of Congo and those foreigners
here in the country to stay calm and to stay at home until order is
restored,'' said an abrupt announcement Monday morning on
state-controlled People's Radio. ``Stay at home just until that
time when the armed forces of Congo re-establish civil order.''
	   Troops loyal to Kabila set up roadblocks throughout the city and
began a massive search for Rwandan Tutsi soldiers _ Kabila's
one-time allies.
	   A defense ministry official said loyalist troops had been
ordered to kill any Rwandan soldiers found hiding in and around the
city.
	   Pre-dawn clashes at two military bases apparently pitted
Kabila's troops against Rwandan mercenaries, who last year helped
the president oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila last
week ordered all Rwandan soldiers to leave the country.
	   The fighting comes amid growing suspicions within Kabila's
government that the Rwandan troops had been plotting against the
regime.
	   Earlier, Kabila sacked James Kabari, a Rwandan Tutsi who had
been the president's top military commander.
	   Although Rwandan troops played an important role last year in
Kabila's victory over Mobutu, relations between the central African
countries have soured in recent months.
	   According to a defense ministry official, more than 1,000
Rwandan Tutsi soldiers fled the Kokolo base in Kinshasa and are
hiding in a forest just outside of the city.
	   In the Rwandan capital, Kigali, a private news agency reported
an open rebellion against Kabila had been launched in North Kivu
province in eastern Congo.
	   ``We, the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
taken the decision to remove President Laurent Desire Kabila from
power,'' said a statement read Sunday in French and Swahili over
Radio Goma, according to the private Rwandan News Agency.
	   The statement was signed by Sylvain Mbuchi, commander of the
10th battalion of the Congolese army based in Goma, the provincial
capital, RNA said.
	   The statement called on the local population to remain calm and
go about their daily business and assured residents that the goal
of the rebels was to ``preserve the unity and security of the whole
nation.''
	   Eastern Congo's Banyamulenge Tutsi population has been
increasingly against Kabila's rule.
	   Congo's foreign minister, Bizima Karaha, a Tutsi from the
eastern Banyamulenge group, failed to return home Saturday from a
trip to South Africa. His absence has triggered speculation that he
may be linked to the uprising in the east.
	   In the capital, Kabila had been growing anxious over the
presence of Rwandan forces in Kinshasa, and weeks before ordering
them to leave he increased security around government buildings.
	   Tanks were deployed in front of the presidential residence and
office compound while troops were stationed at key ministry
buildings.
	   The sound of fighting Monday triggered an order by the
government to clear the streets.
	   Shops throughout the capital remained closed Monday morning, and
people who had headed downtown for work early in the morning
quickly returned home.
	   Speculation was rife over the stability of Kabila's government
after weeks of growing tension between the president, his top
advisers and what now appears to be a shaky military alliance with
neighboring Rwanda.
	   The country's finance minister, who was arrested last week and
then released, said he was questioned about whether Rwandan
soldiers still in Kinshasa had been planning a coup against Kabila.
	   ``I was questioned about rumors of a putsch attempt,'' said
former Finance Minister Ferdinand Tala-Ngai.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Some 15,000 bank employees went on strike
for the second time throughout Kenya on Monday to demand the
withdrawal of a tax on their low-interest loans.
	   Their union representative Jacob Opiyo said the 7 percent tax
was leaving
	   bank workers with ``negative salaries.''
	   ``Due to unavoidable circumstances, we regret to advise we are
unable to offer full banking services,'' read a notice at the Loita
Street branch of the Commercial Bank of Kenya in downtown Nairobi.
	   Many employers provide their staff with low-interest loans,
generally to purchase homes, because the 29 percent commercial
lending rate makes borrowing impossible for most Kenyans.
	   The government now claims the loans are income and should be
taxed.
	   Opiyo said the strike would continue until the government
withdraws the tax.
	   In February, bank employees staged a five-day strike until
Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae agreed to put off the tax.
	   But he reinstated it in the 1998-99 budget in June, citing the
need to increase revenues because of economic hardship.
	   Employees of the state-owned Kenya Post and Telecommunications
Corporation have threatened to strike over the same tax.
	   ------
	   CHINHOYI, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A top government official condemned
proposed foreign investment in Zimbabwe's media, saying the move
would challenge political order in the country.
	   ``The aim of most foreign owned newspapers is to destabilize the
political order in the country,'' said Nathan Shamuyarira, Minister
of Industry and Commerce.
	   The man who is also propaganda chief for the ruling Politburo
spoke Sunday on state radio and TV.
	   Last month, an agency in Shamuyarira's ministry approved a 60
percent capital investment by outside investors for the launch of
four regional weeklies and a national paper, The Daily News.
	   A key player is Tony O'Reilly, a close personal friend of
President Robert Mugabe and a majority shareholder in Independent
Newspaper Holdings of South Africa.
	   Shamuyarira was editor of a paper also called the Daily News in
1964, when former Rhodesian leader Ian Smith's Front Government
banned it for opposing white rule.
	   Information Minister Chen Chimutengwende last week demanded
legislation to curb foreign participation in the media.
	   Most of Zimbabwe's media are owned by the parastatal Mass Media
Trust.
	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Switzerland's President Flavio
Cotti on Monday signed a 16 million rand (dlrs 2.6 million) aid
agreement to establish a fund for needy students in South Africa.
	   Starting a three-day state visit, Cotti was greeted by President
Nelson Mandela at his offices, Tuynhuys. Mandela led the visitor on
a stroll to a gate where they greeted school children _ a gesture
that has become a trademark of his presidency.
	   Switzerland is South Africa's fifth-largest investor.
	   Cotti was expected to meet Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and
retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairman of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission that is investigating apartheid-era
crimes.
	   ------
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Zambian police are investigating reports
that international truck drivers are smuggling military weapons
into the country for use in armed robberies.
	   Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe confirmed on Monday that a
syndicate
	   was responsible.
	   International truckers have allegedly sold guns to organized
gangsters currently terrorizing Lusaka in a spate of armed
robberies.
	   Chimfwembe said 68 people were robbed in Lusaka at gunpoint in
June.
	   Chimfwembe said the guns came from Angola, Burundi and Rwanda.
He would not confirm nor deny that some weapons were from South
Africa.
	   ------
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A second round of peace talks between
military rebels and the incumbent government of Guinea Bissau have
been scheduled for Friday and Saturday, the Portuguese news agency
LUSA reported Monday.
	   The talks, to be held on a Portuguese frigate moored off the
coast of the
	   capital Bissau, follows a ceasefire agreement reached last
month.
	   The talks were negotiated by a delegation from the Community of
Portuguese Speaking Countries, or CPLP.
	   The tiny West African former Portuguese colony was plunged into
conflict
	   following a military uprising on June 7.
	   -------
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Raging mountain fires forced the
evacuations of dozens of people before the blazes were brought
under control late Monday.
	   South African Air Force helicopters assisted in fighting the
fires and helped transport firefighters to the mountains, said
spokeswoman Lt. Col. Laverne Machine.
	   The fires occurred along the Western Cape's Garden Route in the
southern region of the country.
	   -----
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Fourteen people were killed and more
than 40 were injured when a bus crashed into a sugar cane truck at
Tambuti in Eastern
	   Swaziland.
	   The bus was carrying vendors home from Durban in South Africa
when it crashed on Saturday into a broken-down tractor and veered
into the loaded sugar cane truck.
	   The drivers of the bus and the truck were among the dead.
	   ------
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Long known for its financial prudence,
the Botswana government has increased salaries of public servants
by as much as 43 percent.
	   The increase is the largest in the history of Botswana, which
has one of Africa's most successful democracies and economies.
	   The move drew fire from the local Gazette newspaper, that wrote:
``This will go down in the history of Botswana as the year in which
prudent financial management was thrown out of the window to be
replaced by help yourself economics.''
	   The former British protectorate ranked among the world's 10
poorest countries at independence in 1966. Today, its 1.5 million
people enjoy per capita income of dlrs 3,000, putting Botswana in
the upper half for the world and the top ranks for Africa.
	   The government claimed a budget surplus the last nine years.

	   British landmine expert killed in accident in Angola
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A British landmine expert was killed in
Angola while demonstrating how to defuse a mine, the Foreign Office
in London said Monday.
	   Justin Bailey, 27, was training Angolans in how to make mined
areas safe as part of a program run by a non-governmental
organization called Norwegians Peoples Aid, Foreign Office
spokeswoman Clare Davies said by phone.
	   The accident happened July 28 and Baily's body has since been
flown back to his home in Gloucester, west England, Davies said.
	   An estimated 10 to 14 million land mines were laid in Angola
during a two-decade-long civil war that pitted UNITA rebels against
government forces. An estimated 70,000 Angolans lost limbs from
land mine explosions.
	   Princess Diana, who died last year, had visited landmine victims
in Angola to publicize the devastation that these weapons can
cause.
	   The government and UNITA signed a tenuous peace deal in 1994. A
recent sharp rise in tension, including reports that new mines are
being laid, has triggered fears that the country may slide back
into war.
	   A top United Nations envoy arrived in the country Friday on an
emergency six-day peacemaking mission.

Lithuania in quarterfinals joining Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lithuania, Puerto Rico wins; edits, trims &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS Greece (AP) _ Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two
Olympics, booked a place in the quarterfinals of the World
Basketball Championship Monday with a second-round victory over
Australia 84-75.
	   Lithuania joined Yugoslavia, Greece and Spain _ unbeaten
entering their late second-round games Monday _ in the coveted
quarterfinals.
	   Russia (3-1) and the United States (3-1) _ also playing late
Monday _ looked likely to also reach the final eight with the final
two places up for grabs.
	   Lithuania (4-1) led Argentina (2-3) almost from the start and
was up 41-33 at halftime and then pulled away steadily. Salulis
Stombergas had 19 to lead the Lithuanians with 14 from Darius
Lukminas.
	   Argentina, which had two players foul out _ Alejandro Montecchia
and Juan Ignacio Sanchez _ was topped by Juan Alberto Espil with
18.
	   In Monday's other early second-round game, Puerto Rico (2-3)
stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth with a 94-81 victory over
Canada (1-4).
	   Eddie Casiano topped Puerto Rico with 23 and Jose Ortiz added 15
and 10 rebounds. The Canadians were led by Greg Newton with 25
points and eight rebounds.
	   In games to determine 13th to 16th place, Nigeria claimed 13th
with a 70-60 victory over Japan. Senegal finished 15th, beating
South Korea 75-72.
	   In late second round games Monday it was: Brazil (1-3) vs.
Australia (2-2), Italy (2-2) vs. Yugoslavia (4-0), United States
(3-1) vs. Spain (4-0), Greece (4-0) vs. Russia (3-1).
	   The team to beat? Look to the silver medalists two years ago in
Atlanta.
	   Sure, the United States is missing all of its NBA stars, but
Yugoslavia is almost as hamstrung without Vlade Divac, former NBAer
Predrag Danilovic and injured playmaker Aleksandar Djordjeciv.
	   After a four-year absence caused by sanctions during the war,
Yugoslavia returned in '95 to win the European title and repeated
it two years later.
	   This team _ stars or no _ is just as good, said coach Zeljko
Obradovic.
	   ``Certainly the absence of players such as Zoran Savic (retired
from international play) and Danilovic and Divac is consideable,''
Obradovic said. ``But I believe this team has a quality equivalent
to that of '95 when all those players were present.''
	   As for the starless Americans, who fell last week by two points
to Lithuania.
	   U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich has watched his team dip and climb
as it tries to tie together its CBA, college and European roots.
	   ``You can say we've had some ups and downs,'' Tomjanovich said.
	   ``Our intensity level coming into the game wasn't where it
should be,'' he added. ``We talked a little about us representing
the United States and also what this can do for players
personally.''

<TEXT>
	   PRINZENDORF, Austria (AP) _ After a bull was slaughtered at
sunrise to a cacophony of bells and brass, naked people strapped
onto crosses were fed and spattered with blood.
	   The bloody scenes marked the bizarre start Monday of a six-day
artistic happening conceived and directed by Austrian Hermann
Nitsch, a self-described action painter whose works are on display
in art galleries around the world.
	   Nitsch's extravaganza aroused widespread outrage before it
began. His chief critics are right-wing politicians, a Vienna
tabloid, animal rights activists and Catholic bishops.
	   But about 200 of the expected 1,000 paying guests watching at
dawn apparently did not mind. They included friends, art students,
artists and intellectuals from several European countries and the
United States.

Death toll reaches 69 since start of U.N. fact-finding mission

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with death count during U.N. mission totaling 69,
mission wraps up probe; ADDS background
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed men in military fatigues stopped a
bus at a fake roadblock, then slit the throats of passengers and
the driver, killing 12 people, authorities announced Monday.
	   The latest killings blamed on Muslim militants brought to 69 the
number of civilians who died since a U.N. mission investigating the
insurgency arrived nearly two weeks ago. The panel wrapped up its
mission on Monday.
	   Army troops killed at least a dozen suspected Islamic militants
after the Sunday afternoon attack that also left six civilians
wounded near Saida, 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of
Algiers, authorities said in a statement.
	   The U.N. panel, looking into the massacres and bombings that
have killed an estimated 75,000 people in this petroleum-rich
nation since 1992, finished its visit Monday after a meeting with
President Liamine Zeroual. No details of the meeting were
immediately available.
	   ``The panel is particularly appreciative of the government and
the people of Algeria,'' a U.N. statement said, adding the
six-member mission would leave for Lisbon on Tuesday.
	   The U.N. mission, led by former Portuguese President Mario
Soares, has met with political leaders in the governing coalition
as well as the opposition, generals, public figures, human rights
activists and victims' families.
	   It visited the main prison in Algiers as well as two massacre
sites, and met with three lawyers from the banned Islamic Salvation
Front.
	   In the meantime, the panel remained tight-lipped, though sources
close to the mission said they were asked tough questions about how
the government was protecting civilians. The government has been
accused of failing to prevent the massacres, and rights groups say
the army is responsible for the disappearances of thousands of
people.
	   While the Algerian government had granted the group more freedom
than to previous foreign delegations, it expressed irritation as it
awaited the results of the probe.
	   The U.N. investigation could ``free the terrorists of guilt,
while they themselves admit to their odious crimes and claim
them,'' the official Algerian Press Agency APS said.
	   Accompanying Soares on the mission were former U.S. ambassador
to the U.N. Donald McHenry; former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral; former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti;
Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako; and former French Health
Minister Simone Veil.
	   The insurgency began after the army-backed government canceled
parliamentary elections in January 1992 that the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win on voter discontent with corruption and
high unemployment.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Visiting Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
said Monday that he will submit legislation in parliament next
month to return property to Jewish Romanian citizens whose property
was seized after World War II.
	   The bill presents a global solution for Romania to return
property to all former owners, not only Jews,'' said Vasile, who
arrived Sunday for a four-day visit to Israel.
	   Vasile met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday
afternoon, and was scheduled to meet with representatives of the
World Jewish Restitution Organization on Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu described his meeting with Vasile as ``excellent,''
and praised the Romanian premier's sensitivity towards Jews.
	   ``I was impressed by the Prime Minister's friendship towards the
Jewish people and the State of Israel, and his willingness to
explore every opportunity and every avenue to increase our special
relationship,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Romanian premier toured Jerusalem's walled Old City with his
wife Maricua on Monday morning. The couple visited the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre, the traditional site of Jesus' crucifixion and
resurrection, and the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and
window-shopped in the Muslim Quarter.
	   ``It's wonderful, unbelievable,'' Mrs. Vasile said. ``It's like
a dream because of all this history.''
	   Some 400,000 Jews _ half the Romanian Jewish population _ died
in World War II, when Romania was allied with Nazi Germany. Many
others left the country in the years after the war, when hundreds
of Jewish properties were nationalized by Romania's communist
government.
	   Naftali Lavi, vice-chairman of the World Jewish Restitution
Organization, said that several thousand public properties and as
many as hundreds of thousands of private properties were seized
from Jews by the Nazis and the communists.
	   ``We were singled out for the confiscation of our property,''
Lavi said. ``Therefore we have to be singled out for restitution as
well.''
	   Lavi said that if property cannot be returned, the owners should
be fully compensated.
	   A joint WJRO-government committee working to restore public
Jewish properties met for the second time Monday in Bucharest, Lavi
said. ``The property that the Nazis took from the Jews is still in
the Romanian government's hands,'' he said.
	   Vasile said five houses belonging to Jews had already been
returned to their owners this year, and that another three or four
would be returned soon.
	   ``We hope to find a way to find justice for those who suffered
under the two totalitarian regimes, the communist and the fascist,
and especially the communist,'' Vasile said.
	   Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said there were now only
12,000 Jews in Romania, but that Romanian Jews living outside the
country were expected to ask for the return of their property as
well.
	   More than 450,000 Jews of Romanian origin live in Israel,
according to Israel's Foreign Ministry.
	   Romania's president, Emil Constantinescu, won praise from
Romanian Jewish leaders last year for publicly acknowledging the
country's complicity in the persecution and murder of Jews in the
Holocaust.
	   Also Monday, Israel and Romania pledged to increase the dlrs 250
million a year in trade between their countries and work toward a
free trade agreement. Vasile and Netanyahu signed two separate
agreements, one dealing with agricultural cooperation, and a second
on investment protection.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey kept Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov at a distance Monday, insisting that his four-day visit
was a private one that did not include official meetings with
Turkish leaders.
	   Maskhadov, who has been seeking support for Chechnya's
recognition as an independent state, arrived in Istanbul Sunday.
	   Although many here sympathize with largely Muslim Chechnya's
demands for independence, Turkey, which is fighting
autonomy-seeking Kurdish insurgents itself, does not recognize
Chechnya's independence.
	   Turkey is also said to be wary of damaging its ties with Moscow,
which insists that Chechnya is part of Russia.

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's leading opposition party
captured the governor's seat in the central state of Aguascalientes
on Monday, a victory that gives it fresh momentum heading toward
the 2000 presidential race.
	   More than anything, the gubernatorial contests in Aguascalientes
and two other states Sunday underscored the growing competitiveness
of elections in a country where for decades one party _ the
Institutional Revolutionary Party _ easily won every vote.
	   ``Mexico has made another important step toward democracy,''
said historian Enrique Krauze, serving as an election-day analyst
for the Mexican network Televisa. ``The process was characterized
by stability and tranquility.''
	   With 79 percent of the vote counted in Aguascalientes on Monday,
Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez of National Action was ahead with 53
percent of the vote, the State Electoral Council said.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's candidate, Hector
Hugo Olivares Ventura, trailed with 36 percent, followed by Alfonso
Bernal Sahagun of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party, with
7 percent.
	   ``What we want for Aguascalientes is a transition that does not
hold back its progress, that does not cause a scandal,'' Gonzalez
Gonzalez told a news conference after media exit polls showed him
the winner.
	   Complete preliminary results in Aguascalientes, as well as in
Oaxaca and Veracruz, were not expected until later Monday. The
final official results for all three races were not expected until
later in the week.
	   The vote in Aguascalientes came a month after National Action,
known by its Spanish initials as the PAN, lost one of its six
governor's seats. It was defeated by the ruling party, known as the
PRI, in Chihuahua. Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best
opportunity to offset the loss.
	   In Mexico City on Sunday evening, PAN national president Felipe
Calderon Hinojosa opened a bottle of apple cider to toast
Gonzalez's apparent win.
	   With Aguascalientes, the PAN ``advances and solidifies its
political position,'' a smiling Calderon Hinojosa said.
	   While the center-right National Action Party was headed for
victory in Aguascalientes, the PRI was virtually assured the
governorship in the Gulf state of Veracruz.
	   With 98 percent of the ballots counted, Miguel Aleman, a wealthy
businessman and the son of a former president, was leading with 49
percent of the vote.
	   Luis Pazos of National Action trailed with 27 percent. The
candidate of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party lagged
behind with 18 percent.
	   Veracruz, a party stronghold, was seen as essential for the PRI.
With its 4 million voters, Veracruz has the nation's third-largest
electorate and could be crucial in the presidential election.
	   Aleman late Sunday promised to create ``a social alliance'' as
Veracruz's new governor.
	   As elected leader of one of Mexico's most important states,
Aleman automatically would become a top contender for the PRI's
presidential nomination for 2000 _ even though he has claimed he is
not interested.
	   The PRI, which long maintained its power through a mix of
patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating at the ballot box, has
seen devastating electoral losses in recent years following reforms
aimed at stamping out vote fraud and making elections more
competitive.
	   The PRI suffered its worst setbacks last year when it lost
control of the lower house of Congress and was defeated in the
Mexico City mayoral race. But it won two of three elections last
month, including in Chihuahua, where it defeated the PAN.
	   In the southern state of Oaxaca Monday, the PRI had a widening
advantage over the center-left Democratic Revolution party for the
governorship.
	   The PRD was challenging the count, arguing that the computer
system reporting results crashed for 40 minutes and when it
returned to service, the results had been altered.
	   PRD national director Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the party
would not validate an election ``plagued by irregularities, that
was not clean nor free and in which the vote was manipulated,'' the
daily Reforma reported Monday.
	   Nevertheless, many analysts said the PRD did better than
expected, showing that it, too, has become a political force
capable of seriously challenging the PRI.
	   With 86 percent of the vote counted Monday, PRI candidate Jose
Nelson Murat Casab widened his lead with 48 percent of the vote.
Democratic Revolution candidate Hector Sanchez had 37.5 percent.
The National Action candidate had just under 11 percent.
	   Formed in 1989, Democratic Revolution saw its first important
electoral win last year when Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the son of late
President Lazaro Cardenas, captured the mayorship of Mexico City.
	   It won its first state governorship _ in the northern state of
Zacatecas _ last month.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army pushed
ahead Monday in its drive to seize control of all of Afghanistan,
closing in on a major opposition stronghold a day after it captured
a nearby town.
	   Though the Taliban met little resistance when it took Shebergan
on Sunday, the militia will get a fight in Mazar-e-Sharif, a
northern alliance spokesman said Monday.
	   ``Our forces are ready to defend Mazar-e-Sharif. If the Taliban
try to capture Mazar-e-Sharif, they will face heavy resistance,''
said Zabet Saliy, spokesman for anti-Taliban military leader Ahmed
Shah Masood. ``They will repeat the mistake they committed last
year.''
	   Taliban fighters briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif last May,
retreating after street battles that left several hundred Taliban
soldiers dead. It is believed that as many as 2,000 Taliban
prisoners of war were later massacred.
	   Taliban fighters have been bolstered by a series of recent
victories and appear poised to capture the remaining northern part
of Afghanistan they do not control.
	   Taliban leaders have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban
officials have barred girls from school and confined most women to
their homes.
	   The fractious anti-Taliban coalition is made of mostly of
Afghanistan's minority ethnic and religious groups.
	   Taliban radio reported late Monday that fighters were just 40
kilometers (25 miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif, within rocket range
of the city's airport, which was reported closed.
	   Wekil Ahmad Muttawkil, a Taliban spokesman at the militia's
headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, said leaders had not
yet decided whether to attack Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Last year's tough battle for the town contrasts with sketchy
descriptions of Sunday's fall of Shebergan, the stronghold of
warlord Rashid Dostum that is located 100 kilometers (60 miles)
west of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Dostum has joined Masood and the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia that
controls Mazar-e-Sharif against the Taliban, but his fighters also
clashed with Hezb-e-Wahadat in Mazar-e-Sharif last year.
	   Taliban officials said casualties were low and a large number of
prisoners were captured. Dostum's forces reportedly set fire to
Shebergan airport as they left, destroying several fighter jets.
	   Saliy, speaking by satellite telephone from northern
Afghanistan, said Dostum's men put up little resistance after some
of their commanders were paid off by the Taliban. Such mercenary
switching of loyalties has long been a hallmark of the Afghan civil
war.
	   Dostum retreated to Hayratan, about 60 kilometers (40 miles)
east of Mazar-e-Sharif on Afghanistan's border with Uzbekistan and
was trying to reorganize his forces, Saliy said.

German-Russian composer Alfred Schnittke dies at 63
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Schnittke to be buried in Moscow's
Novodevichye cemetery. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Alfred Schnittke, one of the former
Soviet Union's most prolific composers whose works ranged from
symphonies to movie themes, died Monday in Hamburg. He was 63.
	   Schnittke, the son of a Russian mother and a German-Jewish
father, died at Hamburg's University Hospital, where he had been
admitted after suffering his fourth stroke over a period of many
years, his wife, Irina, said.
	   A creator of ``polystylism,'' or mixture of musical forms, he
was spurned in his homeland at the beginning of his career, but by
the 1980s had won over Soviet cultural authorities.
	   The unorthodox composer was among five winners in 1992 of the
prestigious Praemium Imperiale for lifetime achievement in the
arts, given by the Japan Art Association.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a telegram Monday to Irina
Schnittke in Hamburg saying he shared her family's ``huge grief.''
	   ``A great composer of modern times has departed. With his
creation, Alfred Schnittke carried out a genuine revolution in
music,'' Yeltsin wrote. ``He brought glory to the culture of his
homeland and enriched the tradition of the Russian classical music
school with his unique, innovative ideas.''
	   Schnittke's final composition, the Ninth Symphony, had its world
premiere this spring in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory.
Schnittke was seriously ill, unable to talk or move much, by the
time he composed it; the right-handed composer wrote the piece with
his left hand.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the composer is to be buried at
Moscow's Novodevichye cemetery _ a high honor in Russia. No date
was set for the funeral.
	   Schnittke was born on November 24, 1934, in Engels, a small town
on the Volga River in what was then called the Volga German
Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, an area that had been settled
by Germans in the 18th century.
	   The son of Harry Schnittke, a German-born Jew of Latvian
descent, and Maria Vogel, a Volga-German Catholic, he was
influenced by both the Russian and German cultures.
	   Music did not play a big role in his life until 1946, the year
his family moved to Vienna, where his father began working for a
Soviet German-language paper.
	   One of the first pieces Schnittke heard on the radio in Vienna
was Shostakovich's Ninth Symphony, which he found, in his words,
``very refreshing, but also very strange.''
	   Increasingly obsessed with music, he started taking piano
lessons with a local teacher, Charlotte Ruber, and he soon
developed an interest in composition.
	   The two years his family spent in Vienna were of ``decisive
importance'' in his life, he once wrote.
	   ``I recall a basic musical tone, a certain Mozart-Schubert sound
which I carried within me for decades and which was confirmed upon
my next stay in Austria some 30 years later,'' he said.
	   Returning to the Soviet Union with his parents in 1948,
Schnittke enrolled at the Institute of the October Revolution, a
music preparatory school in Moscow.
	   Five years later, he entered the Moscow Conservatory, where the
composers Nicolai Rakov and Evgeny Golubev were among his
instructors.
	   As part of his graduation requirements, he composed an oratorio,
Nagasaki, that included an atomic blast as part of the score,
offering an early glimpse of the unorthodox musical approach he
would adopt in later years.
	   In 1961 he joined the faculty himself, and for the next 10 years
taught instrumentation, polyphony, and composition at the
conservatory.
	   Schnittke's long list of compositions includes five symphonies,
a piano concerto, four violin concertos, five concerto grossos, two
concertos each for viola and cello, two oratorios, six ballets,
numerous choral, chamber, and instrumental pieces, and arrangements
of works by Shostakovich, Berg, Scott Joplin, and others.
	   He also has about 60 Soviet film scores to his credit, most of
them written between 1961 and 1984.
	   Schnittke is survived by his wife, Irina Katayeva, and a son.
The couple divided their time between homes in Moscow and Hamburg.

Warning issued against wounded polar bear in Svalbard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Tourists and tour operators in the Norwegian
Arctic archipelago of Svalbard have been warned against a wounded
polar bear which could be dangerous.
	   The bear was shot Saturday when it attacked a group of British
tourists in the Bille Fjord area. The group's Norwegian guide shot
the bear in the neck with his revolver when it got into a fight
with one of the group's dogs in the tourists' tent camp.
	   The bear dissappeared into the icy wilderness, leaving a bloody
trail in the snow.
	   ``We called off a helicopter hunt for the bear on Sunday, but
are still keeping a look-out for it,'' said John Starheimseter of
the Norwegian governor's office to The Associated Press.
	   Governor Ann-Kristin Olsen, who also is chief of police in the
Arctic territory, 700 miles (1100 kilometers) north of the
mainland, warned people against going to the area, about 30 miles
(50 kilometers) from the capital of Longyearbyen.
	   None of the six British tourists or their Norwegian guide were
hurt in the incident.
	   Polar bears are a protected species, and all hunting for the
bears was banned some 25 years ago. The govenor's office will now
launch an investigation to determine whether the shooting Saturday
was legal self-defense.
	   Although encounters with polar bears are rare in the more
accessible areas of Svalbard during the summer, everybody who
ventures outside Longyearbyen is strongly recommended to carry a
gun for protection.
	   In 1995 two people, a French tourist and a Norwegian woman, were
killed by polar bears in two different incidents in Svalbard. The
young Norwegian woman met the bear on a glacier right outside
Longyearbyen.
	   Most areas of Svalbard are off limits for tourists unless they
are well equipped for polar exploration and have a permit, or take
part in an organized tour.
	   Svalbard is Norwegian territory, but under the Svalbard treaty
all signatories can carry out commercial and scientific activities.
Besides Norway, only Russia has significant commercial interests in
two large coal mines.

Spanish police detain 83 would-be immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Police detained Monday 57 Moroccans they
believed were trying to sneak into Spain after crossing the often
treacherous Strait of Gibraltar by night in two single-engine
boats, one of which also carried a cargo of hashish.
	   Police said they found between five and 10 kilograms (11 and 22
pounds) of hashish in a boat that was also carrying 30 men. All 30
were detained while police investigated who was responsible for
smuggling the drugs.
	   The other boat carried 25 men and two women. Both vessels were
spotted just off the coast from Carnero Point on Spain's southern
tip before 2 a.m., the police spokesman said.
	   In a separate incident, police detained 22 Algerians and four
Moroccans found hidden in an Italian truck traveling towards the
French border early Monday.
	   Fleeing poverty at home, thousands of people attempt each year
to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa and sneak into
Europe. Almost all are men and most are from Morocco.
	   Those caught are repatriated.
	   Some 20 would-be immigrants are believed to have drowned when
their boat overturned close to the Spanish coast last week.

Mixed day for Swedes as Johansson exits, Gustafsson advances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Sweden's Thomas Johansson was the
first seeded casualty Monday in the Grolsch Open ATP clay court
tennis tourney, upset 0-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) by Italian Galo Blanco.
	   Johansson, seeded No.4 here and 34 on the ATP tour rankings,
frittered away a 4-2 second-set lead against the 104th-ranked
Italian in the first match of main draw.
	   But the next match up on centre court saw Swedish third seed
Magnus Gustafsson make short work of Brazilian Fernando Meligeni
6-4, 6-3.
	   Two more seeds booked last-16 berths at the Bosbaan tennis
complex with straight sets wins on a first day free of the rain
which has dogged Dutch tennis this summer.
	   Australian No. 6 Richard Fromberg ousted Andrei Pavel of Romania
6-3, 6-4 and Slovakian No. 7 Dominik Hrbaty downed Belgium Filip
Dewulf, 6-3, 7-5.
	   The longest match of the day was between two unseeded players.
Italian Davide Sanguinetti came back from a first set tiebreaker
loss to eliminate Spaniard Alex Calatrava 6-7 (7-3), 6-2, 7-5.
	   Top-seeded Slovakian Karol Kucera starts his campaign in this
dlrs 500,000 tournament Tuesday, with a first-round matchup against
Russian Marat Safin.

Iraq says some of Odai's attackers captured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi security forces have captured two of
the five men who shot and seriously wounded President Saddam
Hussein's eldest son in 1996, the government said Monday.
	   The two men who were arrested carried out the actual attack on
Odai Hussein, the General Directorate of Security said in a
statement carried by Iraq television. The three others still at
large provided cover and support, the directorate said.
	   The statement accused a ``neighboring foreign country'' of
masterminding the attack but stopped short of naming it. Odai, in
an interview from his hospital bed after the attack, had pointed
the finger at Iran. Iran has denied any involvement.
	   ``The organs of a foreign neighboring country have been involved
in this treacherous operation,'' the statement said.
	   The names of the two men were released, but the statement did
not give their background or say when they were arrested. It said
two of the three men at large are hiding in a neighboring country.
	   Odai, 34, was shot about 10 times on Dec. 12, 1996, while he
waited alone in his car in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood.
	   In April 1997, surgeons operated on his shattered left leg. He
has since been shown on television walking with the aid of a cane.
	   Two opposition groups claimed responsibility for the attack: the
Iranian-backed Al-Dawa Party, a Shiite opposition group, and the
Mohammed Madhlum al-Dulaimi Group, named after an Iraqi air force
general executed for plotting against Saddam.

Attorney General says threatened crackdown on strike is illegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's attorney general declared on
Monday that the government had acted improperly when it said it
would clamp down on a threatened strike by the country's largest
labor federation.
	   The statement by Attorney General Patrick Chinamasa left many
observers in confusion.
	   ``I don't know what to believe,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai,
secretary general of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trades Unions, which
is considering a five-day national stoppage to protest tax hikes,
runaway inflation and government corruption and mismanagement.
	   Chinamasa said notices in the official Government Gazette which
declared virtually all the formal sector economy ``essential
services'' and threatened to impose 10-year jail terms for people
inciting or supporting a strike were ``erroneous and invalid.''
	   An International Monetary Fund delegation is to arrive in Harare
on Tuesday and is to consider giving more aid to the country's
economy. Chinamasa's comments may be a sign the government had a
change of heart about the threatened strike and is worried that a
crackdown would threaten an international aid package.

Sailor attacks captain and crew member, then sets himself ablaze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A sailor aboard a luxury yacht attacked
his captain and another crew member with a hatchet Monday and then
doused himself with gasoline and set himself ablaze.
	   According to the Merchant Marine Ministry, four Greek and seven
Canadian passengers aboard the yacht Thelginos used fire
extinguishers to put out Robert Giannousis. The yacht had three
crew members.
	   Capt. Nicolas Klaromenos, 56, and sailor Vasilis Hasandras, 45,
were seriously injured in the attack.
	   Giannousis was listed in serious condition at a health center on
the Aegean Sea island of Alonissos, the ministry said. The captain
and sailor were also hospitalized.
	   The ministry said it had no further information on the incident,
which occurred while the yacht was anchored off a bay in Alonissos.
	   An investigation was underway to determine why Giannousis went
on a rampage, the ministry said.

Lithuania in quarterfinals joining Greece, Spain, Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to Argentina in lead; ADDS quotes from Kanisovas,
Puerto Rico coach Carlos Morales &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS Greece (AP) _ Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two
Olympics, booked a place in the quarterfinals of the World
Basketball Championship Monday with a second-round victory over
Argentina 84-75.
	   Lithuania joined Yugoslavia, Greece and Spain _ unbeaten
entering their late second-round games Monday _ in the coveted
quarterfinals.
	   Russia (3-1) and the United States (3-1) _ also playing late
Monday _ looked likely to reach the final eight with the last two
places up for grabs among Italy, Argentina, Puerto Rico and
Australia.
	   Lithuania (4-1) led Argentina (2-3) almost from the start and
was up 41-33 at halftime and then pulled away steadily. Salulis
Stombergas had 19 to lead the Lithuanians with 14 from Darius
Lukminas. The team's top scorer in the tournament _ Arturas
Karnisovas had 11.
	   ``Because they paid so much attention to me, I had to distribute
the ball instead of shooting it,'' the former Seton Hall star said.
``We kept going to Stombergas because they couldn't stop him one on
one. He was too quick.''
	   Argentina, which had two players foul out _ Alejandro Montecchia
and Juan Ignacio Sanchez _ was topped by Juan Alberto Espil with
18.
	   In Monday's other early second-round game, Puerto Rico (2-3)
stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth with a 94-81 victory over
Canada (1-4).
	   Eddie Casiano topped Puerto Rico with 23 and Jose Ortiz added 15
and 10 rebounds. The Canadians were led by Greg Newton with 25
points and eight rebounds.
	   ``This is the first time we have been able to play the game we
are capable of playing,'' said Puerto Rico coach Carlos Morales.
``We are small so we go hard for the boards and try to penetrate
and shoot from the outside.''
	   In games to determine 13th to 16th place, Nigeria claimed 13th
with a 70-60 victory over Japan. Senegal finished 15th, beating
South Korea 75-72.
	   In late second round games Monday it was: Brazil (1-3) vs.
Australia (2-2), Italy (2-2) vs. Yugoslavia (4-0), United States
(3-1) vs. Spain (4-0), Greece (4-0) vs. Russia (3-1).
	   The team to beat? Look to the silver medalists two years ago in
Atlanta.
	   Sure, the United States is missing all of its NBA stars, but
Yugoslavia is almost as hamstrung without Vlade Divac, former NBAer
Predrag Danilovic and injured playmaker Aleksandar Djordjeciv.
	   After a four-year absence caused by sanctions during the war,
Yugoslavia returned in '95 to win the European title and repeated
it two years later.
	   This team _ stars or no _ is just as good, said coach Zeljko
Obradovic.
	   ``Certainly the absence of players such as Zoran Savic (retired
from international play) and Danilovic and Divac is consideable,''
Obradovic said. ``But I believe this team has a quality equivalent
to that of '95 when all those players were present.''
	   As for the starless Americans, who fell last week by two points
to Lithuania.
	   U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich has watched his team dip and climb
as it tries to tie together its CBA, college and European roots.
	   ``You can say we've had some ups and downs,'' Tomjanovich said.
	   ``Our intensity level coming into the game wasn't where it
should be,'' he added. ``We talked a little about us representing
the United States and also what this can do for players
personally.''

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Rescue teams searching for 10 men buried
last month in an Austria mine have shifted the focus of their
efforts from saving survivors to retrieving bodies, officials said
Monday.
	   ``We won't give up hope,'' said Alfred Zechling, spokesman of
the rescue team in the mining village of Lassing, 190 kilometers
(120 miles) southwest of Vienna. But he also made clear there was
little hope any survivors would be found.
	   The decision to change tactics came after cameras and
microphones lowered into an emergency shaft failed to detect signs
of life in a chamber where it was hoped some of the men were able
to survive.
	   Relatives of the missing and residents of Lassing were depressed
at the news, and asked the rescue teams not to ease up on their
search, ``even if only to retrieve the dead,'' the Austrian Press
Agency reported.
	   The 10 were sent into a talc mine in Lassing on July 17 to
rescue miner Georg Hainzl, who was buried in a massive landslide
unleashed by torrential rains. But a second, larger landslide
trapped the nine miners and one geologist.
	   Talc is a soft mineral that is refined into talcum powder and
lubricants.
	   Rescue efforts intensified after Hainzl was found alive and in
relatively good condition July 26. He had taken refuge in another
chamber closer to the surface.
	   The only remaining hope is a series of other air pockets that
have been detected from the surface, where the miners might have a
chance of surviving because there would be enough oxygen. Boring
through to them, however, will be a long, slow ordeal, as they are
located under the original stone surrounding the mine.

British land-mine expert killed in accident in Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A British land-mine expert was killed in
Angola while demonstrating how to defuse a mine, the Foreign Office
in London said Monday.
	   Justin Bailey, 27, was training Angolans in how to make mined
areas safe as part of a program run by a nongovernmental
organization called Norwegians Peoples Aid, Foreign Office
spokeswoman Clare Davies said by phone.
	   The accident happened July 28 and Bailey's body has since been
flown back to his home in Gloucester, west England, Davies said.
	   An estimated 10 to 14 million land mines were laid in Angola
during a two-decade-long civil war that pitted UNITA rebels against
government forces. An estimated 70,000 Angolans lost limbs from
land mine explosions.
	   Princess Diana, who died last year, had visited land-mine
victims in Angola to publicize the devastation that the weapons can
cause.
	   The government and UNITA signed a tenuous peace deal in 1994. A
recent sharp rise in tension, including reports that new mines are
being laid, has triggered fears that the country may slide back
into war.
	   A top U.N. envoy arrived in the country Friday on an emergency
six-day peacemaking mission.

British Columbia split over historic treaty with Indians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Rewarded for 111 years of
persistence, the Nisga'a Indians sign a historic treaty Tuesday
giving them land, cash and self-government in a remote and
spectacular mountain valley.
	   It is a time of celebration for the 5,500 Nisga'a, who have
sought a treaty since 1887, but many British Columbians don't share
their joy. Critics contend that history of this magnitude should be
made only with voters' consent.
	   If ratified, it will be the first treaty this century for any of
the 51 Indian communities in British Columbia. Unlike the rest of
Canada, treaties in the Pacific Coast province were not signed
during colonization.
	   The province's two main opposition parties are demanding a
referendum on the treaty. It will cost taxpayers more than dlrs 300
million (dlrs 200 million U.S.) and likely serve as a blueprint for
settlements with dozens of other tribes.
	   ``We are creating a whole new order of government, we are
creating new rights, we are entrenching inequality based on race,''
said Gordon Campbell, leader of the opposition B.C. Liberal Party.
``The least they could do is allow the public a say.''
	   The Nisga'a will get to vote on the treaty later this year. It
also must be ratified by Parliament and British Columbia's
legislature.
	   The treaty is strongly backed by the federal government of Prime
Minister Jean Chretien and the provincial government of Premier
Glen Clark.
	   The province is spending dlrs 2.3 million (dlrs 1.5 million
U.S.) to promote the treaty. A key selling point is that British
Columbia _ its economy now reeling _ needs treaties to end the
uncertainty for mining and forest companies considering projects on
land claimed by Indians.
	   The Nisga'a treaty, which took two decades to draft, gives the
Indians dlrs 190 million (dlrs 126 million U.S.) in cash over 15
years, plus title to 1,930 square kilometers (745 square miles) of
rugged land in northwestern British Columbia. Other programs, plus
forgone government revenue, push the cost of the treaty higher.
	   The chief Nisga'a negotiator, Joe Gosnell, says the cost to
taxpayers is dwarfed by value of fish, timber and minerals taken
from Nisga'a territory in past decades. Lack of control over those
resources has helped boost the Nisga'a jobless rate above 60
percent.
	   Gosnell admits some Nisga'a are bitter because negotiators
settled for one-tenth of their original land claim and agreed to
relinquish their tax-exempt status.
	   The treaty provides the Nisga'a with the right to
self-government and the authority to make laws governing their own
affairs. It envisions a Nisga'a justice system, with its own
judges, police force and jails.
	   The treaty's critics say the 100 or so non-Indians living in
Nisga'a territory will become second-class citizens, excluded from
voting for tribal governments.
	   Keith Martin, a Parliament member with the right-wing Reform
Party, said the treaty could lead to creation of mini-states for
each of British Columbia's native communities.
	   ``Apartheid or separate development failed in South Africa and
it will fail in B.C.,'' he said.
	   But government officials insist the treaty does not create
racial inequality.
	   ``There is no taxation without representation,'' said Clark,
noting that non-Indians in Nisga'a territory will pay taxes to the
provincial government, not the tribal council.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The Kivu region of eastern Congo is in
open rebellion against the government of President Laurent Kabila,
a Rwandan official said Monday.
	   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be further
identified, said the 700-kilometer (435-mile) stretch between
Kalemie and Beni in South and North Kivu provinces was up in arms.
	   Contacted by telephone in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu
province, Maj. Ilunga Kabambi, the commander of the Congolese army
in the South Kivu region, said he and members of the 222nd Brigade
were ``not in agreement with the president.''
	   He said the city at the south end of Lake Kivu was calm after
``some trouble'' and confirmed reports that several dozen
Banyamulenge or ethnic Tutsi officers and soldiers, who had been
court-martialed and jailed for insubordination, had been freed from
Bukavu prison.
	   ``This is a generalized movement,'' Kabambi said, cutting short
the conversation.
	   Officers and troops from the Rwandan Patriotic Army were
instrumental, in collaboration with the Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis
from Kivu, in launching and carrying out the eight-month rebellion
that brought Kabila to power in the former Zaire in May 1997 and
ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The rebellion began among the Banyamulenge in October 1996
around Uvira, 110 kilometers (68 miles) south of Bukavu.
	   Humanitarian sources in the Kivu region said Monday the movement
against Kabila _ and his Baluba kinsmen from southeastern Katanga
province _ appeared to have overcome recent rifts between the
Banyamulenge in the Congolese army and soldiers from tribes
indigenous to the area.
	   A humanitarian source who could not be further identified said
Rwandan soldiers and officers were seen in Bukavu Monday, including
Col. James Kabarere, who as Col. Kabari was, until he was dismissed
by Kabila last month, the chief of staff of the Congolese army.
	   The sources said it appeared that the majority of the 9,000
Rwandan soldiers who were supposed to have returned to Rwanda last
month had stayed on in the region.
	   The private Rwandan News Agency said earlier Monday that the
radio station in Goma, capital of North Kivu province, had
broadcast a communique from mutineers saying the army had decided
to remove Kabila from power.
	   Goma is 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Bukavu.
	   There were unconfirmed reports that the rebellion had also
spread to Kindu, capital of Maniema province, 130 kilometers (80
miles) west of Bukavu.
	   In Kigali, Rwandan government spokesman Maj. Wilson Rutaisire
told The Associated Press no Rwandan troops were involved in the
current rebellion because they had all left the Congo last week at
Kabila's request.
	   However, he acknowledged that the departure of the unspecified
number of Rwandan troops may have played a role in the current
unrest.
	   Analysts have been predicting major problems in North and South
Kivu for some time because of the competition for land and power
among the Banyamulenge and other ethnic Tutsis who have lived in
the region for generations with ethnic Hutus _ also originally from
Rwanda _ and the so-called indigenous tribes like the Bahunde, the
Banyanga and the Babembe.
	   Writing in the July issue of Le Monde Diplomatique, French
researcher Gerard Prunier said Kivu was on the verge of explosion,
``and no one is looking for scissors to cut the fuse.''

All-night vigil for Gypsy victims of the Nazis

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- In an all-night ceremony that ended at
dawn Monday, about 300 people mourned those killed 54 years ago
when the Nazis slaughtered thousands of Gypsies during the
Holocaust.
	   From the night of Aug. 2, 1944, until the next morning, the
Nazis massacred 4,500 Hungarian Gypsies in the notorious
Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland to make room for
more Jews.
	   SS guards with dogs led Roma, as Gypsies prefer to be called,
from their barracks and gave them salami and bread, telling them
they were to be transferred to another camp.
	   Instead, the Gypsies were swiftly herded into gas chambers.
	   The annual ceremony has been expanded to honor all of the
European Gypsies who were murdered by the Nazis during World War
II. The exact number of victims is unknown because they were often
registered by the country where they were living.
	   Scholars believe the number is between 200,000 and a half
million. Of the 23,000 Gypsies taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau
prison camp, only about 2,000 survived, according to Franciszek
Piper of the Auschwitz State Museum.
	   Gypsies refer to the Holocaust as Poraymos -- or the Devouring.
	   As dusk fell Sunday over the square in front of the Gothic-style
national parliament, Erika Mate sang a Gypsy lament: ``Dear God,
let the day come when all the slaves are freed. Punish, the
Germans, oh God, for they have killed the people...''
	   The vigil included the reading of a message from President Arpad
Goencz, an ecumenical religious service and the reading of names of
thousands of Gypsy victims.
	   Speakers said that although the world has become aware of the
Nazi massacre of 6 million Jews, many remain unaware of the Nazi
slaughter of Gypsies, homosexuals, Marxists and the mentally
impaired.
	   ``My grandfather was rounded up by the Hungarian police and he
was turned over to the Germans,'' said Aladar Horvath, 34. ``When
he could not play the tune they wanted on his violin, they locked
him in the ice shed. He froze to death.''
	   The Roma settled in Hungary in the 13th century and are the
country's biggest ethnic minority _ 500,000 out of a population of
10.2 million. They are nomadic people with a distinct language and
ancient folklore and are found mostly in Spain, Hungary and the
Balkans.
	   Andras T. Hegedues, a Budapest expert on minority affairs, said
Hungarian records indicate 50,000-60,000 Hungarian Gypsies were
deported to death camps in the last two years of World War II.

Mixed day for Swedes as Johansson exits, Gustafsson advances

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS nationality of Blanco to Spaniard in first two grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Sweden's Thomas Johansson was the
first seeded casualty Monday in the Grolsch Open ATP clay court
tennis tourney, upset 0-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) by Spaniard Galo Blanco.
	   Johansson, seeded No.4 here and 34 on the ATP tour rankings,
frittered away a 4-2 second-set lead against the 104th-ranked
Spaniard in the first match of main draw.
	   But the next match up on centre court saw Swedish third seed
Magnus Gustafsson make short work of Brazilian Fernando Meligeni
6-4, 6-3.
	   Two more seeds booked last-16 berths at the Bosbaan tennis
complex with straight sets wins on a first day free of the rain
which has dogged Dutch tennis this summer.
	   Australian No. 6 Richard Fromberg ousted Andrei Pavel of Romania
6-3, 6-4 and Slovakian No. 7 Dominik Hrbaty downed Belgium Filip
Dewulf, 6-3, 7-5.
	   The longest match of the day was between two unseeded players.
Italian Davide Sanguinetti came back from a first set tiebreaker
loss to eliminate Spaniard Alex Calatrava 6-7 (7-3), 6-2, 7-5.
	   Top-seeded Slovakian Karol Kucera starts his campaign in this
dlrs 500,000 tournament Tuesday, with a first-round matchup against
Russian Marat Safin.

Forest fire sends cloud over Athens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with bigger fire under control, some houses destroyed
by fire &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 150 firefighters struggled
Monday to control a wind-whipped forest fire that threatened a
German World War II cemetery and sent a cloud of reddish smoke over
central Athens.
	   The blaze began late Sunday at the foot of Mount Pendeli about
four kilometers (2 1/2 miles) northeast of Athens' northern
suburbs, officials said.
	   By evening firefighters managed to bring most fronts sparked by
the big fire under control, while others smoldered around the
mountain.
	   ``At one point the fires threatened nearly 200 houses. We lost a
couple of the houses,'' said Panaghiotis Fourlas, fire chief for
the greater Athens area.
	   He said that the blaze started in different places at the same
time and speculated that some could have been started by arsonists.
	   ``I can't accept that all these fires started by chance,''
Fourlas told Athens' private Mega channel.
	   Authorities evacuated a home for disabled children and an army
hospital. A main road in the area was closed, reports said.
	   Four planes and a Chinook helicopter assisted 155 firefighters,
who managed to bring the blaze under control as it swept towards
the village of Rapentosa, and a cemetery for German soldiers killed
during World War II.
	   But strong winds hampered firefighting efforts from the air,
local media reported, with planes unable to continue flights for
long.
	   No injuries due to the fire were reported. Blazes in the area in
past years have left much of the mountainside a landscape of
charred stumps.
	   Several other fires also raged around Greece, with a blaze on
the 2,900-meter (9,570-foot) Mount Olympus in northern Greece
entering its third week. The fire on the legendary home of the
ancient gods has destroyed 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) of forest
so far, local media reported.
	   Two weeks ago, three firefighters and a volunteer firefighter
were killed battling a blaze that scorched the eastern edge of
Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades, with fires burning daily for the past month.

British landmine expert killed in accident in Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Bailey in third graf, fixes coding

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A British landmine expert was killed in
Angola while demonstrating how to defuse a mine, the Foreign Office
in London said Monday.
	   Justin Bailey, 27, was training Angolans in how to make mined
areas safe as part of a program run by a non-governmental
organization called Norwegians Peoples Aid, Foreign Office
spokeswoman Clare Davies said by phone.
	   The accident happened July 28 and Bailey's body has since been
flown back to his home in Gloucester, west England, Davies said.
	   A estimated 10 to 14 million land mines were laid in Angola
during a two-decade-long civil war that pitted UNITA rebels against
government forces. An estimated 70,000 Angolans lost limbs from
land mine explosions.
	   Princess Diana, who died last year, had visited landmine victims
in Angola to publicize the devastation that these weapons can
cause.
	   The government and UNITA signed a tenuous peace deal in 1994. A
recent sharp rise in tension, including reports that new mines are
being laid, has triggered fears that the country may slide back
into war.
	   A top United Nations envoy arrived in the country Friday on an
emergency six-day peacemaking mission.

	   His comments followed harsh criticism by Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, who said Butler was ``serving the American policy'' by
trying to prolong punishing sanctions on Iraq.
	   Aziz said the U.N. Special Commission was ``back to its old
games, to its old tricks.''
	   The commission, which Butler heads, is responsible for ensuring
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as
required by U.N. resolutions that followed the 1991 Gulf War. The
comments by both sides followed some optimism that the two sides
were on track to ending the inspections, which began after the war.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.

Kirch challenges EU decision to bar its pay TV plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German media company Kirch is challenging
European Union regulators' decision to block its digital TV
alliance with competitor Bertelsmann in a lawsuit filed Monday at
the European Court.
	   Kirch said it planned to argue before the Luxembourg court that
the EU's approval process was unfair and that regulators had viewed
the proposal negatively from the start.
	   Kirch said EU regulators in Brussels relied on arguments of
potential competitors to block the plans without giving the
applicants enough access to those arguments.
	   Bertelsmann's subsidiary CLT-Ufa said it agreed generally with
Kirch's position but that wouldn't be worth it to join the lawsuit,
arguing that the court proceedings could take up to five years.
	   The European Union's executive agency decided in late May to bar
plans by Kirch and CLT-Ufa to merge their pay television
operations, saying the plan did not adequately guarantee an open
digital TV market in the long term.
	   Kirch launched Germany's first digital service in 1996 to much
fanfare, but people were reluctant to buy the expensive decoder
boxes necessary to receive it, and the unprofitable service has
attracted only 160,000 customers.
	   To keep DF1 going, Kirch wanted to merge it with Premiere,
CLT-Ufa's analog pay-TV service with 1.6 million subscribers. Kirch
and Bertelsmann would each then own 50 percent of Premiere.

Study links teen girls' pursuit of thinness with smoking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARA BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Most teenage girls who take up smoking do so to
lose weight, according to a study released Monday.
	   Past studies have shown a connection between young smokers and
eating disorders, but the new research is the first to directly
link teen girls' pursuit of thinness with smoking, said Lesley
Walker, head of science information for the Cancer Research
Campaign, which funded the study.
	   The researchers surveyed almost 2,800 girls in Britain and
Canada ranging in age from 11 to 18, 20 percent of whom smoked.
	   Most of the smokers said weight control was the principal reason
they took up the habit. More than 30 percent of them feared they
would eat more and put on weight if they tried to give up
cigarettes, researchers said.
	   Researchers also found that the girls who smoked were 30 percent
more likely than their non-smoking peers to be overweight and twice
as likely to be concerned about their bodies and to vomit
frequently after overeating.
	   Young girls are ``trading pounds off their weight for years off
their life,'' said Arthur Crisp, the professor at London's St.
George's Hospital Medical School who conducted the study.
	   The study, published in the Postgraduate Medical Journal, comes
at a time when the number of young female smokers continues to
grow. The most recent figures available from the Office of National
Statistics in England found that a quarter of girls aged 11 to 15
were occasional or regular smokers in 1996, up from 20 percent in
1982.
	   The researchers interviewed 1,936 girls in London and 832 in
Ottawa, Canada. Of the smokers, 15- and 16-year-olds were the most
likely to be puffing away.
	   The study also found that girls were three times more likely to
start smoking after beginning menstruation, when normal body
changes might be considered ``puppy fat'', said Ms. Walker, with
the Cancer Research Campaign, one of Britain's largest cancer
research charities.
	   Action on Smoking and Health, a British anti-smoking group,
blamed tobacco advertising for making smoking so attractive.
	   ``Cigarette ads don't show you images of smoke-filled rooms or
someone hacking away,'' Ash spokesman Phil Rimmer said. ``Instead,
you see wide-open spaces and glamorous, happy smokers.''
	   Crisp's research did not investigate whether girls were more
susceptible to tobacco advertising than other groups, but it did
conclude young women clearly identified smoking with thinness.
	   ``Sometimes you'd rather not publish these findings out of fear
it might encourage a few girls to take up the smoking habit or put
off others thinking about quitting,'' Ms. Walker said. ``But the
way to develop a body shape with which they feel comfortable is
exercise, not smoking.''

Vatican agency reports three priests arrested in Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Three priests working in Sudan were recently
arrested, including one who keeps contacts between Sudanese
authorities and the local church, a Vatican news agency said
Monday.
	   Fides, the news agency of the Vatican's missionary branch, said
there were fears for the safety of two priests of the priests whose
whereabouts were unknown.
	   According to Fides, the Revs. Lino Sebit, Hillary Boma and
William Nilo were arrested by Khartoum police and accused of having
participated in explosions June 30 in the capital.
	   Citing a communique from the Khartoum archdiocese, Fides said
that on July 28, 40 security and police officers entered a church
near Khartoum to arrest Sebit. The priest wasn't there but went the
next day to police and was arrested and was accused of the
explosions, according to Fides.
	   On Aug. 1, Fides said, 50 heavily armed security force members
barged into the premises of the archbishop's offices near Khartoum
cathedral, searched Boma's room and took away the priest, who keeps
contacts between government authories and the archbishop's office.
Nilo was arrested at the same time and released a few hours later.
	   Khartoum's Muslim fundamentalist-backed government is fighting a
war against rebels based in the mainly Christian and animist south.
Christians in Sudan have reported oppression by the government.
	   Fides said the arrests of the priests ``seem to be part of an
attempt to discredit the Sudanese Catholic church.''

Butler says disarmament talks with Iraq on verge of collapse

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Talks between Iraq and the United Nations
on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have reached an
impasse and may not resume, the chief U.N. inspector said Monday.
	   Richard Butler, speaking at the end of a second round of talks,
said Iraq turned down his proposal for a plan of action to end the
inspections that began after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``We did not make the progress I have hoped for,'' Butler told
reporters. ``I do not know whether we are going to meet tomorrow.''
	   His comments followed harsh criticism by Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, who said Butler was ``serving the American
policy'' by trying to prolong punishing sanctions on Iraq.
	   Aziz said the U.N. Special Commission was ``back to its old
games, to its old tricks.''
	   The commission, which Butler heads, is responsible for ensuring
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as
required by U.N. resolutions that followed the Gulf War.
	   The comments by both sides followed some optimism that they were
on track to ending the inspections. But after the two rounds of
talks Monday, the two sides seemed headed for a crisis.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.
	   Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's progress in
eliminating its weaponry and instead focusing on ``minor issues
which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq .... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   Neither Aziz nor Butler gave specifics on what was discussed
Monday, but the ``blueprint'' Butler presented the Iraqis during
his last visit in June calls for further disclosures about the
country's missile program and biological and chemical weaponry.
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said that the sanctions
must be lifted this year _ the first time he had set a deadline.
Iraq says the sanctions have caused widespread poverty,
malnutrition and illnesses among its 22 million people.
	   Butler was scheduled to remain in Baghdad until Wednesday.
	   Iraq's refusal to open presidential sites to U.N. inspectors
earlier this year brought the region to the brink of war.
	   The United States and Britain sent warplanes and ships to the
Gulf, threatening military action to force Iraq to cooperate. The
crisis was defused in February through an agreement negotiated by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

Thanks to IMF cash, Russia cancels bond auction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with government canceling weekly
auction, markets closing, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With its coffers temporarily filled by a loan from
the International Monetary Fund, Russia announced Monday that it
would not hold a government bond auction this week.
	   ``The ministry simply didn't announce an auction for this week
because it doesn't need the money,'' a Finance Ministry spokeswoman
said.
	   Yields on the benchmark one-year treasury bills, known as GKOs,
rose to between 75 percent and 78 percent on Monday, from 68
percent Friday.
	   Stocks closed at 145.64 points, down 2.7 percent from Friday's
close of 149.65 points. Volume was minute at dlrs 12.5 million,
down from dlrs 25.8 million Friday. The Russian ruble closed lower
against the dollar in slow trading as investors sold government
bonds.
	   The government announced Monday that it would sell off another 5
percent of the country's largest company, Gazprom, in order to
raise much-needed cash.
	   The sale would reduce the government's share in the company from
40 percent to 35 percent, and could bring protests from Communist
lawmakers who oppose the sale of many state assets.
	   With nearly 400,000 employees, Gazprom controls production and
distribution of Russia's vast natural gas supplies and is one of
Western Europe's largest suppliers.
	   The gas monopoly is revered as a symbol of national strength,
but the government has targeted Gazprom recently as part of a drive
to get companies to pay overdue taxes.
	   The results of the tender, which will be open to foreigners,
will be announced in September, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   In other economic developments Monday:
	   _ Two oil companies that are behind in their tax payments will
have reduced access to the country's oil export pipeline. The
Sidanko and Onako oil companies will have their monthly exports
reduced by one-third until they pay their taxes, the Interfax news
agency said. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes is
one of its most serious problems.
	   _ The Finance Ministry may issue dlrs 2 billion in Eurobonds
later this year, but emphasized it would wait until ``market
conditions allow the lowest costs.'' Russia is under less pressure
to sell the bonds now because of recent infusions of cash from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   _ President Boris Yeltsin promised to pay all back wages to the
military by early September, ITAR-Tass reported. Soldiers, like
many people are paid by the state, often receive their salaries
months late. The president has frequently pledged to pay wage
arrears, but the government often lacks the money to deliver.

Russian president gives formal approval of new military plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin formally inaugurated a new
era for the Russian armed forces on Monday, signing a document
outlining the principles of a new, leaner military.
	   ``This is the first time in Russian history we have laid out the
fundamental principles of Russia's policy in the field of military
development,'' said Andrei Kokoshin, secretary of the Security
Council, which helped draft the new strategy.
	   The principles in the so-called ``military concept'' have been
publicly debated for months.
	   The main goal is to shrink and professionalize Russia's
inefficient conscript army. Personnel will be cut by 500,000
soldiers, leaving Russia with a 1.2 million-man army by 2005.
	   The strategy also calls for streamlining Russia's command
structure and developing new, less expensive weapons systems,
including nuclear weapons.
	   The plan has been in the works since May 1997, when Yeltsin
appointed Gen. Igor Sergeyev as defense minister and charged him
with reforming Russia's military to bring it in line with current
needs and resources.

patrolled Kinshasa's rutted streets on Monday in search of
allied-turned-enemy Rwandan mercenaries who are suspected of
plotting against the government.
	   The capital awoke to the sound of gunfire as rival soldiers
clashed inside their base compounds in the city's west end. A

Congo, military officers appeared to be in open revolt against
Kabila.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi security forces have captured two of
the five men involved in the shooting that seriously wounded
President Saddam Hussein's oldest son in 1996, the government said
Monday.
	   The two men who were arrested carried out the actual attack on
Odai Hussein, the General Directorate of Security said in a
statement carried by Iraq television. The three others still at
large provided cover and support, the directorate said.
	   The statement accused a ``neighboring foreign country'' of
masterminding the attack but stopped short of naming the country.
Odai, in an interview from his hospital bed after the attack, had
pointed the finger at Iran, which has denied any involvement.
	   ``The organs of a foreign neighboring country have been involved
in this treacherous operation,'' the statement said.
	   The names of the two men were released, but the statement did
not give their background or say when they were arrested. It said
two of the three men at large are hiding in a neighboring country.
	   Odai, 34, was shot about 10 times on Dec. 12, 1996, while he
waited alone in his car in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood.
	   In April 1997, surgeons operated on his shattered left leg. He
has since been shown on television walking with the aid of a cane.
	   Two opposition groups claimed responsibility for the attack: the
Iranian-backed Al-Dawa Party, a Shiite opposition group, and the
Mohammed Madhlum al-Dulaimi Group, named after an Iraqi air force
general executed for plotting against Saddam.

Talks between Italian and South Korean groups break down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Talks between South Korean Daewoo Group and Italy's
state-owned engineering group Finmeccanica SpA aimed at setting up
a joint venture involving energy and transport unit Ansaldo SpA,
have broken down, Finmeccanica said Monday.
	   Italy's giant state-holding company Istituto per la
Ricostruzione Industriale SpA, which controls Finmeccanica, and
Daewoo had been negotiating since late last year.
	   IRI chairman Gian Maria Gros-Pietro said in July that the
success of a deal would depend on the completion of Ansaldo's
restructuring plan, which involved around 2,000 job cuts. According
to industry sources, Daewoo had wanted more money put into Ansaldo
as part of the deal.
	   Finmeccanica said the talks ended because of ``different views
regarding the financial structure at the basis of the planned
global joint venture.''
	   The joint venture would have involved fields of power
generation, industry automation and transport, Finmeccanica said.

Rebel attacks in western Uganda should not affect cobalt project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The insurgency in western Uganda
shouldn't prevent a dlrs 110 million cobalt project from concluding
construction in November, an official at the project told Dow Jones
Newswires Monday.
	   J.C. Coudere, a senior official at Kasese Cobalt Company Ltd.
(KCCL), said the two-year-old insurgency near the project site in
Kasese, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Kampala, has had little
effect on operations. He said the plant should be finished in
November if the insurgency doesn't escalate.
	   Construction of the plant started in August last year. He said
KCCL plans to commence the export of cobalt cathode in March next
year.
	   Allied Democratic Front rebels raided Kasese and nearby Kilembe
on Saturday and Sunday, killing at least 35 people, reports said.
	   ``We are still on schedule, construction of the plant is
continuing, and we expect to conclude it in November,'' said
Coudere by telephone. ``None of our workers nor contractors have
left the site. I talked to them this morning and they are all at

Romanian premier: Romania willing to return property to Jews

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile, who is
visiting Israel, said Monday he would push legislation to return to
Jews and others property that was stolen during and after World War
II.
	   Vasile said that the legislation, which he intends to introduce
in Parliament next month, would be open only to Romanian citizens.
	   ``The bill presents a global solution for Romania to return
property to all former owners, not only Jews,'' said Vasile, who
arrived Sunday for a four-day visit to Israel.
	   Vasile met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday
afternoon. Netanyahu described his meeting with Vasile as
``excellent,'' and praised the Romanian premier's sensitivity
towards Jews.
	   Meanwhile, in Bucharest, Romania's capital, a committee to
return Jewish property met Monday for a second time.
	   About 400,000 Jews _ half Romania's Jewish population at the
time _ died in World War II, when Romania was allied with Nazi
Germany.
	   After the war, the communist government inherited Jewish
property stolen by the Nazis, and Jewish organizations say the
government then confiscated even more.
	   Although only 12,000 Jews are left in Romania, Romanian Jews
living outside the country are expected to apply for lost property
as well, Romania's Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said.
	   Naftali Lavi, vice-chairman of the World Jewish Restitution
Organization, said several thousand public properties and perhaps
hundreds of thousands of private properties owned by Jews were
seized by the Nazis and the communists.
	   ``We were singled out for the confiscation of our property,''
Lavi said. ``Therefore we have to be singled out for restitution as
well.''
	   Vasile said five houses belonging to Jews had been returned to
their owners this year, and that three or four more would be
returned soon.
	   Romania's president, Emil Constantinescu, won praise from
Romanian Jewish leaders last year for publicly acknowledging the
country's complicity in the Holocaust.
	   Also on Monday, Israel and Romania pledged to work toward a
free-trade agreement between their countries, and to increase
trade, which stands at about dlrs 250 million a year.

Teen dies from burns, raising death toll in Moscow blast to seven
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A severely burned 17-year-old girl died Monday
from her wounds, bringing the death toll in an apartment gas
explosion to seven, a news agency reported.
	   A column of apartments in a 10-story building in eastern Moscow
was demolished from top to bottom by the explosion on July 29.
	   Rescuers pulled nine people from the rubble, but only three were
alive. The dead included a child and a couple engaged to be
married, officials and neighbors said.
	   The latest victim had been burned over 90 percent of her body,
and doctors had given her little chance of survival, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Officials have said the explosion was caused by negligence by a
tenant in the third-floor apartment, who died in the blast.

Polish government stays out of Auschwitz cross controversy

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ New crosses erected outside Auschwitz have
deepened the dispute over religious symbols at the infamous Nazi
death camp, but Poland's government said Monday it has no intention
of getting caught up in the controversy.
	   In the past week, Roman Catholics, many linked to a conservative
radio station, have erected 50 smaller crosses around a
26-foot-tall (eight-meter-tall) cross put up a decade ago. And over
the weekend, a nationalist movement in Silesia erected another
cross, this one 10 feet (three meters ) tall.
	   The crosses have angered Jewish organizations, who want them
removed. But Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said Monday the
government would leave the matter to proper authorities, meaning
the Roman Catholic church in Poland.
	   ``The Polish government hopes that the cross in Poland will
always be a uniting symbol and will not be used for political
manifestations,'' he said.
	   Local Archbishop Damian Zimon said placing more crosses at
Auschwitz was ``unnecessary manipulation.'' But he didn't say if
the church would remove them.
	   Church officials say they have no plans to make any decision on
the matter in the near future.
	   Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial on Sunday called the
crosses a provocation that should be removed, warning they ``may
prevent further dialogue between the sides about the future of the
site.''
	   The dispute over crosses near the camp began in 1988, when the
largest one was erected to commemorate a 1979 Mass in the area
celebrated by Pope John Paul II, who is Polish. It is outside
Auschwitz, on neighboring land that used to be a Carmelite
cloister.
	   Jewish organizations complain that the cross, which is visible
from the former death camp, violates the memory of Jews who died at
Auschwitz.
	   Many Poles consider the large cross _ located where 152 Nazi
resisters were murdered in 1941 _ a symbol of the nation's
martyrdom under German occupation.
	   The government took over the grounds of the former Carmelite
cloister in March, but the land continues to be rented to a war
victims' group.

English-speaking Caribbean has 250 people on death row, group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The English-speaking Caribbean now has 250
people on death row and a population of about 5 million _ one of
the highest death-sentence rates in the world, the human rights
group Amnesty International says.
	   Trinidad and Tobago accounts for 104 of the cases, the group
said in a report released Monday. Jamaica is next with 47 cases,
the Bahamas has 40, Guyana has 24 and Belize has nine.
	   There are 26 people on death row in Barbados and the countries
that make up the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States _ Antigua
and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
	   The death row rate is almost four times that of the United
States, which has 260 million people and 3,300 convicts awaiting
execution, the group said.
	   Britain and international human rights groups have been
pressuring former British colonies to eliminate the death penalty.
Caribbean countries have resisted, saying capital punishment helps
deter crime caused by drug traffic through the region.
	   The countries are planning to create a regional supreme court to
replace the British Privy Council, which serves as the final court
of appeal for the former colonies and has moved to limit
executions.

What if the Titanic sunk today? Imagine the lawsuits
</HEADLINE>

verdict &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ If the Titanic went down today, what a gargantuan
lawsuit there would be. Women and children first, indeed! That
alone could trigger wrongful death suits based on a
sex-discrimination claim.
	   Lawyers at the American Bar Association's annual meeting showed
off their legal skills Monday with a day-long trial of a fictional
lawsuit over the great ship's 1912 sinking after it struck an
iceberg.
	   ``You would not want a ship ... to wait until it was literally
on top of an iceberg to take evasive action, would you?'' real-life
lawyer Emmanuel E. Edem of Oklahoma City asked a woman portraying a
survivor of the tragedy.
	   The fictional character, named Rhoda Abbott, claimed the ship
was unsafely built and operated _ brittle rivets, not easily
maneuverable, not enough lifeboats and a lookout crew without even
a pair of binoculars.
	   The fictional Mrs. Abbott sued the ship's manufacturer,
Harland-and-Wolfe.
	   And then there was the women-and-children-first policy. The
woman and her teenage sons survived but her husband didn't, and
thus she said she planned to file a whole new lawsuit against the
ship's owner, White Star Line, based on sex discrimination.
	   The ABA event was conducted as if modern product-liability laws,
legal skills and courtroom technology had been transported back to
the time of the Titanic.
	   Photos of the ship and blowups of White Star Line document were
projected onto large screens to help the audience _ acting as the
jury _ understand the lawyers' arguments and questioning of
witnesses.
	   Even some of the lawyers themselves _ women and blacks _ likely
would not have been seen in a courtroom back then.
	   ``It's an opportunity to see how the best lawyers present the
most complicated cases,'' said Robert H. Alexander of Oklahoma
City, the lawyer who chaired the program. ``It gives a framework
for appreciating how much the law has changed in the years since
Titanic.''
	   The true-life lawsuits over the Titanic's sinking were settled
without coming to trial. The largest American settlement was dlrs
5,000 to a well-to-do family, while the largest British settlement
was dlrs 50,000 to a large company, Alexander said.
	   These days, the claims would be in the millions.
	   Edem closely questioned the fictional survivor about whether she
would have set foot on the ship if she knew of the structural
defects she now claimed were partly responsible for her husband's
death.
	   But attorney Chilton Davis Varner of Atlanta, representing the
ship's manufacturer, asked a series of questions designed to show
the real problem was White Star Line's operation of the ship and
actions after it struck the iceberg.
	   The ship's owners overruled the manufacturer's recommendation to
install enough lifeboats for the 2,000-plus passengers, she said,
displaying documents to back her statements up.
	   And the ship did take almost three hours to sink, Varner said.
	   ``Harland-and-Wolfe provided almost three hours of time during
which, had there been sufficient lifeboats and sufficient training,
you and your family might have escaped,'' she said.

Butler says disarmament talks with Iraq on verge of collapse

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Talks between Iraq and the United Nations
on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have reached an
impasse and may not resume, the chief U.N. inspector said Monday.
	   Richard Butler, speaking at the end of a second round of talks,
said Iraq turned down his proposal for a plan of action to end the
inspections that began after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``We did not make the progress I have hoped for,'' Butler told
reporters. ``I do not know whether we are going to meet tomorrow.''
	   His comments followed harsh criticism by Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, who said Butler was ``serving the American
policy'' by trying to prolong punishing sanctions on Iraq.
	   Aziz said Iraq has no remaining weapons of mass destruction. ``I
asked Mr. Butler to tell the Security Council the truth,'' he said
after the evening talks, which lasted about two hours.
	   Aziz said he rejected Butler's new plan as useless ``if you
(Butler) are going to repeat the same tricks and the same games.''
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which Butler heads, is responsible
for ensuring that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions after the Gulf War.
	   Until Monday, there was some optimism that the two sides were on
track to ending the inspections.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.
	   Neither Aziz nor Butler gave specifics on what was discussed
Monday, but the ``blueprint'' Butler presented the Iraqis during
his last visit in June calls for further disclosures about the
country's missile program and biological and chemical weaponry.
	   Earlier, Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's
progress in eliminating its weaponry and instead focusing on
``minor issues which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said that the sanctions
must be lifted this year _ the first time he had set a deadline.
Iraq says the sanctions have caused widespread poverty,
malnutrition and illnesses among its 22 million people.
	   Butler was scheduled to remain in Baghdad until Wednesday.
	   Iraq's refusal to open presidential sites to U.N. inspectors
earlier this year brought the region to the brink of war.
	   The United States and Britain sent warplanes and ships to the
Gulf, threatening military action to force Iraq to cooperate. The
crisis was defused in February through an agreement negotiated by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

U.N. planning aid workers evacuation from northern Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is planning the
evacuation of aid workers in northern Afghanistan after renewed
fighting there, officials said Monday.
	   U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said that the United Nations
was studying plans to evacuate workers for 11 organizations based
in Mazar-e-Sharif, where the opposition to the Taliban militia is
based.
	   The largest group based in the city is Medecins Sans Frontiers,
the French medical assistance program, Brandt told reporters at
U.N. headquarters in New York. He did not say how many aid workers
were based there altogether.
	   Taliban troops closed in on the major opposition stronghold on
Monday, a day after they captured a nearby town.
	   Opposition leaders promised heavy resistance, although it was
not clear whether the Taliban intended to press ahead into the
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Taliban fighters briefly held the city last May, retreating
after street battles that left several hundred Taliban soldiers
dead. It is believed as many as 2,000 Taliban prisoners of war were
later massacred.
	   Aid workers were caught by surprise during that battle and were
forced to remain in the city during heavy fighting.
	   Taliban leaders have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
the 85 percent of Afghanistan they control. Since capturing Kabul
in 1996, Taliban officials have barred girls from school and
confined most women to their homes.

Serbs press attacks in Kosovo after vowing that offensive is over

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sweeping Serb military attacks on
ethnic Albanian rebels have created a refugee population that puts
Kosovo province ``on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe,''
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Monday.
	   With tens of thousands of refugees living in the woods or in
isolated villages without food or water, Hill said it was essential
that the international community be allowed to help people safely
return to their homes.
	   Weekend Serb attacks on villages lining roads in Kosovo came
just days after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic vowed that
his military push against the successionist Kosovo Liberation Army
had stopped.
	   Milosevic also promised last week to ``personally guarantee''
access for refugee agencies trying to bring aid to displaced ethnic
Albanian civilians. Nevertheless, U.N. refugee official Mons Nyber
said Monday that access had been ``on and off.'' Serb police
blocked aid workers this weekend, or held them for hours at
checkpoints before allowing them to pass.
	   In Geneva, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, Kris Janowski, said the fighting had so disrupted
transport and communications that ``we are back to square one,''
unable to reach pockets of refugees. The agency estimated that at
least 50,000 people fled the weekend fighting, swelling the number
of refugees to 200,000 since the government launched its crackdown
on Albanian militants in March.
	   U.S. envoy Hill has proposed that diplomatic monitors be allowed
to escort refugees back to their homes, saying it was necessary to
show ethnic Albanian civilians that the international community
supports them. Milosevic has agreed to the plan, but some diplomats
question whether he actually would permit it.
	   Widespread Serb shelling continued Monday in Kosovo province,
part of the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia. Ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, which has been under
Serb control since Milosevic yanked its autonomy in 1989.
	   In the past two weeks, Serb forces have driven the KLA from two
strategic roads and the major rebel enclave of Malisevo. But most
of the current fighting was isolating the KLA in the Drenica
region, a hotbed of ethnic Albanian extremism. More refugees were
on the run in the Drenica hills on Monday.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said six villages had been destroyed.
With bulldozers, Serb forces removed KLA roadblocks to reopen the
road between Klina and Srbica. Serb military sources said police
entered Smonica early Monday, after troops had been shelling the
Albanian border village for days. The fighting killed at least a
dozen KLA fighters, the military said.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued to lay siege to the
border village of Junik, a key rebel stronghold. Independent media
in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade said most KLA fighters had fled
the village for rebel sanctuaries in Albania, leaving a few dozen
insurgents who have encircled their positions with landminds.
	   Red Cross spokeswoman Amanda Williamson said in Geneva that a
team found between 60,000 to 80,000 refugees hiding on the slopes
of Mt. Berisa south of Pristina, Kosovo's capital. She said the Red
Cross was trying to organize an aid convoy from Belgrade.
	   The U.N. refugee agency also was planning a convoy Tuesday or
Wednesday for ethnic Albanians in villages near Malisevo. Many of
those refugees had fled villages destroyed by Serb shells. Dozens
of refugees this weekend described Serb forces systematically
busing down houses after residents had fled.
	   In Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party accused
the Serb-led Yugoslav government of trying ``to make it impossible
for thousands of Albanians to return to their homes.''
	   But a senior diplomat questioned assertions that the Serb
campaign against Albanian civilians was reminiscent of ``ethnic
cleating,'' the forcible removal of rival ethnicities that marked
conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Croatia
earlier this decade.
	   The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it
appeared that Serbs were clearing only those villages near key
roads that the KLA had blocked in recent months. He also said the
Serbs were likely to insist they had indeed ceased their military
attacks, and that police forces were merely securing their hold on
former KLA territory.
	   KLA leaders were expected to announce this week whether they
will accept a U.S. plan to join Albanian politicians in peace
negotiations with Milosevic. While rebels and politicians share a
goal for independence, politicians say they would accept autonomy
as a first step.
	   Rebels have so far opposed this plan, and the current Serb
offensive appears designed to deliver a strong blow against the
rebels and force them to negotiate from a position of weakness.
	   Milosevic has offered only to restore Kosovo's autonomy, and
major world powers also oppose independence for the province. The
United States and European nations fear independence could lead to
demands by Albanian speaking communities in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, to establish a ``greater
Albania'' in the southern Balkans.

U.N. probe wraps up; violence during visit leaves 69 dead

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A U.N. mission investigating a Muslim
insurgency met with President Liamine Zeroual as it wrapped up its
visit Monday, while officials reported a massacre that left at
least 12 more civilians dead.
	   The latest killings blamed on Muslim militants brought to 69 the
number of civilians who died since the U.N. mission arrived nearly
two weeks ago.
	   In the attack Sunday afternoon, armed men in military fatigues
stopped a bus at a fake roadblock, then slit the throats of
passengers and the driver, authorities said.
	   Army troops killed at least a dozen suspected Islamic militants
after the massacre that also left six civilians wounded near Saida,
400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Algiers, authorities said
in a statement.
	   It was the kind of attack the U.N. panel was trying to get to
the bottom of, looking into massacres and bombings that have killed
an estimated 75,000 people in this petroleum-rich nation since
1992.
	   There were no immediate details from the six-member panel's
meeting with Zeroual.
	   ``The panel is particularly appreciative of the government and
the people of Algeria,'' a U.N. statement said, adding the mission
would leave for Lisbon on Tuesday.
	   The U.N. panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares,
on Monday released a list of dozens of people it met with,
including government ministers, political leaders, generals,
newspaper editors, human rights activists and victims' families.
	   It visited Serkadji, the main prison in Algiers, as well as two
massacre sites and spoke with survivors. It met with three lawyers
from the banned Islamic Salvation Front.
	   In the meantime, the panel remained tight-lipped, though sources
close to the mission said they asked tough questions about how the
government was protecting civilians. The government has been
accused of failing to prevent the massacres, and rights groups say
the army is responsible for the disappearances of thousands of
people.
	   While the Algerian government had granted the group more freedom
than to previous foreign delegations, it worried about the results
of the probe.
	   The U.N. investigation could ``free the terrorists of guilt,
while they themselves admit to their odious crimes and claim
them,'' the official Algerian Press Agency APS said.
	   Accompanying Soares on the mission were former U.S. ambassador
to the U.N. Donald McHenry; former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral; former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti;
Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako; and former French Health
Minister Simone Veil.
	   The insurgency began after the army-backed government canceled
parliamentary elections in January 1992 that the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win.

Caspian oil pipeline consortium submits feasibility study
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Caspian Pipeline Consortium has submitted the
a feasibility study to local Russian authorities, seeking their
approval for construction of an oil pipeline, the consortium said
Monday.
	   The plan for the 1,580-kilometer (980-mile) pipeline from the
vast Tengiz field in Kazakstan to the Russian port of Novorossiisk
also needs approval from Russian federal authorities, the
consortium said in a press release.
	   ``We are certain that the committees will approve the drafts,''
said Natalya Prutkovskaya, a consortium spokeswoman. ``All the
principal issues have been agreed.''
	   Construction of the pipeline should start either late this year
or at the beginning of 1999, Prutkovskaya said. The pipeline is
expected to begin operations some time in 2001.
	   The building of the dlrs 2 billion artery has been delayed
because of bureaucratic wrangling over permits and disputes over
funding within the consortium.
	   The planned capacity of the pipeline is 67 million metric tons a
year.
	   The CPC is half-owned by the governments of Russia, Kazakstan
and Oman. The remaining stake is held by a group of international
oil companies, including Chevron Corp., LUKARCO (a partnership of
Lukoil and U.S.-based Arco), Rosneft-Shell, the U.K.'s BG PLC,
Mobil, Italy's Agip, Oryx and Kazakstan Pipeline Ventures LLC.

At least seven people die in building collapse
</HEADLINE>

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A seven-story building collapsed in a
Bombay suburb on Monday, killing at least seven people, a local
government official said.
	   Another 13 people were rescued by police and fire brigade, said
Shridhar Joshi, additional municipal commissioner. The building was
nearly 20 years old.
	   ``There was a huge thud and the structure came crashing down,''
said Vishveshwar, who uses one name, when reached by phone. He
lives in a nearby building.
	   Up to 35 people were feared trapped under the debris which was
being cleared by rescue workers, police said.
	   Many residents were at work when the building collapsed,
Vishveshwar said. The Govind Tower in congested northwest Bombay,
India's financial capital, comprises shops, a hotel and apartments.
	   Residents said they had complained to local authorities five
months ago about the structural defects in the building which
appeared to be leaning to one side. But nothing was done.
	   ``See what has happened,'' said Bal Sawant, a local lawmaker.
	   Rescuers already have found seven bodies, Sawant said.
	   Poor construction and maintenance have led to the collapse of
several buildings in Bombay in recent years.

Angolan government assures U.N. it is committed to peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; by CASIMIRO SIONA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan president assured a senior
U.N. envoy on Monday that his government was committed to peace
despite signs that the country is sliding back into civil war.
	   ``The president and the government reaffirmed their commitment
to the full implementation of the 1994 peace accord,'' U.N. envoy
Lakhdar Brahimi told reporters after meeting with President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos in the Angolan capital.
	   Brahimi arrived in Luanda Friday on an emergency mission
prompted by a recent escalation of tension, including the massacre
of 100 civilians in a remote northern village and reported military
buildup on both sides.
	   He spent the weekend conferring with western diplomats and U.N.
officials before his Monday meeting with Dos Santos.
	   The envoy's agenda for Tuesday is dominated by talks with Jonas
Savimbi _ the leader of the former UNITA rebel movement and the
other main figure in the simmering conflict.
	   A U.N.-brokered accord signed in 1994 sealed a tenuous end to a
two-decade-long war between the government and UNITA rebels that
was fueled by Cold War geopolitics.
	   But successive deadlines for full implementation of the
agreement have passed unheeded, and in recent weeks the entire
peace process has appeared in danger of collapse.
	   After his talks with Dos Santos Monday, Brahimi met with
government officials and UNITA representatives on the Joint
Commission that was formed to monitor implementation of the peace
accord.
	   The commission includes representatives from the government,
UNITA, the U.N. and diplomats from United States, Russia and
Portugal.
	   ``We felt great openness from the United Nations but we will
only be able to draw conclusions after tomorrow,'' when Brahimi has
met Savimbi, UNITA representative Haracio Junjuvili said after
meeting the envoy.
	   Brahimi was due to travel Tuesday morning by air to meet Savimbi
at his highland stronghold 480 kilometers (300 miles) north of the
capital of this former Portuguese colony.
	   UNITA's reluctance to relinquish its rural strongholds in
compliance with the 1994 accord has triggered harsh U.N. sanctions.
Savimbi has refused to move his base to the capital for personal
security reasons.
	   The government has also accused UNITA of not fully demobilizing
its 70,000-strong guerrilla army and maintaining troops hidden in
the bush.
	   But in recent weeks the government, as well as UNITA, have been
accused of preparing for another war with forced recruitment drives
in this immense southwest African country.
	   Junjuvili denied reports that UNITA had hired over 300
mercenaries from the South African company Executive Outcomes.
	   ``There are no mercenaries on UNITA's side'' he said.

Actors covered with bull's blood in artistic happening

<TEXT>
	   PRINZENDORF, Austria (AP) _ Naked people strapped to crosses
were spattered with the blood of a freshly slaughtered bull Monday
to mark the beginning of a six-day event conceived by Austrian
artist Hermann Nitsch.
	   Nitsch, a self-described action painter whose works are on
display in art galleries around the world, said he planned the
spectacle to show the range of human experience from happiness to
cruelty and ``bestial destructiveness.''
	   The show was staged at Nitsch's castle outside this small
village, some 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Vienna.
	   About 200 paying spectators watched 100 actors and 180
musicians, including two Czech brass bands, perform from the
1,595-page script of the ``Orgy Mystery Theater'' festival.
	   The script calls for body painting, the display of thousands of
flowers and chamber music played under chestnut trees in a park. It
also features Gregorian chants and boozy scenes with 13,000 liters
(3,500 U.S. gallons) of wine.
	   The performance began with a cacaphony of earsplitting rattles,
coach whistles, bass drums and other instruments as three
professional butchers slaughtered and skinned the bull at dawn
Monday.
	   After being hoisted on a wall in the large castle courtyard, the
bull was disemboweled with the help of the actors.
	   About 10 white-clad actors rubbed animal bowels and other organs
against the dead bull, while some of them soaked everyone with the
animal's blood.
	   Several blindfolded, naked men and women, strapped to wooden
crosses, were carried to the scene and covered with blood.
	   A handful of protesters who blocked some cars from reaching
Nitsch's castle held up a streamer saying: ``The animals' dignity
is untouchable.'' The spectacle has also been condemned by Roman
Catholic bishops, right-wing politicians, a Vienna tabloid and
animal rights activists.

Italy upsets Yugoslavia; Lithuania clinches quarterfinals

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Italy beating Yugoslavia, Australia over Brazil;

	   ATHENS Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, favorites to win this World
Championship, fell from the unbeaten ranks as Italy shocked the
European champions 61-60 Monday in a second-round game.
	   However, Yugoslavia (4-1) along with Lithuania, Greece and Spain
are assured of reaching Friday's quarterfinals with four more
places up for grabs.
	   The loss was the first major shock of this week-old championship
and avenged a Yugoslavia victory over Italy last year in the final
of European championship.
	   It was also Italy's first victory over Yugoslavia in a major
tournament since the 1984 Olympics, when they won 74-61.
	   Italy (3-2) can thank Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka for the
victory as he led the winners with 16 points and hit the two
clinching free throws to put Italy ahead for the final time.
	   Yugoslavia had two shots at the end to win, but Milenko Topic's
shot in the lane with 2.5 seconds left bounded off the rim and
Sasha Obradovic missed from further out at the buzzer.
	   The Italians, who forced the usually tidy Yugoslav into 20
turnovers, will face Puerto Rico Tuesday with a quarerfinal berth
on the line.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two Olympics, booked its
place in the quarterfinals with a second-round victory over
Argentina 84-75.
	   Lithuania (4-1) led Argentina (2-3) almost from the start and
was up 41-33 at halftime and then pulled away. Salulis Stombergas
had 19 to lead the Lithuanians with 14 from Darius Lukminas. The
team's top scorer in the tournament _ Arturas Karnisovas had 11.
	   ``Because they paid so much attention to me, I had to distribute
the ball instead of shooting it,'' the former Seton Hall star said.
``We kept going to Stombergas because they couldn't stop him one on
one. He was too quick.''
	   Argentina, which had two players foul out _ Alejandro Montecchia
and Juan Ignacio Sanchez _ was topped by Juan Alberto Espil with
18.
	   Australia (3-2) improved it chances of reaching the
quarterfinals with a 75-63 come-from-behind victory over Brazil
(1-4) and will face the United States Tuesday in final
qualification-round game.
	   Australia trailed 35-31 at halftime, out-scored Brazil 15-4 in
the first four minutes of the second half, taking a 46-39 lead at
15:59 on a 3-pointer by Andrew Gaze. Gaze was held scoreless in the
first half but finished with 16 behind Paul Rogers' 20.
	   Rogerio Klafke topped Brazil with 15.
	   Puerto Rico (2-3) also stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth
with a 94-81 victory over Canada (1-4).
	   Eddie Casiano topped Puerto Rico with 23 and Jose Ortiz added 15
and 10 rebounds. The Canadians were led by Greg Newton with 25
points and eight rebounds.
	   ``This is the first time we have been able to play the game we
are capable of playing,'' said Puerto Rico coach Carlos Morales.
``We are small so we go hard for the boards and try to penetrate
and shoot from the outside.''
	   Russia (3-1) and the United States (3-1) played late Monday but
looked the most likely to reach the final eight with the last two
places up for grabs among Italy, Argentina, Puerto Rico and
Australia. The United States faced Spain (4-0) and home-favortie
Greece (4-0) played Russia.
	   In games to determine 13th to 16th place, Nigeria claimed 13th
with a 70-60 victory over Japan. Senegal finished 15th, beating
South Korea 75-72.

6-3, 6-4 and Slovakian No. 7 Dominik Hrbaty downed Belgium Filip
Dewulf, 6-3, 7-5.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Rescue teams searching for 10 men buried
last month in an Austrian mine have shifted the focus of their
efforts from saving survivors to retrieving bodies, officials said
Monday.
	   ``We won't give up hope,'' said Alfred Zechling, spokesman of
the rescue team in the mining village of Lassing, 190 kilometers
(120 miles) southwest of Vienna. But he also made clear there was
little hope any survivors would be found.
	   The decision to change tactics came after cameras and
microphones lowered into an emergency shaft failed to detect signs
of life in a chamber where it was hoped some of the men were able
to survive.
	   Relatives of the missing and residents of Lassing were depressed
at the news, and asked the rescue teams not to ease up on their
search, ``even if only to retrieve the dead,'' the Austrian Press
Agency reported.
	   The 10 were sent into a talc mine in Lassing on July 17 to
rescue miner Georg Hainzl, who was buried in a massive landslide
unleashed by torrential rains. But a second, larger landslide
trapped the nine miners and one geologist.
	   Talc is a soft mineral that is refined into talcum powder and
lubricants.
	   Rescue efforts intensified after Hainzl was found alive and in
relatively good condition July 26. He had taken refuge in another
chamber closer to the surface.
	   The only remaining hope is a series of other air pockets that
have been detected from the surface, where the miners might have a
chance of surviving because there would be enough oxygen. Boring
through to them, however, will be a long, slow ordeal, as they are
located under the original stone surrounding the mine.

	   REIMS, France (AP) _ A day after the Tour de France ended in
Paris, members of the Dutch team TVM were questioned by police
Monday about banned drugs found in their possession.
	   TVM team members had pulled out of the race on Friday, two days
before the ending, saying they had neither the physical nor the
mental strength to continue.
	   Six cyclists, along with other team staff members, were
questioned Monday morning in Reims, north of Paris. Already the
team director, Cees Priem, and its doctor, Andrei Mikhailov, and a
masseur have been placed under formal investigation _ a step short
of being formally charged _ on doping charges.
	   Team official Guido Calster emerged early afternoon after being
questioned, and said the team had been ``treated well.'' He said
they were being asked ``personal questions.''
	   By late Monday evening, all but a trainer remained in custody.
But he, too, was expected to be released, said Jacoba de Jong, the
team's lawyer.
	   De Jong said everyone questioned Monday said they were innocent
of any possible doping charges. She said they were not asked about
the results of drug tests, which would take several weeks.
	   ``They were heard as witnesses,'' she told reporters. ``They
fear nothing, or they wouldn't have come. They have nothing to
hide.''

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ One is the son of a former
president, an ex-senator and television mogul. The other a local
businessman who never entered politics until this year.
	   Both Miguel Aleman and Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez scored
impressive victories in gubernatorial elections Sunday that were
crucial for their parties' chances in Mexico's 2000 presidential
election. Their successes show how much Mexico has changed _ and
how much it hasn't.
	   In what was expected to be a tight race, Gonzalez, of the
center-right National Action Party, won easily in the small central
state of Aguascalientes.
	   With 80 percent of the vote counted, Gonzalez had 53 percent of
the vote, according to state electoral council figures. Hector Hugo
Olivares Ventura of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI, had 36 percent.
	   The win was a huge boost to National Action. The party, known as
the PAN, lost one of its six gubernatorial seats when it was
defeated by the PRI in last month's election in Chihuahua.
Aguascalientes was seen as the PAN's best chance to make up for the
defeat.
	   Until recent years, a political novice like Gonzalez would never
have been able to defeat a candidate like Olivares, a former
senator and federal deputy whose family has long been a political
force. For most of its 69-year history, the PRI has dominated
Mexican politics, using patronage, strong-arm tactics and cheating
to crush opponents.
	   But reforms in recent years have made elections more
competitive. The Aguascalientes elections were seen as generally
fair and open.
	   ``The results of the elections in Aguascalientes are very
encouraging to the PAN,'' the party's national executive committee
said in a statement in Mexico City. ``They contribute to the
democratic process that Mexico is undergoing, to which we are fully
committed.''
	   ``For the first time we are seeing elections that are closer to
an ideal, that each day are more credible, that are now beginning
to show a respect for the will of society,'' Gonzalez said in an
interview last week.
	   In a news conference Monday, Olivares acknowledged defeat, but
said his party will bounce back.
	   ``In democracy, you win or you lose, but you don't keep winning
or losing forever,'' he said.
	   In the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, the PRI effectively
trampled over the opposition _ just as it did in its glory years.
With 98 percent of the vote tallied, Aleman had 49 percent. Luis
Pazos of National Action finished second with 27 percent.
	   Veracruz has long been a PRI stronghold, but until a few months
ago, the party was in danger of losing there. It suffered heavy
losses in last year's municipal elections and was hurt by internal
disputes. A defeat there would have devastated the PRI: Veracruz is
Mexico's third largest electorate and could prove crucial in
presidential ballotng.
	   In selecting Aleman, the PRI found someone the whole party could
support. His name _ the same as his father's _ was a huge
advantage. In Veracruz, his business success raised hopes that he
could lure businesses to the state, one of the nation's poorest.
	   Traditional bastions of PRI support such as unions and
agricultural organizations rallied around him. Critics said the
party's heavy spending and media domination gave him an unfair
advantage.
	   Aleman was also helped by divisions in the center-left
Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD. The party decided against a
PRI defector, former attorney general Ignacio Morales Lechuga, as
its candidate. Morales Lechuga ran under the banner of two small
parties. He finished fourth; the PRD candidate finished third with
18 percent of the vote.
	   The PRI on Sunday also won the governor's race in the southern
state of Oaxaca, although the PRD is challenging the count. It
claimed that results were altered after the computer system crashed
for 40 minutes on election night.
	   PRD national director Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the party
would not validate an election ``plagued by irregularities, that
was not clean nor free and in which the vote was manipulated.''
	   With 89 percent of the vote counted, PRI candidate Jose Nelson
Murat Casab had 48 percent of the vote; PRD candidate Hector
Sanchez had 37 percent.
	   ``My government will be plural, inclusive y democratic,'' Murat
Casab said Monday in a telephone interview. ``I will call together
all of Oaxaca's political forces and citizens of all ideologies to
work together in a project for progress.''
	   Even if the results stand, the Oaxaca elections offer some
encouragement to the PRD.
	   The party's strength in the state has steadily grown throughout
the decade. And if the PRD is to be a force in 2000, it will need
support in the rural south, traditionally a PRI stronghold.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rod Laver has suffered a setback in his
recovery from a stroke, but it's not believed to be serious.
	   The former tennis great was back in the intensive care unit at
UCLA Medical Center Monday because of a fever and was responding to
treatment, the hospital said.
	   Laver, who will turn 60 on Sunday, was in serious but stable
condition, resting comfortably and in good spirits.
	   Doctors said the Australian was not paralyzed, although he
continued having difficulty moving his right arm and right leg.
	   Laver, who suffered a moderate stroke July 27, was moved out of
the intensive care unit Friday and his condition was upgraded to
fair. However, he was moved back into the ICU several hours later
because of the fever.

Serbs press attacks in Kosovo after vowing that offensive is over

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sweeping Serb military attacks on
ethnic Albanian rebels have created a refugee population that puts
Kosovo province ``on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe,''
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Monday.
	   With tens of thousands of refugees living in the woods or in
isolated villages without food or water, Hill said it was essential
that the international community be allowed to help people safely
return to their homes.
	   Serb forces took another Albanian stronghold Monday, a Serb
source told The Associated Press. The source said police cautiously
entered the village of Lausa, some 35 kilometers (20 miles)
northwest of Pristina, which has been under control of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army since March.
	   The attack came just days after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic vowed that his military push against the secessionist
Kosovo Liberation Army had stopped.
	   Milosevic also promised last week to ``personally guarantee''
access for refugee agencies trying to bring aid to displaced ethnic
Albanian civilians. Nevertheless, U.N. refugee official Mons Nyber
said Monday that access had been ``on and off.''
	   In Geneva, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, Kris Janowski, said the fighting had so disrupted
transport and communications that ``we are back to square one,''
unable to reach pockets of refugees. The agency estimated that at
least 50,000 people fled the weekend fighting, swelling the number
of refugees to 200,000 since the government launched its crackdown
on Albanian militants in March.
	   U.S. envoy Hill has proposed that diplomatic monitors be allowed
to escort refugees back to their homes, saying it was necessary to
show ethnic Albanian civilians that the international community
supports them. Milosevic has agreed to the plan, but some diplomats
question whether he actually would permit it.
	   Albanian sources said Serb forces continued an offensive in the
border area between Djakovica and Junik, a key rebel stronghold,
which came under grenade fire for eighth day Monday.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued to lay siege to Junik, a
key rebel stronghold. Serb military sources said police entered
Smonica early Monday, after troops had been shelling the Albanian
border village for days. The fighting killed at least a dozen KLA
fighters, the military said.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo province part
of the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia.
	   Red Cross spokeswoman Amanda Williamson said in Geneva that a
team found between 60,000 to 80,000 refugees hiding on the slopes
of Mt. Berisa south of Pristina, Kosovo's capital. She said the Red
Cross was trying to organize an aid convoy from Belgrade.
	   The U.N. refugee agency also was planning a convoy Tuesday or
Wednesday for ethnic Albanians in villages near Malisevo. Many of
those refugees had fled villages destroyed by Serb shells.
	   In Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party accused
the Serb-led Yugoslav government of trying ``to make it impossible
for thousands of Albanians to return to their homes.''
	   But a senior diplomat questioned assertions that the Serb
campaign against Albanian civilians was reminiscent of ``ethnic
cleating,'' the forcible removal of rival ethnicities that marked
conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Croatia
earlier this decade.
	   The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it
appeared that Serbs were clearing only those villages near key
roads that the KLA had blocked in recent months. He also said the
Serbs were likely to insist they had indeed ceased their military
attacks, and that police forces were merely securing their hold on
former KLA territory.
	   KLA leaders were expected to announce this week whether they
will accept a U.S. plan to join Albanian politicians in peace
negotiations with Milosevic. While rebels and politicians share a
goal for independence, politicians say they would accept autonomy
as a first step.
	   Rebels have so far opposed this plan, and the current Serb
offensive appears designed to deliver a strong blow against the
rebels and force them to negotiate from a position of weakness.
	   Milosevic has offered only to restore Kosovo's autonomy, and
major world powers also oppose independence for the province. The
United States and European nations fear independence could lead to
demands by Albanian speaking communities in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, to establish a ``greater
Albania'' in the southern Balkans.

Yemen's president approves capital punishment law for kidnappers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's president approved a law Monday that
imposes a possible death penalty for people carrying out
kidnappings, the latest attempt to curb abductions of foreigners.
	   Since 1991, tribesmen have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners to
pressure the government to provide better services and money. So
far, government efforts to stop the abductions, including sending
armed guards with tourists, have proved futile.
	   The law, signed by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, imposes the
death penalty on anyone leading a group which organizes a
kidnapping, on anyone taking part in the kidnapping itself and on
anyone carrying out highway robberies endemic to parts of Yemen.
	   Executions in Yemen are usually carried out by firing squad.
	   Kidnappers acting on their own face 12 to 25 years in prison.
Attempted kidnappings can bring 12 to 15 years in prison.
	   The law was passed earlier this month by parliament.
	   Large swaths of Yemen are ruled by tribesmen armed with
everything from rifles to artillery. But the hostages _ often oil
workers, diplomats or tourists _ are usually treated as guests and
emerge from the ordeal inconvenienced but unhurt.
	   The last kidnapping occurred July 22 when tribesmen abducted two
Belgian tourists. They were released the next day.

Angolan government assures U.N. it is committed to peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; by CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan president assured a senior
U.N. envoy on Monday that his government was committed to peace
despite signs that the country is sliding back into civil war.
	   ``The president and the government reaffirmed their commitment
to the full implementation of the 1994 peace accord,'' U.N. envoy
Lakhdar Brahimi told reporters after meeting with President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos in the Angolan capital.
	   Brahimi arrived in Luanda Friday on an emergency mission
prompted by a recent escalation of tension, including the massacre
of 100 civilians in a remote northern village and reported military
buildup on both sides.
	   He spent the weekend conferring with western diplomats and U.N.
officials before his Monday meeting with Dos Santos.
	   The envoy's agenda for Tuesday includes talks with Jonas Savimbi
_ the leader of the former UNITA rebel movement and the other main
figure in the simmering conflict.
	   A U.N.-brokered accord signed in 1994 sealed a tenuous end to a
two-decade-long war between the government and UNITA rebels that
was fueled by Cold War geopolitics.
	   But successive deadlines for full implementation of the
agreement have passed unheeded, and in recent weeks the entire
peace process has appeared in danger of collapse.
	   After his talks with Dos Santos Monday, Brahimi met with
government officials and UNITA representatives on the Joint
Commission that was formed to monitor implementation of the peace
accord.
	   The commission includes representatives from the government,
UNITA, the U.N. and diplomats from United States, Russia and
Portugal.
	   ``We felt great openness from the United Nations but we will
only be able to draw conclusions after tomorrow,'' when Brahimi has
met Savimbi, UNITA representative Haracio Junjuvili said after
meeting the envoy.
	   Brahimi was due to travel Tuesday morning by air to meet Savimbi
at his highland stronghold 480 kilometers (300 miles) north of the
capital of this former Portuguese colony.
	   UNITA's reluctance to relinquish its rural strongholds in
compliance with the 1994 accord has triggered harsh U.N. sanctions.
Savimbi has refused to move his base to the capital for personal
security reasons.
	   The government has also accused UNITA of not fully demobilizing
its 70,000-strong guerrilla army and maintaining troops hidden in
the bush.
	   But in recent weeks the government, as well as UNITA, have been
accused of preparing for another war with forced recruitment drives
in this immense southwest African country.
	   Junjuvili denied reports that UNITA had hired over 300
mercenaries from the South African company Executive Outcomes.
	   ``There are no mercenaries on UNITA's side'' he said.

Italy upsets Yugoslavia; Lithuania clinches quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Italian coach Bogdan Tanjevic, Yugoslav
player Dejan Bodiroga &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, favorites to win this World
Championship, fell from the unbeaten ranks as Italy shocked the
European champions 61-60 Monday in a second-round game.
	   And they were undone by two of their own from the former
Yugoslavia _ Bosnian born Bodjan Tanjevic, the Italian coach, and
Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka, who hit the winning shots.
	   However, Yugoslavia (4-1) along with Lithuania, Greece and Spain
are assured of reaching Friday's quarterfinals with four more
places up for grabs.
	   The loss was the biggest upset of this week-old championship _
surpassing's Lithuania's two-point win last week over the
under-staffed Americans _ and avenged a Yugoslavia victory over
Italy last year in the final of the European championship.
	   It was also Italy's first victory over Yugoslavia in a major
tournament since the 1984 Olympics, when they won 74-61.
	   Italy (3-2) can thank Fucka for the victory as he led the
winners with 16 points and hit the two clinching free throws to put
Italy ahead for the final time.
	   Yugoslavia had two shots at the end to win, but Milenko Topic's
shot in the lane with 2.5 seconds left bounded off the rim and
Sasha Obradovic missed from further out at the buzzer.
	   ``It was a bad gamble on the part of the Yugoslavas who thought
Fucka would not be cool enough, but this type of thing you run the
risk of missing your bet,'' said Italian coach Tanjevic said.
	   ``Our victory will not mean anything unless we beat Puerto Rico
tomorrow and go to the quarterfinal,'' he added.
	   The Italians, who forced the usually tidy Yugoslav into 20
turnovers, will face Puerto Rico Tuesday with a quarerfinal berth
on the line.
	   ``Of course it (the loss) is bad but it's not a disaster. It's
not the end of the tournament,'' said Yugoslav forward Dejan
Bodiroga.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two Olympics, booked its
place in the quarterfinals with a second-round victory over
Argentina 84-75.
	   Lithuania (4-1) led Argentina (2-3) almost from the start, was
up 41-33 at halftime and then pulled away. Salulis Stombergas had
19 to lead the Lithuanians with 14 from Darius Lukminas. The team's
top scorer in the tournament _ Arturas Karnisovas _ had 11.
	   ``Because they paid so much attention to me, I had to distribute
the ball instead of shooting it,'' the former Seton Hall star said.
``We kept going to Stombergas because they couldn't stop him one on
one. He was too quick.''
	   Argentina, which had two players foul out _ Alejandro Montecchia
and Juan Ignacio Sanchez _ was topped by Juan Alberto Espil with
18.
	   Australia (3-2) improved its chances of reaching the
quarterfinals with a 75-63 come-from-behind victory over Brazil
(1-4) and will face the United States Tuesday in their final
qualification-round game.
	   Australia trailed 35-31 at halftime, out-scored Brazil 15-4 in
the first four minutes of the second half, taking a 46-39 lead at
15:59 on a 3-pointer by Andrew Gaze. Gaze was held scoreless in the
first half but finished with 16 behind Paul Rogers' 20.
	   Rogerio Klafke topped Brazil with 15.
	   Puerto Rico (2-3) also stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth
with a 94-81 victory over Canada (1-4).
	   Eddie Casiano topped Puerto Rico with 23 and Jose Ortiz added 15
and 10 rebounds. The Canadians were led by Greg Newton with 25
points and eight rebounds.
	   ``This is the first time we have been able to play the game we
are capable of playing,'' said Puerto Rico coach Carlos Morales.
``We are small so we go hard for the boards and try to penetrate
and shoot from the outside.''
	   Russia (3-1) and the United States (3-1) played games late
Monday but looked the most likely to reach the final eight with the
last two places up for grabs among Italy, Argentina, Puerto Rico
and Australia. The United States faced Spain (4-0) and
home-favortie Greece (4-0) played Russia.
	   In games to determine 13th to 16th place, Nigeria claimed 13th
with a 70-60 victory over Japan. Senegal finished 15th, beating
South Korea 75-72.

German-Russian composer Alfred Schnittke dies at 63
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with comments from cellist Rostropovich, Sept.
10 funeral date. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Alfred Schnittke, one of the former
Soviet Union's most prolific composers whose works ranged from
symphonies to movie themes, died Monday in Hamburg. He was 63.
	   Schnittke, the son of a Russian mother and a German-Jewish
father, died at Hamburg's University Hospital, where he had been
admitted after suffering his fourth stroke over a period of many
years, his wife, Irina, said.
	   A creator of ``polystylism,'' or mixture of musical forms, he
was spurned in his homeland at the beginning of his career, but by
the 1980s had won over Soviet cultural authorities.
	   Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who conducted and played
in premieres of many of Schnittke's pieces, said ``a genius
composer, and the most outstanding of my friends has died.''
	   ``This is one of the last losses in my life. I have nobody and
nothing to lose now,'' Rostropovich said.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a telegram Monday to Irina
Schnittke in Hamburg saying he shared her family's ``huge grief.''
	   ``A great composer of modern times has departed. With his
creation, Alfred Schnittke carried out a genuine revolution in
music,'' Yeltsin wrote. ``He brought glory to the culture of his
homeland and enriched the tradition of the Russian classical music
school with his unique, innovative ideas.''
	   The unorthodox composer was among five winners in 1992 of the
prestigious Praemium Imperiale for lifetime achievement in the
arts, given by the Japan Art Association.
	   Schnittke's final composition, the Ninth Symphony, had its world
premiere this spring in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory.
Schnittke was seriously ill, unable to talk or move much, by the
time he composed it, Russian media reports said. The right-handed
composer wrote the piece with his left hand.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the composer is to be buried
Sept. 10 at Moscow's Novodevichye cemetery _ a high honor in
Russia.
	   Schnittke was born on November 24, 1934, in Engels, a small town
on the Volga River in what was then called the Volga German
Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, an area that had been settled
by Germans in the 18th century.
	   The son of Harry Schnittke, a German-born Jew of Latvian
descent, and Maria Vogel, a Volga-German Catholic, he was
influenced by both the Russian and German cultures.
	   Music did not play a big role in his life until 1946, the year
his family moved to Vienna, where his father began working for a
Soviet German-language paper.
	   One of the first pieces Schnittke heard on the radio in Vienna
was Shostakovich's Ninth Symphony, which he found, in his words,
``very refreshing, but also very strange.''
	   Increasingly obsessed with music, he started taking piano
lessons with a local teacher, Charlotte Ruber, and he soon
developed an interest in composition.
	   The two years his family spent in Vienna were of ``decisive
importance'' in his life, he once wrote.
	   ``I recall a basic musical tone, a certain Mozart-Schubert sound
which I carried within me for decades and which was confirmed upon
my next stay in Austria some 30 years later,'' he said.
	   Returning to the Soviet Union with his parents in 1948,
Schnittke enrolled at the Institute of the October Revolution, a
music preparatory school in Moscow.
	   Five years later, he entered the Moscow Conservatory, where the
composers Nicolai Rakov and Evgeny Golubev were among his
instructors.
	   As part of his graduation requirements, he composed an oratorio,
Nagasaki, that included an atomic blast as part of the score,
offering an early glimpse of the unorthodox musical approach he
would adopt in later years.
	   In 1961 he joined the faculty himself, and for the next 10 years
taught instrumentation, polyphony, and composition at the
conservatory.
	   Schnittke's long list of compositions includes five symphonies,
a piano concerto, four violin concertos, five concerto grossos, two
concertos each for viola and cello, two oratorios, six ballets,
numerous choral, chamber, and instrumental pieces, and arrangements
of works by Shostakovich, Berg, Scott Joplin, and others.
	   He also has about 60 Soviet film scores to his credit, most of
them written between 1961 and 1984.
	   Schnittke is survived by his wife, Irina Katayeva, and a son.
The couple divided their time between homes in Moscow and Hamburg.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sweeping Serb military attacks on
ethnic Albanian rebels have created a refugee population that puts
Kosovo province ``on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe,''
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Monday.
	   With tens of thousands of refugees living in the woods or in
isolated villages without food or water, Hill said it was essential
that the international community be allowed to help people safely
return to their homes.
	   Serb forces took another Albanian stronghold Monday, a Serb
source told The Associated Press. The source said police cautiously
entered the village of Lausa, some 35 kilometers (20 miles)
northwest of Pristina, which has been under control of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army since March.
	   The attack came just days after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic vowed that his military push against the secessionist
Kosovo Liberation Army had stopped.
	   Milosevic also promised last week to ``personally guarantee''
access for refugee agencies trying to bring aid to displaced ethnic
Albanian civilians. Nevertheless, U.N. refugee official Mons Nyber
said Monday that access had been ``on and off.''
	   In Geneva, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, Kris Janowski, said the fighting had so disrupted
transport and communications that ``we are back to square one,''
unable to reach pockets of refugees. The agency estimated that at
least 50,000 people fled the weekend fighting, swelling the number
of refugees to 200,000 since the government launched its crackdown
on Albanian militants in March.
	   U.S. envoy Hill has proposed that diplomatic monitors be allowed
to escort refugees back to their homes, saying it was necessary to
show ethnic Albanian civilians that the international community
supports them. Milosevic has agreed to the plan, but some diplomats
question whether he actually would permit it.
	   Albanian sources said Serb forces continued an offensive in the
border area between Djakovica and Junik, a key rebel stronghold,
which came under grenade fire for eighth day Monday.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued to lay siege to Junik, a
key rebel stronghold. Serb military sources said police entered
Smonica early Monday, after troops had been shelling the Albanian
border village for days. The fighting killed at least a dozen KLA
fighters, the military said.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo province part
of the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia.
	   Red Cross spokeswoman Amanda Williamson said in Geneva that a
team found between 60,000 to 80,000 refugees hiding on the slopes
of Mt. Berisa south of Pristina, Kosovo's capital. She said the Red
Cross was trying to organize an aid convoy from Belgrade.
	   The U.N. refugee agency also was planning a convoy Tuesday or
Wednesday for ethnic Albanians in villages near Malisevo. Many of
those refugees had fled villages destroyed by Serb shells.
	   In Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party accused
the Serb-led Yugoslav government of trying ``to make it impossible
for thousands of Albanians to return to their homes.''
	   But a senior diplomat questioned assertions that the Serb
campaign against Albanian civilians was reminiscent of ``ethnic
cleating,'' the forcible removal of rival ethnicities that marked
conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Croatia
earlier this decade.
	   The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it
appeared that Serbs were clearing only those villages near key
roads that the KLA had blocked in recent months. He also said the
Serbs were likely to insist they had indeed ceased their military
attacks, and that police forces were merely securing their hold on
former KLA territory.
	   KLA leaders were expected to announce this week whether they
will accept a U.S. plan to join Albanian politicians in peace
negotiations with Milosevic. While rebels and politicians share a
goal for independence, politicians say they would accept autonomy
as a first step.
	   Rebels have so far opposed this plan, and the current Serb
offensive appears designed to deliver a strong blow against the
rebels and force them to negotiate from a position of weakness.
	   Milosevic has offered only to restore Kosovo's autonomy, and
major world powers also oppose independence for the province. The
United States and European nations fear independence could lead to
demands by Albanian speaking communities in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, to establish a ``greater
Albania'' in the southern Balkans.

Tourists warned about wounded polar bear in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Tourists and tour operators in the Norwegian
Arctic archipelago of Svalbard have been warned that a wounded
polar bear is on the loose and could be dangerous.
	   A Norwegian guide shot the bear in the neck Saturday when it
attacked a group of British tourists in the Bille Fjord area.
	   The bear disappeared into the icy wilderness, leaving a bloody
trail in the snow.
	   Governor Ann-Kristin Olsen, who also is chief of police in the
Arctic territory, 700 miles (1,100 kilometers) north of the
mainland, warned people not to travel to the area about 30 miles
(50 kilometers) from Longyearbyen.
	   None of the six British tourists or their Norwegian guide were
hurt in the incident.
	   Polar bears are a protected species, and hunting them was banned
some 25 years ago. The governor's office is looking into whether
the shooting Saturday was self-defense.
	   Although encounters with polar bears are rare in the more
accessible areas of Svalbard during the summer, people who venture
outside Longyearbyen are strongly recommended to carry a gun for
protection.
	   In 1995 a French tourist and a Norwegian woman were killed by
polar bears in two different incidents in Svalbard.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Gunmen loyal to President Laurent Kabila
patrolled Kinshasa's rutted streets Monday in search of Rwandan
mercenaries who helped bring his government to power and now are
suspected of plotting against it.
	   The capital awoke to the sound of gunfire as rival soldiers
clashed inside their base compounds in the city's west end.
	   A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed on the city, while in eastern
Congo, military officers appeared to be in open revolt against
Kabila.
	   About 14 months after charging victoriously into Kinshasa, the
rebel alliance that carried Kabila to power appears to be
unraveling, a trend that could plunge this central African country
back into chaos.
	   ``The government asks the people of Congo and those foreigners
here in the country to stay calm and to stay at home until order is
restored,'' said an abrupt announcement Monday morning on
state-controlled People's Radio. ``Stay at home just until that
time when the armed forces of Congo re-establish civil order.''
	   Shops throughout the capital remained closed Monday morning, and
people who had headed downtown for work early in the morning
quickly returned home.
	   Troops loyal to Kabila set up roadblocks throughout the city and
began a massive search for Rwandan Tutsi soldiers _ Kabila's
one-time allies.
	   A defense ministry official said loyalist troops had been
ordered to kill any Rwandan soldiers found hiding in and around the
city.
	   Pre-dawn clashes at two military bases apparently pitted
Kabila's troops against Rwandan mercenaries, who last year helped
the president oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila last
week ordered all Rwandan soldiers to leave the country.
	   The fighting comes amid growing suspicions within Kabila's
government that the Rwandan troops had been plotting against the
regime.
	   Earlier, Kabila sacked James Kabari, a Rwandan Tutsi who had
been the president's top military commander.
	   Although Rwandan troops played an important role last year in
Kabila's victory over Mobutu, relations between the central African
countries have soured in recent months.
	   According to a defense ministry official, more than 1,000
Rwandan Tutsi soldiers fled the Kokolo base in Kinshasa and are
hiding in a forest just outside of the city.
	   In the Rwandan capital, Kigali, a private news agency reported
an open rebellion against Kabila had been launched in North Kivu
province in eastern Congo.
	   ``We, the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
taken the decision to remove President Laurent Desire Kabila from
power,'' said a statement read Sunday in French and Swahili over
Radio Goma, according to the private Rwandan News Agency.
	   The statement was signed by Sylvain Mbuchi, commander of the
10th battalion of the Congolese army based in Goma, the provincial
capital, RNA said.
	   The statement called on the local population to remain calm and
go about their daily business and assured residents that the goal
of the rebels was to ``preserve the unity and security of the whole
nation.''
	   Eastern Congo's Banyamulenge Tutsi population has been
increasingly opposed to Kabila's rule.
	   Rwanda's foreign minister said his country had no hand in the
latest turmoil in Congo.
	   ``The crisis now rising in Kinshasa and the eastern part of the
Democratic Republic of Congo is purely an internal matter, and the
government of Rwanda is not involved in any way,'' Anastase Gasana
was quoted by RNA as saying in a statement.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night in a round of talks the Palestinians said would be the last
if no progress was made toward an overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal.
	   The talks between chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and
Israeli envoy Yitzhak Molcho lasted several hours at an undisclosed
location in Jerusalem, and neither negotiator was reachable for
comment at the conclusion.
	   Erekat and his staff then left for Gaza where they were expected
to brief Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat on the talks,
Arafat's office said.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, said earlier Monday that if
the Israelis did not bring new ideas, ``this kind of meeting cannot
continue.''
	   ``We are waiting to see a change in the attitude of the
Israelis,'' Tibi said.
	   ``If not, this means (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu has
said no to the last chance to revive the peace process.''
	   Israel radios reported that the Palestinians were considering
whether to continue talks Tuesday and promised the Israelis an
answer after a late night briefing with Arafat.
	   Senior negotiators from the two sides have been meeting for the
past two weeks, after months without direct talks, in an effort to
come to an agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal. Talks resumed
Monday night in Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians have complained that no progress has been made,
and that Israel has continued to resist an American proposal for a
13 percent withdrawal.
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Palestinians would not accept a reported Israeli proposal for a
10 percent withdrawal plus an additional 3 percent that would be
considered a ``nature reserve'' and where the Palestinians could
not build.

English-speaking Caribbean has 250 people on death row, group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ English-speaking nations in the Caribbean now
have 250 people on death row out of a population of about 5 million
_ one of the highest death-sentence rates in the world, the human
rights group Amnesty International says.
	   Trinidad and Tobago accounts for 104 of the cases, the group
said in a report released Monday. Jamaica is next with 47 cases,
the Bahamas has 40, Guyana has 24 and Belize has nine.
	   There are 26 people on death row in Barbados and the countries
that make up the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States _ Antigua
and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
	   The death row rate is almost four times that of the United
States, which has 260 million people and 3,300 convicts awaiting
execution, the group said.
	   Britain and international human rights groups have been
pressuring former British colonies to eliminate the death penalty.
Caribbean countries have resisted, saying capital punishment helps
deter crime caused by drug traffic through the region.
	   The countries are planning to create a regional supreme court to
replace the British Privy Council, which serves as the final court
of appeal for the former colonies and has moved to limit
executions.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Some local residents on Monday petitioned
a court for permission to install a bronze statue of Mother Teresa
in this city next month to commemorate the first anniversary of her
death.
	   The residents, who have formed a committee, approached the court
after Mother Teresa's Missionary of Charities objected to their
raising funds in the name of the nun. Calcutta was for decades the
home of Mother Teresa, who worked for the dying and the destitutes.
	   High Court Judge Prabir Samanta said he would hear the
petitioners on Wednesday.
	   Sister Nirmala, who succeeded Mother Teresa as the
superior-general of the Missionaries of Charity, has disapproved of
the committee's plans, saying Mother Teresa herself had warned
people not to use her name to raise funds after her death.
	   The Missionaries of Charity planned a simple mass and prayer on
Mother Teresa's death anniversary.

Calypso singer Lord Hawke found dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Calypso singer Lloyd Providence,
better known as Lord Hawke, was found dead Monday morning in his
home on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, police reported.
	   Providence, 54, appeared to have died from natural causes, they
said. Investigators were performing an autopsy.
	   Providence was widely considered a master of Caribbean calypso,
a heavily rhythmic music with African roots and lyrics rich in
political satire. He performed throughout the Caribbean and in New
York.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night in a round of talks that Palestinians said could be the last
if no progress was made toward an overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal.
	   The talks between chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and
Israeli envoy Yitzhak Molcho lasted several hours at an undisclosed
location in Jerusalem, and neither negotiator was reachable for
comment at their conclusion.
	   Erekat and his staff then left for Gaza where they were expected
to brief Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat on the talks,
Arafat's office said.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, said earlier Monday that if
the Israelis did not bring new ideas, ``this kind of meeting cannot
continue.''
	   ``We are waiting to see a change in the attitude of the
Israelis,'' Tibi said. ``If not, this means (Prime Minister
Benjamin) Netanyahu has said no to the last chance to revive the
peace process.''
	   Israel radio reported that the Palestinians were considering
whether to continue talks Tuesday and promised the Israelis an
answer after a late night briefing with Arafat.
	   Senior negotiators from the two sides have been meeting for the
past two weeks, after months without direct talks, in an effort to
come to an agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal. Talks resumed
Monday night in Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians have complained that no progress has been made,
and that Israel has continued to resist an American proposal for a
13 percent withdrawal.
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Palestinians would not accept a reported Israeli proposal for a
10 percent withdrawal plus an additional 3 percent that would be
considered a ``nature reserve'' and where the Palestinians could
not build.

Trial of Turkish human rights activist assailants opens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with one defendant to be released; quote, trial
adjourned to September 3 &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The trial of 11 Turkish defendants accused
of trying to murder a leading human rights activist opened under
high security here Monday.
	   The May 12 attack on Akin Birdal, president of Turkey's Human
Rights Foundation, left him hospitalized for weeks.
	   It was a major embarrassment for Turkish authorities who
admitted that a right-wing terrorist, formerly employed by the
state to kill people seen as threats to national security, was
probably behind the assassination attempt. Despite a manhunt, the
terrorist is still at large.
	   One of the defendants, accused of ordering the attack, said his
aim was not to kill Birdal.
	   ``I did not give instructions for the murder or wounding of Akin
Birdal. My instruction was to have him kidnapped and then get him
to make a press statement saying he regretted his pro-separatist
speeches,'' a former army sergeant, Cengiz Ersever, was quoted by
Anatolia news agency as saying.
	   Birdal, in court in a wheelchair, is a prominent campaigner
against torture and the army's forced evacuation of Kurdish
villages in southeastern Turkey. He has been repeatedly charged
with inciting racial hatred or separatism for his speeches in favor
of a peaceful solution of the war opposing autonomy-seeking Kurdish
rebels and government troops.
	   ``If I had such an intention (of murdering Birdal), I bet, I
would have his brain splattered on the wall in 24 hours,'' Ersever
told the judges, prompting vivid protests from Birdal's lawyers who
asked the court to put the defendant's words on record.
	   According to the indictment, the 11 defendants, including two
who have reportedly confessed to the shooting, belonged to the
Turkish Revenge Brigade, formed by Ersever to fight Kurdish
separatism and pro-Islamic movements.
	   After questioning the defendants, the court, without saying why,
decided to release one of them and adjourned trial to Sept. 3,
Anatolia reported.

Serbs press attacks in Kosovo after vowing that offensive is over

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Sweeping Serb military attacks on
ethnic Albanian rebels have created a refugee population that puts
Kosovo province ``on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe,''
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Monday.
	   With tens of thousands of refugees living in the woods or in
isolated villages without food or water, Hill said it was essential
that the international community be allowed to help people safely
return to their homes.
	   Serb forces took another Albanian stronghold Monday, a Serb
source told The Associated Press. The source said police cautiously
entered the village of Lausa, some 35 kilometers (20 miles)
northwest of Pristina, which has been under control of the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army since March.
	   The attack came just days after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic vowed that his military push against the KLA had stopped.
	   Milosevic also promised last week to ``personally guarantee''
access for refugee agencies trying to bring aid to displaced ethnic
Albanian civilians. Nevertheless, U.N. refugee official Mons Nyber
said Monday that access had been ``on and off.''
	   In Geneva, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, Kris Janowski, said the fighting had so disrupted
transport and communications that ``we are back to square one,''
unable to reach pockets of refugees. The agency estimated that at
least 50,000 people fled the weekend fighting, swelling the number
of refugees to 200,000 since the government launched its crackdown
on Albanian militants in March.
	   U.S. envoy Hill has proposed that diplomatic monitors be allowed
to escort refugees back to their homes, saying it was necessary to
show ethnic Albanian civilians that the international community
supports them. Milosevic has agreed to the plan, but some diplomats
question whether he actually would permit it.
	   Albanian sources said Serb forces continued an offensive in the
border area between Djakovica and Junik, a key rebel stronghold,
which came under grenade fire for eighth day Monday.
	   Serb sources also said troops continued to lay siege to Junik, a
key rebel stronghold. Serb military sources said police entered
Smonica early Monday, after troops had been shelling the Albanian
border village for days. The fighting killed at least a dozen KLA
fighters, the military said.
	   A woman and her son were killed late Sunday when trying to cross
from the Serbian province into Montenegro, the other Yugoslav
republic, Albanian sources said.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9
	   The U.N. refugee agency also was planning a convoy Tuesday or
Wednesday for ethnic Albanians in villages near Malisevo. Many of
those refugees had fled villages destroyed by Serb shells.
	   In Albania's capital, Tirana, a Kosovo Albanian party accused
the Serb-led Yugoslav government of trying ``to make it impossible
for thousands of Albanians to return to their homes.''
	   But a senior diplomat questioned assertions that the Serb
campaign against Albanian civilians was reminiscent of ``ethnic
cleansing,'' the forcible removal of rival ethnicities that marked
conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia and Croatia
earlier this decade.
	   The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it
appeared that Serbs were clearing only those villages near key
roads that the KLA had blocked in recent months. He also said the
Serbs were likely to insist they had indeed ceased their military
attacks, and that police forces were merely securing their hold on
former KLA territory.
	   KLA leaders were expected to announce this week whether they
will accept a U.S. plan to join Albanian politicians in peace
negotiations with Milosevic. While rebels and politicians share a
goal for independence, politicians say they would accept autonomy
as a first step.
	   Rebels have so far opposed this plan, and the current Serb
offensive appears designed to deliver a strong blow against the
rebels and force them to negotiate from a position of weakness.
	   Milosevic has offered only to restore Kosovo's autonomy, and
major world powers also oppose independence for the province. The
United States and European nations fear independence could lead to
demands by Albanian speaking communities in Macedonia and
Montenegro to establish a ``greater Albania'' in the southern
Balkans.
	   In Washington, the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton
said a new Serb offensive could result in the use of NATO firepower
against Serb forces in the province.
	   There was no immediate word on what would trigger an attack by
NATO. Nor was it clear whether the administration was trying mostly
to unnerve Milosevic by raising the threat again publicly.
	   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels said the alliance has
been putting the final touches on a number of options, but these
plans were nothing new.

In Spanish mountains, a mouse roars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANAR, Spain (AP) _ This mountain hamlet has a very old bone to
pick with the government.
	   The mayor of Canar -- population 300 or so -- is pressing Madrid
to honor a promise that King Felipe II made in the late 16th
century. In today's money the bill comes to about 140 dollars.
	   Nearly 400 years ago the monarch put a price on the head of a
Moorish bandit blamed for a massacre of Christians in southern
Spain.
	   The people of Canar captured him, and were rewarded with a royal
decree granting them 180 reales, the currency at the time, per year
in perpetuity.
	   They got the money until 1883, by which time Spain's currency
was the peseta. That year the government decided the king's
arrangement was outdated, and made a lump-sum payment to cover the
next 20 years.
	   After that the funds dried up. Now, Canar wants the installments
for the last 115 years.
	   ``A mayor has to have a goal,'' said the mayor, Manuel Mesa
Torres, 36.
	   He said that on Tuesday the town council will send Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar legal papers asking him to make good on
King Felipe II's pledge. Canar is acting now because 1998 marks the
400th anniversary of the king's death, Mesa said.
	   The debt -- 115 years of arrears at 180 pesetas per year --
stands at 20,700 pesetas. That's 138 dollars.
	   ``We hope the prime minister or a member of his cabinet will see
fit to pay up,'' said Mesa.
	   Asked about the interest accrued over all these years, he said
it would be nice if the government added three zeros to the bottom
line. ``Zeros to the right, of course,'' he said.

Gym classes, education pay off, even for young children
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Getting 9-year-olds to jump rope, play tag and
listen to tips on healthy eating significantly lowered their
cholesterol levels after just two months.
	   Alas, 9 is not too early to worry about cholesterol, and a new
study shows a simple school program that stresses an active
physical education class can help set children on a healthier path
to adulthood.
	   The program tested in North Carolina is easy and cheap enough
that the National Institutes of Health hopes schools throughout
America will quickly adopt it.
	   ``We're very excited about this,'' said Patricia Grady, director
of the National Institute of Nursing Research, which funded the
North Carolina study. ``This is an opportunity to reach children at
an early age and positively influence their lives.''
	   Doctors have increasing evidence that heart disease takes root
in early childhood. Autopsies of young children killed in accidents
have found their arteries already clogging with the fat. And the
risks are on the rise: Studies show more and more children are
obese, and fewer exercise; some schools even have cut back on gym
class.
	   Researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,
studied 422 third- and fourth-graders around the state who got
little physical activity and were obese or had high cholesterol.
	   The children's cholesterol levels averaged 179 _ borderline
high, equivalent to a level of 200 in an adult. For an adult at
that level, doctors would prompt prescribe serious diet and
exercise and occasionally medication. (More dangerous cholesterol
levels are 200 in a child, equal to 240 in an adult). .
	   The children were divided into three groups. In one, teachers
taught healthy nutrition habits during regular classes two days a
week, plus gym class that kept kids moving for 20 full minutes,
three times a week.
	   Other ``control'' classes got the state's routine health and
physical education classes, which featured little aerobic activity.
A third group of children was removed from class a part of each day
for individualized instruction from nurses, plus the vigorous
exercise.
	   In classes that got the heart-healthy education, students'
cholesterol dropped almost 12 points in just two months, lead
researcher Joanne Harrell reports in the journal Pediatrics.
	   Kids who got nurses' instruction had cholesterol drops of 10
points _ showing, surprisingly, that the classroom-based program
was more effective.
	   ``I was very surprised,'' said Harrell, a UNC nursing professor.
``I was convinced the nurses would do better.''
	   She says stressing fun, high-aerobic activity probably was key _
kids ran relays or raced around schoolyards playing parachute
instead of doing boring sit-ups or standing around awaiting a turn
at bat.
	   Parents weren't involved in the study, so kids' at-home diets
presumably didn't change much.
	   Parents probably are confused about cholesterol and kids, Grady
said. Infants and toddlers do need a certain amount of fat to grow
healthy.
	   In the UNC program, children were taught what foods are high in
fat, urged to choose low-fat milk, and shown what ``healthy''
servings of treats like ice cream look like so they might remember
when to stop indulging.
	   The program lasted just two months, but a year later most of the
children's cholesterol still was low _ and some students now in
high school still show a benefit, Harrell said. The study,
conducted in 1991, wasn't long enough to show significant weight
loss. Now Harrell is planning to study whether longer programs and
involving parents works better.

	   MONTCLAIR, New Jersey (AP) _ Gun violence shocked them, so did
the prevalence of bullet-proof vests and the Russian mafia. But the
concept of community policing, unknown back home in Germany, taught
them the most.
	   Two Berlin policemen who spent a month studying U.S. police
techniques in urban areas say they're taking back crime-fighting
ideas that could be applied to their own city.
	   Hartmut Zander, 31, and Olaf Gratzke, 22, were the guests of
police chief Thomas Russo in Montclair, New Jersey, a middle class
city across the Hudson River from New York City.
	   Their American study tour, paid from their own pockets, included
stops in New York, Boston, Newark, New Jersey, and Manchester,
Connecticut.
	   ``The police work in general is the same, in detail there are a
lot differences,'' Zander said Saturday, a day before flying home
to Berlin. ``In America every patrolman wears a (bulletproof) vest,
it is not the same in Germany.''
	   Zander pointed to America's liberal gun laws as the main
difference in crime in America and Germany.
	   ``America has a gun problem,'' said Zander, who will become a
homicide detective next year. ``In Berlin, we have 100 murders a
year and we have 3 1-2 million people. Chicago has 800 a year'' _
and less than 3 million residents.
	   While the gun violence shocked the Germans, Zander and Gratzke
said they learned the most from community policing, a program that
integrates police work with community involvement. He found
Boston's use of the technique, and its results, especially
interesting.
	   ``Community policing was one of the very, very, very impressive
things here,'' Zander said. ``How the police fight crime, meet the
youngsters and know people by name was very good.''
	   American police take a more informal approach to law enforcement
compared to German police, Gratzke said. He said the New York
Police Athletic League's basketball program, where officers coach
and play teen-agers, was not only interesting, but fun.
	   ``I would like to take this experience back to Europe and wonder
if there are other ways to solve the problems there,'' he said.
	   The Berliners were able to see community policing in a variety
of settings, ranging from relatively prosperous Montclair to the
impoverished Fort Apache neighborhood in the South Bronx of New
York City. Zander said the police knew the people they policed,
which also allowed them to know where the crime was coming from.
	   ``We went on patrol in the real bad area,'' Zander said. ``It
was terrible, the people are very poor, there is lots of crime and
it's very dangerous.''
	   They noted that crime has become more international, requiring
police from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to work together.
	   ``Your cocaine is our cocaine, it comes from the same place. Our
heroin is your heroin. Money laundering is a worldwide business,''
Zander said.
	   He also noted that Russian-based organized crime is another
shared problem.
	   ``We have a lot of Russians in Berlin and the head of the FBI,
the (police) commisioner in New York and the head of the Boston
police said that Russian gangs are also here,'' Zander said.
	   While Zander and Gratzke had to volunteer their vacation days
and pay their own expenses, they said the experience will help
their chances for promotion if they decide to move into
international police work.
	   Both police officers agreed that American police could also
benefit from a few weeks working with their German counterparts.
	   ``American police have problems and they have found some good
answers to those problems. In our country we have different
problems and we have found solutions to our problems,'' Zander
said. ``I am sure the big police departments will be working
together in the future more and more.''

Italy upsets Yugoslavia; Lithuania clinches quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS U.S. beating Spain 75-73, Russia over Greece 60-48; both
clinch quarterfinal berths &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, Greece and Spain suffered
losses Monday in the second round of the World Championship,
leaving nobody unbeaten in a wide-open tournament.
	   Yugoslavia _ regarded as the favorites _ fell to Italy 61-60 as
the Italians avenged a lost in the final of the European
championship last year to the Yugoslavs.
	   And they were undone by two of their own from the former
Yugoslavia _ Bosnian-born Bodjan Tanjevic, the Italian coach, and
Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka, who hit the winning shots.
	   However, Yugoslavia (4-1) along with Lithuania, Greece, Spain,
Russia and the United States are assured of reaching Friday's
quarterfinals with only two more places up for grabs.
	   The United States handed Spain its first loss and Russia did the
same to the host Greeks.
	   The Americans (4-1), with 17 from Jimmy Oliver and 12 from Brad
Miller, rallied to beat Spain 75-73 after trailing by 11 at
halftime. Alberto Herreros led Spain with 27.
	   Russia (4-1) demolised the host Greeks 60-48 as Sergei Babkov
hit 18, one of four in double figures. Greece was led by Fragiskos
Albertis with 12 points.
	   It was a memorable win for Italy _ its first over Yugoslavia in
a major tournament since the 1984 Olympics, when they won 74-61.
	   Italy (3-2) can thank Fucka for the victory as he led the
winners with 16 points and hit the two clinching free throws to put
Italy ahead for the final time.
	   ``It was a bad gamble on the part of the Yugoslavas who thought
Fucka would not be cool enough, but this type of thing you run the
risk of missing your bet,'' Italian coach Tanjevic said.
	   ``Our victory will not mean anything unless we beat Puerto Rico
tomorrow and go to the quarterfinal,'' he added.
	   The Italians, who forced the usually tidy Yugoslav into 20
turnovers, will face Puerto Rico Tuesday with a quarerfinal berth
on the line.
	   ``Of course it (the loss) is bad but it's not a disaster. It's
not the end of the tournament,'' said Yugoslav forward Dejan
Bodiroga.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two Olympics, booked its
place in the Friday quarterfinals with a second-round victory over
Argentina 84-75. The top four teams from each qualifying group
advance.
	   Lithuania (4-1) led Argentina (2-3) 41-33 at halftime and then
pulled away. Salulis Stombergas had 19 with 14 from Darius
Lukminas. The team's top scorer in the tournament _ Arturas
Karnisovas _ had 11.
	   ``Because they paid so much attention to me, I had to distribute
the ball instead of shooting it,'' the former Seton Hall star said.
``We kept going to Stombergas because they couldn't stop him one on
one. He was too quick.''
	   Argentina had two foul out _ Alejandro Montecchia and Juan
Ignacio Sanchez _ and was was topped by Juan Alberto Espil with 18.
	   Australia (3-2) improved its chances of reaching the
quarterfinals with a 75-63 come-from-behind victory over Brazil
(1-4) and will face the United States Tuesday in their final
qualification-round game.
	   Australia trailed 35-31 at halftime but outscored Brazil 15-4 in
the first four minutes of the second half for a 46-39 lead on a
3-pointer by Andrew Gaze. Gaze finished with 16 behind Paul Rogers'
20. Rogerio Klafke topped Brazil with 15.
	   Puerto Rico (2-3) also stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth
with a 94-81 victory over Canada (1-4).
	   Eddie Casiano topped Puerto Rico with 23 and Jose Ortiz added 15
and 10 rebounds. The Canadians were led by Greg Newton with 25
points and eight rebounds.
	   ``This is the first time we have been able to play the game we
are capable of playing,'' said Puerto Rico coach Carlos Morales.
``We are small so we go hard for the boards and try to penetrate
and shoot from the outside.''
	   The last two places are still up for grabs with Italy,
Argentina, Puerto Rico and Australia in the running.
	   In games to determine 13th to 16th place, Nigeria claimed 13th
with a 70-60 victory over Japan. Senegal finished 15th, beating
South Korea 75-72.

U.S. finds evidence of labor rights abuses at Mexico plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For the second time in 1998, the U.S. Labor
Department has found evidence of labor rights and safety abuses at
Mexican factories, and called for high-level bilateral talks on the
problem.
	   The alleged violations at the Itapsa auto parts plant in Mexico
City, a subsidiary of Connecticut-based Echlin, Inc. will be
discussed by the two countries' labor secretaries under the rules
of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
	   Workers at the Itapsa plant said thugs were used to intimidate
workers before a non-secret vote on a union organizing effort in
September. An independent union lost the voice-vote, which union
officials say was conducted in front of plant executives and thugs.
	   ``I think we do see a trend, we see a pattern with freedom of
association issues'' in Mexico, said Irasema Garza, secretary of
the Labor Department's National Administrative Office, speaking
from Washington in a telephone interview.
	   The office was set up under NAFTA to investigate complaints of
labor abuses in the three participating countries, Canada, Mexico
and the United States. NAFTA rules prohibit all three member
countries from reducing labor protection or failing to enforce
labor laws.
	   Eight of the nine complaints filed against Mexican workplaces
since NAFTA was implemented in 1994 have alleged violations of the
right to organize unions. The National Administrative Office has
recommended bilateral talks on five of those.
	   Earlier this year, the Labor Department found evidence that
Mexican authorities interfered with the rights of workers trying to
form an independent labor union at a Tijuana assembly-for-export
plant.
	   In their December complaint, workers at the Itapsa plant on the
outskirts of Mexico City also said they were given ``broken down''
safety equipment despite the fact they handle asbestos-laden brake
pads.
	   The NAO report said that the plant was assessed ``minimal''
fines for safety violations, but it is unclear whether the company
ever paid them.
	   ``Questions are raised regarding the efficacy of (health and
safety) inspections. These questions are of special concern because
of the presence of asbestos and other toxic substances at the plant
which have not been adequately monitored,'' the NAO said in a press
statement.
	   Under NAFTA rules, Mexico can be assessed fines of up to dlrs 50
million for failing to enforce worker safety laws. The other
alleged violations can be pursued no further than the
consultations.
	   Workers who were fired from the Itapsa plant also said they were
attacked by thugs while handing out leaflets outside the factory
gate in December.
	   That attack ``raises troublesome questions as regards the rights
of workers to engage in legitimate organizing activities,'' the NAO
report continued.
	   Workers at the Itapsa plant earn an average of 42 pesos, or
about dlrs 5.00, a day.

Eva Bartok, 1950s movie actress, dies at 69
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eva Bartok, Hungarian-born film actress of the
1950s and '60s, has died in London at age 69.
	   Miss Bartok died Saturday at St. Charles' Hospital in London
after being ill for some time, a hospital spokesman said. The cause
of death was not given, but news reports said she had had heart
trouble.
	   Although she never became a major star, Miss Bartok made nearly
40 films, including ``Operation Amsterdam'' with Peter Finch and
``The Crimson Pirate'' with Burt Lancaster.
	   Miss Bartok had a daughter, Deana, in 1957, when she was married
to German actor Curt Jurgens, but in recent years claimed the
girl's father was Frank Sinatra. She said Sinatra never
acknowledged the claim.
	   Born Eva Ivanova Szoeke in Kecskemet, Hungary, in 1929, she was
imprisoned in a concentration camp as a teen-ager and married to a
Nazi, The Daily Telegraph said, adding that the marriage was
annulled on the grounds of coercion of a minor.
	   Her second husband, Alex Paal, was a Hungarian producer. Eva
arrived in London in 1948, where director Alexander Korda met her
and changed her name to Bartok.
	   Her first film was ``A Tale of Five Women,'' produced by Paal,
in 1951. The following year, she appeared in ``The Venetian Bird''
with Richard Todd.
	   Her marriage to Paal broke up and she married Bill Wordsworth, a
public relations man. That marriage came apart while she was in
Rome making her most famous movie, ``The Crimson Pirate,'' in 1952.
	   She met British aristocrat the Marquess of Milford Haven at a
London dinner in 1952. They embarked on a highly publicized
relationship that lasted for several years.
	   Miss Bartok met Jurgens when they made a movie together in
Germany and her relationship with the marquess broke up. She and
Jurgens married in 1955, but that marriage began to founder by the
following year.
	   In 1956, Miss Bartok said, she met Frank Sinatra at a party
while she was in Hollywood making her first American film, ``Ten
Thousand Bedrooms'' with Dean Martin.
	   Sinatra's marriage to Ava Gardner had broken up. Miss Bartok
said she had very brief affair with the singer.
	   In the last years of her life, she lived in a London hotel.
	   She is survived by her daughter, who lives in Australia, and two
grandchildren. Funeral plans were not immediately made known.

MaliVai Washington advances in Toronto open

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ MaliVai Washington defeated No. 13 seed Jan
Siemerink of the Netherlands 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 on Monday to advance to
the second round of the dlrs 2.4 million du Maurier Open.
	   Washington next faces Canada's Bobby Kokavec, who downed Steve
Campbell 6-1, 6-2 for his first match victory on the ATP Tour.
	   ``MaliVai is obviously playing well,'' Kokavec said. ``I'm just
going to go after my shots and not change anything.''
	   Kokavec, honored Monday as Canada's most improved tennis player,
is ranked No. 347 in the world.
	   ``For me, ranking is just a number,'' Kokavec said. ``I feel
like anyone in the top 500 can beat anyone if they play good
because anybody can have a bad day.''
	   In other early matches, Australia's Scott Draper defeated Jim
Courier 7-5, 5-7, 6-4 and Wayne Black of Zimbabwe beat older
brother Byron 6-4, 6-0.
	   Also, Vince Spadea downed Australia's Andrew Illie 6-3, 6-0;

2-6, 7-6 (15-13), 6-2; South Africa's Neville Godwin topped Cecil
Mamiit 6-4, 1-6, 6-4; and South Africa's David Nainkin took Italy's
Laurence Tieleman 6-1, 3-6, 7-5.

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ Australian rugby union players
Tim Horan and Phil Kearns celebrated their Bledisloe Cup win over
New Zealand on Saturday with a nude dip in the Avon River.
	   Horan and Kearns _ along with a puzzled Christchurch cabbie and
a set of hotel towels _ ventured into the night about midnight
Saturday night.
	   Delighted with their 27-23 Bledisloe Cup win, the Australians
traveled by taxi to the edge of the Avon River, where they stripped
off and jumped in, wearing nothing but their victorious smiles.
	   ``It was a lot warmer than I thought it was going to be,''
Kearns said. ``No one saw it, other than a shocked cabbie. It was
all well-planned.''
	   The 65-test veteran explained the tradition of the skinny-dip.
Horan and then-captain Nick Farr-Jones went the Full Monty in
Wellington Harbor after the Wallabies' 21-9 win over the All Blacks
at Athletic Park in 1990.
	   ``It's tradition. We thought we may as well continue it,''
Kearns said. (djp)

Former head of bank sentenced to 15 years in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The former president of a bank whose
collapse helped set off one of the largest banking scandals in
recent Latin American history was sentenced Monday to 15 years in
prison.
	   Gustavo Gomez Lopez, who headed Banco Latino when it went under
in January 1994, was found guilty of five charges including
diversion of public funds and falsifying documents to cover up
fraudulent activities.
	   Judge Maria Inmaculada Perez Dupuy also ordered Gomez Lopez to
repay the government an amount still to be determined, that could
reach several million dollars.
	   Four other former high-level officials of the bank also were
convicted in the case, and 31 former employees were absolved.
	   Gomez Lopez, who fled Venezuela and is living overseas, plans to
appeal the decision, said his lawyer, Jose Morris Sierralta.
	   Banco Latino and 17 other banks were taken over by the
government in 1994-95 after they nearly went bankrupt from
mismanagement and corruption. The government pumped dlrs 8 billion
_ about half the national budget at the time _ into the system to
avoid a complete collapse.
	   In the aftermath, about 200 bankers fled the country and are
believed to be living in the United States and Europe. Authorities
issued arrest warrants for most of them, but just a couple have
been detained.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Richard Rodriguez greeted fans on shaky ``sea
legs'' Monday after riding for 47 days _ not the turbulent waves of
the ocean, but a wooden roller coaster.
	   The 39-year-old New York City native spent just more than 1,013
hours on the Big Dipper roller coaster in the English resort town
of Blackpool, beating his 1994 record of 549 hours.
	   Rodriguez outlasted Canadian rival Normand St. Pierre, who
stopped riding a Montreal roller coaster after 670 hours last
month.
	   ``I wanted to put the record out of reach,'' Rodriguez said
Monday, after surpassing his goal of 1,000 hours.
	   The Miami University communications lecturer and graduate
student followed the strict guidelines imposed by the Guinness Book
of Records before it stopped tracking the roller coaster
competition several years ago. He eat, slept and drank in his
favorite carriage in the middle of the roller coaster, taking off
two hours each day to shower and eat a hot meal.

Rebel supporters criticize presence of U.S. military attache in
</HEADLINE>
Chiapas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Backers of leftist
rebels in this southern state say revelations that a U.S. military
attache has visited the state prove U.S. meddling in the conflict.
	   Leaders of major political parties last week condemned the visit
by Maj. Thomas Gillen, an assistant attache at the U.S. Embassy who
was detained for several hours on July 26 by government supporters
in the Chiapas village of Los Platanos.
	   The leftist Zapatista National Liberation Army didn't like the
news of the visit very much either.
	   ``This is proof that the gringos are up to their elbows in the
armed conflict,'' said Javier Elorriaga, coordinator of the
Zapatista National Liberation Front, a group which says it is
allied with but separate from the rebel army.
	   Gillen was blocked from leaving because he refused to let
pro-government villagers inspect his luggage. He and another
embassy employee were released after about 4 1/2 hours.
	   The U.S. State Department has said Gillen was in Chiapas as part
of ``normal fact-finding'' duties.
	   Elorriaga claimed such visits are proof that ``they (Americans)
are the one who are training most of the Mexican officers in
counterinsurgency and arming them.''
	   The Mexican government cautioned the embassy on the risks
involved in traveling to Chiapas and asked for advance notice of
future visits.
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army staged a brief armed
uprising in January 1994 demanding greater democracy and Indian
rights. Talks between the government and the rebels have been
stalled for the last two years.

Palestinians say latest round of talks could be the last

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night in a round of talks the Palestinians said would be the last
if no progress was made toward an overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal.
	   The talks between chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and
Israeli envoy Yitzhak Molcho lasted several hours at an undisclosed
location in Jerusalem, and neither negotiator was reachable for
comment at the conclusion.
	   Erekat and his staff then left for Gaza where they were expected
to brief Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat on the talks,
Arafat's office said.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, said earlier Monday that if
the Israelis did not bring new ideas, ``this kind of meeting cannot
continue.''
	   ``We are waiting to see a change in the attitude of the
Israelis,'' Tibi said.
	   ``If not, this means (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu has
said no to the last chance to revive the peace process.''
	   Israel radios reported that the Palestinians were considering
whether to continue talks Tuesday and promised the Israelis an
answer after a late night briefing with Arafat.
	   Senior negotiators from the two sides have been meeting for the
past two weeks, after months without direct talks, in an effort to
come to an agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal. Talks resumed
Monday night in Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians have complained that no progress has been made,
and that Israel has continued to resist an American proposal for a
13 percent withdrawal.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
the administration was still hopeful the sides would continue
talks.
	   ``We think they should deal with each other with respect and
confidentiality and a greater sense of urgency, and meet
intensively, so that they can make sure they've done everything
they can to try to reach an agreement. And they also, as we've said
before, need to make tough decisions. But we want specific
proposals on the table that can be dealt with,'' Rubin said.

	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ Michigan Speedway will erect taller
protective fencing around all grandstands in an attempt to prevent
another spectator tragedy such as the one that killed three fans in
June.
	   The improvements will begin in turn three, near where Adrian
Fernandez's Indy-car slammed into the wall on July 26. The accident
launched a wheel into the stands. The improvements will continue
through the front stretch and finish between turns one and two.
	   The top portion of the fence, which angles over the track, will
be lengthened by 4 feet (1.2 meters). The extension will add about
2 1/2 feet (0.75 meters) to the fence's height, for a total of 17
feet (5 meters).
	   Gene Haskett, president of Michigan Speedway, said staff was
working to complete the job before the DeVilbiss 400 NASCAR Winston
Cup race scheduled for Aug. 16.
	   The speedway has canceled test sessions for race teams and
driving schools held on the track to free up more time.
	   The accident was the worst ever at the speedway. Killed were
Kenneth Fox, 38, Michael T. Tautkus, 49, and Sheryl A. Laster, 40.
Six other spectators were injured.
	   Asked if he was sure the changes would increase safety, Haskett
said: ``We don't jump to conclusions, but when you have three
people fatally injured, it's clear something had to be done.''
	   On Saturday, a 7-year-old boy and a 21-year-old woman were
killed when a racing car spun out of control during a rally on the
Portuguese island of Madeira in the Atlantic.
	   Two others were injured in the accident involving race leader
Adruzilo Lopes of Portugal, according to Portuguese radio TSF.
	   ``It is a very fast curve and there might have been some debris
on the ground,'' another driver, Pedro Azeredo, said.
	   The organizers of the Madeira Wine Rally called off the day's
racing.

What if the Titanic sunk today? Imagine the lawsuits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at end with verdict &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE ASSEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ If the Titanic went down today, what a gargantuan
lawsuit there would be. Women and children first, indeed! That
alone could trigger wrongful death suits based on a
sex-discrimination claim.
	   Lawyers at the American Bar Association's annual meeting showed
off their legal skills Monday with a day-long trial of a fictional
lawsuit over the great ship's 1912 sinking after it struck an
iceberg.
	   ``You would not want a ship ... to wait until it was literally
on top of an iceberg to take evasive action, would you?'' real-life
lawyer Emmanuel E. Edem of Oklahoma City asked a woman portraying a
survivor of the tragedy.
	   The fictional character, named Rhoda Abbott, claimed the ship
was unsafely built and operated _ brittle rivets, not easily
maneuverable, not enough lifeboats and a lookout crew without even
a pair of binoculars.
	   The fictional Mrs. Abbott sued the ship's manufacturer,
Harland-and-Wolfe.
	   And then there was the women-and-children-first policy. The
woman and her teenage sons survived but her husband didn't, and
thus she said she planned to file a whole new lawsuit against the
ship's owner, White Star Line, based on sex discrimination.
	   The ABA event was conducted as if modern product-liability laws,
legal skills and courtroom technology had been transported back to
the time of the Titanic.
	   Photos of the ship and blowups of White Star Line document were
projected onto large screens to help the audience _ acting as the
jury _ understand the lawyers' arguments and questioning of
witnesses.
	   Even some of the lawyers themselves _ women and blacks _ likely
would not have been seen in a courtroom back then.
	   ``It's an opportunity to see how the best lawyers present the
most complicated cases,'' said Robert H. Alexander of Oklahoma
City, the lawyer who chaired the program. ``It gives a framework
for appreciating how much the law has changed in the years since
Titanic.''
	   The true-life lawsuits over the Titanic's sinking were settled
without coming to trial. The largest American settlement was dlrs
5,000 to a well-to-do family, while the largest British settlement
was dlrs 50,000 to a large company, Alexander said.
	   These days, the claims would be in the millions.
	   Edem closely questioned the fictional survivor about whether she
would have set foot on the ship if she knew of the structural
defects she now claimed were partly responsible for her husband's
death.
	   But attorney Chilton Davis Varner of Atlanta, representing the
ship's manufacturer, asked a series of questions designed to show
the real problem was White Star Line's operation of the ship and
actions after it struck the iceberg.
	   The ship's owners overruled the manufacturer's recommendation to
install enough lifeboats for the 2,000-plus passengers, she said,
displaying documents to back her statements up.
	   And the ship did take almost three hours to sink, Varner said.
	   ``Harland-and-Wolfe provided almost three hours of time during
which, had there been sufficient lifeboats and sufficient training,
you and your family might have escaped,'' she said.
	   The verdict? The shipbuilder was liable and must pay $1.5
million.

Israeli army hosts wedding for young immigrant soldier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Pvt. Arieh Torliansky got an order from
Israel's defense minister Monday that he couldn't refuse: Take your
bride for a honeymoon anywhere in Israel on me.
	   Torliansky, a 24-year-old immigrant from the former Soviet Union
didn't have enough money for a wedding, so his army commanders and
fellow soldiers threw one for him at his army base on the Lebanese
border Monday.
	   Living on a soldier's meak salary while his wife, Yanina
Tashnikov, also a recent immigrant studying at a local college, the
couple, which has few relatives in Israel, could not afford a
wedding, the Israeli army said.
	   So army cooks worked up a feast, a military chaplain performed
the ceremony and an Army radio disc jockey volunteered to play the
music for free.
	   After the ceremony, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
telephoned the young couple to congratulate them and gave
Torliansky a three-day weekend furlough with his bride at any hotel
in the country at the minister's expense.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ If the Titanic went down today, what a gargantuan
lawsuit there would be. Women and children first, indeed! That
alone could trigger wrongful death suits based on a
sex-discrimination claim.
	   Lawyers at the American Bar Association's annual meeting showed
off their legal skills Monday with a day-long trial of a fictional
lawsuit over the great ship's 1912 sinking after it struck an
iceberg.
	   ``You would not want a ship ... to wait until it was literally
on top of an iceberg to take evasive action, would you?'' real-life
lawyer Emmanuel E. Edem of Oklahoma City asked a woman portraying a
survivor of the tragedy.
	   The fictional character, named Rhoda Abbott, claimed the ship
was unsafely built and operated _ brittle rivets, not easily
maneuverable, not enough lifeboats and a lookout crew without even
a pair of binoculars.
	   The fictional Mrs. Abbott sued the ship's manufacturer,
Harland-and-Wolfe.
	   And then there was the women-and-children-first policy. The
woman and her teenage sons survived but her husband didn't, and
thus she said she planned to file a whole new lawsuit against the
ship's owner, White Star Line, based on sex discrimination.
	   The ABA event was conducted as if modern product-liability laws,
legal skills and courtroom technology had been transported back to
the time of the Titanic.
	   Photos of the ship and blowups of White Star Line document were
projected onto large screens to help the audience _ acting as the
jury _ understand the lawyers' arguments and questioning of
witnesses.
	   Even some of the lawyers themselves _ women and blacks _ likely
would not have been seen in a courtroom back then.
	   ``It's an opportunity to see how the best lawyers present the
most complicated cases,'' said Robert H. Alexander of Oklahoma
City, the lawyer who chaired the program. ``It gives a framework
for appreciating how much the law has changed in the years since
Titanic.''
	   The true-life lawsuits over the Titanic's sinking were settled
without coming to trial. The largest American settlement was dlrs
5,000 to a well-to-do family, while the largest British settlement
was dlrs 50,000 to a large company, Alexander said.
	   These days, the claims would be in the millions.
	   Edem closely questioned the fictional survivor about whether she
would have set foot on the ship if she knew of the structural
defects she now claimed were partly responsible for her husband's
death.
	   But attorney Chilton Davis Varner of Atlanta, representing the
ship's manufacturer, asked a series of questions designed to show
the real problem was White Star Line's operation of the ship and
actions after it struck the iceberg.
	   The ship's owners overruled the manufacturer's recommendation to
install enough lifeboats for the 2,000-plus passengers, she said,
displaying documents to back her statements up.
	   And the ship did take almost three hours to sink, Varner said.
	   ``Harland-and-Wolfe provided almost three hours of time during
which, had there been sufficient lifeboats and sufficient training,
you and your family might have escaped,'' she said.
	   The verdict? The shipbuilder was liable and must pay $1.5
million.

Spirit of executed revolutionary haunts Grenada 15 years later

	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Fifteen years have passed, but the
execution of charismatic Cuban-allied revolutionary Maurice Bishop,
and the bloody U.S. invasion that followed, still haunt this island
perfumed by frangipani and nutmeg.
	   ``The same people he helped turned and killed him,'' the former
leader's mother, Alimenta Bishop, said Monday before meeting with
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   Castro's visit, part of a historic Caribbean tour, has stirred
memories of the complex and confusing October of 1983.
	   Castro received a warm welcome from thousands of supporters at
an outdoor rally Monday afternoon held at a sports field decorated
with small red, green and yellow flags.
	   As he stood up to speak, thunderous chants of ``Fidel. Fidel''
roared from the crowd. Before he could speak, the audience starting
singing a song from the 1979 Grenadian Revolution: ``Forward march.
Forward march against imperialism.''
	   Castro referred to the anniversary of the abolition of slavery
in the British-ruled Caribbean 160 years ago, then likened the
oppression of slavery to the U.S. embargo against Cuba.
	   ``Those who took a part of our wealth later, they are the great
countries, the rich countries now ... thanks to the sweat and blood
of slaves and natives,'' he said. ``If slavery could not last
forever, the blockade cannot last forever.''
	   He and Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell congratulated
Grenada's Caribbean neighbors for defying U.S. pressure and said
they believed the embargo's end was near. ``The American people
themselves, the same way they did during the war in Vietnam, the
American people themselves will put an end to that cruel and unfair
action,'' Castro said.
	   Mitchell also endorsed Cuba for acceptance back into the
Organization of American States, which has shunned the communist
island.
	   Earlier, Mrs. Bishop hugged Castro and took him into her home.
Afterward, neither she nor her guest would discuss their meeting.
	   But in an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Bishop, 83,
agreed to talk about her son's last days, saying she blamed his
death only on hard-line Marxists in his New Jewel Movement who
betrayed him _ not the United States, or Cuba, or the Cold War.
	   In 1979, Bishop ousted the corrupt and dictatorial regime of
Eric Gairy, believed here to have used powers from the dark side of
the African-inherited Obeah religion.
	   The handsome revolutionary, who won the hearts of many
Grenadians, rankled Caribbean neighbors and the United States with
his close ties to Castro. But when he was ousted in early October
1983, it was by allies who thought him ideologically too soft.
	   Hundreds of supporters formed a human shield around Bishop when
he was taken from house arrest to the military headquarters at Fort
George several days later.
	   But their protection was inadequate: tanks moved in and soldiers
lined Bishop and his colleagues _ including his lover and Education
Minister Jacqueline Creft _ against a stone wall and shot them.
Many jumped from the back wall of the fort, some to their deaths.
Fire trucks had to wash the blood from the wall.
	   The United States had never been enamored of Bishop, but liked
his fearsome successors even less. A few days after the execution,
President Ronald Reagan sent a U.S.-led invasion force to the
island.
	   Armed Cuban construction workers who had been building an
airport were kicked out after what was the only American-Cuban
fighting of the Cold War.

UNITED NATIONS: in talks.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Earlier, Butler said Iraq turned down his proposal for a plan of
action to end the inspections that began after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``We did not make the progress I have hoped for,'' Butler told
reporters. ``I do not know whether we are going to meet tomorrow.''
	   His comments followed harsh criticism by Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, who said Butler was serving U.S. interests by
trying to prolong punishing sanctions on Iraq.
	   Aziz said the U.N. Special Commission was ``back to its old
games, to its old tricks.''
	   The commission, which Butler heads, is responsible for ensuring
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as
required by U.N. resolutions that followed the Gulf War.
	   The comments by both sides followed some optimism that they were
on track to ending the inspections. But after the two rounds of
talks Monday, the two sides seemed headed for a crisis.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.
	   Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's progress in
reaching the goal and instead focusing on ``minor issues which make
no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq. ... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   Neither Aziz nor Butler gave specifics on what was discussed
Monday, but the ``blueprint'' Butler presented the Iraqis during
his last visit in June calls for further disclosures about the
country's missile program and biological and chemical weaponry.
	   ``Butler had a road map,'' Turk, the Council President said as
he left U.N. headquarters in New Yorkafter what he described as a
``long day'' of consultations wiht other ambassadors. ``That road
map has to be developed further.''
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said that the sanctions
must be lifted this year _ the first time he had set a deadline.
Iraq says the sanctions have caused widespread poverty,
malnutrition and illnesses among its 22 million people.
	   Butler was scheduled to remain in Baghdad until Wednesday.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Talks between Iraq and the United Nations
on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have collapsed,
and the chief U.N. inspector was cutting his trip to Baghdad short,
the President of the U.N. Security Council said Monday. Richard
Butler would be in New York by Wednesday at the latest to brief the
council, said Danilo Turk, the Slovenian ambassador to the Council
and its current President. Butler was unlikely to get clearance to
fly out of Baghdad before dawn Tuesday. ``This is a difficult
moment,'' Turk said. ``It is not easy to have the discussions cut
short, it is disturbing. We will have to see what Mr. Butler
brings.'' Turk said he had consulted with fellow council members,
and was not clear yet what caused the breakdown in talks. (IRAQ)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid agencies were
struggling to reach tens of thousands of refugees camped in the
woods of Kosovo province, after Serb attacks forced them to flee
their villages. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
planning an aid convoy Tuesday for ethnic Albanians near Malisevo,
a former stronghold of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army,
where thousands of refugees had sought shelter. Serb forces toppled
three additional ALA strongholds Monday, Serb sources said. These
included the villages of Laura, Monica and Jablanica. The attacks
come days after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic promised to
stop his attack on the KLA. Milosevic also pledged last week to
``personally guarantee'' access for refugee agencies trying to
bring aid to displaced ethnic Albanian civilians. Nevertheless,
U.N. refugee official Mons Nyber said Monday that access had been
``on and off.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's capital remained under a curfew
Tuesday as troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila set up
roadblocks throughout the city and searched for renegade Rwandan
mercenaries. In eastern Congo, military officers proclaimed
themselves in open revolt against Kabila and urged the population
to oust the president. About 14 months after charging victoriously
into Kinshasa, the rebel alliance that carried Kabila to power
appears to be unraveling. ``The government asks the people of Congo
and those foreigners here in the country to stay calm and to stay
at home until order is restored,'' said an abrupt announcement
Monday morning on state-controlled People's Radio. ``Stay at home
just until that time when the armed forces of Congo re-establish
civil order.'' (CONGO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Palestinian negotiators met Monday
night in a round of talks the Palestinians said would be the last
if no progress was made toward an overdue West Bank troop
withdrawal. The talks between chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat and Israeli envoy Yitzhak Molcho lasted several hours at an
undisclosed location in Jerusalem, and neither negotiator was
reachable for comment at the conclusion. Erekat and his staff then
left for Gaza where they were expected to brief Palestinian
Authority leader Yasser Arafat on the talks, Arafat's office said.
Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, said earlier Monday that if the
Israelis did not bring new ideas, ``this kind of meeting cannot
continue.'' (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army pushed
ahead Monday in its drive to seize control of all of Afghanistan,
closing in on a major opposition stronghold a day after it captured
a nearby town. Though the Taliban met little resistance when it
took Shebergan on Sunday, the militia will get a fight in
Mazar-e-Sharif, a northern alliance spokesman said. ``Our forces
are ready to defend Mazar-e-Sharif. If the Taliban try to capture
Mazar-e-Sharif, they will face heavy resistance,'' said Zabet
Saliy, spokesman for anti-Taliban military leader Ahmed Shah
Masood. ``They will repeat the mistake they committed last year.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Monday after another late
selloff as the market's steep slide entered a third week. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 96.55 points _ or 1.1 percent _ to
8,786.74 despite two fleeting forays into positive territory during
the day. The blue-chip barometer now sits about 550 points below
the record of 9,337.97 set on July 17. Broader stock indicators
also suffered hefty losses, with the smaller-company sector
continuing to draw the heaviest selling. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Americans kept spending at a strong pace in
June even though their incomes posted the smallest increase in 3
1/2 years. The combination of weak income growth and strong
spending pushed the personal savings rate down to an all-time low.
The Commerce Department reported Monday that personal incomes rose
by just 0.2 percent in June, just half of the 0.4 percent May gain.
The big decline reflected in part a loss of dlrs 2 billion, at an
annual rate, in wages because of the General Motors strike, which
was not settled until last week. A closely watched barometer of the
manufacturing sector, the National Association of Purchasing
Management's composite index, retreated again in July, dropping to
49.1 percent, down from 49.6 percent in June. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With its coffers temporarily filled by a loan from
the International Monetary Fund, Russia announced Monday that it
would not hold a government bond auction this week. ``The ministry
simply didn't announce an auction for this week because it doesn't
need the money,'' a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said. Yields on
the benchmark one-year treasury bills, known as GKOs, rose to
between 75 percent and 78 percent on Monday, from 68 percent
Friday. Stocks closed at 145.64 points, down 2.7 percent from
Friday's close of 149.65 points. Volume was minute at dlrs 12.5
million, down from dlrs 25.8 million Friday. The Russian ruble
closed lower against the dollar in slow trading as investors sold
government bonds. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Eastman Kodak Co. is buying the
medical imaging business of Imation Corp. for approximately dlrs
520 million in cash. The deal gives Kodak manufacturing facilities
in White City, Oregon, and Oakdale, Minnesota, as well as all the
outstanding shares of Imation's Cemax-Icon subsidiary in Fremont,
California. Imation's medical imaging business has annual sales of
dlrs 500 million. Approximately 1,600 of Imation's 9,500 employees
will transfer to Kodak. Imation will retain its manufacturing
facility in Ferrania, Italy, where the company will manufacture
X-ray and wet laser medical imaging film for Kodak under a supply
agreement for a minimum of two years. Under a separate supply
agreement, Kodak will supply document imaging products to Imation.
(US-KODAK-IMATION)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami has called for
reducing government monopolies on goods and services, eliminating
the red tape holding back foreign investment and cutting the
country's reliance on oil revenues. The moderate cleric, who took
office one year ago, said Iran's ``sick'' economy has suffered from
several decades of mismanagement and needs fundamental changes,
such as reducing government intervention. He outlined his
long-awaited economic proposals in a speech broadcast on state
radio late Sunday. The remarks were reported Monday in the Iran
News. (IRAN-ECONOMY)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Tiger Woods, speeding ferry, Caught in the
Act, George Bush, and Kathie-Lee Gifford. Some items may have moved
as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The father of golfer Tiger Woods says parents
must set a good example and listen to their children if they want
to earn their respect.
	   ``It's surprising how infrequently parents listen to their
kids,'' Earl Woods said Sunday.
	   Woods spoke to about 2,500 people at Hartford Memorial Baptist
Church. He was in Detroit for a golf clinic sponsored by the Tiger
Woods Foundation.
	   ``People will listen and try his advice because his son turned
out so well,'' church member Margaret Betts said.
	   Tiger Woods provided golf tips at the clinic Monday for about
125 young golfers from Detroit, Flint and Toledo, Ohio.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) _ The Cat's owners boast that it's the
fastest car ferry in North America _ a dlrs 44 million vessel that
can hit 55 mph (88 kph) as it shuttles between the United States
and Canada.
	   And now it's got its first speeding ticket.
	   Harbor Master Eddie Monat cited The Cat's captain, Kenneth
Smith, for ``imprudent speed'' after two Massachusetts boaters were
injured by its wake Saturday afternoon. Smith is scheduled to be
arraigned Sept. 19.
	   Monat said the boat dropped out from under the boaters, sending
them five feet (1.5 meters) into the air. Debra Kelley landed on
her face, and Joanne Kelley, her sister-in-law, fell on her ankle.
Both were treated at a hospital.
	   The harbor has no speed limit, but boaters are responsible for
their wakes. It wasn't clear how fast The Cat was going, but Monat
said it only hits top speed on the open ocean.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GULFPORT, Mississippi (AP) _ Showgirls dancing at two casinos on
the Mississippi Gulf Coast have been ordered to show less skin.
	   State Alcohol Beverage Control agents called for more modesty
after taking a peek at some of the Las Vegas-style shows.
	   Costumes were altered to add fabric to thongs at Biloxi's Grand
Theatre and the Grand Showroom in Gulfport, according to Jean
Herbert-Wiesenburg, spokeswoman for Grand Casino.
	   ``We will comply, but the regulations do not allow any latitude
and we will work vigorously to change these regulations,'' she
said.
	   ABC agent Mark Ford said his office suggested changes to some
costumes but did not file formal charges.
	   The agents were dispatched to the shows, he said, after patrons
complained.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Caught in the Act, one of Europe's
most successful boy groups, will make a quick farewell tour this
month before disbanding after six years together, a spokeswoman
said Monday.
	   The two Dutch members, Eloy de Jong and Batsiann Ragas, and
Benjamin Boyce and Lee Baxter of Britain, all now in their mid-20s,
will hit the road Saturday and play their final show in Magdeburg,
in eastern Germany on Aug. 16, said the spokeswoman for ZYX Records
in Frankfurt.
	   The four singers, whose hits include ``You Know,'' ``Do It for
Love,'' and ``Baby Come Back,'' also plan a greatest hits album in
September.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House of Representatives agreed Monday
with the Senate to rename the Central Intelligence Agency's
headquarters after George Bush, the only president whose resume
includes a stint as CIA director.
	   During brief debate, lawmakers from both parties extolled Bush's
long service to the nation, from his days as a World War II Navy
pilot to his years in the White House. The legislation was adopted
by voice vote.
	   The Senate already has voted to rename CIA headquarters in
Langley, Virginia, the George H. W. Bush Center for Central
Intelligence.
	   When informed of the House's action, Bush said he was ``very
pleased,'' said spokesman Michael Dannenhauer.
	   Bush became CIA director in 1976, while the agency was under
congressional investigation for abuses of power. During his year
there, Bush was credited with restoring morale to the agency's
beleaguered staff.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ It was ``Live With Winnie and Kathie Lee,
and Tigger, too.''
	   U.S. talk-show host Kathie-Lee Gifford appeared at the United
Nations on Monday to celebrate ``Pooh Friendship Day.''
	   The Walt Disney Corp. brought in 50 pairs of friends _ 25 pairs
of kids and 25 pairs of adults _ from as far afield as Australia
and Japan to celebrate international friendship day with Winnie the
Pooh and his pals Tigger, Kanga, Eeyore and Piglet.
	   Ms. Gifford _ accompanied by kids Cody and Cassidy _ sang
standards from the Pooh repertoire, along with Tyler Collins,
another stalwart of Disney albums for children.
	   The original stuffed animals on which A.A. Milne's beloved
stories are based are in a display case at the New York Public
Library.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Leftist rebels suspended peace talks
with civic leaders to protest agreements between the civilians and
right-wing paramilitary squads.
	   The decision follows a weekend of rebel attacks that left eight
dead and raised doubts about the guerrilla's desire for peace.
	   Jailed representatives of the 5,000-member National Liberation
Army, or ELN, had planned to meet Monday with business and civic
leaders in a prison near Medellin, the country's second largest
city.
	   The meeting was supposed to help pave the way for direct
negotiations with President-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes office
August 7.
	   The rebels said in a statement they would not resume talks until
the civilian leaders explain a July 26 agreement reached with
paramilitary groups.
	   Pastrana, who met Monday in Washington with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, has pledged to negotiate with both the ELN and the
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's
largest rebel group. The guerrillas have been fighting since the
1960s.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A local police association has called for the
resignation of the city's top cop, arguing he is incapable of
curbing crime or police corruption, newspapers reported Monday.
	   The National Coordinator of Security Workers also urged
lawmakers to revise labor laws to allow creation of a formal police
union that could help win pensions and other benefits, steps it
said would fight the ranks' reputation for corruption.
	   The association, representing 150,000 police and security
guards, called on city police Capt. Rodolfo Debernardi to step down
over a recent scandal in which police officers allegedly kidnapped
three teen-age girls and raped two of them.
	   Association leaders said Sunday the case shows that Debernardi
has no control over his officers.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Roman Catholic archbishop of Oaxaca state
says he spoke with leftist rebels on two occasions but stressed the
church has no intention of acting as a mediator between the group
and the government, newspapers reported Monday.
	   Archbishop Hector Gonzalez Martinez said Sunday he met members
of the Popular Revolutionary Army during religious services _ the
first time a Catholic church official has acknowledged doing so,
the daily Reforma said.
	   He did not specify when the meetings took place.
	   The rebels, known by their Spanish initials EPR, rose up in
neighboring Guerrero state in 1996 on the anniversary of a massacre
of 17 peasants by state police. The group has demanded sweeping
political reforms.
	   Gonzalez, who said neither he nor the church is looking to
mediate in the conflict, said he urged the rebels to revise their
political tactics and objectives and adopt a ``more civil''
approach to their goals.
	   ___
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A farm laborer has been found shot to
death in a region of Guerrero state where political tensions have
been high.
	   Relatives of the slain man, Juan Mejia Hernandez, 44, said they
could not explain his death since he was not involved with any
political party.
	   A family member found Mejia's body Sunday in a corn field in
Aguas Blancas, a community 16 miles (25 kilometers) northwest of
Acapulco where state police massacred 17 men in 1995. The next
year, a rebel group surfaced in the area demanding political
reform.
	   Since then there have been periodic clashes between troops and
suspected rebels or rebel supporters.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A passenger bus flipped on a mountain road in
the southern state of Oaxaca, killing four passengers and injuring
nine, local authorities reported Monday.
	   The four died at the scene of the wreck, which occurred late
Sunday in the township of Juquila Mixe, Oaxaca, about 60 miles (100
kilometers) east of Oaxaca City, the state government said in a
press statement.
	   The state government did not provide information on the
condition of the injured.
	   The bus driver, who was among the injured, was blamed for poor
driving in the accident, the government news agency Notimex
reported.

On road to stardom, weary Pak makes rest stop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ On the eve of the du Maurier Classic,
with a chance to become the first rookie to win three majors in one
year, Se Ri Pak was a weary soul surrounded by distractions.
	   She sat in the middle of a round table tucked in the corner of
an Asian restaurant, picking at her food as a stream of people came
and went _ a Korean reporter, her father, and manager Steven S.Y.
Kil.
	   There was business to be discussed _ Kil said two endorsements
from U.S. companies are in the works, and dozens of offers from
Asian firms are being considered. But Pak looked as if her mind was
far away.
	   Four days later, she was looking forward to a week off at home
with her beagle puppy, Happy. She was never in contention at the du
Maurier, finishing 13 strokes behind winner Brandie Burton.
	   ``I say every time maybe I'll play next week more better, next
week more better,'' she said. ``I'm thinking every time like that.
The important thing is to rest sometimes.''
	   The strain brought back memories for Annika Sorenstam, who was
paired with Pak the first two rounds.
	   A year ago at Pumpkin Ridge, Sorenstam of Sweden had a chance to
become the first woman to win three consecutive U.S. Opens. She was
consumed with winning to the point that she played her worst golf
of the year and missed the cut.
	   ``I put a lot of pressure on myself, and I couldn't handle it,''
Sorenstam recalled. ``Se Ri is probably a little brighter than I
am, and I don't think it's bothering her too much. It doesn't seem
to be.''
	   Pak came into the LPGA's final major of the season having won
three of the past four weeks, starting with her 20-hole playoff
victory over amateur Jenny Chausiriporn of the United States in the
longest U.S. Women's Open in history.
	   The du Maurier was her sixth tournament in six weeks, and the
schedule took its toll. After closing with a 1-over-par 73 at Essex
Golf and Country Club, Pak knew it was time for a break.
	   ``I think that's why sometimes my shot is not perfect because my
body is a little heavy or something,'' she said. ``I need rest and
will get more better. I have to learn many things.''
	   When Pak won the Open a month ago, she became the youngest woman
to win two majors and brought women's golf to front pages, similar
to Tiger Woods' impact when he won the Masters last year.
	   But Woods proceeded to take the next four weeks off, then showed
up in Dallas and won the Byron Nelson.
	   Pak won the Open, then traveled to Ohio and set an LPGA record
with a 61 on her way to tying the 72-hole scoring record by winning
the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic. Then it was on to the JAL Big Apple
Classic in New York, back to Ohio for the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic
and another win.
	   But it all caught up to her at the du Maurier.
	   Lost in the hype over Pak was a brilliant short game by Burton,
who got up-and-down on the last two holes for a one-stroke victory
over Sorenstam.
	   Burton also crashed the LPGA Tour at an early age. She left
Arizona State after one year, won rookie of the year at 19 and had
won four times, including the du Maurier, by the time she turned
22.
	   Injuries helped keep Burton winless since 1993, along with her
single-mindedness about the game.
	   ``I was so locked into golf,'' Burton said. ``I wasn't having
fun. I'll make sure I enjoy this one.''
	   There wasn't much for Pak to enjoy about the du Maurier.
	   She began rubbing her left shoulder after opening with a 69, and
said Friday it still felt ``heavy'' from too much play. A day
later, Pak had had enough of cameras and microphones thrust into
her face and sneaked off into the locker room.
	   Kil, her agent, said the six straight weeks was designed for Pak
to ``test herself to overcome toughness.''
	   Instead, she never had a chance to become the first woman since
Pat Bradley in 1986 to win three majors in a year, the first player
since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three in a row.
	   ``I think she now realizes that after six weeks, she needs to
have a break,'' Kil said. ``She's 20 years old, she's experiencing
the American tour. As she goes through this kind of experience, it
will help her to accomplish something more, something better,
something big _ winning three majors, maybe next year.''

Kabila moving against rebellious troops

 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's capital remained under a curfew
Tuesday and troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila manned
roadblocks throughout the city searching for renegade Rwandan
mercenaries.
	   In eastern Congo, military officers proclaimed themselves in
open revolt against Kabila Monday and urged the population to oust
the president.
	   About 14 months after charging victoriously into Kinshasa, the
rebel alliance that carried Kabila to power appears to be
unraveling.
	   ``The government asks the people of Congo and those foreigners
here in the country to stay calm and to stay at home until order is
restored,'' an abrupt announcement said Monday morning on
state-controlled People's Radio. ``Stay at home just until that
time when the armed forces of Congo reestablish civil order.''
	   Shops throughout the capital remained closed and the city's
downtown streets were deserted Monday.
	   A defense ministry official said loyalist troops had been
ordered to kill any Rwandan soldiers found hiding in and around the
city.
	   Pre-dawn clashes Monday at two military bases apparently pitted
Kabila's troops against Rwandan mercenaries, who last year helped
the president oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila last
week ordered all Rwandan soldiers to leave the country.
	   The fighting comes amid growing suspicions within Kabila's
government that the Rwandan troops had been plotting against the
regime.
	   Earlier, Kabila sacked James Kabari, a Rwandan Tutsi who had
been the president's top military commander.
	   According to a defense ministry official, more than 1,000
Rwandan Tutsi soldiers fled the Kokolo base in Kinshasa and are
hiding in a forest just outside of the city.
	   In the Rwandan capital, Kigali, a private news agency reported
an open rebellion against Kabila had been launched in Kivu province
in eastern Congo.
	   ``We, the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
taken the decision to remove President Laurent Desire Kabila from
power,'' said a statement read Sunday in French and Swahili over
Radio Goma, according to the Rwandan News Agency.
	   The statement was signed by Sylvain Mbuchi, commander of the
Congolese 10th battalion.

Senegal improves on last-place finish 20 years ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The last time Senegal was in the World
Basketball Championship it finished last. That was 1978. This time
the African champions finished 15th of 16 teams, beating South
Korea Monday 75-72.
	   In the game to decide 13th place, Nigeria defeated Japan 70-60.
	   Senegal features several players from the U.S. college ranks,
including Makhtar Ndiaye, who played at North Carolina.
	   But the country's isolation from the hotbeds of basketball is
still a hindrance.
	   ``The most important problem we have is the lack of contact with
international basketball,'' coach Bassirou Badji said. ``European
teams get ready by playing each other. In the future, we need to
focus more on that kind of competition.''
	   And what about being 15th instead of 16th and last?
	   ``The only good position in my mind is first place,'' he said.
``Obviously finishing on top is everyone's aim.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO. 1 FAN: Dimitris Kapaniris is 16 and Greece's No. 1 fan.
	   During the first week of the tournament, he's been the first fan
in the arena and the last to leave.
	   His trademark is the blue and white, hand-painted canvas sign he
hangs amid thousands of other fanatic Greek fans. It reads, in
Greek of course, ``The Great Greece, We Are With You.''
	   He picks Greece to win Sunday's final, but under one condition.
	   ``If we play Yugoslavia we can lose,'' he admitted. ``If we play
anybody else we can win since there's no Dream Team.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BLISTERING: Athens has been baking for a week. It's been around
38-40 degrees Celsius (100-104 Fahrenheit) daily with no relief in
sight.
	   The sizzling temperatures have set off fast-spreading forest
fires in the mountainous Pendeli region about 20 miles (30
kilometers) north of downtown Athens with vast blankets of smoke
easily visible Monday from the 18,000-seat Olympic stadium _ one of
two sites for the championship.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SOME GAMES, SOME PLAY: Greek newspapers have been reporting on
the whereabouts of various players after the games. Guess what?
They've been spotted in Athens' many clubs, restaurants and bars
along the seafront.
	   According to the Eleftheros Typos newspaper, the Americans were
seen at a club called Romeo near the beach, where they were
listening to traditional music called ``bouzouki.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO TEAM: Canadian guard Sherman Hamilton is the only player on
the 16 national teams who doesn't have a professional team to play
for.
	   A 1996 graduate of Virginia Commonwealth, he was drafted by
Sioux Falls of the CBA but released. A few months ago he had a
one-month tryout with a club in Finland, but said couldn't recall
the team's name.
	   ``I'm just trying to get (a job) for this fall,'' he said.
Anything's fine.''

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA (AP) _ With a war-induced famine killing hundreds of
people a day, representatives of the Sudanese government and rebels
fighting in southern Sudan have again agreed to put down their
weapons and look for a solution to their 15-year-old civil war.
	   The government in Khartoum announced a unilateral cease-fire
throughout southern Sudan Monday to allow humanitarian relief to
reach an estimated 1.5 million people threatened by famine. Talks
to end the fighting were set to begin Tuesday.
	   The latest cease-fire expands the scope of a three-month truce
agreed to last month between the government and the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army in the hardest-hit southwestern region of
Bahr al-Ghazal.
	   The government of Sudan ``has declared an indefinite cease-fire
as of (Tuesday) to facilitate the distribution of relief supplies
to the drought and war victims,'' Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Ismail told reporters upon his arrival in Addis Ababa Monday
evening.
	   The mainly African, Christian and animist southerners have been
fighting the Islamic, Arabized north since 1983 for greater
autonomy.
	   The last major cease-fire, brokered by former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter, was signed in March 1995 and lasted two months. The
government then extended it another two months.
	   Sudanese officials said the announcement Monday should aid
negotiations with the rebels and urged the SPLA to respond with a
similar declaration.
	   But an SPLA official in Cairo dismissed the announcement.
	   ``This cease-fire is just a maneuver for the talks tomorrow,''
said Daniel Kodi Angelo, who added that he could not comment on the
response of the SPLA leadership.
	   Aid workers estimate that about 1.5 million people are facing
starvation in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr al-Ghazal province, as
a result of drought and the fighting.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is dropping 9,500 tons of food a
month _ at a cost of dlrs 30 million _ into the south.
	   The Sudanese government and the SPLA have been holding sporadic
peace talks sponsored by the Inter-governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD), a regional cooperative of six east African
countries.
	   An IGAD source said Monday that the talks would focus on
principles of self-determination for southern Sudan and on a
referendum on the issue agreed to at the last round of talks in May
in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   The rebels disagreed over what constituted southern Sudan. They
want to include the Southern Kordofan and Southern Blue Nile
provinces, as well as the eastern Nuba Mountains.
	   The two provinces were included in northern Sudan at the time of
independence from British-Egyptian rule in 1956.
	   The two sides had also disagreed on separation of state and
religion, another issue to be discussed this week, the source said.

Italy upsets Yugoslavia; Lithuania clinches quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ This much is certain: Senegal, Japan,
South Korea and Nigeria _ eliminated in the consolation round _
won't win the World Basketball Championship. Otherwise, 10 teams
still have a chance to reach Friday's quarterfinals.
	   Yugoslavia _ regarded as the favorite _ fell Monday to Italy
61-60 as the Italians avenged a last year's loss in the final of
the European championship to the Yugoslavs.
	   And they were undone by two of their own from the former
Yugoslavia _ Bosnian-born Bodjan Tanjevic, the Italian coach, and
Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka, who hit the winning shots.
	   However, Yugoslavia (4-1) along with Lithuania, Greece, Spain,
Russia and the United States are assured of reaching Friday's
quarterfinals with only two more places up for grabs.
	   The United States handed Spain its first loss and Russia did the
same to the host Greeks.
	   The Americans (4-1), with 17 from Jimmy Oliver and 12 from Brad
Miller, rallied to beat Spain 75-73 after trailing by 11 at
halftime. Alberto Herreros led Spain with 27.
	   Russia (4-1) demolished the host Greeks 60-48 as Sergei Babkov
hit 18, one of four in double figures. Greece was led by Fragiskos
Albertis with 12 points.
	   It was a memorable win for Italy _ its first over Yugoslavia in
a major tournament since the 1984 Olympics, when they won 74-61.
	   Italy (3-2) can thank Fucka for the victory as he led the
winners with 16 points and hit the two clinching free throws to put
Italy ahead for the final time.
	   ``It was a bad gamble on the part of the Yugoslavas who thought
Fucka would not be cool enough, but this type of thing you run the
risk of missing your bet,'' Italian coach Tanjevic said.
	   ``Our victory will not mean anything unless we beat Puerto Rico
tomorrow and go to the quarterfinal,'' he added.
	   The Italians, who forced the usually tidy Yugoslav into 20
turnovers, will face Puerto Rico on Tuesday with a quarterfinal
berth on the line.
	   ``Of course it (the loss) is bad but it's not a disaster. It's
not the end of the tournament,'' said Yugoslav forward Dejan
Bodiroga.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two Olympics, booked its
place in the Friday quarterfinals with a second-round victory over
Argentina 84-75. The top four teams from each qualifying group
advance.
	   Lithuania (4-1) led Argentina (2-3) 41-33 at halftime and then
pulled away. Salulis Stombergas had 19 with 14 from Darius
Lukminas. The team's top scorer in the tournament _ Arturas
Karnisovas _ had 11.
	   ``Because they paid so much attention to me, I had to distribute
the ball instead of shooting it,'' the former Seton Hall star said.
``We kept going to Stombergas because they couldn't stop him one on
one. He was too quick.''
	   Argentina had two foul out _ Alejandro Montecchia and Juan
Ignacio Sanchez _ and was topped by Juan Alberto Espil with 18.
	   Australia (3-2) improved its chances of reaching the
quarterfinals with a 75-63 come-from-behind victory over Brazil
(1-4) and will face the United States on Tuesday in their final
qualification-round game.
	   Australia trailed 35-31 at halftime but outscored Brazil 15-4 in
the first four minutes of the second half for a 46-39 lead on a
3-pointer by Andrew Gaze. Gaze finished with 16 behind Paul Rogers'
20. Rogerio Klafke topped Brazil with 15.
	   Puerto Rico (2-3) also stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth
with a 94-81 victory over Canada (1-4).
	   Eddie Casiano topped Puerto Rico with 23 and Jose Ortiz added 15
and 10 rebounds. The Canadians were led by Greg Newton with 25
points and eight rebounds.
	   ``This is the first time we have been able to play the game we
are capable of playing,'' said Puerto Rico coach Carlos Morales.
``We are small so we go hard for the boards and try to penetrate
and shoot from the outside.''
	   The last two places are still up for grabs with Italy,
Argentina, Puerto Rico and Australia in the running.
	   In games to determine 13th to 16th place, Nigeria claimed 13th
with a 70-60 victory over Japan. Senegal finished 15th, beating
South Korea 75-72.

Leading polls at home, Schroeder tests foreign policy muscle in
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder is a man at ease. The
front-runner all year in the race to govern Germany, he strides
confidently into a room packed with foreign journalists, smoking
his trademark cigar.
	   Seven weeks before voters decide whether he will end Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's 16 years in office, Schroeder is ahead in the polls
and _ by his account _ calling the political shots in a heated
campaign.
	   ``This is of course a comfortable position,'' Schroeder said
during an interview Monday at Lower Saxony's administration
offices, from which he has governed the state since 1990.
	   Confident that he leads the battle at home, Schroeder heads to
Washington on Tuesday to take on Kohl in the one area where the
chancellor holds the advantage: experience on the world stage.
	   Hoping to neutralize that shortcoming, Schroeder promises to
stay Kohl's course.
	   ``We don't intend to fundamentally change foreign policy,''
Schroeder said. ``No matter what government emerges after the Sept.
27 elections, Germany is interested in maintaining maximum
continuity in European and trans-Atlantic relations.''
	   His broad reassurances are what Kohl's camp calls vague
platitudes aimed at convincing centrist voters that he can energize
Germany's economy without destabilizing its social net.
	   Schroeder is aware of the criticism, and deftly seizes on it
when asked to outline his vision for Germany, using Britain's Tony
Blair's campaign as an example.
	   Laughing at the suggestion that Blair's concept of a ``modern
nation'' was concrete, he quipped, ``Mine is just as concrete.'' He
did not elaborate.
	   While in the United States, Schroeder will meet with President
Bill Clinton, give a foreign policy speech at Georgetown University
and sign an agreement with officials from Indiana's Purdue
University to open a satellite business school in Lower Saxony.
	   As the election nears, Schroeder's public statements
increasingly sound like an incumbent's. He claimed credit last
month when economic indicators showed improvements, saying the
turnaround was the result of expectations that there would be a new
government, run by him.
	   And it's not just the Social Democrats' steady lead in the polls
_ holding at 41 percent to 37 percent for Kohl's Christian
Democrats in the latest released Friday _ that has fueled
Schroeder's confidence.
	   His assertive campaign has put Kohl on the defensive _ a
position Schroeder contends has weakened the government's position
with voters.
	   Schroeder's appointment of a shadow Cabinet also included some
unlikely choices, who have generated headlines on their own.
	   Economics Minister-designate Jost Stollmann called for trimming
the social welfare system and would-be cultural czar Michael
Naumann suggested that Kohl's plans for a Holocaust memorial in
Berlin should be scrapped.
	   Those ideas and others brought ``violent shrieks'' from Kohl's
camp, Schroeder noted.
	   ``I have the impression that the others are the opposition,''
Schroeder said. ``The government, oddly enough, is in a situation
where they react.
	   ``That has something to do with the expectations. A third of
Germans expect, want, a change of government.''
	   During his 24-hour visit to the United States, Schroeder said he
won't be looking for direct models to ease the country's record
unemployment. Bound by Social Democratic ideals of social justice,
Schroeder shrinks from a purely market-based system.
	   ``I think that you can learn a lot from the dynamics of the
American economy, from the readiness to decisively and quickly
adopt new ideas, and to discuss chances and risks.
	   ``The question is, `How we can make that work in Germany?''
	   He points to innovations at Volkswagen, where he sits on the
board, that allowed for shorter work weeks _ at less pay _ in
return for guarantees of no layoffs.
	   And Schroeder pointed out that American workers at Chrysler will
gain a direct voice in management of a merged DaimlerChrysler with
a seat on the board, a strictly German concept.
	   ``It became clear that one could bring together two corporate
cultures. This can become an example for future cooperation and
mergers,'' he said.
	   Perhaps his clearest statement on the limits transcending
German-American relations was unwitting. He held up the cigar which
he smokes freely in German government chambers, but which is
strictly forbidden in American offices, and joked, ``This is the
last one for two days.''

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in early
trading Tuesday on nagging concerns over the anemic Japanese
economy's recovery prospects. Tokyo stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 145.72 yen, up 0.08 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 145.60 yen
overnight.
	   In New York, the dollar continued to rally against the yen
Monday in reaction to worrisome economic news from Japan released
late last week, including record high unemployment in June, traders
said.
	   The U.S. currency's gains were stemmed in Tokyo trading,
however, on profit-taking triggered by remarks early Tuesday from a
Japanese Finance Ministry official who warned Japan may take
measures to buoy the sagging yen, they said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices dropped in
line with the yen's weakening against the dollar overnight and a
decline in U.S. stocks traded on Wall Street Monday, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average declined 97.10
points, or 0.60 percent, to 16,067.98 in the first half hour of
trading. On Monday, the index lost 213.89 points, or 1.31 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 7.92 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1,237.32. It
fell 16.80 points, or 1.33 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.215 percent from Monday's finish of 1.225 percent,
driving its price up to 111.69 yen from 111.62 yen.

Telecommunication snags illustrate India's foundering reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY339 &QL; 
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ When the Indian government's
telecommunications monopoly ended, big names rushed in hoping to
hook a middle class estimated at 250 million people to cell phones,
pagers and basic telephone service.
	   Four years later, companies like AT and T, Bell Canada and
British Telecom, all partnered with Indian companies in the
telephone projects, are admitting their dreams were inflated.
	   They stumbled into a morass of red tape that has delayed the
ability to make even the money owed the government for the right to
do business in India.
	   Telecommunications was the showpiece after India launched
economic reforms in 1991, breaking five decades of socialist-style
insularity. The telecommunications monopoly was ended in 1994, and
more than a quarter of the total foreign direct investment in India
in 1996-97 of dlrs 6 billion was earmarked for telecommunications.
	   Among the problems companies like AT and T have encountered is
finding that a deal struck with one arm of government _ the
Department of Telecommunications _ didn't clear the way to doing
business. When it came time to lay cables for basic telephone
service, the Surface Transport Ministry asked for fees on top of
the license fees owed the Telecommunications Department. When some
companies tried to avoid that extra cost by stringing their lines
from existing electricity polls, the Power Ministry made its own
demands.
	   ``Sometimes it takes longer than expected'' to do business in
India, said Virat Bhatia, AT and T's spokesman in New Delhi.
	   A new government took over in March saying it would concentrate
on developing India's infrastructure. In his budget, Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha promised to cut red tape for investors and
proposed spending 611 billion rupees (dlrs 1.5 billion), a 35
percent increase, on what he called the key areas of energy,
transportation and communications. But such pledges have been made
before, with little to show today.
	   Some things have improved. In 1991, it could take all day to
make a phone call from New Delhi to Calcutta or Bombay because
lines were so few. Intercity calls are easier now, but thousands of
villages still have no phone lines. In a country approaching 1
billion people, there are fewer than 18 million telephones.
	   In the heady early days, says entrepreneur Sunil Mittal, ``every
hotel room was occupied by bankers, consultants and technicians.
You couldn't even talk without being overheard by rivals.''
	   Mittal's Bharati Enterprises, in partnership with Telecom
Italia, launched India's first private telephone service in early
June in Madhya Pradesh state with 2,000 subscribers. Foreigners can
have up to a 49 percent share of Indian telecommunications
companies.
	   Mittal, from a politically powerful family, also runs cellular
services in northern Himachal Pradesh state and in New Delhi.
	   It took more than three years for even the politically savvy
Mittal to get to the first Bharati phone call. He said it is
gradually getting easier to do business.
	   Corruption has plagued the reform effort, though few people are
willing to discuss the issue for fear of angering government
officials with whom they want to do business. Former communications
minister Sukh Ram is suspected of taking bribes in exchange for
awarding government contracts _ federal agents raided his New Delhi
home in 1996 and found 30 million rupees (dlrs 857,000) in cash and
jewelry.
	   As for cellular, growth of mobile phone subscribers began to
slow after reaching 100,000. Revenue per subscriber was estimated
at around 2,500 rupees (dlrs 59) per month, but it turned out to be
less than 1,000 rupees per month, said T.V. Ramachandaran,
executive vice-chairman of the Cellular Operators Association of
India.
	   Nearly 8 percent of subscribers don't pay their bills, a higher
than expected default rate. The 23 cellular companies operating in
India, all partnerships between Indian and foreign companies, have
together accumulated losses of 20 billion rupees (dlrs 476
million), Ramachandaran said.
	   Individual companies won't specify what losses they have
incurred because they have not yet been able to start doing
business. And they say they did not expect to make money right
away.
	   Entrepreneurs say their survival depends on the government
suspending license fees for two to three years. Fees vary widely,
and are based on the bids the company offered to win the contract.
One company bid 140 billion rupees (dlrs 3.3 billion) over 15 years
to provide basic telephone services in Maharashtra state, while
Mittal won a similar contract in Madhya Pradesh for just 6.54
billion rupees (dlrs 155.7 million).
	   ``We made a mistake,'' said Ramachandaran, saying investors were
misled by India's annual economic growth rate of 7 percent to 8
percent in the early 1990s.
	   Growth was 5 percent in the fiscal year 1997-98, the lowest in
the last five years. Prospects were further battered by a sharp
plunge in the rupee following international economic sanctions
imposed as punishment for a series of nuclear weapons tests in May.
It will be tougher to arrange foreign funding for projects in
India, said AT and T's Bhatia.
	   Bhatia said the industry was desperate for ``a definite, dynamic
gesture'' from the government.
	   The new government is expected to pronounce in September whether
it will give entrepreneurs the fee break they have requested, a
communications ministry official said on condition of anonymity.

Indian Ocean island nation once again needs Africa

<TEXT>
	   PORT LOUIS, Mauritius (AP) _ When Mauritius became independent
30 years ago, it joined the Organization of African Unity, even
though Africa lies 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the west
across the Indian Ocean.
	   Since then, and despite the fact that African slaves were once
the majority on the island, Mauritians _ 51 percent of whom are now
Hindus from India _ have had little contact with or interest in
Africa.
	   But riding the crest of economic prosperity fueled by the
production and export of textiles and sportswear, the
2,000-square-kilometer (790-square-mile) island is again turning
toward Africa _ for land, labor, and investment opportunities.
	   ``(Former Prime Minister) Seewoosagur Ramgoolam sought to give
Mauritius the African vision and in 1976 hosted the OAU summit.
Now, it's the economic and functional that bring Africa to the
fore,'' said Uttama Bisoondoyal, director of the Mahatma Gandhi
Institute.
	   In addition to training teachers, accountants and artists, the
institute also aims to help the 1.1 million citizens of Mauritius _
whose roots are in Africa, France, India, Britain and China _ to
understand themselves and their history.
	   ``Africa is likely to become extremely important in our
future,'' Bisoondoyal said. ``There may only be a small group here
with African origins, but a greater knowledge of Africa will help
us all.''
	   Thanks to tax-free export processing zones first established in
1970, Mauritius managed to get out from under the yoke of total
dependence on sugar, which has dropped to third place in foreign
currency earnings. In 1996, it had an annual economic growth rate
of 6.1 percent.
	   The Geneva-based World Economic Forum ranked Mauritius No. 1 in
its 1998 Africa Competitiveness Report. And at about dlrs 3,690 a
year, the per capita annual income of Mauritius is 10 times that of
most continental African nations.
	   Some 90,000 people are employed in the tax-free export zones, or
about 20 percent of the workforce, most of them in the textile and
apparel sector, the country's leading foreign currency earner.
Tourism is second.
	   But labor costs are rising in Mauritius, while the economic
crisis in Southeast Asia is driving down production costs in the
regional textile sector.
	   Maurice Vigier de la Tour, director of Floreal Knitwear, which
after Benneton is the world's second-largest manufacturer of woolen
sweaters, called Africa ``the natural expansion area for this
business.''
	   Floreal employs 12,000 people in Mauritius and another 5,000 in
Madagascar. The company is planning to set up knitwear operations
in Mozambique, Lesotho and Namibia where salaries and costs are
lower than in Mauritius, a former British colony.
	   Vigier de la Tour is also head of the Mauritius Export
Processing Zone Association, which is pushing hard for passage of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's African Growth and Opportunity Act.
	   Mauritian textile exports to the United States, like those of
Kenya and several other African nations, are limited by quota. The
trade bill would remove the quotas.
	   ``The bill would allow Mauritius and Africa to gear up for
competition from Southeast Asia, Mexico and the Caribbean when
quotas throughout the world are lifted after 2004,'' Vigier de la
Tour said.
	   Mauritius and Mozambique have signed an agreement under which
Mauritian firms will be able to use 100,000 hectares (250,000
acres) of Mozambican land to set up factories, processing plants or
to grow crops.
	   Mauritian sugar companies are also expanding into Africa where
the Mon Loisir group has formed a consortium with the French Union
St. Aubin to rehabilitate a sugar factory in the West African
nation of Benin. Another consortium involving Mon Loisir will
rehabilitate a sugar mill in Mozambique.
	   In a recent editorial, the country's largest newspaper,
L'Express, said Mauritian-African cooperation should not be limited
to breathing new life into sugar refineries.
	   ``It should also be a sharing of the experience acquired in
economic management, to motivate African countries to grow on their
land ... the products that we need.''
	   Africans have been in Mauritius since the mid 1630s when the
Dutch attempted to establish a settlement on the uninhabited
volcanic island. They introduced sugar cane and deer from Java,
brought in rats and exterminated the dodo, a large flightless bird
whose meat was fancied by Dutch sailors. They also imported slaves.
	   The French replaced the Dutch and began serious sugar cane
production, with the labor of more African slaves. After the
British assumed control, they abolished slavery in 1835 and brought
in thousands of indentured Hindus from India to work in the cane
fields.
	   Although Africans were the majority in Mauritius 250 years ago,
today there are only about 30,000 Afro-Mauritians. Most live in the
southwestern corner of the country in Riviere Noire district where
they are fishermen and day laborers.

France's Testud takes first day of competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Amateur American Alexandra Stevenson
lost concentration and with it a potential upset Monday in the
Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   France's Sandrine Testud, ranked 13th in the world, was down a
set and trailed 2-1 in the second set before winning the final 11
games for a 4-6, 6-2, 6-0 victory on the opening day of the dlrs
450,000 event at the La Costa Resort and Spa.
	   Testud's comeback highlighted play on the first day of action in
the tournament featuring seven of the top 10 players on the WTA
tour.
	   None of the seeded players, including No. 1 seed Martina Hingis,
played on Monday.
	   Iva Majoli of Croatia, ranked 20th on the WTA tour but unseeded
here, was extended in a 7-6, (7-1), 6-3 victory over Alexandra
Fusai of France.
	   Former teen sensation Jennifer Capriati won her third qualifying
match _ a 7-6, (7-5), 2-6, 6-1 victory against France's Nathalie
Dechy _ to move into the main draw.
	   Stevenson, who will be a high school senior in the fall, was
playing in only her eighth WTA event. But the 17-year-old American
had never had the type of success she enjoyed Monday in taking a
lead into the second set against Testud.
	   Stevenson envisioned an upset that would improve her current
world ranking of No. 151.
	   ``I kept telling myself to stay focused,'' said Stevenson, who
has a 1-9 record on the WTA tour. ``I didn't think I played badly
but I got unfocused and made some errors.''
	   For Capriati, 22, the victory was another in her attempted
comeback from problems encountered as a teen tennis phenom.
	   Capriati has been an infrequent player since taking two years
off from the tour in 1994.
	   ``It's a humbling experience,'' Capriati said about having to
qualify for a tournament that she won in 1991 and 1992. ``But it
makes me more determined also.''

Personal bankruptcies peaking, study says, but root causes remain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICIA LAMIELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Personal bankruptcy filings, which have grown to
record levels in recent years, will level off this year and decline
in 1999, according to a recent study.
	   The decline in filings reflects a drop in interest rates, which
has enabled consumers to refinance debt at lower monthly payments,
according to the study by SMR Research Corp.
	   But it warns that the root causes of the boom in bankruptcies _
such as too much debt _ continue to worsen.
	   ``Bankruptcy remains a serious problem,'' said Stuart A.
Feldstein, president of SMR Research. ``Other than interest rates,
all the other basic drivers behind bankruptcy look worse. When
rates rise again, we'll probably see record bankruptcy filings
again.''
	   The SMR warnings are in line with projections released in July
by Visa USA, the brand with the largest number of credit cards.
Visa said that despite slower growth during the first six months of
this year, total personal bankruptcy filings would hit a new high
of 1.35 million in 1998 and continue growing to 2.2 million a year
by 2001.
	   In 1997, an all-time high of 1.332 million personal bankruptcies
were filed in the United States.
	   SMR forecasts that the growth rate will flatten this year, with
total filings between 1.25 million to 1.35 million, and decline
next year to between 1.15 and 1.28 million. Those estimates will be
lowered if tougher bankruptcy legislation currently before Congress
is passed, Feldstein said.
	   For the time being, falling interest rates have slowed the
growth of bankruptcies by lowering housing costs, which are ``the
vast majority of consumer debt,'' Feldstein said.
	   Total home mortgage debt in the United States exceeds dlrs 4
trillion. All other consumer debt combined, including credit card,
auto loans, and mobile home loans, comes to less than dlrs 1.3
trillion, SMR figures show.
	   Personal bankruptcy filings began to climb in 1984, when they
reached 282,105. They increased steadily to 893,248 in 1992, then
declined 13 percent to 773,111 in 1994.
	   Higher interest rates and consumer debt levels in 1994 and 1995
pushed up the bankruptcy again.
	   ``The main causes of bankruptcy are a host of socio-economic
problems that can lead to personal financial disaster,'' SMR said.
The study also cites other problems related to consumer attitudes
toward debt, such as the growth of legal gambling and aggressive
advertising by lawyers handling bankruptcy cases, which has helped
reduce the stigma of such filings.
	   In addition, the number of Americans lacking health insurance
reached 15.6 percent in 1996, up from 12.9 percent 10 years prior,
in 1987, according to the most recent census data.
	   ``This raises to more than 41 million the number of people at
risk of bankruptcy in the event they require hospitalization and
cannot pay the bills,'' SMR said.
	   Divorce often triggers bankruptcy, as divorced people typically
face income and expense pressures greater than married people face.
	   The average number of adult Americans over age 18 who are
divorced reached an all-time high of 9.9 percent in March 1997, and
by mid-1998 should exceed 10 percent, SMR said.
	   Proposed federal legislation, if it passes, could cut down on
bankruptcy filings, SMR said. A bill passed in June by the House,
would require bankruptcy filers above a certain income to pay back
at least part of their debts rather than having them all dismissed.
Prospects are unclear for a milder measure pending in the Senate.
	   Credit card issuers say they have tightened restrictions on who
gets credit. But consumer groups have blamed the issuers for the
rise in bankruptcies, saying they flood consumers' with enticing
offers, issue credit to people who can't pay it back, and raise
charge limits to inappropriate levels.

Americans not saving for that rainy day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Talk about a morality tale turned upside down:
Free-spending Americans are the economic envy of the world, while
the Japanese, those industrious savers, are swamped by economic
troubles.
	   Americans' personal savings rate dipped to 0.2 percent in June,
the lowest level since the government began tracking savings on a
monthly basis in 1959, officials said Monday.
	   And newly revised annual figures, which go back further, are
abysmal as well. They indicate the personal savings rate dipped to
a 63-year-low of just 2.1 percent last year. Not since the nation
was in the Great Depression during the 1930s has the savings rate
been lower.
	   But these aren't depression times. Far from it. The country has
enjoyed 7 1/2 years of uninterrupted growth. Jobs are plentiful and
incomes are rising.
	   So why isn't the savings rate going up? Especially when the 73
million Americans born between 1945 and 1964 _ one-third of the
population _ are headed into what should be their peak saving
years, their 40s and 50s, a time to squirrel away money for
retirement, given the widespread doubts about Social Security.
	   Despite the U.S. economy's current superior performance,
economists insist that savings do matter to a nation's economic
health. It is from this pool of money that businesses borrow to
make the investments in new factories and equipment that boost
productivity. And rising productivity _ more output per hour of
work _ is the key to rising living standards.
	   ``The lower the savings, the lower the investment and
ultimately, the lower the growth in productivity,'' said Mark
Zandi, economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester,
Pennsylvania.
	   But a large pool of savings is not all that's needed. The money
must also be invested wisely. And that is where Japan and other
Asian nations have gone wrong, analysts say.
	   Too often, the Asian money went into building factory capacity
that was not needed or office towers that now stand vacant.
	   ``In Japan, you had a very high savings rate but a system that
did not put capital to very good use,'' said Robert Shapiro,
Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs. ``Japan has a highly
regulated, highly insulated system.''
	   In the United States, by contrast, venture capital firms are
constantly looking for the next hot idea, ready to invest.
	   Foreigners, also, are eager to grab higher returns by investing
in the United States. That flow of foreign money offsets the
smaller pool of personal savings.
	   None of that, however, explains why the U.S. savings rate is so
low. Economists admit they don't have any easy answers. Part of the
problem lies in how the government measures the statistic.
	   The personal savings rate measured by the Commerce Department
reflects income left over after spending. But the government does
not count capital gains as income. Thus, the purchase of a car
counts as spending, even when the money to buy the car comes from
the sale of stock, which doesn't get counted as income.
	   And a rising stock market often prompts owners of stock to spend
more freely, even if they aren't selling shares to do so. That
higher spending relative to incomes has also helped to lower the
savings rate.
	   But even those factors don't entirely explain the problem. Both
Commerce's savings rate and a separate statistic kept by the
Federal Reserve have been headed lower for 50 years, during booming
markets and stock market declines. And the Fed estimates that 59
percent of American households have realized no benefit from the
bull market because they own no stock.
	   The national savings rate, which includes not only personal
savings but also business and government savings, is actually doing
better of late, because the federal government has managed to
whittle down its deficit from a record dlrs 290 billion in 1992 to
a projected surplus of dlrs 63 billion this year.
	   But policy makers still worry because those surpluses will melt
away in coming years under the strain of paying Social Security to
the baby boomers.
	   One option is the one Japan employed successfully after World
War II _ a public education campaign using billboards, radio and
television ads to drive home the point that savings are important.

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Wrapping up a Caribbean tour that
helped shatter Cuba's isolation from its neighbors, Fidel Castro
visited with the mother of a leftist leader whose death at the
hands of hard-liners in his own movement prompted the U.S. invasion
of Grenada.
	   Castro's visit with Alimenta Bishop stirred the woman's memories
of her son Maurice, a former Cuban ally, and she hugged the bearded
leader and welcomed him into her home.
	   Over the past six days, Castro has also stopped in Jamaica and
Barbados, island nations that once shunned him but are now
receptive to his demands for an end of almost four decades of
U.S.-led economic sanctions against Cuba.
	   At a rally in St. George's on Monday evening, Castro predicted
an end to the embargo.
	   ``The blockade cannot last forever,'' Castro said to roars of
approval from the crowd. ``The same way they did during the war in
Vietnam, the American people themselves will put an end to that
cruel and unfair action.''
	   Sensitive to his hosts, Castro did not once refer to Maurice
Bishop in his 95-minute speech.
	   Later this month, Castro plans to travel to the Dominican
Republic, where about 20 Caribbean leaders are gathering at a
special summit, apparently called solely to further the regional
reintegration of Cuba.
	   After Castro finished his chat with Mrs. Bishop, neither he nor
his host would comment about the visit.
	   But in an interview with The Associated Press before Castro's
arrived, Mrs. Bishop agreed to talk about her son's last days,
saying she blamed his death only on hard-line Marxists in his New
Jewel Movement who betrayed him _ not the United States, or Cuba,
or the Cold War.
	   ``There were a lot a rumors going around,'' the 83-year-old Mrs.
Bishop recalled. ``There are a lot of things I didn't know myself
because my son never wanted me to be involved too much.''
	   Bishop had ousted the corrupt and dictatorial regime of Eric
Gairy in 1979. Gairy died last year.
	   A handsome revolutionary, Bishop won the hearts of many
Grenadians, but rankled Caribbean neighbors and the United States
with his close ties to Castro. But when he was overthrown in early
October 1983, it was by allies who thought him ideologically too
soft.
	   Several days after he was placed under house arrest, soldiers
shot Bishop and his colleagues _ including his lover and Education
Minister Jacqueline Creft.
	   ``He trusted ... those Judases,'' lamented Bishop's sister Ann,
waiting for Castro with her mother. Keith Bishop, who bears a
striking resemblance to his dead cousin, added: ``He was too kind
and too soft, and that's why the hard people took over.''
	   The United States had never been enamored of Bishop, but liked
his fearsome successors even less. A few days after the execution,
President Ronald Reagan sent a U.S.-led invasion force to the
island, saying American medical students there were in danger.
	   Armed Cuban construction workers who had been building an
airport were kicked out after what was the only U.S.-Cuban fighting
of the Cold War. A democratic regime was installed. And Bishop's
killers were thrown in jail for life. The death toll included 45
Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 Americans.
	   U.S. strategists had feared the airport would give Cuba's air
force deep reach into South America. But with the Cubans out, the
Americans completed it, giving Grenada a direct link to the world
that Premier Keith Mitchell calls ``a gateway to development.''
	   On Saturday, Castro unveiled a plaque at the airport
commemorating Cuba's contribution to it.
	   Mitchell, once a Castro foe, said Castro's visit was ``an
opportunity to pursue the question of reconciliation.''
	   As Castro wound up the tour, the Clinton administration,
meanwhile, chided the countries he visited for not insisting on
democratic change as a condition for inviting him.
	   It also said the funds Castro used to carry out his tour might
have been better spent on meeting the needs of his deprived
countrymen.
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the
administration strongly believes that Caribbean governments that
engage Cuba ``ought to condition such engagement on fundamental,
systematic change by the Cuban government and respect for human
rights.''

Two major surveys show support for Obuchi at just 25 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Only one in four voters questioned support Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet, two major newspapers said Tuesday,
making it the second least popular start for a new administration.
	   The respected Nihon Keizai business daily said its nationwide
survey conducted over three days after the launch of Obuchi's
``economic recovery'' Cabinet on July 30 showed a 25.1 percent
approval rating for the new administration.
	   Another poll taken by the mass-circulation Mainichi showed
support for the Cabinet at 25 percent, with 48 percent of
respondents saying they disapproved of the new administration.
	   In recent decades, only the short-lived government of
scandal-tainted Prime Minister Sosuke Uno in 1989 had lower ratings
at its start. The 48 percent disapproval rating was the worst ever
for a new Cabinet, the Mainichi said.
	   The two surveys follow similar polls released earlier this week.
	   On Monday, an Asahi newspaper poll gave support for Obuchi's
administration at 32 percent, while one published Sunday by the
Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper, put it at a slightly higher
33.1 percent.
	   The Mainichi survey also said that for the first time the main
opposition Democratic Party had become Japan's most popular
political party. It garnered 26 percent support, compared with 19
percent for Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
	   The Nihon Keizai said its poll showed the two parties virtually
neck and neck, with 28.2 percent supporting the Democrats and 28
percent supporting the LDP.
	   The LDP suffered devastating losses in July 12 elections for the
upper house of Parliament, which forced Ryutaro Hashimoto to step
down as prime minister. Hashimoto's administration was widely
blamed for deepening Japan's severe economic crisis.
	   In a bruising leadership battle, Obuchi, a veteran LDP consensus
builder, won his party's support to become Japan's new prime
minister. But opinion surveys showed he was the least popular of
the three party candidates to take the helm of the government.
	   The Nihon Keizai polled 1,770 eligible voters nationwide between
July 31 and August 2. The Mainichi conducted its nationwide survey
on August 1 and 2, but did not say how many people it questioned.
As is customary with Japanese polls, no margin of error was given.

Disarmament talks with Iraq collapse, Butler to return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to ADD background on UN-Iraq dispute. &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Talks between Iraq and the United Nations
on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have collapsed,
and the chief U.N. inspector is cutting his trip to Baghdad short,
the president of the Security Council said.
	   Richard Butler would be in New York by Wednesday at the latest
to brief the council, said Danilo Turk, the Slovenian ambassador to
the council and its current president.
	   Butler was unlikely to get clearance to fly out of Baghdad
before dawn Tuesday.
	   ``This is a difficult moment,'' Turk said Monday. ``It is not
easy to have the discussions cut short, it is disturbing. We will
have to see what Mr. Butler brings.''
	   Turk said he had consulted with fellow council members, and was
not clear yet what caused the breakdown in talks.
	   The ramifications of the impasse were not immediately clear,
although it appeared unlikely that sanctions would be lifted any
time soon. Iraq, which wants the measures lifted by the end of the
year, has feuded with U.N. inspectors numerous times.
	   In February, tensions reached the brink of military
confrontation when U.S. and British forces were dispatched to the
Gulf to pressure Iraq to comply with the inspections.
	   U.N. chief Kofi Annan defused the situation _ and raised the
prospects of lifting sanctions _ by brokering an agreement in
February with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to open eight
presidential complexes to inspectors. The situation further
improved in June, when Butler gave Iraq a ``blueprint'' of what it
must do to comply with U.N. resolutions that must be met for
sanctions to be lifted.
	   Earlier, Butler said Iraq turned down his proposal for a plan of
action to end the inspections that began after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``We did not make the progress I have hoped for,'' Butler told
reporters. ``I do not know whether we are going to meet tomorrow.''
	   His comments followed harsh criticism by Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, who said Butler was serving U.S. interests by
trying to prolong the punishing sanctions.
	   Aziz said the U.N. Special Commission was ``back to its old
games, to its old tricks.''
	   The commission, which Butler heads, is responsible for ensuring
that Iraq has ended efforts to build nuclear weapons and eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction _ long-range missiles and chemical
and biological arms _ as required by U.N. resolutions that followed
the Gulf War.
	   The comments by both sides followed some optimism that they were
on track to ending the inspections. But after the two rounds of
talks Monday, the two sides seemed headed for a crisis.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions _ including a
ban on air travel and limits on the sale of oil _ will not be
lifted until the commission ensures the weapons have been
destroyed.
	   Aziz accused Butler's team of ignoring the country's progress in
reaching the goal and instead focusing on ``minor issues which make
no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq. ... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   Neither Aziz nor Butler gave specifics on what was discussed
Monday, but the ``blueprint'' Butler presented the Iraqis during
his last visit in June calls for further disclosures about the
country's missile program and biological and chemical weaponry.
	   ``Butler had a road map,'' Turk, the council president said as
he left U.N. headquarters in New York after what he described as a
``long day'' of consultations with other ambassadors. ``That road
map has to be developed further.''
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''

Burke: Canucks won't give in to Bure's trade demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Pavel Bure, who has said
he'll never again play for the Vancouver Canucks, isn't going
anywhere and may have to sit and stew until the right deal comes
up, general manager said Brian Burke Monday.
	   While acknowledging that he believes the reasons behind his star
player's trade demands to be ``sincere,'' Burke said he's not going
to be pressured into a corner.
	   ``He's an employee of the Vancouver Canucks and therefore to me
at this point he is no more than an asset,'' the Canucks president
and GM said via telephone. ``And I today will not promise to move
him. In fact, I'm going to make the opposite promise, that I will
not move him unless I'm offered a deal which makes sense to our
hockey club and improves our hockey club.''
	   Burke said Bure will face fines and a suspension without pay if
he refused to play for the team or fails to show for training camp.
	   ``If we start the regular season and we haven't made a deal,
then a suspension is not an option, it's going to happen.''
	   Burke said that Bure has already informed him that he will not
be at camp.
	   Bure, who broke into the NHL with the Canucks in 1991, is a
two-time 60-goal scorer and last season had 51, one of only four
players to break the 50-goal plateau. The Russian right winger has
one year left on a five-year contract which, through contract
incentives which he has met, will reportedly pay him over dlrs 8
million.
	   Burke's comments came in response to an article in Sunday's
Vancouver Province newspaper which quoted Bure's agent Mike Gillis
as saying, ``Pavel has told Brian Burke he will never play for the
team again.''
	   Burke, who took over his post in late June, said he has known of
Bure's intentions since meeting with him on July 5.
	   ``I'm not operating with any artificial timeline and I'm not
making any promises. ... If (a trade is not made) he better have a
good TV set,'' Burke said
	   Since his conversation with Bure, Burke said he has tried to
appease his star player in an effort to change his mind. Bure,
however, has not budged.
	   ``I said, `Is there anything, anything at all that I could do or
say that would make you want to stay in Vancouver?' And he said,
`No,''' Burke said.
	   Burke said he has yet to receive any trade offers since the
story came out, and will ``jump into it tomorrow.''
	   Bure was not available for comment.
	   The newspaper quoted Bure as citing ``personal reasons'' for no
longer wanting to play for the Canucks.
	   Among the reasons that he would discuss included not wanting to
stick around during the Canucks' rebuilding phase. The club has
missed the playoffs for two straight seasons and underwent a
wholesale shakeup of its roster and front-office staff since last
November, including the arrival of Burke and coach Mike Keenan.
	   Bure's contract battles began from almost the minute he first
signed his current five-year deal in the summer of 1994. Despite
guarantees in his contract, Bure was forced to battle the Canucks
for the money they failed to pay him during the NHL lockout that
gutted half of the 1994-95 season.
	   He has also been unhappy with the Canucks' travel schedule, and
is also frustrated by the amount of attention he attracts in the
city from fans, some of whom hang out in front of his posh home.
	   Bure ran into injury problems, missing most of the 1995-96
season with a knee injury. He then played most of the 1996-97
campaign despite headaches and dizzy spells resulting from a
concussion before the season.

French woman injured climbing Philippine volcano
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEGAZPI, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers on Tuesday were trying to
reach a French woman reportedly injured after falling off a ravine
while climbing a volcano, disaster officials said.
	   Two air force helicopters with paramedics were sent to the
eastern side of the Mayon volcano which the woman and her two
companions had climbed early Monday.
	   The woman reportedly suffered head and leg injuries but it was
not immediately known how serious her condition was, said Cedric
Daep, the Albay provincial disaster operations officer.
	   The three French tourists, whose names were not immediately
available, hired a local resident to guide them up the 2,462-meter
volcano (8,125-foot) volcano.
	   The woman apparently slid off a ravine after they became
separated from their guide. The guide later found them about 500
feet (151 meters) up the slope of the mountain Monday afternoon and
reported the incident to local authorities, Daep said.
	   The other tourists were a man and woman.
	   Governor Al Francis Bichara said the tourists did not use
certified guides from the local tourism office and did not inform
local authorities they had planned to climb the volcano, about 320
kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Manila.
	   Mayon, one of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines, last
erupted in February 1994 killing at least 70 people.
	   After the 1994 erutpion, the government declared an area six
kilometers (3.75 miles) around the summit as a permanent danger
zone off limits to tourists and local residents.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ MaliVai Washington defeated No. 13 seed Jan
Siemerink of the Netherlands 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 on Monday to advance to
the second round of the dlrs 2.4 million Du Maurier Open.
	   Washington next faces Canada's Bobby Kokavec, who downed Steve
Campbell 6-1, 6-2 for his first match victory on the ATP Tour.
	   ``MaliVai is obviously playing well,'' Kokavec said. ``I'm just
going to go after my shots and not change anything.''
	   Kokavec, honored Monday as Canada's most improved tennis player,
is ranked No. 347 in the world.
	   ``For me, ranking is just a number,'' Kokavec said. ``I feel
like anyone in the top 500 can beat anyone if they play good
because anybody can have a bad day.''

(14-12), 7-6 (7-4) by 10th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia.
	   ``I served good in the tiebreakers,'' Ivanisevic said. ``Usually
in tiebreaks the advantage goes to the guy who is serving better
and bigger and in this case that was me.
	   ``In the second tiebreak, I made some good returns and I was
never scared that I could lose the match.''
	   Also, Vince Spadea downed Australia's Andrew Illie 6-3, 6-0;

Disarmament talks with Iraq collapse, Butler to return

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Talks between Iraq and the United Nations

	   Turk said he had consulted with fellow council members, and was

	   But a U.S. State Department official said the decision to pull
out was Iraq's.
	   ``Iraq's action to break off talks is disturbing. We, of course,
want to wait for Chairman Butler's report to the council, probably
on Thursday, before assessing what cancellation of the talks
means,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Two major surveys show support for Obuchi at just 25 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with reports of finance minister hinting at permanent tax
cuts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Only one in four voters questioned support Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet, two major newspapers said Tuesday,
making it the second least popular start for a new administration.
	   The respected Nihon Keizai business daily said its nationwide
survey conducted over three days after the launch of Obuchi's
Cabinet on July 30 showed a 25.1 percent approval rating for the
new administration.
	   Another poll taken by the mass-circulation Mainichi showed
support for the Cabinet at 25 percent, with 48 percent of
respondents saying they disapproved of the new administration.
	   In recent decades, only the short-lived government of
scandal-tainted Prime Minister Sosuke Uno in 1989 had lower ratings
at its start. The 48 percent disapproval rating was the worst ever
for a new Cabinet, the Mainichi said.
	   The polls come as the new administration scrambles to convince a
skeptical public it is serious about its pledges to lift Japan out
of recession and clean up the bad loan mess in the country's
banking system.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, the lynchpin of Obuchi's
self-styled ``economic recovery Cabinet,'' hinted Tuesday that the
government may introduce 4 trillion yen (dlrs 27.4 billion) in
permanent income tax cuts next year, Kyodo News reported.
	   The government has already implemented special income tax relief
worth 4 trillion yen (dlrs 27.4 billion) for 1998.
	   The surveys conducted by the Mainichi and the Nihon Keizai
follow similar polls released earlier this week.
	   On Monday, an Asahi newspaper poll gave support for Obuchi's
administration at 32 percent, while one published Sunday by the
Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper, put it at a slightly higher
33.1 percent.
	   The Mainichi survey also said that for the first time the main
opposition Democratic Party had become Japan's most popular
political party. It garnered 26 percent support, compared with 19
percent for Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
	   The Nihon Keizai said its poll showed the two parties virtually
neck and neck, with 28.2 percent supporting the Democrats and 28
percent supporting the LDP.
	   The LDP suffered devastating losses in July 12 elections for the
upper house of Parliament, which forced Ryutaro Hashimoto to step
down as prime minister. Hashimoto's administration was widely
blamed for deepening Japan's severe economic crisis.
	   In a bruising leadership battle, Obuchi, a veteran LDP consensus
builder, won his party's support to become Japan's new prime
minister. But opinion surveys showed he was the least popular of
the three party candidates to take the helm of the government.
	   The Nihon Keizai polled 1,770 eligible voters nationwide between
July 31 and August 2. The Mainichi conducted its nationwide survey
on August 1 and 2, but did not say how many people it questioned.
As is customary with Japanese polls, no margin of error was given.

Sydney signs with USOC for coin marketing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Coins commemorating the Sydney 2000
Games will be the most widely marketed in Olympic history following
the signing of a marketing agreement with the United States Olympic
Committee.
	   The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
announced Tuesday that 21 months of negotiations had resulted in
the access marketing agreement through a wide range of distributors
in the United States.
	   ``A comprehensive marketing strategy has been developed to
ensure the broadest possible distribution of the coins throughout
the U.S.,'' committee executive Don Mackay-Coghill said in a
statement.
	   Access agreements to market Sydney 2000 coins pressed at the
Royal Australian Mint and the Perth Mint had already been signed
with 44 countries, and a further 16 were expected to join the
program, Mackay-Coghill said.
	   Eight gold coins, 16 silver and 28 aluminum bronze coins are
being released progressively between October of last year and May
2000. (djp)

Dollar slips in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall moderately
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar and bond
price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday
morning after Japanese finance officials warned there may be
intervention to halt the yen's slide. Tokyo stock prices fell
moderately.
	   The dollar bought 144.81 yen in mid-day trading, down 0.83 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
145.60 yen overnight.
	   Finance Minster Kiichi Miyazawa said intervention in the foreign
exchange markets is necessary if currency moves are disruptive,
adding that similar comments last week weren't meant to imply that
intervention to support the yen was unnecessary.
	   Separately, Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the international bureau
with the Finance Ministry, warned that Japan is prepared to take
action against the ``excessively weak'' yen.
	   The comments combined to push the dollar down from 146.05 yen,
its morning high, traders said.
	   It was Miyazawa's assertion last week that intervention should
occur only when currency moves are disruptive that prompted dollar
buying.
	   But the different emphasis this time, and Miyazawa's suggestion
that he had been misinterpreted previously, helped boost the yen,
traders said.
	   On Monday, the dollar climbed to a seven-week high against the
yen amid a perception that a turnaround in Japan's economy could
take time.
	   Meanwhile, stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued to
fall as a drop in bank issues was weighing on overall market
sentiment. But the yen's recovery trimmed the losses, dealers said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 48.30 points,
or 0.30 percent, to 16,116.78 at the end of the morning session. On
Monday, the index lost 213.89 points, or 1.31 percent.
	   Domestic institutional investors were among sellers of bank
shares on worries that restructuring of the nation's banking
industry will take a toll on the sector.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 7.28 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,237.96. It
fell 16.80 points, or 1.33 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.245 percent from Monday's finish of 1.225 percent,
driving its price down to 111.47 yen from 111.62 yen.

Cambodian officials vow to speed trial of alleged Khmer Rouge
</HEADLINE>
killer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian justice officials said
Tuesday that they are working to speed up the trial of a former
Khmer Rouge guerrilla suspected of ordering the killing of three
Western tourists in 1994.
	   Nuon Paet was arrested Saturday for heading a band of guerrillas
who halted a train in the southern province of Kampot, abducted and
allegedly killed David Wilson, 29, of Australia, Mark Slater, 28,
of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, of France.
	   Justice Minister Chem Snguon said he has requested the
provincial court of Kampot, where the slayings took place, to
transfer the case to Phnom Penh within the next few days.
	   The deputy chief of the Phnom Penh court, Nop Sophon, said once
he receives the go-ahead, ``we will start handling the case
immediately.''
	   Nuon Paet was arrested in Phnom Penh after the government lured
him to the capital from the former guerrilla stronghold of Pailin
with a bogus business deal.
	   He is being detained at the capital's dilapidated T-3 prison.
	   Though the three Western backpackers were killed in Kampot, from
where the warrant for Nuon Paet's arrest was originally issued,
Cambodian leader Hun Sen over the weekend said that he wanted the
trial to be held in Phnom Penh ``for security reasons.''

Thai army, short of cash, offering troops unpaid leave: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's army, short of cash because
of the country's economic crisis, is encouraging its troops to take
a month's unpaid leave, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
	   The army's budget for troop daily allowances is only sufficient
for 11 months of the year, and some army units are short of fuel
for their vehicles, the paper said.
	   Training budgets have also been cut by 60 percent, and Army
Commander in Chief Gen. Chetta Thanajaro has ordered commanders to
suspend construction and procurement projects and divert the money
to training programs.
	   The army has also launched projects where soldiers grow their
own food on bases to cut costs.
	   Thailand is battling its worst economic crisis in modern times,
and the military, once immune to budget cuts because of its history
of launching coup d'etats, has also had to reduce its expenses.
