MAVS STUMBLE IN NEW JERSEY DESPITE HOLDING LATE LEAD

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Don Nelson will have to wait to enter
the 900-win fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of victory, the Mavericks collapsed down the
stretch and lost, 98-95, yesterday to the New Jersey Nets before a
Saturday-matinee crowd of 13,682 at Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks wind up this three-game road trip at 6 tonight
against the Detroit Pistons at the Palace of Auburn Hills. But
before they take on the Pistons, the Mavericks are still trying to
figure out how they lost to the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just shot ourselves in the foot once again in a game we
should have had,'' guard Michael Finley said. ``Every loss is
tough, but this one was tough because we were put in a situation
where we could have won the ballgame, but we just came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks led 91-86 with 3:14 left, but errant shots and
blown defensive assignments helped leave Dallas with a 13-26 record
and prevented Nelson from joining Lenny Wilkens, Pat Riley, Red
Auerbach, Bill Fitch and Dick Motta as the only NBA coaches with
900 career wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks also wasted another 30-plus-point outing from
Cedric Ceballos. Ceballos scored 39 points in Monday's loss to
Houston, and pumped in a game-high 36 against the Nets on 17-of-26
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos also was involved in one of the game's crucial plays.
With 31.6 seconds left and Dallas up, 95-94, Ceballos drove hard to
the basket, but his hook shot was rejected by Kerry Kittles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where he came from,'' Ceballos said. ``I saw the
shot go up clean, and he just came out of nowhere and got it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets picked up the loose ball, and point guard Stephon
Marbury (20 points, eight assists) zipped downcourt for a layup and
a 96-95 Nets lead with 24.5 seconds remaining. But instead of
calling a timeout, the Mavericks worked the ball downcourt, and in
the confusion, Hubert Davis missed a running jumper with 4.3
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was on different pages,'' Finley said. ``I was
calling for Ced to come get the ball. He thought that the play was
called for Dirk \RNowitzki\S to get the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was just scattered, and it was kind of hectic at the
end. And I ended up throwing a \Rcrosscourt\S pass to Hubert that
almost was stolen, and Hubert threw up a desperation runner, and
that's how the game went.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Burrell hit a pair of free throws with 4.3 seconds left to
give the Nets some breathing room. After a Mavericks timeout,
Nowitzki stepped on the 3-point line and missed a long two-point
shot at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a bad move,'' Nowitzki said. ``They switched
everything, so I had Marbury on me, and I didn't want him to steal
the ball, so I did a spin move and I was on the line. Maybe I
should have shot it over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Ceballos, the Mavericks contributions were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Davis scored 13 points and kept a stranglehold on first place in
the NBA in 3-point shooting with a 3-for-3 effort. Finley (5-of-18)
struggled for 10 points, seven rebounds and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki was 4-of-11 from the floor with 11 points and 10
rebounds. Shawn Bradley had 10 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were dealt a big blow when forward Gary Trent
aggravated his tender left groin when his shot was blocked by
Kittles. Trent, whose availability for tonight's game is unknown,
did not play after the first quarter and finished with only four
points and two rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally couldn't get the ball in the bucket, but coach
kept calling my number,'' Finley said. ``Everything that could have
gone wrong, went wrong in those last couple of minutes.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M PULLS SHOCKER ON OKLAHOMA STATE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ When Oklahoma State's 12th-ranked
Cowboys arrived at Reed Arena yesterday, they were welcomed by a
struggling Texas A&AMP;M team with four freshmen in the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   They departed a few hours later with the throbbing beat of the
/Aggie War Hymn'' reverberating in their heads, as hundreds of
screaming patrons gathered a midcourt to mob the home team. Some
were a bit tentative, since it's a routine that hasn't happened in
a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this is a beginning of what Aggie basketball will be
like in the future,'' said coach Melvin Watkins, following a 64-59
victory over the stunned Cowboys (14-2, 3-1 Big 12).
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to start somewhere, and today was as good a day as
any.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Aggies (6-10, 2-3), facing their fourth ranked team in
the past five games, it was a day that seemed to defy logic.
Trailing 43-35 early in the second half, they were being wiped off
the boards by OSU and missing free throws with alarming
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beginning to look like another one of those games,''
said Bernard King, who led the Aggies with 17 points and nine
rebounds. ``But we said, `Not this night,' '' and a comeback that
broke a string of 29 consecutive losses to ranked opponents was
soon under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a moment when things were looking pretty bad,'' said
Jamaal Gilchrist, ``but the coaches called us over and said, `Get
your heads up ... don't quit, keep fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the game's complexion changed and, as OSU's
Glendon Alexander noted, ``They stuck around, and when the momentum
changed, they bit us like a wounded dog.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the Aggies had their first victory over a
ranked team since an 81-70 victory over 15th-ranked TCU in the
opening round of the 1987 Southwest Conference tournament. The last
victory over a team ranked higher than OSU was a 1982 victory over
fifth-ranked Texas.
</P>
<P>
   OSU still seemed in command when Desmond Mason gave the Cowboys
a 45-39 lead with 17:30 remaining. But it would be six minutes and
20 seconds before Oklahoma State scored again. Mason _ who riddled
Texas with 30 points in a showdown of ranked teams Wednesday, soon
picked up his fourth foul and sat out much of the last half. He
scored only two more points, finishing with 19.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the wounded dog kept biting. In the second half the
Aggies improved on a 2-of-10 first-half performance from the line
and evened a 10-rebound deficit and, as Cowboys coach Eddie Sutton
noted, ``They had 17 offensive rebounds and killed us in the second
half. They scored four or five times on rebounds after missed free
throws and that just shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With 2:37 left, OSU's last lead disappeared when Aaron Jack's
two free throws lifted A&AMP;M to a 58-57 lead. A jumper by Larry Scott
and free throws by Gilchrist and Jack pushed it to 62-57 with 27
seconds left. The Cowboys then lost a key possession when they let
the ball slip out of bound.
</P>
<P>
   OSU's last gasp _ a hook by Fredrik Jonzen _ was countered by
two King free throws with nine seconds left, and it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenged them at halftime to be aggressive on the boards,
and I told them if they didn't come back, I wouldn't feed them
tonight,'' Watkins quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing all these ranked teams, and I think it made
us better,'' Gilchrist said. ``We wanted to beat one of them _ just
one _ and this was the game. I know it's just one win ... but, oh
my, it feels good. I'm happy for the school and the fans _ it was
great to have them out there screaming and dancing and pounding on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the gym, OSU point guard Doug Gottlieb shook his head
and said, ``For years, our goal has been to be in the top 10, and
after beating Texas, we would have been there if we'd won this one.
It's so disappointing.''

OKLAHOMA NUDGES IOWA STATE IN OT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Kansas learned it. Oklahoma State was schooled.
And so was Iowa State. They found out that winning on the road,
especially in conference play, isn't exactly life in the fast lane.
More like life in the on-coming lane.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones entered the day one of three undefeated teams in
Big 12 Conference play. And yesterday's 80-75 double-overtime loss
to No. 17 Oklahoma (15-3, 3-2) handed Iowa State (16-3, 4-1) its
first league loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw some of the other top teams lost and we knew this could
be a turning point for us,'' said Sooners guard Tim Heskett, who
came off the bench to score 18 points and lead an OU 3-point
downpour. ``We had lost two on the road and you've got to defend
your home court. We needed to win this one.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing two consecutive road games, Oklahoma was faced with
a must-win situation. And the Sooners nearly fumbled it away.
Victor Avila, who is averaging 4.6 points per game, scored all of
OU's four points in the first overtime. The Cyclones' Jamaal
Tinsley had his driving shot rim out at the end of regulation. And
Michael Nurse made just one of two free throws with 4.8 seconds
remaining at the end of the first OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of chances and we didn't capitalize on it,'' said
Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy, whose team's school-record 13-game
winning streak ended. ``I can't believe Jamaal's layup didn't go
in. You've got to win games like this. This was a great opportunity
that got away.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 16 points late in the first half and trailing 52-38 with
6:47 remaining, the Cyclones nearly stole a road victory.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's zone defense limited Iowa State to a season-low 19
first-half points and 30 percent shooting. The Cyclones went the
last 7:47 of the first half without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy's pleas to attack the Sooners' zone started to sink in,
particularly late in the second half. Iowa State overcome OU's lead
by forcing turnovers and converting. Nurse, who had just three
points at halftime, scored 16 after intermission. His 3-pointer
with 1:38 remaining in regulation tied it at 59-all.
</P>
<P>
   In the first overtime, neither team's top player took a shot.
Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera (25 points, 14 rebounds), though, got hot
in the second overtime while Iowa State's Marcus Fizer (20 points,
six rebounds) missed his only attempt. In 48 minutes, Fizer
(averaging 20.8 points per game) managed just 13 shots.
</P>
<P>
   After 3-pointers by Heskett and J.R. Raymond gave the Sooners a
69-67 lead, Najera's three-point play with 2:18 remaining provided
some separation. On OU's next possession, Najera beat a double team
with a pass to the corner to Heskett. Swish. 75-69 lead with 1:37
remaining. Ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make that pass to Tim 100 times out of 100,'' said
Najera, who was involved in 10 of OU's 17 points in the second OT.
``I knew he'd make that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy and Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson described the game as
a slugfest. Heskett talked to the media wearing four ice packs _
one on each shin, one on his left knee and one on his back. He also
had a bandage on his left elbow. Najera wore a post-game ice pack
on his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids bent,'' said Sampson, whose team hit 13 3-pointers.
``But these kids are tough. Hesketh can't touch the rim. But
there's a lot to be said for making open shots.'' \Ntagtop:Wendell

TEXAS TECH PRESSURE OVERWHELMS KANSAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK _ The Texas Tech Lady Raiders employed a ``hands-on''
approach during yesterday's Big 12 game against No. 23 Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Little went uncontested by the 15th-ranked Lady Raiders, who
transformed a matchup between two nationally ranked programs into
no contest during their 76-56 victory at United Spirit Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive-minded Lady Raiders' fingerprints covered the
basketball with 12 steals and four blocked shots, and that did not
include the 23 turnovers their defensive pressure created.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that we're going to feed off of our defense,''
coach Marsha Sharp said after the Lady Raiders' 25th consecutive
Big 12 victory in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Raiders (15-2, 4-2 Big 12) went on their decisive feast
during the final four minutes and eight seconds of the first half.
Texas Tech forced four turnovers and mustered three steals and a
blocked shot during a 14-0 run that doomed the Jayhawks (12-5, 3-2)
and gave the Lady Raiders a 43-29 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started playing well defensively and got our hands on the
ball,'' said Texas Tech guard Katrisa O'Neal, who had three steals.
``That got our offense going and the crowd into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Forwards Keitha Dickerson and Aleah Johnson silenced Lynn Pride
of Kansas, whom Sharp called ``as good an athlete as we'll play
against.'' Pride, a Sam Houston High School graduate, converted
only four of her 16 shots from the field and scored a season-low
eight points during her 34 minutes before fouling out.
</P>
<P>
   Center Plenette Pierson also made the afternoon difficult for
Kansas' Jaclyn Johnson, who missed 10 of 13 shots from the field
and scored only 10 points. The Jayhawks shot only 35.4 percent (23
of 65) from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Raiders' Johnson matched her career high with 21
points, and Pierson added 17 points and 11 rebounds. Guard Melinda
Schmucker-Pharies also made 3-of-6 attempts from behind the 3-point
arc and directed the offense near flawlessly with eight assists and
only one turnover during her 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we got as complete an effort for 40 minutes as we've
had all year from everyone on the floor,'' Sharp said. ``Everyone
we put on the floor did her job.''

A VERY THOROUGH JERRY JONES KEEPS UP COWBOYS' COACHING SEARCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys' head-coaching job has come open
three times in six years, and twice in the past 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   This raises a question: How good a job can this really be?
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has spoken to a large number of
coaches, scouts and front-office personnel around the NFL that have
produced an outpouring of opinions during an intense
information-gathering process, which is heading into its third
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this \RCowboys' head-coaching\S job has become the
Bengals and the Raiders,'' scoffed one longtime NFL general manager
this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jones has indicated that most of the feedback has been
constructive. After all, the Cowboys' head-coaching vacancy still
represents one of only 31 jobs in league, and is one of only three
unfilled head-coaching positions.
</P>
<P>
   Head-coaching jobs remain open at Dallas, New England and New
Orleans after Green Bay hired Seattle Seahawks offensive
coordinator Mike Sherman and the New York Jets appear set to
promote linebackers coach Al Groh.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mike Brown in Cincinnati and Al Davis in Oakland, Jones has
the dual role of hands-on owner and personnel-involved general
manager. Although the Cowboys have won three Super Bowls since the
Bengals (1989) or Raiders (1984) have appeared in one, their
head-coaching job is one of the most treacherous in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has used his coaching search to gather ideas from those he
respects around the league on what kind of offense the Cowboys need
to run. His next head coach and offensive coordinator _ whether
it's one person or two _ are only part of what Jones hopes will
come from these conversations. He has yet to ask for permission to
interview a candidate from another team for either the job of head
coach or offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process for Jerry,'' one NFL coach said. ``He's
smart enough to use this time to ask a lot of people around the
league a lot of questions about his franchise. What do they think
of the Cowboys? What would they do against the Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   ``This might take a little time. Who knows? And if Jerry ends up
hiring someone \Rsuch as Dave Campo or Joe Avezzano\S from inside
the organization, people are going to wonder why he didn't do that
from the get-go. Well, that's not the point. The point is that
Jerry has gathered a lot of valuable information on his team in the
meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seems to know for sure what Jones will do, or when he
will do it, in selecting a successor or successors to Chan Gailey,
who was fired Jan. 11 after only two seasons as head coach and
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry is a lot like I am,'' the Raiders' Al Davis said. ``He
doesn't care about public perception. He cares about only one thing
_ winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones still covets Washington Redskins coach Norv Turner. Owner
Daniel Snyder, however, has said that Turner isn't go anywhere and
Turner has said he isn't interested in leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Turner's status quo, the recent promotion of Dave
Wannstedt to head coach in Miami and the designation of St. Louis
Rams offensive coordinator Mike Martz to Dick Vermeil's heir
apparent, has limited Jones' field of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This has resulted in a runaway rumor mill: Al Saunders, the
Rams' receivers coach and former San Diego head coach (17-22 in
1986-88); Art Shell, Atlanta's offensive line coach and former
Raiders head coach (56-41 in 1990-94), and an unemployed Lindy
Infante, who once coached at Green Bay (24-40 in 1988-91) and
Indianapolis (12-21 in 1996-97).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys are still, in my opinion, the most visible sports
franchise in the world,'' Jones said. ``Of course, that doesn't
make it a good coaching opportunity ... \Rwhat does\S is that we
have a reputation for doing whatever it takes financially to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Cleveland, Green Bay and New England reportedly spent more
money than the Cowboys last season. Jones paid $41.5 million in
signing bonuses alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jones continues the search, with few clues being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry is really tight-lipped on this one,'' the Bengals' Brown
said.

LAKERS SEARCH FOR BACKUPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coach Phil Jackson took a break from his
Bill-Bradley-for-President advocacy to offer another endorsement
with political overtones: I like Ike.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Ike Austin of the Washington Wizards, who
according to a Washington Post report, has attracted the interest
of the Lakers. Austin is languishing on the Wizards bench but could
fill the Lakers' greatest need - a big body off the bench to spell
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the prototype of what we were kind of hoping to have as a
backup center - 6-10, mobile,'' Jackson said Saturday. ``But right
now that hasn't been addressed in those terms or the kind of
urgency or the kind of seriousness that was kind of denoted in that
article. I don't know who was responsible for that (rumor), so I
can't comment on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive Jerry West indicated last week that he might
hesitate to make a trade in light of the team's success. But
Jackson sounds ready to add frontcourt depth if it's available.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to make good chemistry important as an ingredient,
but you also have to be realistic about what we have as far as
backing up power players,'' he said. ``We don't have a lot of
poundage on this team. After you get rid of Shaq, there's not a
whole lot of big bodies on this team to go against the big-bodied
teams like Portland, San Antonio and Utah.... We could use another
big body.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lakers have the NBA's best record, Jackson wouldn't
say if he's comfortable with the roster as is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say I'd be very comfortable doing it this way,
but who knows? I mean, we're sitting here with Shaq having averaged
almost 40 minutes a game... and I'm very comfortable with where
he's at physically, but today's the halfway point of the season,
and the games come a little more fast and furious toward the end of
the year. With playoffs ahead, you can always use an extra body.''
</P>
<P>
   Approving: Jackson seemed pleased with Kobe Bryant's decision to
skip the slam-dunk contest at All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be a very draining weekend, not only the attention
that you have but also the number of events that you participate
in, and it can be extremely difficult for players to recover after
that,'' Jackson said. ``I think it's a smart move for him.''

LUBBOCK _ After the road team took it on the chin in the five
earlier Big 12 Conference men's basketball games Saturday,
including nationally ranked Kansas and Oklahoma State, Texas had to
figure an upset was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But the Longhorns were having none of that.
</P>
<P>
   With only a couple of lapses that made things interesting for a
minute or two, Texas put in a business-like performance and
disposed of Texas Tech 72-69 in front of 14,045 at the United
Spirit Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Five players scored in double figures for the 14th-ranked
Longhorns. Center Chris Mihm led the way, tallying his 10th double
double of the season with 15 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Chris Owens had a solid effort as well, scoring
14 points in 22 minutes off the bench. Darren Kelly and William
Clay, with 11 points each, and Lawrence Williams (10 points) were
in double figures as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what went on in the league today, this was obviously a
big win for us,'' said Texas coach Rick Barnes, whose team is tied
for first place in the league standings. ``For the most part,
everyone that played (contributed).''
</P>
<P>
   Texas (12-5 overall, 4-1 in the Big 12) held Tech to 37.3
percent shooting and improved to 9-0 this season when its opponent
shoots less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rayford Young scored 18 points to lead Tech, which dropped to
9-6 overall and 0-4 in conference play. Jayson Mitchell and Mario
Layne added 11 points and Brodney Kennard 10 for the Red Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Texas held a 30-20 advantage at the half, but the short-handed
Red Raiders made a run early in the second period and closed to
within 39-38. But Tech never managed to regain the lead it held
five minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue could have played a role down the stretch as the Red
Raiders were forced to play four player 35 minutes or more, while
Texas had the luxury of sending seven players to the court for 18
or more minutes with only Mihm and Gabe Muoneke playing more than
30.
</P>
<P>
   Tech was playing its first game without center Andy Ellis, who
is out for the season with an injured shoulder. With Ellis and his
16.9 points and 8.9 rebounding averages on the sideline, arm in a
sling, his replacement, Johnny Phillips had four points and five
rebounds in 25 minutes. All three were season highs for the
little-used Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard got free down low against the bigger Longhorns for a
pair of layups, Layne added a dunk, and Mitchell threw home a
two-handed stuff following up a Young miss to pull Tech within
39-38 with 12:16 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams drilled a 3-pointer, and after a Young layup, Texas
regained its composure by reeling off seven straight points.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke got it going with a one-handed touch pass to Kelly for a
3-pointer. Muoneke grabbed an offensive rebound off a missed free
throw and Mihm cashed it in with a spinning layup. Kelly converted
a long pass from Mihm for a basket to give the Longhorns a 49-40
lead. Tech would get no closer than seven points the rest of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the difference in the ballgame was they made plays
when they had to,'' Tech coach James Dickey said. ``Texas just made
more plays than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey was not about to accept kudos for just hanging around the
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no moral victories just because we stayed close and
had a chance,'' he said. ``I'm not interested in being close. I'm
interested in victories.''

Rice squanders late lead in 58-56 loss
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
There are only so many of the games remaining on the schedule that
injury-riddled Rice could or should win, and Saturday's was one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose State's David Egans made an uncontested layup with
two-tenths of a second remaining off a long pass from R.J. Powell
after Rice failed to get back on defense, capping an improbable
comeback for a 58-56 victory at Autry Court.
</P>
<P>
   Egans' basket capped a 7-0 San Jose State run to offset what had
been a five-point Rice lead with 1:06 left in the Western Athletic
Conference game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what the score was, I didn't know what the time
was,'' Egans said. ``I was just trying to get there as quick as
possible. What crossed my mind was whether I should dunk it or lay
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice coach Willis Wilson said he thought he had seen everything
that could happen in a college contest before witnessing the late
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told me when I got into coaching that every day
you'll see something you've never seen before,'' Wilson said.
``That's an example of the things you see in college basketball.
Tonight was a night we had a chance to control the outcome of the
game, and we just did not do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the Owls had this game won. Rice guard Michael
Walton has deftly put in a jumper as the shot clock wound down to
give Rice a 56-51 lead at the 1:06 mark.
</P>
<P>
   But on SJSU's ensuing possession, guard Billy Landrum was fouled
by Rice center Alex Bougaieff outside the 3-point arc, and made two
of three free throws to draw the Spartans to within 56-53 with 52
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Rice then tried to take time off the clock but, with 19 seconds
to go, a pass from Mike Wilks to Walton bounced off Walton's chest
and out of bounds. San Jose missed a shot, but Darnell Williams
grabbed the offensive rebound and scored _ and he was fouled by
Bougaieff. He converted his game-high 22nd point to tie the score
at 56.
</P>
<P>
   Wilks, who led Rice with 18 points, dribbled out front before
getting the ball inside to Jay Christian. But Christian's shot was
blocked by Williams, and the game took a surreal twist.
</P>
<P>
   Rice players neglected to get back on defense as Powell took
control of the ball. He spotted Egans streaking alone up the court.
Egans took the pass in for the winning layup that stunned the Autry
Court crowd of 2,413.
</P>
<P>
   Rice called two timeouts and SJSU one as each team tried to see
how the other would line up for the Owls' last play, which would
require a length-of-the-court pass. With only two-tenths of a
second left, the Owls could not grab an inbounds pass but only tip
the ball. After a successful pass, a tip by Bougaieff missed the
mark and the Spartans escaped with the emotional victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking it was going to go into overtime,'' said SJSU
coach Steve Barnes. ``But the (game-winning) play developed so
quickly. We kicked it out before they got back.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that San Jose State (11-8, 2-2) has
defeated Rice in four meetings. The victory broke a 16-game
regular-season road conference losing streak for the Spartans,
dating back to Feb. 25, 1997, at San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, saddled with a seven-game losing streak, drops to 4-11,
0-4 in league play.
</P>
<P>
   Can Rice overcome the draining loss and win again this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if our guys believe that tonight was our best chance
to win, then we won't win a game,'' Wilson said. ``But if we
believe in ourselves and continue to get better and improve as a
team, and execute and learn from our mistakes, then we are going to
beat teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think anything other than that, then we are not going to
win a game. I don't believe that and I don't think our players
believe that.''

SAMARANCH STILL HAS A DANCE STEP OR TWO
</HEADLINE>
 REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His flamenco days are behind him, but Juan Antonio Samaranch can
still dance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a House of Representatives subcommittee last
month, the Spanish-born president of the International Olympic
Committee deftly dodged bureaucratic bullets and soft-shoed any
notion of a premature resignation.
</P>
<P>
   What the panel of eight lawmakers was trying to do, other than
shamelessly grandstand like Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), is unclear.
The subcommittee sought Olympic reforms, but Samaranch beat them to
it, unveiling the IOC's to-do list before he ever got to Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Barton wanted the 79-year-old Samaranch to resign on the spot, a
suggestion that smacked of American arrogance. I'll go if that
misbehaving president of yours goes, Samaranch could have said.
</P>
<P>
   One more time: Samaranch isn't resigning. His term expires in
2001, and there is every indication that he will stay the course
till the end. The storm of last year's scandal clearly has passed,
as evidenced by the announcement last week that two major Internet
sponsors and the Marriott hotel chain had signed on as Olympic
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch can rightfully cite progress on Olympic reforms,
because as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger _ a wise
choice as a member of the IOC's reform commission _ said, ``There
was not a single proposal that we made which was not accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton, Texas' own, showed his tackiness by disparaging
Samaranch for his alleged preference for the title ``Your
Excellency.'' The weak chiding fails to consider that the IOC is an
absurdly diverse group, whose ranks indeed include princes, sultans
and assorted royalty. The ``Excellency'' title, which Samaranch has
not encouraged in recent years, is a bow to old protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch doesn't understand why IOC matters are any U.S.
legislator's business. He fails to acknowledge that we must subject
him to the same scrutiny that we would any other foreign
businessman whose firm regularly takes away billions of American
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the subcommittee persisted, grilling the IOC leader on
things like his wife's all-expenses-paid trip to Atlanta in 1990. A
congresswoman from Colorado argued that gifts to IOC members should
be banned.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. That sort of stuff never happens to U.S. politicians.
Right.
</P>
<P>
   If asked again to testify, Samaranch said that, of course, he
would come to address the subcommittee again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were only asking questions to get information,''
Samaranch told reporters with a shrug after the first inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   His Excellency, in other words, can still dance.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON ...
Cancer latest obstacle for triathlete
There was a point, somewhere among the 26 miles of running in the
Hawaii Ironman triathlon, when Karen Smyers was passed by an old
rival.
</P>
<P>
   But Smyers wasn't thinking of losing. She was wondering about
the mystery of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had convinced myself that there must be some mistake,'' said
the 38-year-old Lincoln, Mass., native.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `How could I be feeling this good and have cancer?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Smyers has thyroid cancer. First feared after an
examination last September, she came back in October to finish
second at the Hawaii Ironman competition, completing the demanding
three events in 9 hours, 20 minutes, 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not Smyers' whole story.
</P>
<P>
   She was already an accomplished triathlete _ twice voted the
U.S. Olympic Committee's triathlete of the year _ when, in June
1997, she severed a hamstring muscle while trying to change a storm
window. She was forced to miss the race of the triathlon season.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Smyers gave birth to her daughter Jenna by Cesarean
section. Three months later, she competed in the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12 of that year, Smyers was out training when a
semi-truck struck her, breaking six ribs and separating a shoulder.
Again, she had to miss the rest of the triathlon season.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, Smyers returned to competition, placing fourth
at a triathlon in Chile. In July, she was selected by team captains
to carry the U.S. flag in the opening ceremonies of the Pan
American Games.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, she went to the doctor to be treated for
bronchitis and mentioned that she thought her neck glands were
swollen. The doctor scheduled an ultrasound examination, during
which six nodules were discovered in the area of her thyroid.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers kept training. ``The first few days after finding out
were a little bit tough,'' she said. ``I was kind of thinking
what's the point of training for the Ironman when you have cancer?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I kind of realized that I wasn't going to just lay down
and give up. So I might as well continue on. I wasn't feeling bad
or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the pain part came in November. That's when Smyers crashed
her bicycle while trying to avoid a fallen cyclist. Smyers suffered
a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I guess, after hearing all that, no one wants to get on an
airplane with me, right?'' Smyers joked.
</P>
<P>
   Thyroid cancer strikes an estimated 16,000 Americans each year.
It is a slow-progressing cancer, said Smyers' physician, Dr.
William Burtis of Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10-year survival rate with this type of cancer is about 98
percent,'' Burtis said. ``The fact that Karen is an elite athlete
in optimum physical condition, I'm sure, is all to her benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, Smyers underwent six hours of surgery to have
her thyroid and two lymph nodes removed. With her doctor's
approval, she has decided to postpone the next phase, a radioactive
iodine treatment, until after the Olympic Trials in Irving on May
27-28.
</P>
<P>
   Smyers said she has taken strength from cyclist Lance Armstrong,
a testicular cancer survivor, and from a Canadian, rower Emma
Robinson, who had the same disease as Smyers yet came back to win a
world championship six months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role model,'' Smyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily,'' she added, ``I'm not new to overcoming obstacles
and challenges, given the last couple of years. So I'm kind of
taking all this in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:QUICK HITS Olympic appeal \Nagatea:A Harris Poll of
American kids and teen-agers showed that the Olympic Games are
their favorite sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   According to the recent poll, 81 percent of young people, ages 6
to 17, enjoy watching the Olympics on TV.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of name recognition, the poll reported that 91 percent
know what the Olympics is, compared with 88 percent for the Super
Bowl and 87 percent for the World Series. Among those who said they
liked a particular event ``a lot,'' the Olympics was first,
followed in order by the X Games, Super Bowl and World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is particularly important to see that the Olympic Games
appeal to children, many of whom have only had the opportunity to
see one or two Olympic Games in their lifetime,'' said David
Ogrean, the marketing deputy director of the USOC.
</P>
<P>

FRESH START HAS OLYMPIC HOPEFUL VANESSA ATLER BACK ON THE BEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEIDI PEDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANO, Texas _ Vanessa Atler's failures were becoming bigger
news than her successes.
</P>
<P>
   Atler, the 1996 U.S. junior gymnastics champion, had fallen
during a difficult release move in the uneven bars at the past
three U.S. Championships. In each of the past two years, the fall
cost her the senior all-around title and raised questions about why
she would risk performing the move.
</P>
<P>
   Then Atler left her California gym one month before the 1999
World Championships in China. At the Worlds in October, the lack of
regular training _ and a sore ankle _ resulted in an underwhelming
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Atler returned home feeling underwhelmed about the sport. When
she found out her ankle was broken, she debated whether to quit.
</P>
<P>
   She decided instead to make a fresh start. Following the advice
of renowned gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi, she moved to Plano and
the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy, where she has rekindled her
interest _ and potential _ heading into the 2000 Summer Olympic
Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I didn't really want to quit. That's not the
kind of person I am,'' said Atler, who will turn 18 next month. ``I
just wanted to be happy again, and I feel awesome now. My goal is
to go over \Rto Sydney\S and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler says she is on the right path again. In Plano, she trains
under coach and World Olympic co-owner Valeri Liukin, the 1988
Olympic men's all-around silver medalist and high-bar champion from
the former Soviet Union. The gym has several national team members,
but Atler is its first star.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got here, we needed to pump her up. She needs to
believe that she's a very good gymnast,'' Liukin said. ``She's got
a desire to be the best. If everything's right, I think she can
be.'' \Nsubheds:DOWNFALL \Nbody:Atler said she has waited a long
time for things to be ``right'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Things started going wrong in 1997, she said, at about the same
time her coaches at Covina's Gliders Gymnastics inserted a
particularly difficult release move into her uneven-bars routine.
</P>
<P>
   Atler struggled with the move, named after Olympic gold medalist
Nadia Comaneci. The skill set the tone for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   She achieved impressive results in international competition
when the skill was removed from her uneven bars routine. When it
was included, as it was in the 1997, 1998 and 1999 U.S. Senior
Championships, the almost inevitable fall cost her. She had to
settle for a tie as U.S. co-champion with Kristy Powell in 1997,
and lost the 1998 and 1999 crowns outright.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1999 nationals, Atler said it was her decision to keep
the move in her routine. Actually, she says now, she wanted to take
the move out because it was as inconsistent in practice as it was
in competition.
</P>
<P>
   Atler said it was one of severaldisagreements she had with her
coaches, and the fall from the bars at the 1999 nationals may have
been the final straw. When she arrived home after the meet, she
told her parents she wanted to leave Gliders, where she had trained
since age 11, and her coaches, Steve and Beth Rybacki.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of little things added up, and I didn't really notice it
until championships. And it wasn't just the bars situation,'' Atler
said. ``It was more making me feel just like _ like I'm not good.
All of my confidence was down. That's not going to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler's parents, Ted and Nanette, said they weren't shocked by
their daughter's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming probably in the last year or so. She just
wasn't too happy in the gym,'' Nanette Atler said. ``I think it
worked really well in the beginning. The problem was when she
matured and started to become her own woman. She couldn't speak her
own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   After USA Gymnastics officials agreed to fly in a national team
coach to temporarily train Atler at another local gym, Ted Atler
phoned the Rybackis to inform them of the decision. Beth Rybacki, a
1980 Olympian, said the call came as a total surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no problem as far as we understood. There was really
no explanation. We never spoke to \RVanessa\S,'' she said. ``Our
relationship with that athlete could not have been any better.
Vanessa always did everything we asked her to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler said she would have preferred to fade into the background
for awhile, but instead went to the World Championships with the
U.S. team and temporary coach Arthur Akopian. In China, she had to
deal not only with the presence of Steve Rybacki, who was coaching
fellow team member Jamie Dantzscher, but an ever-worsening left
ankle injury she had originally suffered at a meet in March in
France. \Nsubheds:UPSWING \Nbody:Atler said Rybacki's presence
wasn't a problem, but the ankle was. It showed in her performance.
She hit all four routines in team preliminaries to qualify seventh
into the all-around competition but faltered in the final to place
31st overall. Citing her injured ankle, she withdrew from floor
exercise and balance beam finals.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was enough to make Atler consider quitting,
especially after an X-ray revealed a bone chip in her sore ankle.
After the chip was removed by arthroscopic surgery Nov. 1, Atler
sought Karolyi's advice and moved into a Plano apartment with her
mother. Ted Atler, an electrical technician for the U.S. Postal
Service, and brother Teddy, 20, remained in Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   Atler said she immediately felt at home when she arrived Nov.
13. She liked Plano so well, she said, that not even another bone
chip, discovered in a follow-up exam in Dallas that week, could
dash her hopes. She had surgery to remove the second chip Nov. 30.
She wore a brace on her foot for six weeks, and she recently
started working out on all four events again.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe injury\S has actually helped me a lot, in a way, because
I want to do gymnastics so bad now,'' she said. ``And I've worked
out on bars so much that I've learned all of these new skills.
\RLiukin is\S going to put in a lot more turns and stuff, which is
what I've always wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Liukin, for his part, said he has no complaints about his new
pupil.
</P>
<P>
   ``She helps me a lot, actually. She listens and says yes all the
time, and the other kids see that,'' he said. ``She has the
discipline. It kind of proves to them that this is the way to be a
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Liukin said Atler could make her 2000 debut at the American
Classic in Reno, Nev., next month, but might compete in only one
event. Her first major all-around competition will likely be the
Pacific Alliance Championships in April in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Atler said she thinks she'll be ready for the biggest test,
which should come in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I worry about is if \Rthe recovery\S is going
to take a long time, but my ankle's getting better every day,'' she
said. ``Other than that, I don't have many worries because I know
that when I'm happy I do really well.''  &LR; tagtop:Heidi Pederson

BLAZERS HOLD OFF LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a while Saturday, as the Lakers triangulated
the offense to ne ar perfection, as Kobe Bryant swished jumpshot
after jumpshot, as the sellout crowd roared with glee, one caught a
glimmer of a championship-caliber team, living up to its gaudy
record.
</P>
<P>
   Then a blur of black-shirted bodies and red headbands smashed
the image to bits.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that marked the halfway point of the season, in a
matchup of the NBA's two winningest teams, the Lakers displayed
uncanny precision just long enough to make their recent struggles a
memory.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't finish the task, and the Portland Trail
Blazers hustled and muscled their way to a 95-91, come-from-behind
victory at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers still own the league's best record (33-8) and a 2
1/2-game edge over the Blazers (30-10) in the Pacific Division, but
Portland left the building with the mental edge and a 2-1 series
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ran out of gas in that second half. I'm trying to
figure out why,'' said Lakers coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There were no obvious answers, just a flurry of missed
opportunities and slow-footed moves toward the ball. The Blazers
held the Lakers to a se ason-low 13 points in the fourth quarter to
overcome a seven-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   And when the game came down to a handful of possessions in the
final minute, the Lakers' two best weapons were on the bench --
Bryant because he fouled out (with 28 points), Shaquille O'Neal
because he's a liability at the free-throw line. And he wasn't
having a particularly effective game, settling for 17 points on
8-of-17 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   That left Robert Horry to make an almost game-saving 3-pointer
and Derek Fisher to shoot the potential game-winning shot -- a
rushed 3-point at tempt that drew only air.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't have come down to heroics from the bench, though.
The Lakers simply got outworked in the fourth -- they were
outrebounded 17-5, and Rasheed Wallace seemed to pull in every
loose ball as he scored seven of his 19 points in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of let it all slip away there, the last nine, 10
possessions,'' O'Neal said. ``We just have to sustain our defense
for 48 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with 16 rebounds, seven assists and six blocked
shots, but the Blazers kept him far out of the paint for most of
the night. And he grabbed just two rebounds in the second half as
he played 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigued? O'Neal shook his head. An explanation for the lack of
rebounding? He shook his head again. Blazers forward Brian Grant,
one of an army of defenders on O'Neal, chose the obvious
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that Shaq's playing almost 40 minutes a
night,'' Grant said, ``so we just kept coming at him with different
waves of people, and I think it really wore him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Neal wasn't on the floor at all. Jackson pulled him with
13.6 seconds to go, subbing in Rick Fox to prevent intentional
fouling of O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was missing too. After Horry's 3-pointer (on a pass from
O'Neal) pulled the Lakers within 2 points, 93-91, Bryant picked up
his sixth foul when he intentionally fouled Grant on the inbounds
play, with 14.1 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Grant missed both foul shots, and the Lakers had one final
chance. Horry took the inbounds pass from Ron Harper, then swung
the ball to Fisher. His 3-point try fell short, and Glen Rice
slapped the ball out of bounds trying to gather it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty much looking to get the ball to Glen,'' Fisher
said. ``The play got broken up a little bit, and Robert ended up
swinging the ball to me. You look back on it and you wish you could
have that one back, explore some other options. But you're out
there in the heat of the moment you just go with what you feel. ...
If I had taken my time a little bit, I probably would have made a
more efficient decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Lakers, who appeared to snap out of their funk as
they built a 10-point halftime lead, go back to pondering what went
wrong as they lost for the third time in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been concerned for the past week or so,'' Fisher said.
``Right now we aren't able to go out and carry over the things that
we work on in practice that can be successful for us.''
</P>

DREAM IS A REALITY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No need, USC basketball fans, to worry about what
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been... is.
</P>
<P>
   You know, there were to be (begin ital)two(end ital) games at
the Sports Arena on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   One was to be the Pac-10 battle for first place between Arizona,
second-ranked nationally, and USC, scarred by season-ending
injuries to its leading scorer and its only senior. That was the
game the Trojans weren't supposed to be able to win.
</P>
<P>
   The other was the battle for much more, a game for which it
needed Sam Clancy and Jarvis Turner. That was the game that would
put USC basketball back in the big time.
</P>
<P>
   One was reality, to be played on hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   The other was a lost dream, to be visible only in the spectrum
reserved for what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, incredibly, the two games, truth and imagination, came
together in front of 9,105 ecstatic Trojans fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had to make up for the 17 points and 7 rebounds they
expect from Clancy, and for Turner's vital sixth-man play. They did
it, with Brian Scalabrine scoring a career-high 27, including the
back-to-back-to-back 3-pointers that put Arizona on its heels in
the first half, and David Bluthenthal scoring a career-high 26.
</P>
<P>
   They had to make up for being outrebounded badly in the first
half, for early foul trouble. They did it with a tenacious defense,
holding Arizona to 41 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   They had to pass repeated tests of nerve in the final minutes,
when Arizona sent them to the free-throw line seven times. They
made 12-of-13 free throws to hold on to an 80-72 victory that sent
the USC student body onto the floor for a wild celebration.
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   Think of what you imagined before Clancy and Turner got hurt in
USC's victory over Arizona State on Thursday, Clancy with a broken
right foot, Turner with a broken left ankle. Then pinch yourself to
prove it actually is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Wildcats shows that USC, which was riding an are-
they-for-real wave of emotion and magic, can compete with the best
teams in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Wildcats almost certainly will put the Trojans in
the top 25 on Monday for the first time since 1992, when the Harold
Minor-led team was No.8 before losing on a Georgia Tech half-court
shot in the NCAA tournament's round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Wildcats gives them a 5-0 start to the conference
schedule and gives Henry Bibby a resume line that eluded all four
previous USC basketball coaches of the Pac-10 era.
</P>
<P>
   The imagination can run a little wild at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Is the much-traveled Bibby about to find another career
crossroads in his headlights? Might a better-established program be
formulating a job offer as we speak?
</P>
<P>
   Would Bibby move on, or stay to finish the rebuilding he'd
started at USC, a tangible objective now that an on-campus arena is
on the drafting board?
</P>
<P>
   But we are getting carried away, getting ahead of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, USC is the best basketball team in town, first in
the Pac-10, shocking news-radio listeners nationwide awake this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   This, after the Trojans were outrebounded by 11 in the first
half. When Arizona guard Jason Gardner got back his own miss and
hit a 3-pointer to give the Wildcats a 39-37 lead on their first
possession of the second half, they had scored 13 points on
offensive rebounds, the Trojans 2.
</P>
<P>
   This, after USC failed to go to the free-throw line until 14
minutes were left in the game. Brandon Granville, the point guard,
and Nate Hair, in Bibby's rotation to make up for Turner's loss,
each had three fouls in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   This, although Clancy sat at the end of the Trojans bench in a
red plaid shirt, gently leaning his crutches against the Gatorade
keg, and Turner hobbling out on crutches in a pristine white
T-shirt, looking lost as he flopped into a baseline chair.
</P>
<P>
   What might have happened if they'd never taken those bad steps
in the game against Arizona State?
</P>
<P>
   What might have happened if Clancy and Turner had been able to
play Saturday in the biggest USC basketball game in years?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever might have happened in the the land of what might have
been, it couldn't have been any better than what did.

MAVERICKS' BUYER FANCIES BIRD OR THOMAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mere fact that Mark Cuban picked up the phone a couple of
weeks ago and called Michael Jordan's people about his availability
sends a strong signal that the Mavericks' new owner is planning to
make a big splash in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Jordan, if you will, as part-owner and president of
basketball operations of the Mavericks. Had Cuban purchased the
team's controlling interest in November, say, that notion might
have come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I done something earlier, yeah, I would have talked to him
earlier,'' Cuban said. ``Maybe there would have been a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have explored all options. Woulda, coulda, shoulda.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Cuban will pursue Isiah Thomas or Larry Bird to do
for the Mavericks what Jordan is doing for the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, an Indiana native, has said this is his final season as
coach of the Indiana Pacers. Thomas, who played some pickup
basketball games against Cuban at Indiana University, did a
marvelous job turning the Toronto Raptors into a respectable
franchise when he was vice president of basketball operations and
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   To the possibility of Bird or Thomas joining the Mavericks,
Cuban would only say: ``I will explore all options, and it will be
fun doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan took over a Wizards team Wednesday that has
characteristics similar to the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards haven't won a playoff game since 1988; the Mavericks
haven't won a playoff game since 1988. The Wizards only have been
to the playoffs once in the past 11 seasons; the Mavericks only
have been to the playoffs once in the past 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a stretch to think that Jordan wouldn't have taken a
strong look at what Cuban had to offer if Ross Perot Jr. had sold
this team to Cuban earlier. Sources said Cuban wanted Jordan so
much he would have offered him anything, because he knows the
worldwide respect and publicity the downtrodden Mavericks would
have received.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 media members showed up at MCI Center in
Washington last week to see Jordan tell the world he's back in the
NBA. Just think, that scene could have taken place at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been great to get Jordan,'' Mavericks forward
Cedric Ceballos said. ``He's a good friend and a great player, and
a tremendous individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been great to have him a part of this team. Hey,
\RJordan\S can always sell his share in the Wizards and join us.''
 &LR; subheds:SPOTLIGHT ON ... Heir apparent guarded about teaming with
Air Jordan
Detroit Pistons All-Star forward Grant Hill has been called the
second-coming of Michael Jordan. Now, he's knocking down persistent
rumors that he will be joining Jordan in Washington when he becomes
a free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who left yesterday's game against the Chicago Bulls after
falling hard on his tailbone, is from Reston, Va., which is close
to Washington, D.C. Jordan is now part-owner and president of
basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what \RJordan's\S role is or anything like
that,'' Hill said. ``I don't know what he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought, not one bit, about \Rgoing back to the
Washington area\S. I like coming home and playing against the team
I grew up watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Hill added with a chuckle: ``I'd probably see too much of
my parents, and I don't know if that's good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not good for Pistons coach Alvin Gentry that he has to
constantly hear of the places Hill will play next season. So Gentry
resorted to sarcasm when asked about Hill's Wizards connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he'd want to come back \Rto Washington\S,'' Gentry
said. ``Why wouldn't he?''
 &LR; subheds:AROUND THE EAST  &LR; agatea:Now that Jamal Mashburn finally is
having a breakout season for Miami, Heat coach Pat Riley believes
it's time to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure, but that's life in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Riley criticized Mashburn before Tuesday's home loss to lowly
Chicago and now is reportedly trying to trade him to Philadelphia
for guard Larry Hughes and forward Billy Owens.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Nets forward Jamie Feick, who went into yesterday's
game against the Mavericks fifth in the NBA in rebounds with 11.7
per game, has found himself in the doghouse of coach Don Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Feick said. ``I have not had a
conversation with \RCasey\S. I don't know what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Feick was upset he was pulled early from Monday's game against
Philadelphia after he tossed up a pair of bad shots. Feick wound up
with only four rebounds in 23 minutes against the Philadelphia
76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later against New York, Feick played only eight minutes
and got one rebound _ and he never left the bench in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's game against Detroit, Feick regained Casey's good
graces. He started the game and collected 13 of his career-high 25
rebounds in the first quarter of the 122-120 victory against the
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Heat point guard Tim Hardaway returned to action Friday for the
first time after missing 26 games with a jammed right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Hornets guard David Wesley might be charged for his
part in the death of teammate Bobby Phills, according to Charlotte,
N.C., police.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley and Phills were racing _ police said speeds exceeded 100
mph _ when Phills lost control of his Porsche and died at the
scene.
 &LR; subheds:AROUND THE WEST  &LR; agatea:The Portland Trail Blazers are
concerned they can't depend on forward Rasheed Wallace to be on the
court in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace recently got ejected from consecutive games against
Phoenix and the Mavericks and has received 80 technical fouls in
226 regular season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he understands that it's hurting our team, and I don't
think he wants to hurt our team,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy
said. ``The thing is, it's to the point now where he has to be
careful, because other teams will try to bait him if they know they
can get to him like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be like in the old days, when coaches would send in
some stiff to try to rile a guy and get him ejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix guard Penny Hardaway has started light practices and
plans to play during the Suns' East Coast trip that begins Jan. 25
against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who has missed 21 games with a foot injury, is likely
to play when the Suns face his old Orlando Magic team at the
Orlando Arena on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Orlando,'' Hardaway said. ``Hopefully, I'll be
playing before Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is the doctors have told me when I go out
there, I'm going to have some side effects. There's going to be
some pain, and I may be hobbling sometimes. It's just a matter of
how much pain can you take.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had won seven consecutive games before losing Friday to
Boston. That winning stretch included a victory in Los Angeles
against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which suffered an embarrassing home loss to the
Mavericks on Dec. 4, apparently has gotten its act together. The
Timberwolves have won eight of their past nine road games and are
within 3 1/2 games of first-place Utah in the Midwest Division.

wanting to do neither, neither play offense nor defense.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the Cowboys, in any case. Not at the salary that Owner
Jones is prepared to offer, which won't be in the same tax bracket
as the $12.7-million salary cap figure that his contract said.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders, Count Do-Rag _ worth $12.7 million?
</P>
<P>
   Even in his wackier, Owner Jethro-worst days, Jones wouldn't try
to claim that. It simply makes good business sense to void Sanders'
contract and to let him go. Let him try to make the Cincinnati
Reds. Let him find another NFL locker room to preen in. Let him
find another owner who is enchanted by his Prime Time charms.
</P>
<P>
   Let him find another city to beguile, another church to preach
from, another newspaper (wince) to write a weekly column for.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he can still play football. When he sheds the self-promotion
flora and fauna and tries to blend in with the team, Sanders can be
a defensive presence to reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   But at what price? Owner Jones paid him $12.99 million up-front
in 1995 to jump to the Cowboys. He has since made it an art form to
collect signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses for jumping from the San Francisco 49ers. Bonuses from
rewording his contract. Bonuses from temporarily giving up
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   My numbers might be a little off, but Owner Jones can correct me
if I'm wrong. I calculate the final tab on Deion to be in the
neighborhood of $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   For one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth it? Did you enjoy that one Super Bowl, Owner Jones?
</P>
<P>
   When you consider the retooling job that Jones is now strapped
with, the answer is more complicated than a simple no.
</P>
<P>
   No cornerback, no one defensive player, is worth even $10
million a year. Not as long as there is an NFL salary cap. The
impact that Sanders' disproportionate paycheck had on the Cowboys'
depth was best measured this past season _ an 8-9 season _ when
injuries forced strange faces into odd, nickel-defense places.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't quote that line about Sanders being ``the best
cover cornerback to ever play the game.'' It's become trite.
Without a supporting cast, Sanders made minimal impact on the
Cowboys' won-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   Another trite Deionism that needs to be put to rest is that
``he's great in the locker room.'' And when a team is winning,
maybe Sanders is.
</P>
<P>
   But when a team is winning, everybody whistles to work like the
Seven Dwarfs. When the worm turned at the end of this disappointing
season, Sanders was passing blame and trying to stab backs with the
best of them. Remember when he left the 49ers and then trash-talked
about Jerry Rice?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, he was fun for awhile. Count Do-Rag was Owner Jones'
rich toy, an All-Pro with a cartoon personality. A Nike darling.
</P>
<P>
   But desperate times call for desperate assessments, and by any
accounting, Sanders' tenure with the Cowboys was an expensive
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys fans will always wonder what impact his $40 million,
distributed more wisely, could have had on Chan Gailey's two teams.
</P>
<P>
   His days here are numbered and, judging by his baseball
announcement, he knows that. His renegotiated contract was meant to
be voided, or Jones would have been on the hook for $10.5 million
in base salary in the 2000 season and $13 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, Jones has to time it properly, in order to both
release Sanders and to be able to spread his remaining signing
bonus over another season. The target date is June 2. If he is let
loose on that date, Sanders would count $2.2 million against the
cap and $3.2 million in 2001. If he is released this week, he would
count for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the financial loose ends. Psychologically, the
parting has already begun to occur. You could tell it in Sanders'
voice as the season gurgled down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it wasn't about the nightclub that he owned, or the
clothes that he wore. It wasn't about his newfound religion, or
even about last week's news that he wants to use his baseball
career as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was about Deion Sanders, who could both amaze and amuse.
And for all his antics and theatrics, helped bring the Cowboys one
Super Bowl in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many Prime Time acts, his had become tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   And it's time to say goodbye.

STARS' MORROW MATURING A SEASON EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Simon Gonzalez 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ According to the Stars' master plan, Brenden
Morrow was supposed to be playing for the Michigan K-Wings, honing
his skills in hockey's minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scouting staff and management pretty much made me feel
that I'd play the season in Kalamazoo and then I'd get my chance
next year,'' said Morrow, the team's first-round draft pick in the
1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   The master plan, though, is out for the season. It's on the
shelf after suffering concussions, broken ankles, chest contusions,
bruised ribs, separated shoulders and strained groins.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to virtually every forward forced the Stars to bring
Morrow off the farm prematurely. Instead of clashing with
youngsters in the International Hockey League, he'll be playing in
his 30th NHL game tonight in Chicago. Instead of gaining experience
in Kalamazoo, the 21-year-old rookie will be playing alongside Mike
Modano on the Stars' first line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make that big of a deal of it,'' Morrow said. ``I
realize injuries have forced them to make these decisions, and if
there weren't so many injuries I wouldn't be on the first line. I
just look at it as an opportunity to get some ice time, and try to
make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrow indeed is making the best of it. He has 10 points on five
goals and five assists in 29 games. More importantly, he plays the
high-energy, hard-nosed grinding and checking game that coach Ken
Hitchcock's defense-first system demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you like about Morrow is that there's not very many games
that Brenden doesn't show up and play hard,'' Hitchcock said. ``He
plays physical, he's got good speed, and he's got sneaky-good
skill. The skill that he plays with kind of grows on you after a
while. The way our team plays, he's a very effective player.''
</P>
<P>
   He was especially effective playing on the first line with
Modano and Blake Sloan in Los Angeles on Thursday. Each player
scored an even-strength goal in the Stars' 5-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play real simple and basic,'' Modano said. ``They don't
try to do anything outside their realm as players. They skate well,
they play hard along the boards. That's where the game is played
nowadays. There's not a lot of open ice, but when it does come
they're able to play that style too because they've got the
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of game that made Morrow a standout in junior
hockey and a first-round draft pick. At 5-foot-11 and 210 pounds,
he can play physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty big physical force,'' Sloan said. ``It helps
create room for other people on the ice. It gets the other team's
defensemen looking over their shoulders a little bit knowing that
he's out there, and that might give us that one extra step.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has the skills to put the puck in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever get 50 goals or not, but I've always
played the same style game, grinding it out in the corners, and
I've still ended up scoring quite a few goals,'' Morrow said.
``I'll probably be a two-way player who can add a little offense.''
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of Morrow's offense comes from directly in front of
the net. He posts up by the goal, seemingly impervious to the large
defensemen who beat on him trying to move him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind taking it,'' he said. ``Usually you get rewarded
when you're in front of the net. The puck will go in off your leg
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries brought Morrow to the Stars a year ahead of schedule.
But that attitude, combined with his skills and tenacity, could
have him in the NHL to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's earned the right to play here,'' Hitchcock said.

PANTHERS SHADE BRUINS IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ Every now and then in the course of a season, a
game comes along that can really allow a team to gauge where it is
and potentially where it's going.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &UR;  &LR; night was such a contest for the Bruins, who turned in
a pretty creditable performance but fell short in overtime, 4-3, to
the Florida Panthers at the National Rental Car Center.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Pavel Bure beat goalie Byron Dafoe at the right post
on a rebound of a Viktor Kozlov wraparound try, giving the Panthers
the win at 1:31 of the extra session.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns was pleased with the way his team battled,
especially since they will go home with five of a possible six
points garnered in this three-game road trip. ``We played well and
we played hard,'' said Burns. ``The guys played really hard. We had
some excellent scoring opportunities and we limited them as much as
we could. I'm not sure how much better we can play. We're very
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston was unbeaten in the five previous games (2-0-3) but
although the points in the standings were certainly precious as the
club finds itself in a battle to make the postseason, the points
came against teams who were a combined 48 games below .500 (and
that's only counting Atlanta once, even though the Bruins played
them twice in that span).
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he thought his team was in for a battle and they got
one from the talented Panthers, who have the second best record in
the Eastern Conference. But the Bruins did a decent job of matching
them.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured a lot of up-and-down action, particularly the
second period, which was highlighted by four goals (three by
Boston) in a span of 2:09.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers struck the first blow when they converted a
two-on-one break at 16:12 of the first. Bure took off with the puck
up the right side with center Ray Whitney darting down the left.
Ray Bourque, the only Bruin back to defend, tried to block the pass
from Bure to Whitney but Whitney shoveled it into the net for his
20th goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins rallied to tie it in the middle period with
defenseman Marty McSorley, who scored his first goal as a Bruin
Thursday against Tampa Bay, wristing the puck at the net from the
right point that beat goalie Mike Vernon at 2:45. The goal was
originally credited to center Joe Thornton but later changed.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a minute later, Bure gave Florida the lead back with
his 300th career goal and in doing so, set a Panthers' mark with
his 33d of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With Bure unchecked off to Dafoe's left, Kozlov dished a pass to
Bure that he swept into the net for the 2-1 advantage at 3:47.
Instead of sagging, though, the Bruins made it 2-2 only 32 seconds
later.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Joe Murphy, who returned after missing one game
because of an abdominal strain, relayed a pass to left wing Steve
Heinze. Heinze, in the left circle, beat Vernon for his ninth
tally.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went up, 3-2, only a few seconds after tying it. Left
wing Sergei Samsonov, deep in the right circle, made a nice feed to
right wing Landon Wilson in front. Wilson banged in the shot at
4:54 for his first goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers came back to tie it at 12:19 on a goal by right
wing Mark Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came about a quarter of an inch from going ahead
again at 14:12. Dave Andreychuk teed up a shot from the right
circle that hit Vernon and flew up in the air and over the
netminder's shoulder. It fell onto the goal line but Vernon fell
back on it before it had completely crossed the goal line and
referee Paul Stewart blew the whistle. Video replay officials ruled
that the puck didn't make it all the way across.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said later that Vernon had control of the puck before it
crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had an opportunity to win it late in regulation when
Thornton was high-sticked in the face by defenseman Robert Svehla
but they couldn't cash in on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Bure's goal in the overtime. The Bruins felt they
deserved a better fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outshot this team, I think we outchanced this team, we
didn't get rewarded the way we wanted to at the end and our team is
disappointed,'' said McSorley. ``But at the same time, we know
we're elevating our game right now. We want to be disappointed, but
with our heads held high and with confidence in our game going home
right now.''

BC CAN'T SHAKE ITS COLD SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-MIAMI-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The moment he stepped off the plane from frigid Boston
Friday evening and was greeted by South Florida's siren song _
bienvenidos a Miami _ and its tropical climate, Troy Bell came to
the same realization most Minnesota snowbirds do upon their winter
arrival at Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was the place for me,'' said Boston College's
freshman guard from Minneapolis. ``I can't live in Minnesota and I
definitely can't live in Boston. But this place is beautiful . .
.'' Then he wondered aloud, ``Is this (the way it is) all year
round for them?''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that would have made this trip better for Bell
and his teammates was a victory in Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's Big East
matchup against the Miami Hurricanes. But the Eagles (9-8, 1-4)
remained frozen stiff by an abominable cold snap in conference road
games _ dropping their third straight this season and 16th in a row
overall _ in Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's 62-54 setback against the Hurricanes
(11-7, 4-2) before a crowd of 5,210 at American Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The game was scheduled to be at Miami Arena but was switched to
the Miami Heat's new state-of-the-art-deco building when a cold
water line was accidentally ruptured by a city work crew, leaving
Miami Arena without air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Leonard Hamilton, whose team got a career-high 24
points from senior center Mario Bland, indicated that school
officials opted to move the game because of the threat of injury to
players.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Eagles certainly could have put a chill in the place
with their frostbitten shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we really have to focus on ourselves and what it is
we have to do in order to be effective,'' said BC coach Al Skinner.
``We've got to get back to the basics and what our principles are
both offensively and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   BC got 20 points from Bell, the only Eagle in double figures.
Bell shot 4 for 15 from the field, including 2 of 8 from 3-point
range, but made 10 of his 11 free throws. He has gone 15 for 58 in
BC's four-game skid, and Saturday &UR;  &LR; night had a bag of ice taped to
his shooting hand after the game. Bell aggravated a nagging injury
when he banged his right hand off Johnny Hemsley's knee with 5:16
to go.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of BC's starters combined for 16 points on 7-for-20
shooting. Xavier Singletary was held scoreless, going 0 for 5.
Overall, BC shot 30 percent (17 of 56) and committed 23 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   What bothered Skinner most, though, were the defensive lapses
his team suffered during crucial stretches of the game. ``If we do
the job defensively, then we're in the ballgame,'' he said. ``But
we were totally lost on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Eagles fought back from a 12-point deficit with a 15-7
run in the last 4:29 of the first half to pull within 30-27 at
halftime, BC wound up committing several defensive gaffes that
enabled Miami to reel off 9 unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my shots were right around the goal,'' said Bland, who
became the 23d player in Miami history to score 1,000 career points
when he hit a free throw with 13:23 to go. ``But sometimes I'd turn
around and say to myself, `What happened to my defender?' The guys
just did a good job of getting the ball to me, and you have to take
advantage of that.''

O'NEAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN FOR THE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers in scoring,
rebounds, assists, blocked shots and minutes Saturday against
Portland. He did everything but sing the national anthem and sink
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   For 47 minutes the Lakers' center created a vision of what a
league MVP looks like. And in the final seconds, he rested. It
wasn't his call, it was God's, or the Lakers' version thereof.
</P>
<P>
   First-year coach Phil Jackson made O'Neal, who missed three of
four shots from the foul line, just another Staples Center
spectator in the final seconds of a game the Lakers would go on to
lose, 95-91.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having a chance to be a savior, O'Neal was just
another disciple questioning the man he has put his career and
reputation in the hands of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a peon around here. I just do what they say,'' a glum
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   In his frown were the first signs all season of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Damon Stoudamire, the Trail Blazers' hardy guard, was
saying a prayer of thanks for small favors. ``Heck, if you're going
to take Shaq out for the last play, we're glad to see that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Stoudamire's glee were the first signs that maybe Jackson is
human, after all.
</P>
<P>
   All those years with the Bulls, ``everybody thinks Phil was just
sitting there,'' said Lakers veteran guard Ron Harper, who played
under Jackson for five seasons in Chicago. ``Don't believe that.
Michael Jordan may have scored a lot. Phil had a hand in that,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more impressive than an O'Neal no-look pass, more
intimidating than O'Neal rising in the paint to block a shot: In
less time than it took for the NBA and its players to agree on a
new collective bargaining agreement, Jackson has fashioned a team
ideology out of a roomful of ids.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Bill Bradley wanted Jackson's fingerprints on his
presidential campaign. Halfway through the NBA's 2000 primaries,
Jackson has the attention not only of his Lakers but of the rest of
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking like he's back coaching Chicago again,''
Stoudamire said. ``He barks a command every now and then and then
goes and sits down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if Jackson could just get the Lakers to routinely obey him.
They slipped into their old ways in the second half, wilting like a
piece of plastic exposed to extreme heat. The Trail Blazers' turned
up the intensity and the Lakers melted.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had no rebounds in the third quarter after pulling down
14 in the first half. He had four points in his final 23 minutes.
To be fair, he must have felt less like the toast of the league
than a cork bobbing in a rough sea, what with the continuous waves
of players Portland sent at him.
</P>
<P>
   He was swimming in Trail Blazers jerseys. Brian Grant, Arvydas
Sabonis, Scottie Pippen and Rasheed Wallace took turns pulling at
him like an undertow. It was the kind of game that demanded that
Kobe Bryant or Glen Rice or Harper or somebody, for goodness sakes,
be the lifeline that towed O'Neal and the Lakers to the shores of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant was weighed down by the four fouls he picked up in
the first three quarters, the last of them a piddling one with less
than two seconds remaining in the third. He would end up fouling
out before the Lakers' final, climactic possession.
</P>
<P>
   And Rice looked like he was fighting against the tide; he missed
all three shots he tried in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox was the closest thing the Lakers had to a go-to guy
down the stretch. So short of sending O'Neal in for the final 13.6
seconds and crossing his fingers and holding his breath, there
wasn't much Jackson could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's got (the Lakers) playing great defense, they're playing
well together and he's got them playing hard on both ends of the
court,'' said Pippen, who played his usual stellar game defensively
and also contributed 15 points. ``He's had a great impact on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much Phil could do (Saturday). He couldn't go out
and score for them or defend.''
</P>
<P>
   The only things he could have done were play Travis Knight a few
more minutes in the first half and leave O'Neal in at the end. The
latter was a risk Jackson should have taken. O'Neal isn't going to
become a better foul shooter in clutch situations in April and May
by sitting on the bench in the final seconds of a close game in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The way he has played to this point, O'Neal had earned the
chance to surprise us.

MEMORABLE NIGHT FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No matter what else happens this season, USC won't
be able to top what happened Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, supposedly reeling with two significant players
sidelined with fractures, stunned No. 2-ranked Arizona, 80-72, at
the Sports Arena in a battle between the Pacific-10 Conference's
unbeaten teams before 9,105 fans.
</P>
<P>
   USC hit eight straight free throws in the final minute to hold
off the Wildcats, and the crowd rushed the floor at the buzzer to
celebrate the victory, which gave the Trojans sole possession of
first place in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   USC won without forward Sam Clancy (fractured foot) or forward
Jarvis Turner (fractured ankle) while Arizona was without forward
Richard Jefferson (fractured foot). All three gathered on the floor
on crutches before the game.
</P>
<P>
   USC got career performances from forward Brian Scalabrine and
David Bluthenthal. Scalabrine had a career-high 27 points while
Bluthenthal had a career-high 26.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inspired by the absence of Clancy or Turner, USC came
out and played its most inspired game of the season. They even did
it by playing such little-used reserves as freshmen Kostas
Charissis, Nate Hair and Malachi Thurston.
</P>
<P>
   They held the lead because the core players remained hot,
especially Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   He had 15 points in the first half and quickly hit two shots to
open the second half. He had 23 points with 14:30 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bluthenthal also made up for Clancy's absence, scoring 18 points
in the first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were almost a two-man team offensively in that span,
because starters Brandon Granville and Jeff Trepagnier were both
having subpar performances.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (12-5, 5-0) were clinging to a 65-59 lead with 3:23
left, despite using an unlikely mix of veterans, freshmen and
walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   But USC had no answer for 7-foot-1 center Loren Woods, who
scored 21 points, point guard Jason Gardner (25) and former Grant
High star Gilbert Arenas, who had 16.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (16-3, 5-1) dominated under the basket, outrebounding
the Trojans, 23-12 in the first half, including nine offensive
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Trojans were shutting down forward Michael
Wright, who scored only one point in the first half. He entered the
contest as Arizo na's second-leading scorer (14.8 points per game).
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, already facing a player shortage, appeared in deep
trouble when point guard Brandon Granville picked up his third foul
with 10:27 left in the first half. But Bibby did not substitute,
and Granville managed to play the rest of the half without getting
his fourth foul.
</P>
<P>
   Charissis played 11 minutes in the half, more than his combined
total in USC's first four Pac-10 games and no points, no rebounds
and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams used just seven players in the half.
</P>
<P>
   USC's depth was so thin that Trojans coach Henry Bibby was
reduced to inserting 6-5 walk-on Abdullah Elmagbari in the second
half, after Bluthenthal got his fourth foul with 10:16 left.

HORNETS PUT END TO CELTICS' STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Life without Paul Pierce wasn't pretty the
last time around. It was just as bad Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce went down early with a hamstring injury and the Celtics'
four-game winning streak went the same way. In a nearly empty
Charlotte Coliseum _ a liberal estimate would be 4,000 _ the
undermanned Celtics dropped a 110-96 decision to the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino talked afterward about his short-tempered players
having the ``diplomacy of Stalin'' with the referees, as Antoine
Walker (5 of 15, 11 points) and Kenny Anderson (4 of 15) each did
their Rasheed Wallace imitations and got technicals. But it was the
injury to Pierce that really hurt, given the Celtics already were
shorthanded with Calbert Cheaney (family situation) and Eric
Williams (knee) already out.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said he strained his left hamstring diving for a loose
ball going out of bounds in the first quarter. He played only 11
minutes and sat on the bench the rest of the game with his leg
taped. This was the same building in which he badly sprained his
ankle last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a curse here for me,'' Pierce said. ``I come to
Charlotte and I get hurt. It bothered me, so I couldn't finish the
game. This has never happened to me before, so we'll see. If I was
a doctor, I'd tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino wasn't much more revealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what his status will be,'' said Pitino. ``We'll
watch over the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach, however, was a tad upset with his short-fused
players. The Hornets attempted 37 free throws to the Celtics' 13.
The Celtics were called for 30 fouls to Charlotte's 19. Those
numbers bear out season-long trends: The Hornets lead the league in
free throw attempts while the Celtics commit the third most fouls
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players have got the diplomacy of Stalin,'' said Pitino.
``They have no idea how to get calls. They're just stupid with
officials. Our players have no diplomacy whatsoever. It's like the
cold war with them. They don't understand it. They try to win the
verbal war with referees, they're going to come out and lose every
time. And they still haven't figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who has four technicals in the last five games, said he
found it hard to believe he never got to the line. That has
happened six times this season. ``It's frustrating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Dana Barros, ``We were definitely frustrated, but you have
to keep your frustrations to yourself. The refs are human, too. We
can't afford to get that kind of reputation as a team. Once you get
that label, it's tough to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the referees didn't let Charlotte shoot 52 percent or
collect 31 assists. Boston had trouble all night with Derrick
Coleman, who beat them up inside and outside with 24 points, 11
rebounds, and 3 blocks. Six Hornets were in double figures and
there was enviable shot distribution among those six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made extra passes and got a lot of good, open looks,'' said
Eddie Jones, who had 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics got 18 points and 11 rebounds from Vitaly Potapenko
and 16 points off the bench from Danny Fortson. It easily was
Fortson's best outing, but, as he put it, ``It don't mean anything.
You might as well erase it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets led by 9 after one, by 15 at the half, and by 12
going into the fourth. The Celtics never mustered the necessary
defensive stand to make up any significant ground. In the second
half, they trailed by at least 10 for 23 of the 24 minutes. They
got as close as 8.
</P>
<P>
   They had trouble matching up against the bigger Hornets, made
evident by 16 points from old nemesis Brad Miller. Pitino had no
choice but to go small, admitting, ``It's not a pretty sight.'' He
had Doug Overton playing small forward at one point. Coleman (8 of
11 from the field) killed them down the stretch. He scored 8
straight points to offset a pair of Fortson hoops when the Celtics
were looking like they might do something.
</P>
<P>
   After a Fortson layup made it 95-87, Coleman stepped out and
drained a trey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really killed us,'' said Walker.
</P>
<P>
   After a Fortson dunk (off a Walker miss), Coleman bulled his way
in for a 3-point play. That made it 101-89 with 3:48 left and
finished off the Celtics for good. At that point, even a flight to
Miami in a snowstorm looked to be comforting.

 UNDATED: ... winning campaign.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You start with a great name, Malcolm Forbes, known at least as
well and probably more than Ross Perot at the time of his entry in
February '92,'' Wanniski wrote. ``You actually have a lead of 11
months on Ross. And, remember, he did not spend more than pocket
money from the moment he indicated that he would run, and the day
he hit 40 percent in a matchup with Bush and Clinton. The initial
hesitancy I get from supply-siders when I bring up your candidacy
is your `shyness,' your outward demeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Wanniski continued, ``Your ability to speak with
extemporaneous skill, in measured tones and the compactness of a
self-edited writer, is unparalleled among conservatives. . . . Jack
(Kemp) has more energy in his presentations than you do and will
get more spontaneous applause lines, but your messages tend to be
philosophically seamless and appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes decided he could wait no longer. On a spring day that
Forbes describes as one of the most fateful of his life, he flew to
Phoenix to meet with Kemp and asked him whether there was any
chance he would run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Kemp said, then uttered the words that Forbes wanted to
hear: ``If you do, I will back you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, in an interview, recalls the meeting slightly differently.
``He just asked me if I was going to run. I said, `No, I don't
think I could raise the money.' He said, `Well, I will.' He had the
resources.'' (Kemp, who became displeased with Forbes attack ads
against Dole, has not endorsed anyone so far in the 2000 race.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the exact exchange, Forbes walked away from the meeting
having decided to run, carrying the supply-side banner. ``There was
a vacuum in the political sphere,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   And Forbes could not resist its pull.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' political model might appear to be Ross Perot, the Texan
who financed an unsuccessful independent bid for the presidency in
1992. Some of Forbes' friends believed that Perot had opened the
door for an outsider multimillionaire _ and that Forbes' dry manner
would be welcomed after the criticism of Perot's brash style.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, however, insists that discussion of Perot rarely came
up. Instead, he says, ``the name that was more mentioned was
Wendell Willkie,'' who ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in
1940. Forbes considered him a hero because he was an outsider
businessman who risked his reputation on a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never held elective office, he came out of the business
world and came in after the party was floundering in 1936 and all
the old leaders were out,'' says Forbes. Today, he believes, the
GOP is in a similar situation, and he has no qualms about
presenting himself as the 2000 version of Wendell Willkie.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while many of Forbes' original backers still believe he
would make a good president, others such as Wanniski are
disappointed. Wanniski, for example, said he urged Forbes not to
run the much-criticized attack ads against Dole in 1996, which by
most accounts backfired on the publisher and helped lead to his
withdrawal from the race. This time around, Forbes has tried to
recast himself, with sunny advertisements featuring his daughters
and a fervent antiabortion pitch that is designed to appeal to
social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But at his core this is a man who chose to go public _
sacrificing fortune and privacy _ in the name of one belief: that
tax cuts, and tax cuts alone, can ``drain the Washington swamp,''
as he likes to say, and remake the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a natural candidate,'' says longtime friend Michael
Novak, an American Enterprise Institute scholar. ``He doesn't like
small talk. He is not gregarious. But he is steady as a dime. Most
of the country is now talking about what he first talked about _ a
flat, or flatter, tax.''

 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John McCain was no impressionable kid, no raw
recruit, when he was shot down over North Vietnam on a bombing
mission in 1967. He was 31, a lieutenant commander in the US Navy,
the warrior son of a family of warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a formed, mature individual,'' McCain says. ``I was
married. I was serious about my military career.''
</P>
<P>
   But prison and torture must change a man. The John McCain who
landed with his fellow POWs at Clark Air Force Base in the
Philippines in 1973, liberated after five-and-a-half years of
confinement, was a different person.
</P>
<P>
   The jet jockey had learned humility. The rebel had felt the
power of a higher cause. The loner had come to understand
dependence. The admiral's golden boy had been face-to-face with his
own fallibility, and emerged a more forgiving soul. It was, McCain
says, ``a refining experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Vietnam, ``he was always an individualist,'' says Mark
Salter, McCain's biographer and speechwriter. In the crucible of
the POW camps, ``he learned it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain is 63 now, and his father and grandfather are long dead.
But his story must begin with them, for it is hard to overestimate
the impact that their legacy had on his life. Both were decorated
combat veterans, and four-star admirals. Both were hard-drinking
men's men, adept at profanity, dedicated to the United States and
its Navy. Both spent huge chunks of time at war or at sea, away
from their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   With such a pedigree, it was preordained that young John, after
the rootless childhood of a Navy brat, would follow them into the
US Naval Academy and the officer corps. He did so, but only in what
he now recalls as ``a very rebellious period in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a little bit of internal conflict. His legacy weighed
heavy on him,'' says Frank Gamboa, a Naval Academy roommate. ``I
was there because I wanted to be there. He was there because it was
the family business. He felt he didn't have a choice. He was very
proud of his father, and of the Navy, and felt comfortable, but at
the same time his lack of freedom of choosing his own way bothered
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his background, McCain also recognized that the Naval
Academy was not the Navy, that the ability to endure the
upperclassmen's hazing or shine one's shoes had little to do with
the grit that was needed to land a jet on an aircraft carrier, or
play hide-and-seek with an enemy destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us were not from a military background and had busted
our asses to get to Annapolis. But because he was a Navy junior and
because his father and grandfather each had a salty character and
acquired their own substantial degree of demerits _ it was a family
characteristic _ it gave him a psychological safety net that none
of the rest of us had,'' says Gamboa. ``He developed a reputation
for pushing the limits.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain drank to excess. He led expeditions of randy midshipmen
``over the wall'' without leave. He had a storied love affair with
a Brazilian fashion model. ``I was an arrogant, undisciplined,
insolent midshipman who felt it necessary to prove my mettle by
challenging. . .authority,'' McCain recalls in his memoir, ``Faith
of My Fathers.'' ``In short, I acted like a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's gang of carousing classmates was known as the Bad
Bunch. He collected demerits by the dozens, and just narrowly
avoided expulsion. After graduating in 1958 near the bottom of his
class he maintained his wicked ways while training and serving as a
pilot _ at one point dating an exotic dancer known as Marie, the
Flame of Florida. The officers' wives watched wide-eyed when she
cleaned her nails with a switchblade.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a more mature John McCain who took off from the aircraft
carrier USS Oriskany to attack Hanoi in October 1967. He had
emerged without serious injury from three potentially-fatal flying
accidents, worked his way up through the ranks, and been married in
1965. The Navy was now his life. ``The limits of my ambition were
to be a squadron commander,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1967 McCain had watched friends and shipmates die
before his eyes when a fire and explosions wracked his ship, the
USS Forrestal, while on station in the Tonkin Gulf. He himself was
wounded by shrapnel from exploding bombs, and burned when his jet
was destroyed by the malfunctioning rocket that set off the
conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, being the son and grandson of admirals, had a keen sense
of what it meant to be a naval officer. But on the Forrestal he saw
everything he had heard about _ the immense tragedy, the personal
sacrifice,'' says Orson Swindle, a fellow POW. ``He not only saw
it, but was damn near one of the dead. The vast majority of men
would have taken that as a ticket to avoid further sacrifice. But
he goes and gets on another ship and goes back to war.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 26, 1967, while on his 23d mission over North Vietnam,
McCain's A-4 fighter-bomber was hit by a surface-to-air missile. As
he ejected from the airplane, he broke both arms and a knee. The
Vietnamese who rescued him from a Hanoi lake broke his shoulder,
beat, and stabbed him. He was interrogated by guards who beat upon
his broken bones. Suffering from fever and dysentery, he was
ultimately delivered to a POW compound known as ``the Plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got him he was absolutely on the verge of death. His
right arm was broken. His left arm had been pulled out of the
socket. His right knee had been fractured and cut on. He had been
bayoneted. He weighed somewhere between 95 and 105 pounds. He was
filthy rotten stinking: You could smell him 15 or 20 feet away.
They had battered and tortured him,'' says George ``Bud'' Day, an
Air Force major who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor
for his heroic resistance to their Vietnamese captors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt they had dumped him on me so they could say he
died in the care of an American,'' says Day. ``It was fascinating
to watch him fight back. His body was telling him, we're going to
die. His brain was saying, the hell we are.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is no saint. His first marriage failed when, after
returning from Vietnam, he was unfaithful to his long-suffering
wife. There were reports at the time, which he denied, of affairs
with subordinate female personnel. He must work to control that
now-famous temper. Like many elected officials, he has crossed the
line at which constituent service evolves into favors for special
interests _ most notably in the 1980s for Charles Keating, the
convicted savings and loan kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the McCain that emerged from Vietnam has a certain depth and
strength of spirit that marks him as more than the average fighter
jock, or politician, says writer Robert Timberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have, at various times, a need to test ourselves or
be tested. And we wonder if that moment ever comes, how we will
respond. Most of us never really face that moment. But he faced it.
He found out he could stand up to damn near anything. Because he
had,'' says Timberg, a Vietnam veteran and the author of ``John
McCain: An American Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Honor demanded that, unless a man was seriously ill, the POWs
could only go home in the order by which they were captured.
McCain, though lingering near death, turned down the opportunity
for early release because it would have given the Vietnamese a
propaganda coup: his father was then the commander-in-chief of
naval forces in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognized immediately that he was, as son of a famous
admiral, a major liability to the United States. They tried to get
him to go home, and he was damn near dead, but John McCain said,
`No, I'm not doing it,' '' says Swindle.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ultimately drew confidence from having passed that test,
says Timberg. Such self-knowledge reinforced his natural
feistiness, and helps explain McCain's willingness to tread the
less-worn paths in politics.

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... lucrative contract.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McPhee, who remains Bradley's friend, witnessed his pain during
the ordeal. Bradley played an average of only 16 minutes a game
that season and watched two of his teammates, Walt Frazier and Phil
Jackson, earn All-Rookie honors while he languished. ``He didn't
conceal his feelings on the court,'' McPhee says. ``You could see
him brooding on the bench. You knew he was dealing with so much
disappointment and self-questioning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, Bradley was no longer a prized interview,
says Leonard Koppett, then the Knicks beat writer for the Times.
Bradley's confidence was shaken, and when reporters approached him,
he had little to say. ``He was a little bit aloof,'' says Koppett,
now a columnist for the Oakland Tribune. ``He kept out of the
limelight as much as he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, DeBusschere says Bradley ``felt a sense of embarrassment
and fear that his dream of being a pro basketball player might not
be achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for his life outside basketball, Bradley says, ``I might
have sat around my hotel room all day thinking about my lack of
lateral quickness.''
</P>
<P>
   McPhee, who dined with Bradley after many games that season, was
struck by how Bradley kept his professional woes from poisoning the
rest of his life. ``He showed an amazing ability to step aside from
his basketball concerns,'' McPhee says. ``He wasn't cold to the
situation, but you wouldn't know how much he was hurting if you ate
spaghetti with him after a game. The way he dealt with adversity
that year was sort of his finest hour.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bradley's passion to excel never waned. His
teammates said he approached every practice as if it could be a
turning point. And he sought help after his rookie season from a
stranger, Sonny Hill, who ran a summer league in Philadelphia.
Bradley, who taught in Harlem that summer, rode the train to
Philadelphia twice a week to play against some of the top pros of
the day, among them Hal Greer and Earl ``The Pearl'' Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill had doubts about himself,'' says Hill, ``but he also had
the determination, the grit, and the willingness to reach out and
allow others to support him and help him continue his journey.''
</P>
<P>
   On Hill's advice, Bradley made a pivotal mental adjustment by
forsaking hope of NBA superstardom and accepting that he could
flourish only by playing a supporting role on a Knicks team with
several players as talented as he was. The transition eased the
pressure on Bradley, and he gradually improved, ending the summer
season in a legendary game in which Monroe scored 63 points and
Bradley 52. ``He was just the right person for me that summer,''
Bradley says of Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley continued to founder in his second season, as
Holzman insisted on using him as a reserve guard. Finally,
Bradley's break came in January 1969, with a teammate's misfortune:
Cazzie Russell broke his ankle. Bradley was tapped to replace
Russell in the starting lineup as the team's small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Playing his natural position, Bradley thrived. And the team
began to gel as he honed his supporting role, focusing on the
intangibles that don't appear in box scores but help make
championship teams: picking apart defenses with pinpoint passes,
setting screens for teammates, moving without the ball to get free
for an open shot.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the nonpareil college star, began to solidify his
legacy as a consummate team player. ``Rather than having the ball
all the time, like he did at Princeton, he learned to be one of the
greatest players in NBA history without the ball,'' says Hill, an
administrator for the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Cousy, a supporter of Bradley's presidential campaign, was
coaching the Cincinnati Royals at the time. ``With his shooting
skills, Bill could have scored much more than his average'' of 12.4
points a game over his career, Cousy says. ``But he chose to create
opportunities for others so his team could prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   With memories of his rookie nightmare still raw, Bradley was so
intent on remaining a starter after Russell's injury that when he
became nauseated before a game in San Diego, he asked for a bucket
at the bench to vomit in. Then he repeatedly dry-heaved on the
court. ``I'm not coming out!'' Bradley shouted to the bench, while
his teammates laughed at the absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally was there,'' Bradley says in hindsight. ``I wasn't
about to let some stomach virus keep me from staying there.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 18 months later, on May 8, 1970, the Knicks won their
first NBA championship. With Bradley still in the starting lineup
in 1973, the Knicks won their second _ and only other _ NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley played 10 years of professional basketball. And though
he qualified for only one All-Star team, he was overwhelmingly
elected to the Hall of Fame for his contributions to the Knicks and
the game at large. ``I learned from that experience that resilience
is the most important quality a person can have in life,'' Bradley
says. ``You need the courage and discipline to keep moving forward
even when you don't know how things are going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who used his Knicks fame as a springboard to an 18-year
career as a US senator from New Jersey, says he has relied on the
same sense of discipline in his insurgent campaign for the
presidency that sustained him during his NBA ordeal. Yet he still
wonders at times how his life might have differed if he had failed
to turn around his basketball career. ``Who knows,'' he says in a
cookie-cutter hotel room on a chilly morning in New Hampshire. ``I
might be playing piano somewhere.''

   Turning points. Dancers have them. So do skiers, cars, and
screenplays. But politicians have them also. And oftentimes a
political figure's turning point can become America's turning
point, too.
</P>
<P>
   The United States might have conquered the Depression and won
World War II if an errant polio virus hadn't struck Franklin Delano
Roosevelt after a swim in the Bay of Fundy, but the moral strength
FDR drew from his physical weakness fortified the country at
perhaps the most perilous period of the last century. The nation
might have built the Panama Canal, assembled the Great White Fleet,
and become a muscular 20th century power if Theodore Roosevelt
hadn't fought to overcome a sickly youth, but the determination
that TR brought to life was also the determination that America
brought to its first star turn on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   It is, to be sure, dangerous business to transform a
politician's struggle with adversity into a Rosetta stone of his
character. But it may be even more dangerous to ignore those
struggles. A Thomas Jefferson who wasn't an early widower; an
Andrew Jackson who wasn't scarred by the slash of a British
officer's sword across his face, by two bullets that he carried in
his body for years, and by the ``corrupt bargain'' that denied him
the presidency in his first campaign; an Abraham Lincoln who didn't
suffer from depression; a John F. Kennedy whose PT boat wasn't sunk
in the Pacific; a Lyndon Johnson who hadn't been reared in
hardscrabble Texas and who hadn't taught school to poor
Mexican-Americans _ all of them would have been immensely different
men from the people who eventually ascended to the presidency. As a
result, this would have been an immensely different country.
</P>
<P>
   And so here is a notion that turns intuition on its head: Seldom
courted, never fully avoided, adversity is an advantage. At least
in politics, and probably in life, too.
</P>
<P>
   Great turning points _ George W. Bush's struggle with a midlife
crisis in Midland, Texas, for example, or Bill Bradley's
humiliating performance in his first year in professional
basketball _ are part of what John Adams, speaking a decade before
the Declaration of Independence, called ``that most dreaded and
envied kind of knowledge _ I mean of the character and conduct of
(our) rulers.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans, who are, after all, the ultimate arbiters in American
politics, are drawn naturally to the figures who have overcome
adversity. That is why as early as the campaign of 1840, William
Henry Harrison, who was born on an estate in Virginia and lived in
a 22-room manor in Ohio, allowed his Whig campaigners to shout from
the rooftops that he had been born in a log cabin. Herbert Hoover,
who nearly died of the croup at age 2 and was permanently scarred
when he stepped on a hot iron chip in his father's Iowa blacksmith
shop, became one of the most appealing figures of the early 20th
century because of his rise from a hard childhood to the giddiest
heights of engineering and business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, until the advent of the Bush clan in presidential
politics, the Republicans, beginning with Lincoln, often chose
nominees of the striving classes while the Democrats, whose
populist heroes include FDR and JFK, often displayed a weakness for
well-bred if not aristocratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But often it is adult adversity more than childhood
circumstances that gives shape to a politician's attitudes,
approach, and view of the world. Richard Nixon, whose family
struggled amid the pleasant orange groves of southern California,
campaigned in 1960 as the candidate of experience, but in truth it
may have been the experience of the 1960 campaign that changed him
most. A man of extraordinary accomplishment _ he had been elected
to the House, the Senate, and the vice presidency by the time he
was 40 _ his narrow loss to Kennedy under terms he considered
corrupt embittered him and persuaded him that any political tactic
was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Though Theodore Roosevelt's early adversity hardened him, later
adversity softened him. By 25 he was a widower, with his beloved
wife, Alice, the Valentine's Day victim of Bright's disease. ``We
spent three years of happiness such as rarely comes to man or
woman,'' Roosevelt wrote in his memorial to his wife, adding: ``As
a flower she grew, and as a fair young flower she died. Her life
had always been in the sunshine. . . . And when my heart's dearest
died, the light went from my life forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected and tragic deaths changed the lives of future
presidents, as they do of the rest of us. The death of Earl Carter
at 59 ended the promising Navy career of Jimmy Carter, prompting
him to resign his commission, return to Plains, and abandon his
dream of traveling the world and living the sort of cosmopolitan
life that was unavailable in Georgia peanut country. The death of
his 4-year-old daughter, Robin, from leukemia in 1953, was a jolt
to George Bush and a tragic reminder that no life, even his, is
charmed forever, or for long.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths of children during their presidencies dramatically
altered the equilibrium of both Lincoln and Calvin Coolidge. Willie
Lincoln's death in 1862 devastated his father and broke his mother
emotionally. Calvin Coolidge Jr. died in 1924 from a foot infection
traced to a blister he developed during a game of tennis. ``When he
went,'' Coolidge said, ``the power and the glory of the presidency
went with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in Harry Truman's case, failure in business almost
certainly contributed to success in politics. His haberdashery fell
victim to the recession of 1922. That November Truman was elected
judge for the eastern district of Jackson County and four years
later he was elected presiding judge of the county. In his first
months in the presidency, Truman stated, ``There'll be no more to
this job than there was to running Jackson County and not any more
worry.'' Not true, of course, but, still, Truman was onto
something. The lessons he learned in the past _ the raw materials
of that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge _ would help him
navigate the future, and change ours.

AN OUTSPOKEN RUN AT HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hurtling across Iowa between appearances, conducting yet another
phone interview from his car, Alan Keyes is trying his darndest to
avoid explicit mention of the fact that he is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get the nomination, I'll not only make a run for the
presidency, I will at that moment have made history,'' he is
saying.
</P>
<P>
   But how will he make history?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What is obvious?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been done before,'' he says. ``It will be. . .the
story of this election year.'' And he will go no further.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Keyes, 49, avoids even such veiled references to his
race, though he has spoken of it sometimes, particularly when he is
explaining what he sees as the lack of respect given his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it a little bit annoying,'' he says. ``Just because I
think it's terribly important for me and the country that anything
I do appeal to people as Americans, not on any racial, ethnic, or
other basis, and I work very hard at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, an ambassador to the United Nations Social and Economic
Council during the Reagan administration and radio talk show host,
is a fierce opponent of abortion, and of gays in the military, and
a fervent advocate of reinserting God into American public life.
But he was not always this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of a typical black American,'' Keyes says.
``Democrat family, that kind of background.''
</P>
<P>
   But arriving at Cornell University in the late '60s, amid
roiling social changes and student protests, changed him. When the
African-American society, whose meetings he attended in his
freshman year, voted to close down the campus, Keyes, already a
champion debater, rose to oppose them. He did not sway them,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes says he remembers identifying with the institution during
that time, mystified as to why officials so easily caved in to the
students.
</P>
<P>
   Race is barely relevant to his version of the story. But his
friend Marlo Lewis, with whom Keyes would later attend Harvard
graduate school, tells it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taught when he was a little boy, `There are people out
there who hate you for no good reason, so you can never give them
any legitimate reason to hate you. People will claim you're stupid
because of your skin color, so you had better be smart,' '' Lewis
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education was a lifeline, the one thing no one can ever take
from you. Then he goes to college, and all these people are
demonstrating in the name of civil rights and black power and they
shut down the university, and he saw this as a betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Keyes will tell you, this was not his defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   He is not one to talk of messy emotional moments, of the sort
Lewis describes. This is a candidate who refuses to answer even
innocuous questions about his personal interests and hobbies,
because he believes it makes presidential hopefuls seem ``like
guests on the Jerry Springer show, which is incompatible with the
dignity of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He is profoundly annoyed by the high praise heaped on him for
his oratorical skills because he thinks it implies a disregard for
the merits of what he is actually saying.
</P>
<P>
   He recently upbraided an audience of 1,000 party activists when
they burst into applause during one of his speeches because he said
they didn't really mean it.
</P>
<P>
   For Keyes, a turning point in life is ``an intellectual process,
not an existential one.'' What changed him, he says, was enrolling
in a class taught by Allan Bloom, who would later write ``The
Closing of the American Mind,'' which pilloried American
universities for abandoning classical curriculums in favor of
touchy-feely relativism and multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably had the major transformation of my life in that
period because I read Plato's Republic, and Rousseau,'' Keyes says.
Bloom taught him to think, Keyes says, ``And the more you think
about things the more conservative you become.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also then that Keyes detached himself from his
``typical'' background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that my mother ever got used to it,'' he says.
``She never understood how her baby became a Republican. My father
grew more understanding. He voted for Reagan, though he never
changed his registration.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of people in the Republican party who are
annoyed by Keyes, who still polls in the low single digits but
makes his presence felt in debates. Former Republican National
Committee chairman Richard Bond, who calls Keyes ``belligerent,
glib, and overbearing,'' wishes he would walk away from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who will not concede that his campaign is quixotic, pays
no mind to such criticisms. As he sees it, he's in good company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurs to me,'' Keyes says, ``that a man with the dignity
and gravity and reserve of George Washington could not get elected
today.''

LIVING BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Utah Senator Orrin Hatch is profoundly uncomfortable answering
questions about his life outside his 23-year Senate career, handing
over details of his childhood and his family as if each one were a
treasure for which he had spent a lifetime searching, but now had
no hope of ever seeing again.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he has a list of biographical markers which he will
quickly rattle off when asked: the impoverished Pittsburgh
childhood; his early career as a metal lather; living in a
refurbished chicken coop with his wife and children while he
attended law school. But seldom does he go deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a tall man of 65 with a parson's carriage and rectitude
to match, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, composer of
inspirational songs, would much rather recount his legislative
triumphs in exhaustive detail: his 1978 defeat of a bill which
would have given unions more strength (``We'd have headed straight
to socialism if that had passed''); his 1989 child-care bill; a
1984 bill he cosponsored which he says ``created the modern generic
drug industry''; the many bills on which he has forged a bipartisan
alliance with Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Or he'll talk about his efforts during the Senate confirmation
hearingson behalf of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who was
accused of sexual harassment of Anita Hill. Hatch, perhaps best
known nationally for holding up a copy of `The Exorcist' and
suggesting Hill lifted her story from it, is confident these days
that he has been vindicated, since, he believes, Thomas is doing a
wonderful job on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But push hard enough, and there is this: In 1943, when Hatch was
10, a beloved older brother, Jess, was shot out of the sky in
Italy. A B-24 pilot, he had been shot down twice before and
survived, but not this time. On the day officials came to deliver
the news that Jess was missing, Hatch's mother and father were
sitting on the porch, and he was playing in the woods across the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first and only time I ever saw my dad cry,'' Hatch
recalls. ``The day they came to our home, it affected me so
drastically, I had a white streak up here,'' he says, pointing to a
spot on the top of his head. ``I used to be pretty
distinguished-looking before I became more gray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard thing, because I loved my brother so much.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother's death made Hatch want to live a life big enough
for two. He started by serving two yearlong church missions instead
of one, as most Mormons do.
</P>
<P>
   And in those two years, in which he taught scripture and ``had
an awful lot of meetings with people to help them with their
problems,'' Hatch says he ``learned to love people more than I've
ever loved them before. I would not trade those two years for any
other time in my life, and that includes my time in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hatch has made sure to read the Bible from beginning
to end every year, 10 pages every day.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen polls indicating that 17 percent of Americans would
not want a Mormon as president. He knows there are bigots out
there, though he's surprised there are still so many 40 years after
John F. Kennedy became the first Catholic president. But he doesn't
mind so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to put myself in the same category,'' he says.
``But if the savior himself came down to earth and decided to run
for President of the United States, he'd probably find at least 17
percent against him. But that leaves 83 percent, and I intend to
get 51 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest his problems go well beyond religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started very, very late,'' says Richard Bond, former
chairman of the Republican National Committee. ``And he doesn't
have a niche. He's not the outsider, not the frontrunner, not the
heir apparent, not the conservative, not the crusading antiabortion
figure, not the moralist. He's kind of the cardigan. He makes you
feel good, but that's not enough. I have a great deal of affection
and sympathy for Hatch, but nonetheless, this is the jungle of
presidential pols, and you can either be the consumer or the menu,
and he's getting eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch soldiers along, asserting that his experience will win
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I have guts, they know I have ability,'' he says.
``They know I have more experience than anyone running, including
(Vice President Al) Gore and (Bill) Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   His problem isn't that people don't want him, Hatch says, but
that they just don't think he has a chance to win, which ``takes
away almost any chance to get their vote, unless you just keep
plugging away, which I'm doing.''

THE SENATOR'S SON

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a young newspaper reporter on the lookout for his next
big story, when Al Gore got the tip that would forever change his
life.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Friday afternoon in March 1976. Gore was home with his
new wife, Tipper, when his editor called with the news leak: Joseph
L. Evins, a Tennessee political legend, was retiring from Congress
after 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of disclosure that would send most reporters to
their keyboards, to bang out an exclusive on the unexpected
departure of a longtime congressman. But Gore had another impulse
entirely, one bred into him almost from birth, but long suppressed
beneath his disgust with American politics after Nixon and Vietnam.
For most of his young life, Al Gore Jr. had resisted the role for
which he seemed cast: as the bright, inquisitive son and namesake
of a US senator. But now, with editor John Seigenthaler's call and
encouragement, bowing to the inevitable seemed like just the thing
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipper,'' Gore said. ``I think I may run for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, after hanging up the phone, Al Gore did a very Al Gore
thing. He dropped to the floor and began doing pushups ``sort of
reflexively, to get myself in shape for the race,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore surprised himself with his sudden ambitions, Mary
Elizabeth ``Tipper'' Gore, who had known her husband since they
were teenagers, was shocked. The man she knew had never expressed
an interest in public life, particularly after his father lost his
Senate seat in 1970 in one of the ugliest campaigns in Tennessee
memory. A year later, when Gore began reporting at the Nashville
Tennessean, he bluntly told Seigenthaler, ``I do not want to cover
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore loved his job at the newspaper, where he had risen from
the entry-level grind of obituary writing to the city hall beat. He
had even broken a big investigative story on influence-peddling in
local government, a story which led to several indictments.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore had something else inside, something Seigenthaler had
sensed early on. The editor saw real journalistic talent in Gore
and assumed he would soon lose him to a bigger paper or to
television, ``because he looked like Clark Kent.'' But when Evins
called to leak the story of his retirement to the Tennessean
newspaper, Seigenthaler's thoughts of Gore quickly clicked from
``reporter'' to ``candidate'' and he made the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he knew better than I did that this was something I
would be interested in,'' Gore says.
</P>
<P>
   And interested he was. Gore and Tipper would spend the weekend
sounding out friends and family. They invited five friends for
Sunday dinner and circled the table sampling their advice.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus was supportive, though Steve Armistead, a
childhood friend of Gore's and the only nonpolitical person at the
dinner, offered this: ``You need to get a haircut and you need to
buy new clothes.'' (Gore has never put much of an emphasis on
clothes and ``it still shows,'' Armistead says with a laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   Edward S. Blair, a longtime friend of Gore's, remembers getting
a late-night call around that time from his friend, who had all but
made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where that came from, what made him do that,''
Blair says. ``I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was
words to the effect that he felt like he could do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Do some good. Vindicate his dad. Choose the road more traveled
by. For Al Gore, the life-changing choice was to be Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, in fact, a reawakening of this early childhood
ambition to be like my dad,'' Gore says. ``But I had to do it on my
own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision made, Gore was ready to make it public. He went to
the steps of the local courthouse to announce his candidacy. But
before he began his remarks, this son of a former US senator, this
Harvard graduate, Vietnam veteran, and tough-minded investigative
reporter, made one quick stop.
</P>
<P>
   He went into the courthouse bathroom and threw up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disgust.
</P>
<P>
   The word comes up again and again when Gore's Harvard roommates
describe their old friend's attitude about politics.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late 1960s, and the campus was consumed with the
Vietnam War and the draft. ``Who wasn't disgusted with politics in
1965, '66, '67, '68?'' asks Michael Kapetan, a sculptor who roomed
with Gore at Harvard. ``It was easy to be disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than a brief stint on the freshman council, Gore, like his
classmates, had steered clear of student politics. The hotter
question in Harvard Yard was: Who would go to war?
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his classmates and friends insist, was neither involved
in, nor preparing for, a life in politics. But, like many, he was
obsessed by what he should do about the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all know that when you go off to college and you're
young, it's such a time of breaking away, looking for your
identity,'' says Mrs. Gore. ``Vietnam, Watergate _ all of those
things disillusioned him, like it did many of our generation,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't very interested in politics. I don't ever remember
hearing a word about running for office,'' says standup comedian
Bob Somerby, another Gore roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Gore's early academic choices suggest that he had
inwardly, if not publicly, put himself on a political path. He
started out majoring in English literature, and was fascinated by
the medieval English poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer. Later he would
shift his major to American government.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of using Harvard's elite population to make
political connections, Somerby says, Gore tended to associate with
people from working-class backgrounds. ``Being a senator's son, you
can go to Harvard and do nothing but network. That's not what he
did,'' Somerby says.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was his father, a man Gore decribes as ``a hero
to me,'' a man who has been a constant _ if sometimes subconscious
_ guiding influence in the younger Gore's life and career.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was deeply proud of his father, and he would often regale
his Harvard friends with yarns about his father's political
adventures and tricks. John Tyson, another Harvard friend,
remembers one tale about how the senior Gore would step up to a
podium for dinner speeches with three different forks, to make sure
he had covered all the points he wanted to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he finished a point, he would turn the fork over,''
Tyson says. ``And he taught Gore how important it was to end the
speech on a high note.''
</P>
<P>
   But while at Harvard, when he made his choice to serve in
Vietnam, Gore took pains to separate himself, to carve out an
identity apart from his family name and fame.
</P>
<P>
   With his famous name, ``it would have been pretty easy for him
to have slithered out somehow'' from going to Vietnam, Somerby
says.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. A Congressional Quarterly study at the time found
that of the 234 sons of senators and congressmen who reached draft
age during the Vietnam era, only 28 served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, whom friends say was worried about the potential
effect of his decision on the political career of his father _ a
leading senatorial opponent of the war _ and by the possibility
that some other young man from small-town Carthage, Tenn., would go
in his place, signed up for service in Vietnam. He served as a
reporter, writing for a military newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief time in the Army, Gore never saw active combat,
says Mike O'Hara, a sportswriter who was also a reporter in Vietnam
with Gore. Some recent news reports have suggested that care was
taken by the military to screen Gore from dangerous duty. But
O'Hara recalls it otherwise, saying Gore went into the field when
he could have avoided doing so, and took pains not to bring up his
father the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as regular as they come,'' O'Hara recalls. ``Using his
dad's name would have been out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   When his father was defeated in 1970, Gore became embittered,
even more turned off from politics as a career. The elder Gore had
wanted his son to write his victory speech, Armistead recalls, but
there was no win to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Gore managed a wry joke at his concession speech,
telling supporters ``something like, `Al will be back,' ''
Armistead remembers.
</P>
<P>
   And Al did come back, six years later, but it was the son
instead of the father.

AN INHERITED VISION 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1994, magazine publisher Steve Forbes and a
host of Republican Party luminaries journeyed to the Rocky Mountain
enclave of Telluride, Colo., to ponder the nation's future. In the
company of men such as Jack Kemp and William Bennett, Forbes was
perhaps the least-recognized figure, an awkward tag-along, familiar
only to those who read his columns.
</P>
<P>
   But as Forbes returned to New Jersey on his company jet, a
Boeing 727 known as The Capitalist Tool, his longtime friend Jude
Wanniski believed he had seen the future of the GOP _ and his name
was Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve, here's a historic document,'' said Wanniski, a fervent
believer in supply-side economics, as he handed Forbes a
handscrawled paper. It was a proposal that Forbes run for
president, one of several that Forbes would receive _ and dismiss_
during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, it turned out, already had a presidential candidate in
mind. Jack Kemp was everything that Forbes was not: a
back-slapping, handsome former NFL quarterback, well-known
nationally and established within the Republican Party. The
contrast between Forbes, who laughingly notes that some people call
him ``charismatically challenged,'' and Kemp, is one of the most
striking in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two men did share something: a near-religious belief in
the sanctity of deep Reaganesque tax cuts, which under the
supply-side theory of economics would spur enough growth to more
than pay for themselves. Forbes was astute enough to realize that
Kemp was the ideal political and personal package to sell the
controversial idea.
</P>
<P>
   But during the tumultuous year that followed, Forbes went from
being a passionately private multimillionaire, a man who laughed
off talk of running for president, into a politically energized
campaigner, convinced that he was the savior of the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   It was a transformation that would require Forbes to rethink his
self-image, and invent a public one. It would place his life on a
road he had avoided, more in harmony with the passionately public
life led by his father and namesake, Malcolm S. Forbes Sr., a man
who helped redefine the word flamboyant for the post-war generation
and once ran for New Jersey governor. It would also lead him to tap
deeply into his inherited wealth, draining the dominant share in
the Forbes empire that his father had reserved for his first son.
</P>
<P>
   And so, at some cost, ambition was born. The incubator for
Forbes' new dream was Empower America, a business-oriented think
tank in Washington. Kemp and Bennett were the public face of
Empower America, but Forbes was quietly funding it, and his
confidant Bill Dal Col _ now Forbes' campaign manager _ was running
it.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes could well afford the luxury of paying huge sums of money
to let other people muse at Empower America's many conferences,
including the Telluride gathering. But, though he enjoys the perks
and properties of his inherited millions _ his home in rural
Bedminster, N.J., sits on 550 acres, with 148 head of cattle _ he
wears his wealth lightly. It is one of the ways he is most unlike
his father, who died in 1990 with a train of mourners that ranged
from Richard Nixon to Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' indulgences are intellectual. He has lived and breathed
economics and policy, and one of his proudest accomplishments came
in winning the so-called Crystal Owl award for accurate economic
forecasting an unprecedented three times. In many ways, his most
significant role model was his grandfather, B.C. Forbes, a Scottish
immigrant who was a freelance journalist. As Steve Forbes describes
it, his grandfather one day had an epiphany: ``Why just write about
it? Why not start a business myself?'' Thus was born Forbes
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes said he found himself facing a similar question as
he entered midlife in the early 1980s. Why confine himself to just
dispensing opinions as editor of Forbes magazine? Why not take a
shot at public life?
</P>
<P>
   Forbes took an important step in that direction when President
Reagan appointed him head of the government's Board for
International Broadcasting, a part-time position he held for four
years. While the agency had only 15 employees, its adjuncts, Radio
Free Europe and Radio Free Liberty, had 2,000 workers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes' position was low-profile, he now says he helped
play a role in the fall of the Berlin Wall. He traveled to
Washington hundreds of times during his tenure, meeting with
administration officials and testifying before Congress. From
Forbes' point of view, the job gave him executive government
experience. And he didn't like much of what he saw in Washington,
especially the way the Republican Party seemed to be falling apart
in the post-Reagan world, culminating in the election of President
Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, several of Forbes's friends, displeased with the crop
of likely GOP candidates, were suggesting that he run for
president. These friends included Ken Tomlinson, former editor of
Reader's Digest, and Bruce Porter, the former executive director of
the Board for International Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What few people realize is that his whole life, from when he
was a young man, he was fascinated by politics,'' Porter says. ``He
probably is one of the most widely read persons I have ever known.
When he found out I was from Utah, he started talking to me about
senatorial politics in Utah 50 years ago. He can do the same thing
about every state in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes laughed off most of the suggestions that he make
political history himself, largely because he was still convinced
Kemp would run. But on Super Bowl Sunday, 1995, the former Buffalo
Bills quarterback sent word that he didn't have another White House
race in him. Forbes began to seriously consider the idea that if
Kemp wouldn't, he should. He informed his wife, Sabina, and their
five daughters, who were shocked at the unlikely turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't really reach a critical mass in my mind until
January, when Jack decided to pull the plug,'' Forbes says. ``Even
then, as the idea began to germinate, I kept going after Jack to
take the plunge when it was clear the other candidates were not
going to have the kind of positive, progrowth agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Forbes' decision had as much to do with his antipathy
toward the GOP front-runner, Bob Dole, as it did with Kemp's
decision not to run. Dole was considered by many supply-siders to
be too zealous about balancing the budget and too quick to raise
taxes to accomplish that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, famous for his barbs, once delivered this unforgettable
rebuke: ``The good news is that a bus loaded with supply-siders
went over a cliff. The bad is that there were a few empty seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes wasn't laughing. (Indeed, such Dole-isms would embolden
Forbes to launch harsh television ads against the Kansan in the
1996 primary). Supply-siders believe that tax cuts would spur so
much growth that they would bring in billions of dollars in extra
revenue and balance the budget in the process.
</P>
<P>
   This economic theory, which critics famously derided as ``voodoo
economics,'' is the heart of Forbes' political philosophy. But
Forbes has taken this theory even farther than the original
proponents, advocating a 17-percent flat tax which eliminates many
of the usual deductions, including the supposedly sacrosanct one
for mortgage interest. As Forbes saw it, Dole was the enemy of
supply-siders, and by extension an intellectual outlaw in the
Republican Party. While there is reason to doubt whether Forbes'
view was shared by a majority of Republicans, he saw himself as the
only person with the will and the wallet to defeat Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes had nearly reached his moment of choice. Sensing this,
Forbes' supply-side friends pushed him more strongly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March 1995, seven months after Wanniski had scrawled his
proposal on the back of an envelope, he wrote an eight-page memo
outlining why he believed Forbes could run a winning campaign.

A LEGACY RECLAIMED 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Children in Midland, Texas, are taught the town
motto: ``The sky's the limit.'' It fits a desert place where trees
don't grow to block the heavenly view, and for a time _ when oil
was pumping so much wildcatter wealth and opportunity and optimism
into this out-of-the-way spot _ it captured Midland's spirit, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mid-1980s, when a gregarious George W. Bush was
wheeling, dealing, and working hard to duplicate his famous
father's big success in the Midland oil fields, the can-do
atmosphere abruptly changed. Oil prices went into a free fall,
deals collapsed, banks failed, and men who had grown up together
believing the sky was the limit suddenly lost their jobs and
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was quite a bit of pain,'' recalls Donald Evans, one of
Bush's closest friends in Midland and finance chairman of his
campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. ``People were trying
to sort out their futures and figure out where they were going to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 40, Bush had a particularly deep midlife crisis. Not only
was his oil-exploration company struggling and his professional
world crumbling, but alcohol was taking a toll. His drinking,
excessive at times, was hurting his marriage, sapping his strength,
and threatening to minimize his campaign role as the family geared
up for Vice President George Bush's 1988 run at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Summoning the discipline to get his life in order _ and the
resolve to finally capitalize on his talents and birthright _ was
the most powerful and personal of life turning points for Bush, a
transfiguration that included his re-discovery of the place of God
in his life. As a husband and the father of twin daughters, Bush
was overdue to grow up and get on with things. As the eldest Bush
child, George W. still had to prove himself in a competitive family
and to a role-model father who had achieved much more by the time
he reached middle age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when he quit drinking, he got a lot of confidence out
of that,'' Laura Bush, the Texas governor's wife, said in an
interview. ``A number of things came together for him _ our life,
having little girls, his dad thinking about running for president.
Drinking was the one thing George hadn't been that disciplined
about, and he really wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the brash, wisecracking son who joked about being the
black sheep in the family moved past his epiphanic moment to play a
pivotal role as his father's most trusted aide-de-camp in the 1988
campaign. And when that job was successfully completed, the
``Bombastic Bushkin'' _ the popular cut-up who loved cruising
Midland in hand-me-down clothes and an old jalopy _ returned home
from Washington determined to buy into a Major League Baseball
team, to find fame and fortune, and to build his own career in
Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   If it had never been stated directly, the expectation had surely
been that George W. would follow his grandfather and father into
public service. But his spur-of-the-moment run for a US House seat
in 1978 had been a failure. And it long appeared that success in
business _ the other important measure in the Bush family _ would
elude him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't fully appreciate how much pressure was brought to
bear on George W., or what the impact was of growing up in this
particular family was,'' says Bill Minutaglio, whose biography,
``First Son,'' chronicles how Bush often felt he fell short, from
his average grades in the Ivy League, to his enlistment in the
Texas Air National Guard, and his bad luck in the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   And the drinking, Bush said in a recent interview, ``crowded out
my energy level and competed for my time and affection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that stopping drinking was a real turning
point for Bush, because it gave him the energy to study politics at
the highest level, and it alerted him to his own political
possibilities,'' Minutaglio says. ``It changed him. He realized
that if he straightened up, the sky was the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his fraternity days at Yale, bourbon and beer had been
things he enjoyed too much, Bush wrote in ``A Charge to Keep,'' his
autobiography. ``It magnified aspects of my personality that
probably don't need to be larger than they are _ made me more
funny, more charming (I thought), and more irrepressible,'' Bush
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Those weren't the qualities that endeared him to his family or
Laura, either. In the summer of 1985, the family invited the Rev.
Billy Graham to be their weekend guest in Kennebunkport, Maine, and
George W. walked and talked privately with the evangelist.
``Something was missing in my life, and Billy Graham stimulated my
heart _ I would like to say planted the mustard seed which grew,
and started me on a journey, a walk, to recommit myself to Jesus
Christ,'' Bush said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Midland, Bush recalls that his behavior began to
change. He started reading and studying the Bible, he explored new
ways to save his business, and he tried to stop drinking. ``It's
hard to describe, and I don't necessarily feel really comfortable
talking about it,'' Bush says, ``but the Lord works in mysterious
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The parable of the prodigal son is a big part of Bush lore. It
started with Bush's oft-repeated admission that ``when I was young
and irresponsible, I sometimes behaved young and irresponsibly.''
And _ though questions about how much Bush drank and whether he
ever used illegal drugs dogged him early in this campaign _ the
story, as the family tells it, had a happy ending when Bush found
religion and was born again in Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already had been a regular at the local Methodist church, a
Sunday school teacher, and active in charitable causes. What
friends believe Bush got from Billy Graham, who declined to be
interviewed for this article, was inspiration to live a more
purposeful life, centered on God and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like George had been walking in spiritual darkness.
If he had strayed from church, it hadn't been very far,'' says Don
Jones, a Midland oil executive who helped get Bush involved in a
men's Bible study and support group. ``Why did he stop drinking?
Apparently he felt it had gotten the better hold of him. It's tough
to pray to the Lord every night with a snootful.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Francis, a Dallas businessman and GOP activist who has known
Bush since 1970, credits Laura Bush with having a ``profound
influence'' on her husband's maturation. Mrs. Bush, a soft-spoken
librarian who married Bush when she was 31, has denied she
delivered her husband a ``Jim Beam or me'' ultimatum. But, she
said, ``I thought he was drinking too much, and he knew he was.''
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have been clearer than on that Sunday morning after
the Bushes, the Evanses, and several other Midland couples jointly
celebrated their 40th birthdays at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado
Springs, Colo. Bush awoke with a throbbing head and an awful
feeling that he wouldn't be able to complete his regular three-mile
jog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This run was different,'' Bush wrote. ``About halfway through,
I decided I would drink no more. I came back to the hotel and told
Laura. . .`I'm quitting drinking.' I'm not sure she believed me at
first.'' Bush says he has not touched alcohol since.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the reason was God, or Laura, or the sudden sense of
mortality that often comes with turning 40, it seems no coincidence
that the decision came as Vice President Bush was about to make his
White House bid. ``I have a hunch that George gave up drinking
because he was afraid he might embarrass his father someday,'' says
Joe O'Neill, a childhood friend who introduced Bush to his future
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bush disagrees, but concedes he is not a man of deep
introspection, and has not reflected much on his midlife
transformation. ``I don't sit around and psychoanalyze myself all
the time. I am much more of a doer,'' he says. ``I do remember
having a definite sense of purpose in the campaign to help my dad.
I developed a reputation as a fierce warrior for George Bush, and
rightly so. He is a man I love a lot.''

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They spit on the savior. Night after humiliating
night in the winter of 1968, Bill Bradley trudged off the court at
Madison Square Garden through a storm of peanuts, pennies, and
saliva. A highly acclaimed and richly paid rookie, Bradley had been
expected to lead the New York Knicks to basketball glory, and he
was an utter bust.
</P>
<P>
   Strangers on street corners called him a bum. Cabbies asked how
he could cash his check with a straight face. His own coach
ridiculed ``the Great Man himself,'' as the New York Times had
hailed the promising rookie.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, lionized as the epitome of excellence as a
three-time All-American at Princeton, an Olympic champion, and a
Rhodes Scholar, the indignity was like nothing he had ever tasted.
And like nothing he has experienced since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to be the great white hope,'' he said in an
interview. ``Then I was a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In one foul season, Bradley's grand plan nearly came undone. He
was destined to be a senator one day, and then president; friends,
coaches, and writers had told him so before he was old enough to
legally take a drink. And he had set out to fulfill their
prophecies, banking on pro basketball fame to propel him.
</P>
<P>
   Then he fell flat. Three years after the author John McPhee had
exalted Bradley's athletic and intellectual gifts in the 1965
biography, ``A Sense of Where You Are,'' Bradley had lost his way.
His blueprint for the future was as tattered as a discarded hot dog
wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Bradley enters a crucial phase of his quest for the
Democratic presidential nomination, the story of how he confronted
_ and overcame _ his greatest failure provides a window on both his
character and the quirks of circumstance that helped shape his
life. His encounter with the other side of renown would shake him,
change him and, perhaps more than any experience in his life, steel
him for the ever-more-public life that lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one anticipated that Bill Bradley would stumble, not after
the triumphs of his youth. As a teenager in Crystal City, Mo., he
became an Eagle Scout and a national student government leader as
he advanced in high school basketball from All-Conference to
All-State to All-American.
</P>
<P>
   His inner drive became the stuff of legend. To boost his leaping
power, he filled his sneakers with 10 pounds of lead. To condition
himself to dribble without looking at the ball, he donned
eyeglasses with cardboard taped to the bottom. He trained 3 1/2
hours a day, Sunday through Friday, eight hours on Saturday. And
when a young woman asked him for a date, Bradley politely declined.
``I have a girlfriend,'' he told her. ``Basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 75 colleges pursued Bradley with basketball
scholarships, but he opted for the academic rigors of Princeton,
where athletic scholarships are prohibited by the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable college career, he averaged more than 30 points
a game and, in 1965, led Princeton past the powerhouses of the day
to the semifinals of the NCAA national championship. In helping to
clinch the consolation game, Bradley scored 58 points, a
single-game playoff record, and he finished the season as the
college player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him play in college,'' says Bob Cousy, the Hall of
Fame playmaker who won six NBA championships with the Boston
Celtics. ``Despite the fact that he wasn't a 7-footer and wasn't
that acrobatic, he had skills that made him every bit as dominant
as everyone said he was.''
</P>
<P>
   By 19, Bradley had attained such fame that he needed a part-time
secretary to help answer his mail.
</P>
<P>
   Infatuated with the tweedy, book-toting celebrity, the New York
press corps fawned over Bradley when he joined the Knicks on Dec.
9, 1967. The New York Times declared him an amalgam of ``Jack
Armstrong, the All-American boy,'' ``the fictional Sir Galahad,''
and some of the league's best players: Cousy (who had retired four
years earlier), Oscar Robertson, and Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   All the hoopla piqued unusual curiosity among Bradley's new
teammates before his first game, which drew a then-rare sellout
crowd. ``When he got undressed in the locker room,'' said Dick
Barnett, a veteran guard, ``we all thought he would have a big `S'
on his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley joined a team in dire need of help. For years, the
Knicks had dwelled near the cellar of their division, perenially
swept aside by the Celtics. In signing Bradley to a four-year,
$500,000 contract _ when the average NBA salary was $9,500 _ the
Knicks hiked expectations for the rookie. And the fans expected
nothing short of greatness from ``Dollar Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw him as the savior,'' says Dave DeBusschere, Bradley's
roommate with the Knicks. ``New York was starved for a good team,
and they expected Bill to singlehandedly turn it around. Not too
many players have come into pro basketball under that kind of
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's debut, the crowd shrieked every time he touched the
ball _ in pregame warmups. ``Not even the debut of Babe Ruth as a
New York Yankee evoked more hysterical acclaim,'' the New York
Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bradley failed. He had played the forward position
throughout his amateur career, yet the Knicks assigned him to play
guard, a role that demanded more speed and dexterity than the
6-foot-5 rookie possessed. ``You could tell he wasn't equipped for
the role,'' DeBusschere says. ``The guys he was playing against
were clearly taking advantage of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks lost eight of their first 10 games with Bradley.
Memories of his college heroics quickly faded. And Bradley's
inability to guard swifter opponents became an everyday burden,
best exemplified in a Christmas game against the Celtics in Boston.
As he tried to keep up with Boston's Sam Jones, Bradley suddenly
lost track of where he was on the court. Jones sped away; Bradley
slammed blindly into the Celtics' massive backup center, Wayne
Embry, and crumpled to the parquet floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those first months, it was clear I wasn't going to make
it,'' Bradley says. ``The cheers quickly turned to boos. It was a
difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks fired their coach, Dick McGuire, after Bradley's 10th
game. ``That could have been my fault,'' McGuire said recently of
Bradley's early struggle. ``I played him at guard, and the other
guys were so much quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley remained at guard under McGuire's successor, Red
Holzman. And when the rookie continued to struggle, Holzman rode
him mercilessly, mocking his Ivy League pedigree and chiding him
about his lucrative contract.

A CONSERVATIVE CALL TO ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most important night of Gary Bauer's life began in less than
ordinary fashion, as most nights did for him back in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   A too-sincere high school senior, a little guy whose classmates
mocked him and sometimes beat him, Bauer was parked on the couch in
his family's modest house in Newport, Ky., watching television.
Newport was a Godforsaken, broken-down town then, a haven for
gambling, corruption, other sins. And home was no refuge: Beside
the young Bauer, his alcoholic father guzzled ``probably his third
quart of beer for the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, they watched actor Ronald Reagan address the nation on
behalf of Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to talk of controversial things,'' Reagan began.
``I make no apology for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer was transfixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I have a rendezvous with destiny,'' Reagan said.
America must choose, ``Whether we believe in our capacity for
self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and
confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital
can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It came to be known as ``The Speech.'' And Bauer heard the call,
as clearly as he had heard the altar call at First Baptist back
when he was 13, the congregation belting out ``Amazing Grace,'' the
teenager from the troubled home drawn forward to embrace his
savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to my father and said, `Dad, that guy's gonna be
president some day, and I'm going to work for him in the White
House,' '' Bauer, now 53, recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `You're nuts.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years later, Bauer's father came to visit him in the
West Wing of Reagan's White House, where he was working as a
domestic policy adviser. Bauer heard The Speech dozens of times in
the 1980s, surrounded by others who had answered the call that
night. And every time, Bauer says, it was as true to him as it had
been Oct. 27, 1964.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about Ronald Reagan all the time, the other
candidates. Sprinkle his name about like confetti, each of them
claiming the mantle of the GOP's sainted, now sadly infirm hero.
Even Bill Bradley, the Democrat, invokes Reagan, for his leadership
skills.
</P>
<P>
   This makes Bauer angry. Where were they in 1976, he wants to
know. When he was a campaign volunteer sweating for the dream. This
close to his hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quite frankly believe that if that wonderful, decent man
wasn't suffering from a horrible disease, he'd be holding press
conferences right now about whether we have forgotten what he
taught us,'' Bauer says.
</P>
<P>
   The party has come loose from the moral moorings Reagan had
fixed so tightly, Bauer says. That's why Bauer had to come forward,
put aside his role as president of the Family Research Council and
chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, and bring his
efforts to protect unborn children and traditional marriage and
morality into presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   So, here he is. Visiting New Hampshire middle schools on brisk
mornings, telling rosy-cheeked 8th-graders that an 11-year-old rape
victim who gets pregnant should not be allowed to have an abortion.
Challenging an audience of high school seniors with his argument
that allowing same-sex marriages will throw society open to a flood
of other perversities, including pedophilia. Trying to making the
front-runners for the nomination, both avowed opponents of
abortion, look less than committed to the cause. Yet still polling
in the single digits _ 2 percent in the most recent Globe/WBZ-TV
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer was not always so fervent. He leaned towards the
pro-lifers, but not strongly. It was Reagan who put him in charge
of researching the abortion issue, exposing Bauer to much that
repelled him, giving him that passion, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer chafes at being called a one-issue candidate. He has
spoken as much of China as of abortion, he says. But he cannot
pretend the latter is not much more important to him, ``the great
civil rights crusade of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   And he rejects suggestions that he is in the race to build up
his national profile, or to land a berth in a Bush administration.
Sure, he says, if you were laying bets, you'd have to go with
George W.
</P>
<P>
   ``But politics is a history of surprises and we'll have to wait
and see,'' he says. ``I think we've already beaten expectations and
whatever happens, I believe I'm going to be a voice in politics for
a long, long time.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... the father.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took a brief stint outside politics to lure Gore back into
the family business.
</P>
<P>
   On his return from Vietnam, Gore entered the divinity school at
Vanderbilt University. It proved the perfect place to spend a year
of study for a young man with many more questions than answers
about life, and whose natural idealism had been, for a time,
sequestered in cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gore switched course again, after Seigenthaler _ who had
known the Gore family for decades and had printed a story Gore had
written from Vietnam _ offered the returning soldier a job.
</P>
<P>
   It was while he was at the Tennessean that Gore began to
consider the possibility that he might one day run for office. The
idea wasn't in the front of his mind _ he hadn't even discussed it
with Tipper _ but it had been percolating for years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had moved up from the police beat, and begun covering city
hall and local politics. He attended board meetings and council
meetings; he watched local citizens volunteer their time to help
their community.
</P>
<P>
   He still loved writing and reporting, but slowly, his attitude
toward politics began to thaw. ``I began to let myself feel
idealism again about the possibility for politics to be a force for
good,'' Gore says.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters at the paper not only thought Gore would ultimately
run for office, but they even jokingly came up with slogans for
him. ``We all just assumed that young Al would follow in the
footsteps of his father,'' says Charles Fontenay, who worked at the
Tennessean with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It took Gore longer to realize his own change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``My evolution toward thinking about politics had advanced
further beneath the surface than I really had given evidence of in
talking to people openly about it, even to Tipper,'' Gore says. ``I
just hadn't articulated it, even to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He had, however, taken some pains to preserve the choice of
politics for himself, should desire and opportunity arise. There
was his shift in majors in college, which suggested to his thesis
adviser, Richard Neustadt, that he'd had a ``stray thought or two''
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly he made his decision about military service well
aware of the potential political ramifications of his choice. He
even managed to complete a couple of years of law school while he
built his portfolio as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me a couple of times and said, `Do you think I need
a law degree to be a congressman or to go into politics?' ''
Armistead recalls.
</P>
<P>
   So, the seed of the idea had been planted. The unexpected call
from Seigenthaler matched an unexpected sense of calling. Gore was
ready. And he won, bringing the family name back to Capitol Hill,
launching a political career that would take him to the Senate in
1984 and the vice presidency in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson would visit his old college friend, shortly after his
election to the House. He recalls staring at a picture on Gore's
office wall of a huge crowd at Carnegie Hall, applauding.
</P>
<P>
   Gore smiled: ``As long as they keep clapping, John, I am still
in this business.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 WASHINGTON: ... a lot.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time, George W. couldn't let his dad down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a coming of age for Bush, a realization that all the
talent in the world _ and he always has had tremendous talent _
doesn't win games if you are out of shape and don't have a game
plan,'' says Ron Kaufman, a GOP committeeman from Massachusetts who
was a top aide in Bush's 1988 presidential campaign. ``At 40,
George W. got focused on what he wanted to do with his life,
eliminated those things that were counterproductive to his
business, politics, and family, and he moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1987 Bush packed up his family and moved to Washington
to become his father's right-hand man, his eyes and ears inside the
presidential campaign. Culturally and generationally, George W. was
perfectly suited to be the bridge between his polite Yankee family
and the late Lee Atwater, the profane, take-no-prisoners campaign
strategist from South Carolina. He also served as unofficial chief
of his father's loyalty police _ not heavy-handed or
quick-tempered, Kaufman insists, but a team builder trusted as
``everybody's shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A candidate really needs someone to be unquestionably,
unquestioningly his person, and for Bush, that was his son,'' says
Chase Untermeyer, who has known the family for decades and worked
in the Bush administration. ``And it was very clear that George
W.'s entire, consuming passion was his father's politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also clear that the son harbored some political ambitions
of his own. Tougher, more charismatic, and endowed with keener
political instincts than his father, George W. observed the 1988
presidential campaign from the inside and learned a lot about
grass-roots organizing, fund-raising, media and advertising, and
the importance of reaching out to ethnic groups and religious and
social conservatives that the elder Bush never comfortably
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Bush considered putting the experience to work in the 1990 Texas
governor's race. By then, Dallas-based Harken Energy Corp. had
agreed to buy Spectrum 7, Bush's debt-ridden oil company, and
compensate him with $600,000 in stock. But neither the resume nor
the man was fully formed, and he decided against running. Only when
the president-elect's son got an opportunity in late 1988 to put
together a partnership to buy the Texas Rangers baseball team did
he prove his mettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really changed his life was his decision to buy and run
the baseball team,'' says Betts, a Manhattan sports and
entertainment executive who became a major investor in the Rangers
franchise. ``So much of what he had done before mirrored his dad.
This was the first time he had really departed from the script and
the life his father had led, and he was extremely successful at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was good for baseball, and baseball was good to him. ``He
wasn't all flash and no substance,'' said Dallas lawyer Tom
Schieffer, a former president of the Rangers. ``To him it was more
than a business. Bush was passionate about baseball, and he made it
a public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   With business acumen, political savvy, and a famous name, Bush
took what Texans generally agreed was a sad-sack franchise and
boosted it into a popular pennant contender. He also engineered the
building of a dazzling new ballpark, financed largely by the city
of Arlington through a half-penny hike in the local sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, Bush hit a home run: His $600,000 investment in the
Rangers in 1989 returned him $14.9 million when the team was sold
in 1998. As important as the money, the public exposure, political
contacts, and confidence he built through baseball made Bush a
credible GOP candidate for governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it looked like a fool's errand. Incumbent Democratic
Governor Ann Richards was popular and particularly deft at needling
the Bushes with her homespun wit. But by now Bush had found the
religion and self-control not to be bedeviled. Studiously avoiding
the mistakes of his father's failed reelection race in 1992, Bush
stayed focused and pulled off an upset. Four years later he was
reelected with 68 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought he could be successful against Richards,'' said
Michigan Governor John Engler, one of 25 GOP governors helping Bush
in the upcoming state primaries and caucuses. ``To run in the face
of knowing you don't have a chance, to resist the tit-for-tat
name-calling, showed extreme confidence. It also showed that George
W. Bush is extraordinarily serene and comfortable with who he is.''

PASSIONLESS IOWA RACE UNLIKELY TO END IN UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ With one notable exception, the entire cast of
presidential candidates have fanned out across Iowa in an attempt
to breathe a bit of drama into the most desultory contest since the
Hawkeye state became a political stage a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   From a community college in Council Bluffs to the Bee Hive in
Davenport, Republican and Democratic hopefuls appealed for support
in Monday's caucuses, but the last hours of the race in Iowa have
taken on the air of ``garbage time'' in the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore command
impressive organizations and hold comfortable leads in public
opinion polls here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome is not going to be terribly surprising,'' said
Hugh Winebrenner, the caucus historian at Drake University.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican wild card, Senator John McCain of Arizona, is not
even competing in Iowa, and Gore's only Democratic challenger, Bill
Bradley, appears to be steeling himself for a second-place finish.
``We knew all along that Iowa was a state that rewards entrenched
power,'' Bradley said Thursday of Gore's advantage in the ranks of
organized labor and within the party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican Steve Forbes has invested millions here, he
makes no predictions of an upset victory, either. He promises only
``a big surprise,'' which is believed to mean a respectable
second-place showing.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Iowa caucuses in the past, there seems to be no
come-from-behind surge, no election-eve earthquake developing this
final weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason has to do with the money primary in 1999,'' said
David Yepsen, political editor of the Des Moines Register. ``In the
old days, the candidates came here to do well in order to raise
money and fight again. Now they have to have money to start with.
The winnowing process has been ceded to the money primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with rich campaign treasuries, both Bush and Gore
targeted Iowa, enlisted the help of the best local players in their
parties and seemed to suck all the air out of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Republican race started, a large number of candidates
came here to explore,'' said Winebrenner, who has followed every
caucus since the event's inception in 1972. ``All that changed when
George W. Bush came in with his giant money vacuum cleaner.''
Bush's triumph at a straw poll at a Republican gathering last
summer solidified his position and drove several candidates from
the race, including Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle, and Elizabeth
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, ``came in early, trying to lock up everybody in
the state,'' Winebrenner said. ``It was interesting for a while
when Bradley decided to run, but he's been paddling upstream all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since Gore put Bradley on the defensive in a
televised debate here, accusing the former New Jersey senator of
opposing flood relief for Iowa in a long-forgotten Senate vote,
Bradley has moved in a funk.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments have broken down in the Democratic fight to arcane
disputes over tax proposals and health care. On the Republican
side, the candidates parse differences over the degree of their
opposition to abortion. Speeches are delivered by rote.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa may cast the first votes in the nation Monday night, but
the state has played second fiddle to New Hampshire for most of the
political season. Because competition is more intense in both party
primaries in New Hampshire, Bush, Bradley, and Gore chose to spend
part of their time there last week rather than commit themselves to
an all-out stretch drive in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   There are no echoes of the closing rush made here by Patrick J.
Buchanan four years ago, when he mobilized resistance to the
leading Republican candidate, Bob Dole, and nearly overtook him in
the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Christian conservative movement, united in
stunning fashion in 1988 by evangelist Pat Robertson and exploited
in 1996 by Buchanan, is now divided among several Republican
candidates, including Forbes as well as bit actors Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes. The religious right is unlikely to spring another trap.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is a grass-roots rebellion expected to arise suddenly around
the state, such as Rich Bond's army of volunteers that materialized
in 1980 after the young organizer put together a network for the
elder George Bush that overwhelmed the favorite in the Iowa race,
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, great issues that once loomed over Iowa
caucus debates _ war and peace, American hostages in Iran, economic
inequities _ no longer exist. Confronted with prosperity, Bradley
has been forced to compete against Gore by calling for bold
health-care initiatives, arguing that ``we should be fixing our
roof when the sun is shining.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the winter, the Iowa contest has lacked passion, a
close race, an intense debate, the presence of McCain, or any kind
of external dynamic _ such as the appearance of Gennifer Flowers
and an old letter about the military draft during Bill Clinton's
campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is attracting attention this weekend, as hundreds of
reporters, photographers, and television crew members descend on
the state for the climax. But the numbers in the press corps
pursuing Bush and Gore are greater than the crowds greeting some
candidates.

 WASHINGTON: ... in politics.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salter believes that the POW experience taught McCain the limits
of a lone-wolf existence. Bud Day and the other POWs saved McCain's
life, and kept him sane. By submerging his ego in the organized
resistance of the POWs, says Salter, McCain learned the virtues of
sacrifice, and the power of being part of something greater than
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned that it wasn't enough, that no human being could
handle it alone. That he had to become part of a greater whole. And
he learned the satisfaction of being part of something that
encompassed him, yet liberated him,'' says Salter.
</P>
<P>
   McCain emerged from Vietnam with a stronger sense of duty and
public service than before. ``It wasn't until I was deprived of her
company that I fell in love with America,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The POWs were freed in 1973. McCain and the others were welcomed
home like heroes. His family treated him with deference, not
wanting to probe or pester him as he made the adjustment to normal
life.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's brother Joe waited a while, then went to see him in
California. John McCain picked his brother up at the airport in a
convertible, and seemed his old charming self at the base officer's
club, or when driving around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every now and then he fell really quiet,'' Joe McCain
recalls. ``John had always been a guy constantly in motion: social
motion, verbal motion, mental motion. Partying. Arguing. Fussing.
Having fun. Being a pilot. Now he seemed to be focusing on who he
was, as opposed to just living in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the feeling that what had changed in him was that the
experience had taken what was inside of him and condensed it.
Tempered it, like steel,'' says Joe McCain. ``He was a lot more
reflective. He came out looking more forward, and more backward. It
all made him think about that inner gyroscope, that compass.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to these changes were the lessons McCain learned from
the times he failed: when the pain and fear caused him to act less
nobly, and submit to his jailers. To this day, McCain is haunted by
a confession he signed in Vietnam, under torture, confessing to
being a ``black criminal'' and an ``air pirate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obsessed and tortured by guilt. We all were. To this
day I get angry with myself,'' says Swindle. ``But we did the best
we could. And he realizes, over time, that we all fall short of
what we aspire to be. And that is where forgiveness comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   On several notable occasions since he returned from the war _
when battling POW-MIA profiteers, reaching out to old foes from the
antiwar movement, or giving President Bill Clinton the political
cover to normalize relations with Vietnam _ McCain displayed true
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton-hating veterans challenged the President's right to
visit the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial in Washington, McCain offered
to escort the commander in chief. And it was McCain who defended
and befriended antiwar leader David Ifshin in the years before his
death from cancer in 1997, though Ifshin had been one of those
students who traveled to Hanoi and made propaganda broadcasts for
the North Vietnamese, which had been piped into McCain's cell.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's ability ``to move on '' is perhaps the most impressive
legacy of his time in POW hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closeness of the relationship that we developed in prison
is hard to adequately describe,'' he explains. ``And the senior
officers, especially, recognized that many of us were weak, and
sometimes didn't do too well under the pressure of our
interrogators, as perhaps we would have liked to. They displayed
compassion by encouraging us, even if we had failed, to go back
again and do better next time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson he never forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah. Oh yeah,'' McCain says, sitting in a straight-backed
chair, his elbows on his knees, staring at the floor as he answers
the question. ``Recognition of my own failures had the obvious
result of making me a lot more tolerant of the failings of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are individual Vietnamese who, if I saw them again, I am
sure I would attempt to inflict some physical punishment,'' he
says. ``But the South Vietnamese were our allies and friends, and
they are now part of overall Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my job. . .was to help the healing and reconciliation
process, so we could give help to those Vietnam veterans who had
not come all the way home, to continue that journey,'' McCain says.

INVENTOR'S IMPATIENCE MAY HELP THE WORLD BREATHE EASIER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Help may be on the horizon to fight severe air pollution in big
cities under federal pressure to clean up their act.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Ballard fuel cell, an electrochemical device
converts hydrogen and air directly into electricity to run electric
motors _ such as those in cars.
</P>
<P>
   There are no nasty byproducts: Its emission is water pure enough
to drink.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no need for a slow recharging period after use. The
Ballard cell is simply refueled with compressed hydrogen when it
runs low.
</P>
<P>
   If the skeptic in you is wondering where these cars with Ballard
fuel cells are and where this compressed hydrogen will come from,
consider this: DaimlerChrysler has a prototype car on the road in
Germany and plans to put fuel cell cars on the market by 2004,
along with Toyota and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, Texaco and Arco are working on developing the fuel
infrastructure with compressed hydrogen necessary to run these
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Sound too good to be true? Considering that it was developed by
a few scientists and engineers working for next to nothing in a
little Canadian town, such an energy source does seem almost
unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes for a terrific book, written by journalist Tom
Koppel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ballard fuel cell promises nothing less than to solve some
of the world's worst air pollution problems,'' he writes. ``Yet, it
all began with a handful of people working on shoestring budgets
for a tiny Canadian company, Ballard Power Systems, in a
little-known city of North Vancouver.''
</P>
<P>
   Development and implementation of the Ballard fuel cell is
discussed in Koppel's book, ``Powering the Future: The Ballard Fuel
Cell and the Race to Change the World'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 276
pages).
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Ballard, a citizen of Canada and the United States
through his parents, did not set out to find an environmentally
friendly energy source, Koppel writes. Ballard became interested in
the idea when he was director of research for the newly formed
conservation office of the Army during the energy crisis of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard quickly realized that conservation was not a practical
means to solve air pollution problems or U.S. dependence on foreign
oil. Instead, a cleaner energy source had to be discovered, he
decided.
</P>
<P>
   So Ballard quit his well-paid job to start a company to create
such an energy source. Tight money forced Ballard and his wife and
children to start a restaurant to finance his dream, Koppel writes
as he deftly chronicles the ups and downs of such an
entrepreneurial effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, taking the Ballard fuel cell to where it is today
took inspiration, perspiration, and a heavy dose of serendipity,''
he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, as the company began to succeed, so did its
stock. Now 35 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler and Ford, Ballard
Power Systems stock is up tenfold in the past three years. Daimler
and Ballard also agreed to create a separate company called Ballard
Automotive that would be owned jointly and would market the fuel
cells and fuel cell engines made by DBB.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ballard is a millionaire several times over, money may
be the least of his interests.
</P>
<P>
   As he told students graduating from the University of Victoria,
British Columbia: ``Do not be patient. All things to do not come to
those who wait. Challenge the normal. Question conventional wisdom.
... Dare to be in a hurry to change things for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard was in a hurry, and his urgency may help us all breathe
a little better.

prime time? By Bernard Weinraub.

   TIMEWARNER-EMI (London) _ Time Warner plans to announce on
Monday that it will acquire EMI Recorded Music for about $1

   ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ In the world of
business-to-business Internet commerce, it has become difficult to
keep up with the rapid-fire creation of so-called e-marketplaces _
the darlings du jour of the investment community. The vast lineup
of newcomers to this e-commerce arena speaks to the riches they see
awaiting any company that can dominate a given business-to-business
sector. Internet marketplaces are part of a business-to-business
e-commerce industry that is expected by 2003 to reach $1.3 billion
in annual revenue _ more than 10 times the projected size of the
business-to-consumer market. But capturing that cash will prove
difficult, analysts said, and not just because of the growing

<P>
   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ While Israel and the
Palestinians will intensify negotiations over the next few weeks,
it is unlikely that they will reach a framework agreement by the
goal of mid-February, Israel's senior negotiator said Sunday. By
Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-WEIZMAN (Jerusalem) _ Israeli President Ezer Weizman said
late Sunday he would stay at his post in spite of a police
investigation into suspected tax fraud and corruption. (Summary
from wire.) By William A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-POLITICS (Undated) _ With less than four weeks remaining
before Iran's 38-million voters elect a new Parliament, the
conservative Muslim clerics who have held the country in a rigid
political grip since 1979 have moved to shore up their power. By
John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   GENETIC-ENGINEERING-TRADE (Undated) _ Nearly a year after the
United States blocked a proposed global treaty to regulate trade in
genetically modified products, delegates from more than 130 nations
will resume negotiations Monday in Montreal. After months of
international concern about bioengineered food, Washington will be
on the defensive. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Grozny, Russia) _ Russian troops have reached
Grozny, but it is clear that they are not of the verge of victory.
By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-U.S. (Undated) _ When Richard C. Holbrooke took over as
Security Council president for January, he declared it the month of
Africa. But council members have been getting more than an
education on important African issues, from an AIDS epidemic to
multiple civil wars. They have also been absorbing some lessons in
U.S. politics, election-year style. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-BOMB-PROTEST (Madrid, Spain) _ An estimated 1.1 million
people marched through downtown Madrid on Sunday to protest a
car-bomb attack seen as a resurgence of Basque separatists'
32-year-old campaign of violence. By Al Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   YUGOSLAVIA-U.S. (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The State Department is
backing the Serbian opposition. At the same time, Voice of America
and Radio Free Europe broadcasts have been cut back for lack of
funding. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CULT (Tokyo) _ By changing its name and denouncing its
spiritual leader last week, the religious sect that killed 12
people in a nerve gas attack in the Tokyo subways in 1995 tried to
convince Japanese society that it was no longer a threat. But the
name change from Aum Shinrikyo to Aleph, which is the first letter
of the Hebrew alphabet and signifies renewal for many Japanese,
appears to have raised more fears than it calmed. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-KOHL (Berlin) _ A report that Kohl will tell all about
secret donors turns out to be a hoax. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ROME-HOMELESS (Rome) _ Eight homeless people have died on the
streets of Rome since New Year's Eve, the start of the Vatican's
2,000 Jubilee, including a 60-year old woman who died near St.
Peter's basilica. Those deaths have caused shock and soul-searching
in a usually balmy capital where homelessness mostly used to seem
like a preoccupation of larger, harsher cities like New York or
Moscow. By Alessandra Stanley.

<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-GUARD (Austin, Texas) _ Early next month, nearly 800
men and women of the 49th Armored Division will board transport
planes and fly to Bosnia. Ultimately, they will take command of the
American sector in NATO's multinational operation there. The
Pentagon has deployed Guard and Reserve units overseas before; more
than 265,000 were called up to support the Persian Gulf war in
1990. But the 49th's mission is something new. Not since the Korean
War has a National Guard division commanded an overseas operation.
By Steven Lee Myers. (First article in a continuing series.)
</P>
<P>
   USC-ENTERTAINMENT-STUDIES (Los Angeles) _ Here in the city where
``entertainment'' means everything from a televised freeway chase
to a multimillion-dollar movie, the University of Southern
California is embarking on an ambitious inter-disciplinary effort
to study entertainment as a defining concept of 21st century life,
in fields from law to architecture, with the dual goal of prompting
intellectual debate and training the next generation of media
moguls. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHEAST-ICE-STORM (Atlanta) _ A storm swept through parts of
the mid Atlantic and Southeast states with rain, ice and snow early
Sunday, glazing highways and knocking out power to more than
300,000 customers in Georgia, about 270,000 of them in the Atlanta
metropolitan area. By David Firestone and Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ The Cuban American National Foundation
(CANF) on Sunday offered to fly the two grandmothers of Elian
Gonzalez, the Cuban boy rescued from Florida waters in November, to
Miami to visit him and his relatives there, according to the wires.
The organization, which represents the large Cuban exile community
in Miami, said a private plane was being prepared to take them to
South Florida to visit Elian. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   AFTERSCHOOL-PROGRAMS (Undated) _ The explosion in after-school
programs _ federal funding alone has ballooned from $1 million in
1997 to $454 million this year _ represents nothing less than a
re-imagining of the school day for the first time in generations,
as educators and policymakers seek to respond to the realities of
working families and what may be missing from the classroom. By

<P>
   UCLA-SURVEY (Undated) _ This year's class of first-year college
students, having survived the most competitive higher-education
admissions process ever and saddled with increased family and
financial responsibilities, entered school more stressed out than

``Frankly, an awful lot of people feel they have no effective voice

   CLINTON-SPEECHWRITER (Washington) _ J. Terry Edmonds is the
keeper of the disc. With just days to go before President Clinton
delivers the final State of Union speech of his presidency, there
is a mad scramble underway among aides and outsiders to insert a
paragraph, or just a sentence, or even a fleeting phrase, into the
final text. As the president's chief speechwriter, Edmonds is the
guardian of the computer disc containing the speech's latest draft,
and the coordinator of the policy proposals, accolades, reflections
and humorous asides that will pop up Thursday night on Clinton's
teleprompter. By Marc Lacey.

   HOLLYWOOD _ Only a few months ago, the situation comedy was a
fading genre on television. Television executives groaned about low
ratings, derivative shows, lazy comedy writing, the rise of hipper
cable-channel programs and the same old tired format set in an
apartment or workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   A surprise success in its first two weeks, the new half-hour Fox
comedy, about a dizzy family whose middle son is a genius, has not
only resuscitated the troubled network but revived hopes for the
genre. It was almost as if the coffin was being lowered when
someone noticed the corpse was breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' which has received the best reviews
of any comedy in years, has tied for No. 2, after ``E.R.,'' among
viewers in the 18-to-49 age group coveted by networks and
advertisers. In its first week, ``Malcolm'' was seen by 22.4
million viewers overall. In its second week, the show's audience
increased to 23.2 million viewers, making it the most-watched
comedy on television.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Malcolm in the Middle'' actually restores the status
of sitcoms _ as ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' did for
game shows _ or merely results in poor imitations, will not be
known for a while. But the impact on the networks has been fairly
swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can be certain of is that every comedy pitch
will include the pitch, `a ``Malcolm in the Middle' kind of
sensibility,'' said David Kissinger, president of Studios USA
Television, an arm of USA Networks. ``I've already begun to hear
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is unusual in several ways. For one thing, it is more
expensive than other sitcoms. It costs almost $1.2 million for each
episode, in contrast to the traditional sitcom, which in its first
year may cost $800,000 to $900,000 an episode. That's because
``Malcolm'' is not made on a stage, with three or four cameras,
before a studio audience whose laughter is often heightened by a
laugh track. This process goes back to ``I Love Lucy,'' which was
first broadcast in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Malcolm'' is made like a movie, with a single camera,
on an indoor set as well as outdoors, without an audience or a
laugh track. Another show using the same technique is HBO's ``Sex
and the City.'' This single-camera method, rarely used on sitcoms,
gives the show a far more realistic look and implicitly signals
that the show is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single camera allows audiences to have a fresh view of the
form,'' said Gail Berman, president of the show's producer, Regency
Television, an independent company affiliated with Fox, a unit of
News Corp. ``The form hasn't moved that much. It goes back to Desi
Arnaz. Now, with `Malcolm,' you'll see additional single-camera
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show's early success is hardly based on its grittier
look and its form. Its appeal _ and Ms. Berman said she was
surprised that the audience was heavily male _ is that its
characters are funny and unpredictable, and thus a far cry from the
failed sitcoms in recent seasons cloned from the big hits
``Seinfeld'' and ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Linwood Boomer, the show's creator and executive producer and a
longtime TV writer of programs like ``Third Rock From the Sun,''
called ``Malcolm'' a faintly autobiographical comedy about a
middle-class family: four squabbling brothers, and an
unconventional mom and dad who seem to watch over the boys with
humor and amazement.
</P>
<P>
   The early success of ``Malcolm'' underscores the strange and
sudden turnarounds that take place in the TV business _ just as in
the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Fox _ and its executives _ were in the doldrums.
The network's high-profile comedy series, ``Action,'' about a
loathsome Hollywood producer, had failed, and Fox was littered with
duds like ``Time of Your Life,'' ``Family Guy,'' ``Ryan
Caulfield,'' ``Harsh Realm'' and ``Get Real.'' At the same time,
shows like ``X-Files'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' were aging, and
Fox seemed to be relying on often-silly reality programs that
embarrassed the network's executives.
</P>
<P>
   The UPN network, which is owned by Viacom and Chris-Craft
Industries, was almost written off by rivals and certainly by
critics for its failure to find an audience. Today, UPN's audience
has climbed 35 percent over last season among adults 18 to 49 _ and
an extraordinary 90 percent among men 18 to 34 _ because of the
success of several shows, notably its Thursday night wrestling
extravaganza, ``WWF Smackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   And Walt Disney's ABC unit, which finished the season as the No.
3 network last year, will likely finish in the No. 1 position this
year among adults 18 to 49 because of the success of
``Millionaire.'' This hugely successful quiz show has already
spawned imitators at the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week success of ``Malcolm in the Middle'' will probably
spawn imitators as well. ``The rules are off,'' said Rick Rosen, a
partner at the Endeavor Agency, which packaged the show. Until now,
he said, ``when clients tell us about their new shows, and they say
they're single-camera shows, we tell them that if they mention
single camera, the networks won't validate their parking. The
networks are so desperate for hits now. The success of `Malcolm'
shows there are no more rules.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The show itself was initially developed for UPN, which passed on
it and allowed Ms. Berman and Regency Television to bring it to
Fox. Doug Herzog, president of entertainment at Fox Broadcasting,
read the script last year on a plane flying from New York to Los
Angeles and agreed to broadcast the show.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, who was new to the Fox job after working as president
and chief executive of Comedy Central from 1995 to 1999, said, ``My
naivete worked in my favor. Here was a script about a 9-year-old
kid, a single camera show, no laugh track, Linwood not considered a
well-known writer. This was, like, authentic. It was funny. It was
not politically correct. I said, `Let's give it a shot.'''
</P>
<P>
   To rival television executives, the success of the show is based
not only on its humor, but on the expensive marketing campaign
created by Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Television Entertainment
Group. Weeks before the show's premiere, on Jan. 9, Fox began
heavily advertising the show on radio shows that appeal to
audiences between 18 and 34 years old, on cable networks like MTV
and on billboards at shopping malls around the nation. The cost of
the campaign reached more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, just before Christmas, Grushow got a call from a
rival, Stu Bloomberg, co-chairman of ABC Entertainment Television
Group. Bloomberg was driving in Massachusetts. ``He said he kept
hearing `Malcolm' ads on the radio,'' Grushow laughed. ``He wanted
to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow said he was certain that the success of ``Malcolm''
would have a ripple effect on other networks. He said that the
relatively unused forms of a single camera and no laugh track was
the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the American public tends to have gotten pretty
cynical about those brightly lit sitcoms with souped-up laugh
tracks,'' said Grushow. ``There's a lack of honesty to them that is
clearly not appealing to what has become a much more sophisticated
audience over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sures, a television agent at United Talent Agency, said that
``Malcolm'' would have ``enormous impact.'' But, he added, if a
spate of comedies about offbeat families, made with a single
camera, results, they will not be seen until 2001. At the moment,
scripts have already been ordered and networks are starting to make
pilots for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family sitcom has always had a cyclical history,'' he
said. ``Before `The Cosby Show,' family shows were seen as dead.
`The Cosby Show' revitalized it. Then by last year it seemed to hit
bottom. Now, with `Malcolm,' the up cycle is back.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, some current successful and enduring
network comedies, among them ``Friends,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Dharma and
Greg,'' ``King of Queens,'' ``Will and Grace,'' ``Drew Carey'' and
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' But in the last year, the sitcom
fatalities have mounted: ``The Naked Truth,'' ``The Mike O'Malley
Show,'' ``Union Square,'' ``Conrad Bloom,'' ``Caroline in the
City,'' ``Fired Up,'' ``Suddenly Susan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to find a show that taps into a unique voice,
one that pulls you in and separates itself from the clutter,''
Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of ABC Entertainment Group, said.
```Malcolm' has done that, in much the same way as our show, `Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.'''
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, executives were somewhat buoyed by the success of their
rival's show. NBC, while broadcasting ``Seinfeld,'' for years had
also flooded its schedule with often-lame comedies that are no
longer on the air. Garth Ancier, the president of NBC
Entertainment, who took over the job last year, said that the
number of comedies had recently been ``trending down'' in favor of
dramatic shows. Now, perhaps, the trend is reversing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just picked up a show called `Daddio''' he said. ``It's
about a nuclear family with a stay-at-home dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was written before ``Malcolm.'' But the success of the
Fox show certainly didn't hurt the prospects of ``Daddio'' getting
scheduled.

PERRY T. RATHBONE, WAS DIRECTOR OF MFA; AT AGE 88 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDGAR J. DRISCOLL JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Perry T. Rathbone of Cambridge, an internationally
known art authority and former director of the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts, died Saturday after a long illness at Sancta Maria
Nursing Home in Cambridge. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rathbone was director of the MFA from 1955 until 1972.
During much of that time he also was the museum's acting curator of
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down, he became head of the American branch of
Christie's USA, the London-based art auction house. He joined
Christie's in 1973 and five years later was elected senior vice
president and director of Christie's International. He retired in
1986, and continued as a consultant with Christie's until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to the MFA, Mr. Rathbone was director of the City
Art Museum of St. Louis for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rathbone served the MFA well during his 17 years at the
helm, although clouds of controversy surrounded his last three
years there. They resulted from the museum's acquisition of a
Raphael portrait that had been illegally smuggled out of Italy.
After an investigation by Italian government officials, the
portrait was seized at the museum by US Customs officials and
eventually returned to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the director's role in the acquisition, many felt his
early retirement stemmed from the scandal. However, museum trustees
at the time said: ``No inference or imputation should be attached
to the director's early retirement,'' pointing out that the
retirement came nearly three years after the acquisition of the
small, early 16th-century painting.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Rathbone stepped down, he said he did so because ``the
time has come for a younger man to take the helm of this great
museum _ someone able to respond to the almost unmanageable demands
made upon the director of a great metropolitan museum.''
</P>
<P>
   During his directorship, the museum facility expanded and its
staff, budget, activities, and membership increased greatly.
Membership rose from 2,000 to 15,000. Three new curatorial
departments _ American Decorative Arts, Contemporary Art, and
Pre-Columbian and Primitive Art _ were added, and the museum
undertook the largest physical expansion since 1912.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mr. Rathbone oversaw the renovation of 57 of the
institution's 189 galleries, and brought a number of important
acquisitions, including Ancient and Asiatic treasures, Medieval,
Renaissance and Baroque masterpieces, and the development of a
significant 20th-century art collection.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions included a Cycladic idol, a pair of early Rembrandt
portraits, a 15th-century Flemish triptych, Monet's ``La
Japonaise,'' a Tiepolo, an Il Rosso, a van Leyden, and a Gaughin.
And he laid the foundation for the museum's 20th-century collection
through the acquisition of works by Picasso, Beckmann, Moore, Klee,
Kokoschka and David Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The director also played a major role in the museum's centennial
campaign, which, starting in 1967 raised $9 million and increased
the size of the museum by 80,000 square feet. The centennial,
celebrated in 1970, featured seven major exhibitions and 150 new
acquisitions worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rathbone, a genial, outgoing man, was a former two-term
president of the Association of Art Museum Directors. After
stepping down from the MFA directorship, he served as art
consultant to the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Seattle Art Museum, and
the Japan Financial Journal
</P>
<P>
   He was a graduate of New Rochelle High School in New York, and
of Harvard College in 1933. He did postgraduate work at Harvard's
Fogg Museum of Fine Arts, and was co-director of the Harvard
Society of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rathbone was the author of many works on painters and their
art, including ``Charles Wimar: Painter of the Indian Frontier,''
``Max Beckmann,'' ``Westward the Way,'' ``Mississippi Panorama''
``Lee Gatch,'' ``The Handbook of the Forsyth Wickes Collection''
and `Andrew Wyeth,'' plus many articles for museum bulletins and
art journals.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Euretta (de Cosson); a son, Peter B. of New
Canaan, Conn.; two daughters, Eliza E. of Washington and Belinda T.
of Cambridge; and seven grandchildren.

`GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING': MASTER VERMEER, ISN'T IT, UM, MISSING
SOME SPARK? 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a while, it seems that it will be this kind of novel.
Namely, the painter Johannes Vermeer hires Griet, a serving girl,
to clean his studio. He is struck by her pictorial sense even when
she is arranging vegetables on a platter. She shows a brilliantly
progressing sensibility for his painting: refusing to clean the
windows because it will alter the light on a work in progress,
remarking that a map in the background weakens the composition,
rearranging a blue cloth to provide the needed touch of disorder
for a portrait's serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as model for what will become the celebrated ``The Girl
With a Pearl Earring,'' she knows before Vermeer does that it is
precisely the earring's spark that is needed to ignite the
portrait. And the painter is captivated by her brilliance as well
as her wildly tumbling hair (once she removes her cap) and so ...
bam! boom! ... a swirl of storm, passions and trouble. In short, an
artist romance.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Chevalier steers her novel deliberately close and tacks
abruptly away. The book she has written, despite a lush note or two
and occasional incident overload, is something far different and
better. All but the last two sentences of the previous paragraphs
are there; but they are the armature of a brainy novel whose
passion is ideas.
</P>
<P>
   These range among the dynamics and moralities of art and the
artist, their claims upon life, life's claims upon them and the
struggle of women to find their own values and place in a male
hierarchy, specifically in a 17th-century painter's world. There is
strong feeling, but it rises unforcedly from the book's tactile
evocation of the social, material and emotional detail of life in
Delft of the time, and increasingly from the stormy clarity
achieved by Griet as narrator and protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Griet's arrival in the Vermeer household is a descent. She has
fallen out of her world. Her father, a tile glazier, belongs to the
guild of which Vermeer is master. Thus, when the father is blinded
in a kiln explosion, leaving the family near destitute, his
membership qualifies his daughter for a menial job. Chevalier draws
the distinctions of class in the mercantile Dutch nation as a
contour map whose every gradation bruises the feet.
</P>
<P>
   Griet takes up her post as a sacrifice but also with a tremor of
excitement. Her father has taught her to revere art. Furthermore,
although Griet sleeps in a dirt-floor cellar and must do the
washing for the 10 members of the Vermeer household, her special
duty gives her a distinction that no one else enjoys: not the
painter's high-strung wife, Catharina, nor Maria, his
mother-in-law, nor their children.
</P>
<P>
   Only she is allowed into the studio. Her job is to clean without
moving anything. It is a skill she learned with her father. In
their world or workshop, respectively, blind people and painters
both require objects to remain in place; the former because they
cannot see, the latter because seeing is so searching and
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Griet, her voice perplexed and exploratory (and vibrating
occasionally with anger and desire as she struggles to know who she
is and where she can fit) tells of the three worlds she finds
herself in.
</P>
<P>
   There is her intoxicating discovery of her own perceptive gifts
as she assists Vermeer, grinding his colors, laying out his paints
and ultimately posing. There are her grittier relations with a
bitter fellow servant; Vermeer's wife, Catharina, pregnant and
increasingly jealous up to a final detonation; the children, some
affectionate and one destructively malicious; and Maria, the old
mother-in-law, tragically perceptive and tragically restrained in
her woman's role from doing what she knows should be done. Finally
there is Griet's own family. Her mother, another wise woman, is
wary of her daughter's attachment to her master and eager to get
her safely married to the butcher's son.
</P>
<P>
   Griet's relations with Vermeer are the motor of the novel and
its rising and then falling arc. It stands for much more than
itself. Chevalier's pattern is complex and revealing. There is an
erotic element, but it is never more than implicit. As for flesh,
it is Pieter, the butcher's son and eventual refuge, who stirs
Griet. What Vermeer means to her is transformation, the awakening
of a larger life and an unsuspected power (the power of art, in
short).
</P>
<P>
   Set against this are the material and sexual hegemonies that in
art as elsewhere have worked to suppress or exploit such awakenings
in women. Think of Suzanne Valadon, a 19th-century painter's model
who only after many years and struggles was recognized as a
painter; of Camille Claudel, Rodin's model, whose gift for
sculpture he jealously belittled.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer is gray-eyed, calm, seemingly godlike. Participating in
his work surely is fulfillment. Griet's mother distrusts it. ``I
think his paintings are not good for the soul,'' she says. ``From
the way you talk they could be of religious scenes. It is as if the
woman you describe is the Virgin Mary when she is just a woman,
writing a letter. You give the painting meaning that it does not
have or deserve.'' And Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the naturalist,
optical inventor and Vermeer's friend, warns Griet when he sees her
posing for ``Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyes are worth a room full of gold,'' he tells her. ``But
sometimes he sees the world only as he wants it to be, not as it
is. He does not understand the consequences for others of his point
of view. He thinks only of himself and his work, not of you.'' He
adds: ``The women in his paintings _ he traps them in his world.
You can get lost there.''
</P>
<P>
   That warning comes true but only in part. Griet had known before
her painter did that the portrait needed the flash of the earring.
She knew that using the earring (Catharina's) would mean disaster.
She protested; he insisted, interested only in the painting, not in
her or the consequences. She bears the consequences. She refuses to
be lost, though, and her refusal is the book's triumph, opening the
way to an ending, 10 years later, that weaves together,
sardonically and exhilaratingly, the social and artistic
complexities that Ms. Chevalier has so pungently presented.

CHIP INNOVATOR BETS ON BRAINPOWER, NOT ELECTRIC POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Ditzel must have secrecy in his genes.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, he and his band of engineers operated in stealth
mode. No one else knew quite what they were up to. But their
reputation as chip architects, as well as the backing of investors
that include Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, shrouded
their activities in mysterious, geeky glamor.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of mystery, last Wednesday Ditzel's chip design
company, Transmeta Corp., made a big splash in Silicon Valley by
introducing a new line of microprocessors intended for portable
computers and new types of wireless, hand-held Web-surfing devices.
Some analysts say the chips, which IBM will produce and which are
to be available by the middle of this year, could pose the first
serious challenge in years to the personal computing chip giant,
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the 43-year-old computer designer sat in his
office in Santa Clara, Calif., surrounded by blown-up diagrams of
his chips, and mused on the upbringing that prepared him to lead
200 employees on a five-year secret mission.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that his father, who was a chemical engineer
employed by Monsanto Corp., had moved moved the family to
Washington under mysterious circumstances when little David was 5
years old. They lived there for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what he was doing, but 20 years later I learned
that he had gone to work temporarily for the National Security
Agency to work on their Project Tempest,'' Ditzel recalled. Tempest
was a successful NSA operation to secure electronic communications
equipment from potential eavesdroppers.
</P>
<P>
   Turnabout, in the Ditzel family, is fair play. Until last week,
even Ditzel's parents did not know what Transmeta was up to, other
than something having to do with chip design. ``Rather than risk
inadvertent disclosure by a proud parent, I, and eventually the
rest of Transmeta, usually kept the details to ourselves,'' Ditzel
explained.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the cat is out of the bag, there comes a challenge
far bigger than keeping secrets. He must prove that Transmeta's
technology warrants not only stealth, but the money and industry
ambitions that are now riding on it. The premise behind his chips
is in many ways a startlingly simple notion _but also one of the
most audacious gambles that Silicon Valley has seen in several
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta is picking up a torch originally carried by a hardy
band of computer-design rebels in the late 1970s and 1980s, who bet
that computer performance could be improved by drastically
simplifying the hardware and shifting many of the most complex
operations to software. The approach, known as Reduced Instruction
Set Computing, or RISC, was pioneered at IBM and the University of
California at Berkeley. It created a frenzy of computer innovation
during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for personal computing, RISC ultimately failed. With
the exception of Apple's PowerPC chip, made by IBM and Motorola,
RISC chips were never able to achieve compatibility with existing
personal computer software, which ran on the industry-dominating
chips made by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than RISC, Intel's chips were based on a design called
Complex Instruction Set Computing, or CISC. Despite the greater
complexity of CISC, Intel has been able to use steady advances in
chip-making techniques to squeeze ever greater numbers of
transistors onto each generation of its chips and, thus, ever
greater speed and performance.
</P>
<P>
   So what if that greater performance came at the cost of
requiring considerable amounts of electrical power to operate the
increasingly complex chips _ not to mention power for cooling such
chips, which tend to generate considerable heat? Desktop computer
users could always get enough power from the wall plug. As for
portables _ well, that's what battery chargers were for.
</P>
<P>
   RISC was a concept that Ditzel knew well. He had helped create
the term in 1980 as a graduate student in an academic paper on
which he was co-author with his adviser, David Patterson, a
Berkeley computer scientist.
</P>
<P>
   But 15 years later, as the head of computer design at Sun
Microsystems, Ditzel was forced to concede that the RISC mission
had failed. Not only had it lost out to the Intel personal computer
standard, but he saw that even the RISC microprocessors used in
Sun's workstations were rapidly becoming as baroque as Intel's CISC
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RISC guys didn't really understand what their own idea was
about,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and burned out, Ditzel told Sun's chief executive
Scott McNealy one day in March 1995 that he was going on sabbatical
_ and would probably not return.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two months he stayed at his house, where he lives
alone, in the foothills overlooking Silicon Valley. He took walks
each day and ``studied my navel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to clear my mind and think about the principles
for a computer design that would have both simplicity and
compatibility,'' he said. ``The key idea came to me like a light
bulb was going on: It's the battery, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he concluded, lay not in silicon hardware but,
instead, in clever software _ code that might achieve compatibility
with the dominant Intel standard, but that might also reduce the
power needs of a computer's microprocessor. Saving power, he knew,
would be a key to succeeding in the post-PC era, in which handheld
devices, unhindered by power cords, are expected to become an
increasingly common way to compute and to connect to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this tradeoff between hardware is not a new concept
in computing. But Transmeta's decision to radically simplify
hardware, and its potential for low-energy portable computing
devices, comes at a time when Intel is moving in the opposite
direction with its next-generation, IA64 chip architecture.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel's appreciation for the tradeoff traces to his
undergraduate days at the University of Iowa in the 1970s, when he
used and attempted to modify a maddeningly inflexible
hardware-centric computer called the Symbol. His bachelor's degree
was a double major in computer science and electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't choose between hardware and software,'' he said of
his dual academic track.
</P>
<P>
   That indecision left him with an appreciation for the
interrelationship between circuitry and coding that many computer
designers lack.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, RISC had been overtaken in design circles by an
approach called VLIW, for Very Long Instruction Word. But the
philosophy was the same: Simplify the hardware and do more complex
things in software. VLIW, Ditzel knew, would be his starting point.
</P>
<P>
   As he had warned McNealy, he left Sun and began seeking out the
brightest people he knew in computing to tell them about his
gestating ideas and ask each person, ``Can it work?'' One by one,
each of them responded that it would not only work but that they
wanted to participate. Within a few weeks he had assembled
Transmeta's eight-member founding team, all working each day from
the living room of his home.
</P>
<P>
   To support the original group, with the help of another founder,
Doug Laird, he raised the seed capital for Transmeta by landing a
$300,000 consulting contract with Cray Research, a supercomputer
company that has since been acquired by Silicon Graphics. With that
contract, the group could pay itself small salaries for a short
time and move out of Ditzel's living room and into a temporary
office.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent financing proved a bit harder to come by. Silicon
Valley's venture capitalists were obsessed with Internet-commerce
start-up companies and had scant attention for arcane-sounding new
computer designs. The challenge was to explain a key concept that
Transmeta referred to as ``dynamic software translation'' _ the
chameleonlike ability to mimic the instructions for other
microprocessors, which would be crucial for any new chip meaning to
crash Intel's party.
</P>
<P>
   Then late one night in the autumn of 1995, a Transmeta
programmer named Robert Cmelik _ a boyhood friend and longtime
co-worker of Ditzel _ coined ``code morphing'' for this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by this hip, edgy-sounding term, the Transmeta team
drew up an amoebalike diagram to represent the software, which was
depicted surrounding a square box that represented the chip
hardware. The labels on the amoeba _ words like ``super scalar''
and ``complex addressing modes'' _ might be music only to a nerd's
ear. But the diagram and that catchy ``code morphing'' phrase now
gave the venture capitalists something to latch onto as Ditzel made
his sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he had commitments from two venture-capital firms:
Institutional Venture Partners and Walden Group. And when he
journeyed up to Allen's Seattle estate to make his presentation,
Allen immediately understood the concept and became enthusiastic
about the prospects for Transmeta.
</P>
<P>
   It took Allen only 90 minutes to make up his mind to become a
major backer of the company, which has now raised about $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   With financing, Transmeta was able to acquire some of the
world's best computer talent _ including Linus Torvalds, the
programmer better known for leading the development of Linux, the
freely distributed computer operating system with a growing
industry following. Transmeta's chips are meant to work with Linux,
as well as Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta also began handpicking graduate students from Stanford
University's computer science department, where it was soon labeled
``the cult.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, even with IBM planning to produce Transmeta's first
chips in volume by midyear, Ditzel and Transmeta are far from
proving their concept can be a commercial success. Even Ditzel's
former professor, David Patterson, expressed concerned when told
that at 700 megahertz, the company's new chip did not have quite
the clock speed of an equivalent Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even being twice as fast isn't good enough,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But he brightened when he learned that the new chip might
consume as little as one-tenth the power of Intel's best portable
chips, which means it would run much cooler and have a much longer
battery life. ``I recently bought a portable computer and
discovered it had two fans,'' he said. ``It's really noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel points out that fans, like complex computer chips that
run hot, require lots of power. Software, by contrast, is mainly a
matter of brainpower. ``The tradeoffs between hardware and software
were drilled into my head at a very early age,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, so was secrecy. But after thrusting themselves
into the spotlight last week, Ditzel and his chips no longer have a
place to hide.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are blue days for blue chip owners, but they're great days
if your money is in small technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a bad one for the Dow Jones industrial average,
the index that has long been identified with blue chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology-saturated Nasdaq composite index had its best
week ever relative to the Dow. The Nasdaq rose 4.2 percent last
week to yet another closing high, with gains in every trading
session, while the Dow fell 4 percent as it declined each day.
</P>
<P>
   That outperformance _ with the Nasdaq doing 8.2 percentage
points better than the Dow _ far exceeded the Nasdaq's previous
record for outperformance over a week. That margin, 4.8 percentage
points, was set in the week ended Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's divergence reflects continued speculation in small
technology stocks at a time when rising interest rates have hurt
many stocks _ including the bigger, bluer-chip technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Intel and Microsoft, the Nasdaq-listed technology
issues that were added to the Dow's 30 component stocks last year,
were among the 23 Dow stocks that lost ground last week. And the
other two most-active Nasdaq stocks last week, MCI WorldCom and
Dell Computer, also lost ground. Together, those four stocks
account for 20 percent of the Nasdaq composite index, but their
decline did not stop that index from having a strong week.
</P>
<P>
   The latest speculation in small technology stocks extends beyond
Internet issues, but it is concentrated on companies that are often
small and unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new in the Nasdaq's soaring, of course; it has
doubled over the past 13 months. But the fact that smaller stocks
are leading the way is a bit of a change.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2,000 _ an index that includes the stocks that rank
from 1,001 to 3,000 in market capitalization in the United States
and is the most widely followed index of small stocks _ rose 5.2
percent last week, better than the Nasdaq, which is dominated by
large technology stocks. Compare that to 1999, when the Nasdaq
composite rose more than 80 percent for the year, while the Russell
was up less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, huge margins of outperformance by Nasdaq over the
Dow have usually _ but not always _ come at a time when the
momentum of the Nasdaq composite was likely to continue. As
calculated by Bloomberg Financial Markets and going back to the
Nasdaq's creation in 1971, of the 10 previous cases when the Nasdaq
composite outperformed the Dow by at least four percentage points
during a week, on eight occasions the Nasdaq composite outperformed
the Dow over the subsequent four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, the Nasdaq composite registered gains in
seven of those eight cases.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable exception came slightly less than a year ago.
In the week ended Jan. 29, 1999, the Nasdaq leaped 7.1 percent,
vastly outperforming the Dow, which gained 2.6 percent. Over the
next four weeks, though, the Dow slipped only a bit while the
Nasdaq fell 8.1 percent. Technology stocks, which had led the move
up, also led the move down.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the most recent big outperformance for the
Nasdaq over the Dow, prior to last week _ the week of Nov. 5, noted
above, when the Nasdaq rose 4.6 percent and the Dow slipped a bit _
served as a signal that the current Nasdaq surge was under way. It
was the third week in a row that the Nasdaq rose at least 3
percent, and it did not have a week with a gain of less than 2
percent for the rest of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A drop of 4.6 percent occurred in the first week of this year,
but the Nasdaq has more than made up for that decline by rising
more than 4 percent in each of the two subsequent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All told, since Oct. 15 _ a period of 14 weeks _ the Nasdaq
composite has risen 55 percent, while the Dow has gained 12 percent
and the Russell 2,000 is up 29 percent.

BRITAIN GRANTS EMBRYO-CLONING PATENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Britain last week became the first country to grant a patent
covering cloned early-stage human embryos. The decision could
ignite new controversy among biotechnology critics, even though
Geron Corp., the company licensed to use the patent, has no
intention of creating cloned humans.
</P>
<P>
   The British patent covers both the cloning process made famous
by the creation of Dolly, the cloned sheep, and some of the
products of that process. Those products include nonhuman mammals
and human embryos in the very early stage of development, when they
consist of stem cells that could develop into any sort of human
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Geron, based in Blacksburg, Va., hopes to use the technology to
help those suffering from degenerative diseases _ in theory,
instead of getting a liver transplant that might be rejected, a
person could be saved with new tissue grown from his or her own
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Geron and its technology partners have applied for U.S. patents
covering the technology, but that application does not cover human
embryo products, David Earp, Geron's vice president for
intellectual property, said. The U.S. Constitution's ban on slavery
bars patenting human clones, but the law is not clear on the
patentability of early-stage embryonic material.

sweepstakes and other efforts off the gridiron to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in those tactics apart from traditional television
advertising is part of a trend, particularly among the dot-coms, to
more narrowly focus sales pitches on potential customers rather
than aim broadly at all consumers. The reason? Disappointment among
many dot-coms and their venture capitalists with sales during the
holiday shopping season, despite the estimated $1 billion spent to
drive traffic to and encourage buying on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one day in the entire year when the average
consumer is interested in advertising,'' said Jonathan Bond,
co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners in New York. ``But
nothing makes Madison Avenue look as excessive as all the Super
Bowl ads.''
</P>
<P>
   So in some instances, he added, ``there's almost a better
opportunity to go against the Super Bowl than to be on it.''
</P>
<P>
   For one client, DLJ Direct, the online brokerage unit of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, Kirshenbaum Bond is promoting an
offer: commission-free trading for customers on Super Bowl Sunday.
In a television commercial running this week to publicize the
promotion, DLJ Direct asks a cheeky question: ``Why invest $2
million on one ad this Sunday when we could invest it in you?''
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the attention being paid to
``non-advertising'' is a fanciful feature in the trade publication
PR Week, focused on alternatives to expensive Super Sunday spots.
The feature, ``Super Bowl Fantasy,'' appears in the issue due out
Monday; it is a sequel to an article from 1999 for Super Bowl
XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to challenge the Super Bowl advertising mindset,''
said Adam Leyland, editor in chief at PR Week in New York,
published by the PR Publications unit of the Haymarket Group. ``It
has become a brag, and bragging doesn't always work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of companies think if they throw enough money at a
problem, that will fix it,'' he added. ``But of the 30-odd Super
Bowl advertisers, only one or two break through and get talked
about. The rest get forgotten after 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyland and other editors at PR Week asked six agencies
specializing in public relations to assume that Super Bowl
advertisers were seeking other ways to spend the money earmarked
for commercials: an estimated average of $2 million to $3 million
for each 30-second spot during the game.
</P>
<P>
   The plans the agencies proposed included wacky stunts like a
``Super Pet Bowl'' held in a tent shaped like, yes, a pet's food
bowl; giveaways of prizes like $1 million and 50 luxury
automobiles; and campaigns for dot-coms to encourage Internet
literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it makes more sense to do something else, to say
`We're not playing the Super Bowl game,' literally or
figuratively,'' said one participant in the imaginary exercise,
John Brodeur, chairman and chief executive at Brodeur Worldwide in
Boston, a unit of the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if our friends in advertising would enjoy these
ideas,'' he added, ``but a lot of them are turning to webcasts and
other types of marketing communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur and his colleagues ``decided it would be fun to get into
the car business,'' he said, suggesting that BMW of North America,
which is buying two 30-second commercials during the game, instead
give away 50 BMW 323i sedans to drivers in the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   And like Kirshenbaum Bond, Brodeur Worldwide ``would advertise
that we're `counter-advertising,''' Brodeur said, perhaps buying
spots to announce the winners on programs opposite the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the feature said he came to praise
commercials, not to bury them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I'm an advocate of public relations,'' said Mitch
Markson, global creative director at Edelman Public Relations
Worldwide in New York, ``I'm not here to slam advertising. They
work best when they work together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are things public relations can do,'' he added, ``to
make the consumer experience more involving and less passive'' than
watching a TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Markson and his colleagues offered two ideas for McDonald's
Corp.: a Super Bowl trivia contest called ``Who Wants to Be a
McMillionaire,'' spoofing guess which extraordinarily popular ABC
game show, and a charity auction of football memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, McDonald's, a perennial Super Bowl advertiser, is not
buying a commercial this time. ``I can only assume the list we had
contained an error,'' Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   What does an actual Super Bowl advertiser that was included in
both PR Week fantasy features think of the unsolicited advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're huge believers in public relations and tripled our PR
budget this year,'' said Anne Hollows, senior vice president for
global brand strategy at Monster.com in Maynard, Mass., the job
search Web site owned by TMP Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're breaking a $50 million brand campaign that will run
all year long,'' she added. ``And let's face it, there's no place
like the Super Bowl to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com advertised during Super Bowl XXXIII and will return
for Super Bowl XXXIV with more work from Mullen Advertising in
Wenham, Mass., part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group
of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   In PR Week, Monster.com is offered four ``non-advertising''
ideas by Porter Novelli Millsport Sports, a joint venture of Porter
Novelli in New York, a public relations agency owned by Omnicom,
and Millsport, a sports marketing agency in Stamford, Conn. The
ideas include an online contest to match celebrities with their
resumes and a job fair that would travel across the country in
``Monster trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there could be another idea: free career counseling for
the creative directors whose Super Bowl spots flop.

TURNING THE FAMILY CAR INTO THE FAMILY SNOWPLOW
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Snow fell on much of the Northeast last week, sending homeowners
and merchants outside to clear off sidewalks and cars. Municipal
plows took care of most town and city streets, but private
residents once again were stuck shoveling the drifts with those
bulky shovels. Anyone with a long driveway or large parking area
surely dreads that cold, back-wrenching labor.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Nugent looked around his home for a tool that might make
clearing snow easier, and realized the most powerful engine he
owned was idle during snowplowing: his car. Working with a used
lawn-tractor plow blade bought at a charity bazaar and two plow
arms that were made for him, Nugent designed a snow plow blade that
can turn a mid-size car into a plow.
</P>
<P>
   His blade is half as tall and half as wide as standard plows,
attaches to the front end of a car, and can be folded up and stored
like a bicycle. His model weighs about 40 pounds, and he says it
easily attaches and detaches to a car chassis.
</P>
<P>
   But Nugent admits previous designs for homeowner plows have been
unpopular because Americans are reluctant to view their cars as
workhorses.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. consumers learn from childhood to think of cars as status
badge, rocket ship, music room, anything but work tool,'' he wrote
in his patent. ``Owners felt little demand for a plow to mount on
the family car because they instinctively recoiled from heavy
hardware suggesting body damage.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, there is a limited time in winter when most car
owners might regret that attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most parts of the world where snow accumulates, the
homeowner's need for plowing ranges from near zero to merely a few
hours per year,'' he wrote. ``Only in winter, only on storm days,
only during or after storms of a certain accumulated snow depth and
density, and even on those rare occasions, driveway plowing is only
required if you really need to drive out soon into a plowed
street.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nugent says he found that those who really need to drive
must use car snow plows modeled on industrial plows _ heavy, with
hydraulic lifts, which can be hard for a passenger car to handle on
slippery surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, 73, of Wilton, Conn., designed a plow blade for his car
that is five millimeters thick, made of steel and can be attached
to the pre-existing tabs on the chassis, called ears, which are
normally used for tying a car down during shipping. Nugent
envisions a person attaching the blade in about three minutes and
says it can be done without damaging the car.
</P>
<P>
   The blade does not lift off the ground when the car is driving
in reverse. A person ``merely drives and drags,'' Nugent said. He
hopes to license his invention, which received patent 6,009,642.
</P>
<P>
   In-Flight Evacuation, Parachute Included
</P>
<P>
   How many people have ever wondered if they could bring their own
parachute on a commercial flight in case of emergency? Neil and
Cleveland Nance have won a patent for an in-flight evacuation
system that takes care of that concern, and adds a survival kit as
a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Nances have invented a system that would eject passengers
from a plane in peril during flight. In their design, passenger
seats rotate 180 degrees to face backward and then glide toward the
rear of the plane, where large doors open to allow the people in
their seats to be ejected. The patent does not address the issue of
cabin pressure in an airliner, which might change drastically if
large doors were opened during an emergency, depending on the
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Just before being expelled, the bottom part of the seat would
detach and drop into the plane's cargo area. The passenger would
float into the air strapped to the backrest portion of the seat,
from which a parachute would emerge as the passenger leaves the
rear of the plane. In addition to housing the parachute, the
backrest also carries a survival kit with a first aid pouch,
floatation device and safety lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passengers will slowly descend to earth,'' the Nances
wrote in their patent. ``After landing, the survival kit will be
used until rescuers arrive.'' The system was given patent
5,979,829.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the World Wide Web at www.uspto.gov or
may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the lobby of the Vivian Beaumont Theater during
the intermission for ``Marie Christine'' people have been talking
intently, wondering whether the work they are hearing is a musical
or an opera. It's almost as if before they decide how good it is
they have to figure out what it is.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is likely to come up again in May when Stephen
Sondheim's ``Sweeney Todd'' is performed in concert by the New York
Philharmonic with the title role sung by a leading operatic
bass-baritone, Bryn Terfel, and Mrs. Lovett sung by a diva of
Broadway, Patti LuPone.
</P>
<P>
   What is the difference between a musical and an opera? There is
no definitive answer. In recent weeks the question has been debated
anew in these pages. It's always intriguing when a work blurs the
boundaries between the two genres, as many operas and musicals do.
But there is a difference, an important one, that is being
forgotten by composers from each field who try to play it safe in
some mushy middle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously both genres involve the mixing of words and music. But
in the musical, words hold the upper edge. The opposite is true of
opera. If you accept that difference, then many further defining
aspects of each genre _ singing styles, orchestration, the role of
spoken dialogue, the importance of melody, the appropriate degree
of musical complexity _ all follow logically.
</P>
<P>
   Some opera experts will howl in protest at the suggestion that
words in opera are not every bit as important as words in musicals.
Yes, it would have been inconceivable to Verdi and Wagner that
audiences would not understand the languages of operas they were
hearing: when their operas were performed in, say, Paris, they were
translated into French. Yes, until the 1950s, when the conductor
Herbert von Karajan began presenting Mozart's Italian operas in
Austria in the original Italian, the works were always performed in
the native tongue, German. And yes, the use of supertitles has
drawn large new audiences to the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at times opera has also thrived with audiences who had scant
idea of what the words meant. Think of the German-born Handel's
long run in London as a composer of hugely popular Italian operas
for English-speaking audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Like many American buffs, I grew up hearing opera on the radio
and attending performances at the Met (seated in the stratosphere),
while having little idea of what the operas were about. Later, when
I found out what was going on in, say, ``Rigoletto,'' it was of
course revelatory. But did it exponentially increase my love of the
opera? Not really. And uncounted numbers of operas with lame
librettos, like ``Il Trovatore,'' are beloved repertory staples.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine hearing the stylish current revival of Cole Porter's
``Kiss Me, Kate'' performed in Italian. Even Italian-speakers in
the audience would find it odd, for every nuance of the music was
crafted to lift and spin out those wonderful words. (``I would
gladly give up coffee for Sanka/Even Sanka, Bianca, for you.'')
</P>
<P>
   Memorable melodies have been a hallmark of the musical. Still,
the great Broadway tunesmiths knew that the primary function of
melody was to service words. Many tricky tunes are memorable
because clever words are bonded to them in our minds. Think of
Porter's ``Anything Goes.'' (``In olden days a glimpse of stocking
was/Looked on as something shocking but/Now God knows, anything
goes.'') How many Puccini fans who can easily hum the gorgeous
melody of ``Un bel di, vedremo'' could recall even the next lines
of text?
</P>
<P>
   The true achievement of the great musical lyricists is sometimes
taken for granted. Consider this couplet from the song ``Once in
Love With Amy,'' introduced by Ray Bolger in the 1948 show
``Where's Charley?,'' words and music by Frank Loesser: ``Ever and
ever fascinated by 'er/Sets your heart afire to stay.'' Two lines
later the internal rhyme (``by 'er/afire'') and the line rhyme
(``to stay'') are echoed with wistful beauty: ``Ply her with
bonbons, poetry and flowers,/Moon a million hours away.''
</P>
<P>
   Loesser, a poet of Broadway, came up with a supple, breezy tune
to caress those words. You can get a clear sense of how important
words were to these masters by listening to recordings of them
singing their own songs. Loesser had no voice to speak of, but his
affectionate, gently snappy rendition of ``Once in Love With Amy''
(accompanying himself on the piano) has never been topped. And
Porter's historic recording of ``Anything Goes'' in his twangy
voice is taken at a strikingly moderate tempo, so that all the
words are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway cherished its great singers, like Ethel Merman, John
Raitt and Barbara Cook. But countless singers with merely
serviceable voices have also excelled there. Fred Astaire, with his
teeny tenor, was an urbane stylist and a master of putting words
across. In opera the voice reigns. Of course when a superb vocalist
has the ability to make words come alive, this is true greatness in
operatic singing. Still, fans have long thrilled to the work of
many singers with poor diction, like Dame Joan Sutherland, because
their voices were so extraordinary that no one cared.
</P>
<P>
   In defining the musical too much emphasis is accorded the
genre's mix of spoken text and song. Many operas do this, too,
notably ``Carmen'' and ``Fidelio.'' The inclusion of dialogue does
not turn these operas into proto-musicals. Even ``The Magic
Flute,'' which Mozart wrote for a people's theater, is thoroughly
an opera, with complex ensembles, sublime arias and, in the duet of
the two men in armor, an evocation of Baroque sacred music.
</P>
<P>
   The great Broadway musicals, no matter the degree of spoken
dialogue, have an overall musical shape that their creators
rendered carefully. A musical cannot go too long without a song
before the balance is thrown off. There are two famous scenes that
are badly miscalculated in this regard. One is the long soliloquy
by the cross-dressing dancer in ``A Chorus Line,'' a blatantly
emotional speech that always elicits nervous applause. The other,
in ``Cabaret,'' is Sally Bowles' confession to her sometime
boyfriend about having had an abortion, which makes audiences
squirm, not because of the subject matter. The problem is that both
speeches stop the musicals in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Christine,'' Michael John LaChiusa's retelling of
``Medea,'' is neither an opera nor a musical. It's a clunky hybrid.
In The New Yorker the critic John Lahr called it an ``opsical,''
which could be defined, he wrote, as ``an empty vessel that makes a
big sound.'' In a New York Times essay published prior to the
show's opening, LaChiusa warned his musical-writing colleagues to
trust the genre and not ape opera, which he considers somewhat
elitist. In ``Marie Christine'' he does not seem to have followed
his own advice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is a revealing pastiche number in Act I, when Dante
promises to take Marie Christine to Chicago. It's as close as the
score gets to a jaunty Broadway song, and it's pretty weak. The
words are lame: ``We're gonna go to Chicago./And we're gonna have
fun./We're gonna live in a tower/Stretching up to the sun.'' The
rhythmic swing is stiff; the tune is awkward. The self-trained
LaChiusa lacks a real melodic gift. You cannot hear this song
without wondering whether the reason he has been working the middle
ground is because he is no facile songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of the score, especially the leaping, fussy
vocal lines, do not pay off. Rather than sounding intricate, the
music just seems labored. The contrapuntal ensemble writing in
``Guys and Dolls,'' by Loesser, is more sophisticated than anything
LaChiusa has done. And his word-setting is faulty. Even the
remarkable Audra McDonald cannot project the lyrics with consistent
clarity.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly Sondheim, who is often credited with writing
musicals that are de facto American operas, is no opera fan and
does not aspire to opera. Naturally he is grateful when opera
companies present works like ``A Little Night Music'' and ``Sweeney
Todd.'' Why shouldn't he be interested in what opera singers and
symphony orchestras make of his scores?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweeney Todd'' is almost continuous music, but not because
Sondheim was trying to write an opera. He was paying homage to late
19th-century British melodramas, in which music was always
ruminating ominously in the orchestra pit as the characters spoke
their lines. Sondheim is an ingenious composer, but true to the
Broadway tradition he writes music that serves words. Still,
detractors regularly accuse him of hitting audiences over the head
with musical complexities. You could argue just the opposite, that
Sondheim's music keeps its secrets to itself and never detracts
from the impact of his words and the dramatic vitality of the show.
</P>
<P>
   For example when Sweeney relates his story, indirectly, to
Anthony in the beginning of Act I, the orchestra undulates quietly
as he tentatively sings the first phrases of his song: ``There was
a barber and his wife,/And she was beautiful.'' The music that
accompanies him is quietly extraordinary. An advanced college
seminar in composition could spend a lot of time trying to figure
out what the chord is on the word ``beautiful.'' Yet the spiky
dissonance is almost submerged. It simply provides a haunting
harmonic nudge to the mournful melody, and makes a telling point:
his wife's very beauty made her a victim.
</P>
<P>
   It will be fascinating to hear Jonathan Tunick's orchestration
played by the New York Philharmonic, and to hear the melody and
words sung by a great operatic bass-baritone, Terfel. But what we
will be experiencing is a song in a show, not an opera aria. Len
Cariou, who created the part, brought his grainy Broadway voice and
keen way with words to the task, and was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the problem with most musicals today is that words as
the genre's defining attribute have lost their primacy. With voices
and instruments so heavily amplified and the productions
spectacularized, words get sucked into the scenery instead. That
the words to ``Jekyll and Hyde'' or ``Miss Saigon'' are so trite
hardly matters. Few people are paying attention to them.
</P>
<P>
   Those creators who are determined to merge opera and the musical
into some new genre should consider the words of the producer in
``Merrily We Roll Along,'' my desert island Sondheim show.
Complaining that the new songs by Franklin and Charlie, the
musical's heroes, are too highbrow (``There's not a tune you can
hum''), the producer gives them some terrible advice: ``Oh sure, I
know,/It's not that kind of show./But can't you have a score/That's
sort of in between?/Look, play a little more,/I'll show you what I
mean.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problems are in the musical and in opera today, the
answer is not in combining them.

EARMARK STANLEY PARK SCHNITZEL FOR YOUR NEXT DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've heard and sympathized with the complaints from our
neighbors to the north:
</P>
<P>
   _The exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollar has
limited the number of shopping excursions residents of Vancouver,
Moose Jaw and Kamloops can afford to make to Bellingham, Seattle or
Queets.
</P>
<P>
   _Terrorist threats frequently slow traffic across the border to
an escargot crawl.
</P>
<P>
   _And if disdain for Canadian coins were not bad enough among
U.S. shopkeepers, the bearers of said cash persist in calling their
dollar a ``looney.''
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't comprehend the magnitude of the problem before
spotting a recent clipping from a major Canadian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ottawa _ Health Canada announced yesterday that it is widening
its investigation into puppy chews after 29 people across the
country suffered salmonella infection from dog treats made out of
pigs' ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during the depths of the Great Depression, or at the time
of sweeping Boeing layoffs or following the Great Seattle Fire, our
residents were never reduced to wrestling their dogs for pigs'
ears.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed Canadian authorities have attempted to mask the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health Canada is telling Canadians to avoid handling the
pig's-ear treats with their hands, to wash their hands carefully
after giving the treats to their pets and to make sure that young
children and elderly people stay away from the products,'' the
newspaper article proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Nice try, Health Canada, but you're not fooling us.
</P>
<P>
   No where in the news reports does it mention an epidemic of
salmonella among cocker spaniels, Pekingese or great Danes.
Obviously, they are being shorted by their owners when the dog
treats are passed around.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Taco Bell chihuahua should be dispatched across the
northern border to issue an overdue command: ``OK, drop the pig's
ear!''
</P>
<P>
   But better times must be coming for our Canadian friends. When
that day dawns, they can return the dog chews to the rightful
owners and feast upon a vastly superior pork product.

be illegal in British Columbia. Whatever you use, whack the meat
until you have reduced the thickness by one-half, without tearing a
hole in the chop.
</P>
<P>
   Lay the chops out in a dish and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of
lemon juice. Let sit for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the beaten egg with the remaining half tablespoon of lemon
juice. Moisten both sides of the fillets in the egg mixture, then
coat with the bread crumbs, also on both sides. When you have
accomplished this, refrigerate the coated chops for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to eat, heat the oil in a large skillet and cook the
pork quickly on both sides, until the crust is crisp and golden
brown. Serve immediately to three guests, maybe with some fried
potatoes on the side.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taco Bell Chihuahua sends a CARE package to Canada, it
may include this casserole, which might be retitled:
</P>
<P>
   English Bay Enchiladas
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup diced onion
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cumin (divided)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt (divided)
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons chili powder (divided)
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup beef broth
</P>
<P>
   1 cup tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces small shrimp
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces surami (fake crab meat)
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup green onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped green chilies
</P>
<P>
   One cup minced celery
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups grated Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups grated Monterey Jack cheese
</P>
<P>
   12 6-inch corn tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Toppings (see below)
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet heat the butter and oil. Add the onions, half
teaspoon cumin, half teaspoon salt and 3 teaspoons chili powder.
Cook 5 minutes over medium heat. Add the flour and cook another
minute, stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the chicken broth, beef
broth and tomato sauce and stir-cook until this muck thickens.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl combine the shrimp, shredded surami, green
onions, green chilies, celery, black pepper, half teaspoon cumin,
half teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon of chili powder.
</P>
<P>
   Cover a greased, flat oven dish with a thin layer of the sauce.
Break the tortillas into large pieces and create a layer in the
oven dish. Top with one third of the shrimp mixture, more tortilla
pieces, one third of the shrimp, more tortillas, the last third of
the shrimp mixture, and a final layer of the tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Over this whole mess pour the remaining sauce and top with the
grated Cheddar and jack cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in a 350-degree oven for 30 minutes, or until the dish is
bubbling. Remove from oven and DON'T DROP THAT ENCHILADA! Instead,
let this dish rest 5 minutes, then cut into 6 serving portions.
</P>
<P>
   If you want, you can pass around bowls of guacamole, sour cream,
sliced black olives and sliced jalapeno peppers and let your guests
choose their own toppings.
</P>
<P>
   But please, no pig's ears.

CANDIDATES LOOKING FOR A HOME RUN

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ When he first ran for president in 1988, Al
Gore disdained the disproportionate influence of ``the small state
of Iowa'' in winnowing the field of White House contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Gore refused to put resources into organizing for the 2,142
precinct caucuses across Iowa. After early forays, he flew in just
once, picking Independence, Iowa, to explain why he was cutting
free of the state.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years later, Gore is proclaiming his support for Monday
night's first-in-the-nation caucuses, and solidarity with Iowa's
family farmers, as he seeks to follow Bill Clinton into the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about Iowa, which ranks 30th in population among the
50 states, a stable and somewhat old-fashioned place in a
fast-changing country, that causes national candidates to campaign
here for months? What gives it so much sway over how Americans
elect their president?
</P>
<P>
   In the Iowa-based movie ``Field of Dreams,'' the mantra was ``If
we build it, they will come,'' referring to a baseball field and
legendary players of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The new mantra is ``If we hold a caucus, they will come.'' Every
four years the candidates appear before bales of hay as if in a
batting cage. And if they can't get a home run _ the victory that
will propel an unknown politician onto the covers of Time and
Newsweek _ there is the scratch single of a third-place finish that
keeps a candidate in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is the envy of other states in having an early, influential
voice in picking a president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is neither fair nor rational that a few select states
dictate the outcome of every presidential race,'' Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., said in October when introducing a bill to create
four regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's caucuses first gained major notice in 1972, when after a
rules change they became the nation's first contest. That year,
long-shot liberal George McGovern beat expectations with a strong
second-place showing against Sen. Edmund Muskie, then the top-heavy
favorite for the Democratic nomination. McGovern went on to win the
nomination and lose in a landslide to Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, across Iowa, about 200,000 out of 1.76 million
registered voters will find their way to schools, churches, civic
buildings and homes for separate Republican and Democratic
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will hear talks for candidates and then vote their
preference by secret ballot. Democrats will have to publicly
declare their preference and master arcane rules of proportional
representation in electing precinct delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses have impacted the picking of presidents in several
important ways. These include:
</P>
<P>
   Retail politicking: Jimmy Carter's road to the White House began
at the home of Harry and Elaine Baxter, of Burlington, and other
guest rooms across Iowa. Caucus politics make candidates go after
voters in small groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to succeed, where you begin is in somebody's
living room,'' said ex-Sen. Bill Bradley, who has stumped the state
in an uphill race against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates aren't willing to go through the ritual. Former
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo twice veered away from seeking the
presidency, with friends joking that he couldn't stand the thought
of trooping around farms in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Humbling the mighty: Favorites stumble in Iowa, a state that
refuses to be taken for granted. Ronald Reagan was upset by George
Bush in 1980 _ because Bush visited almost all of Iowa's 99
counties and Reagan didn't. Eight years later, as vice president,
Bush ran a distant third behind Bob Dole and Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., pooh-bahs must adapt or expire. About 400
Iowans gathered in front of baseball bleachers in Ottumwa in 1988
to hear GOP candidates. Four of the candidates stood
self-importantly on the stage. Only the physically disabled Dole
climbed around the rickety bleachers to greet voters one on one.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses have humiliated powerful senators.
Astronaut-turned-lawmaker John Glenn drew big crowds in 1984. He
ended up with just 3.5 percent of the Democrats' vote. Indian Sen.
Richard Lugar, touting his foreign policy expertise, was the choice
of just 2.5 percent of Iowa Republicans in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's GOP race, veteran Utah senator Orrin Hatch is
going nowhere. He's not happy about it. ``I'm telling you I can
win, but I can't win if you Iowa students don't come out and vote
for me,' Hatch told aspiring chiropractors at Palmer College.
</P>
<P>
   Winnowing the field: Iowa can put a sometimes brutal end to
presidential aspirations, even before the first results are phoned
in to Des Moines on caucus night.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Republican Party, as a fund-raising device, conducts a
straw poll of candidates late in the summer before the caucuses.
Three GOP candidates who fared poorly _ Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle
and Pat Buchanan _ have since dropped out of the contest. So has
Elizabeth Dole, who finished in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm managed to tie Dole by packing the 1995 straw
poll with out-of-state supporters. In the actual caucuses, he
finished a dismal fifth and quit the race two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, candidates do recover from a loss in Iowa. Reagan came
back to overwhelm Bush in the New Hampshire primary, and was on his
way to the GOP nomination and the White House. Bush staged a
similar recovery in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Special constituencies: Farmers account for only about 100,000
of Iowa's 3 million people, but farming assumes almost mythic
importance at caucus time.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has staged 25 meetings with farmers and six farm visits
in an effort to prove that he cares about agriculture. Gore
imported a farmer from New Jersey, which Bradley represented in the
Senate for 18 years, to argue that he doesn't. Gore has talked
endlessly about working as a boy on his father's Tennessee farm,
and even demonstrated expertise in the field of bull semen.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates not only court the family farmer but tirelessly
pledge to defend Social Security and Medicare. Iowa has an aging
population: 16 percent of its citizens are 65 and older. The
American Association of Retired Persons has 360,000 members in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives are a major target for courtship by
Republican candidates. Iowa is home to sizeable anti-abortion and
home schooling movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the frustrations is that New Hampshire doesn't have a
large church community,'' said Gary Bauer, head of the Family
Research Council and a longshot GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   About 90,000 people are expected at the Republican caucuses. As
many as 35,000 will be activists in the pro-life and pro-family
movements. ``The conservatives will show up,'' said state Rep. Dave
Lord, a GOP legislator.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has come
courting and, in Lord's words: ``He has convinced some people but
not the majority of the Christian community.''
</P>
<P>
   With 97.9 percent of Iowa's work force employed, it is difficult
to get the state's residents fired up about the idea that America
is going to the dogs, a common theme in many election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   In Perry, northwest of Des Moines, the Iowa Beef Processors have
attracted out-of-state Hispanic workers at $8 an hour because
Iowans don't want to do the messy, dangerous work. More than 3,000
Bosnians have also settled in Iowa, largely to work in the
meatpacking industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is working,'' said Lord, who owns a car wash in
Perry. ``My nephew is trying to hire people; he can't, unless he
hires people away from other businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeye State is, in some ways, not exactly reflective of
America. In an increasingly multiethnic America, its population is
more than 96 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   It is prosperous with unemployment at half the national average.
Des Moines is one of the major insurance industry centers of the
world. Agribusiness and manufacturing fuel an increasingly
diversified economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have had to get out of farming. Fortunately, the
rest of the economy in Iowa is so good that they easily get jobs,''
said Dave Topel, dean of the college of agriculture at Iowa State
University.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa faces problems. Its population is stagnant. Despite
high employment, median household income trails $3,000 behind the
national average. Opportunity-seeking young families leave the
state, often for the Pacific Northwest. For the first time in its
history, Iowa has more people over the age of 74 than under 5.
</P>
<P>
   One of the state's major employers _ the appliance maker Maytag
_ just announced that it may move corporate headquarters out of
Newton. In Maytag's words, the move is being considered so it can
``continue to attract the most-qualified personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more Iowans, we need younger Iowans, we need
better-paid Iowans,'' Gov. Tom Vilsack said in his recent
state-of-the-state speech.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is a far different chunk of America than the
technology-driven Northwest, or the increasingly multiethnic
California, or the fast-growing cities of the South and Sunbelt.
</P>
<P>
   But it is first. And Monday night, Iowans get first crack at
picking the first American president to be elected in the 21st
century.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news barely registered on the radar of Internet industry
analysts and executives: The Uniform Code Council, the nonprofit
organization that created the bar code system, recently announced
that it had chosen AppNet, an Internet consulting company, to build
what it called ``the largest electronic marketplace for
business-to-business transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of business-to-business Internet commerce, it has
become difficult to keep up with the rapid-fire creation of
so-called e-marketplaces _ the darlings du jour of the investment
community.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business marketplaces are Web sites on which
companies in a given industry buy and sell their goods, get news
and find related services. And such operations actually began
stealing investors' attention away from the business-to-consumer
market last year. Companies like Chemdex, E-Steel and DirectAg.com
achieved success in their respective industries, offering a
promising model that might be duplicated in other markets. There
are now more than 500 companies that are in some stage of creating
an e-marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The vast lineup of newcomers to this e-commerce arena speaks to
the riches they see awaiting any company that can dominate a given
business-to-business sector. Internet marketplaces are part of a
business-to-business e-commerce industry that is expected by 2003
to reach $1.3 billion in annual revenue _ more than 10 times the
projected size of the business-to-consumer market. But capturing
that cash will prove difficult, analysts said, and not just because
of the growing number of competitors in every category _ or the
$100 million it can cost to build the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the initial resistance has come from buyers and sellers
within each market, who have been understandably reluctant to risk
disrupting business by making major purchases on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the goal of these e-marketplaces is to be seen as a
legitimate part of the supply chain, not some weird mutant thing or
flavor of the month,'' said Varda Lief, an analyst with Forrester
Research. ``For consumers, shopping is a leisure activity. In
B-to-B, your livelihood depends on how you buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the e-marketplaces are just now showing signs that
businesses trust them to handle such transactions on a large scale.
For example, Chemdex, an Internet company that created a forum for
buyers and sellers of laboratory products in 1997, now has over 100
corporations and educational institutions purchasing goods from
2,200 suppliers on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Companies making purchases through the site include SmithKline
Beecham and Bristol-Myers Squibb, among others, pushing the site's
revenues to $8.5 million for the third quarter of 1999. Convincing
companies to move purchasing systems onto the Internet was not
easy, recalls David Perry, chief executive of Chemdex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a year ago, we had to begin every presentation with
`Here's what the Internet is, and here's why you should be
interested,''' Perry said. ``The hardest single thing to solve was
the chicken or the egg problem. When you start, you have no sellers
or buyers, and you have no value to one without the other.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, you have no revenue. Chemdex, like other
e-marketplaces, makes money by charging buyers a fee _ based on how
many people in an organization use the site to purchase goods _ and
extracting a transaction fee from sellers. Chemdex charges buying
organizations from hundreds to hundreds thousands of dollars a
year; sellers pay a transaction fee of 8 to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By initially waiving the fees, Perry said he persuaded
SmithKline Beecham, Harvard University and Genentech to use the
site. He said he also requested that they bring their suppliers on
board, and when they agreed, the site at last had something to
offer other prospective buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking difference between a business-to-consumer site
and a business-to-business site, Perry said, is the constraints
that a business places on the purchaser. ``They can only buy from
certain sellers, they have spending limits and the companies want
to have the data associated with that purchase,'' he said. ``So we
have to have technology solutions for all of those customers, and
you have to integrate them with hundreds or thousands of
suppliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, that means building into the site a feature
that monitors a buyer's spending limits, alerts them when they
exceed their limit, and sends a notice to executives for further
spending approvals.
</P>
<P>
   The various e-marketplaces are pushing to build a much longer
list of services to distinguish themselves from their competitors,
according to Forrester Research. In a recent survey of 50 such
sites, the firm found that in the next two years, most plan to
expand beyond simply brokering purchases, and offer services like
linking purchases with a company's distribution schedules,
integrating transactions with financial ledgers and settling
disputes between buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the relevance of the Uniform Code Council comes
into play. The council may play a role in expanding that lineup of
services, analysts and executives said. Through its subsidiary,
UCCNet, the council will soon begin building a community of
marketplace sites to cover each of the 23 industries represented by
the council's 240,000 member companies worldwide. The first site,
for the food and packaged goods industry, will be a relatively
modest version of an Internet marketplace, in that it will not
support transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it will allow suppliers like Procter &AMP; Gamble and
PepsiCo's Frito-Lay to automatically notify retailers like the
Kroger Co. on changes made to the suppliers' product catalogs.
Seemingly a pedestrian accomplishment, but nearly a third of all
the goods purchased by grocers are delivered at the wrong price or
in the wrong size, because word of the product changes takes too
long to get from supplier to buyer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and food industry executives said the new Uniform Code
Council system capitalized on the council's role as a nonprofit
organization devoted to industry standards. Companies will work
with UCCNet to agree on a single procedure for changing product
descriptions. They will then send any product updates to the
UCCNet, which will screen the data to make sure it conforms to
industry standards, before updating the site's product catalog and
informing buyers of the change.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers like Procter &AMP; Gamble and Frito-Lay can now offer
their goods to grocers through the Internet, analysts said, while
grocers can comparison-shop with confidence that the products and
prices they see are up to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the industry if we get this rocking and
rolling,'' said Michael Heschel, executive vice president of the
Kroger Co. Heschel said the new system would not only reduce the
cost of communicating with suppliers, but would also eliminate the
inefficiencies that come with incorrect orders.
</P>
<P>
   UCCNet plans eventually to increase the offerings of the
marketplaces to include other services, including a way for buyers
and sellers to collaborate on inventory management. But rather than
build a behemoth marketplace to take on other e-marketplaces in
each of its industries, UCCNet leaders and participants said the
council might want to license the initial service to other
e-marketplaces. Or at the very least, other online marketplaces may
ultimately adopt the Uniform Code Council's standards as a way to
make the ordering process between buyers and sellers more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get carried away with saying what UCCNet could
ultimately become _ sort of like the one megasystem that'll do it
all,'' said Jim Boyce, vice president of global e-commerce for
Procter &AMP; Gamble. ``That's silly. If we see it as simply the
enabler it intends to be, then it's a good thing.''

   WASHINGTON _ This week, the U.S. Congress is expected to
consider a private bill waiving requirements for citizenship, or
granting permanent residency to 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In 1875, the U.S. Supreme Court declared immigration and
citizenship federal issues and Congress, in 1891, established a
federal agency to deal with them. But, citizenship has become as
much a legislative as bureaucratic issue. According to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, between 1992 to 1997,
Congress granted citizenship to almost 30 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As for the process, little is written in stone. The Congress can
bypass many of the usual steps for passing a bill, and a senator
can filibuster ad nauseam to stop it. The usual steps are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The private bill for citizenship is introduced in both the
House and in the Senate;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It is then sent to committees and subcommittees in both
chambers;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The committees review the bills, make changes and send it back
to the floors for debate;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If the bills in both chambers are passed, then it goes to a
conference committee of representatives and senators to make final
changes and again must be approved by Congress;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If approved it is then sent to the president for his
signature.
</P>
<P>
   The most common waivers set aside the oath of office
requirements for children or immigrants with disabilities, or
exempt residency requirements.

   WASHINGTON _ The fate of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez
has been debated in houses across the country. Now the debate moves
into the halls of Congress as several lawmakers Monday are expected
to offer up legislation to make him an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The expected move by Congress comes as the boy's two Cuban
grandmothers continue their whirlwind visit to the United States,
appealing to the American public and top government officials to
allow the boy to return home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in New York Friday, the women _ Raquel Rodriguez
and Mariela Quintana _ flew to Washington Saturday for a tearful
meeting with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Immigration and
Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner. A sympathetic Reno told
them she could do little now that the case is in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers are expected to return to Cuba Monday, but not
before making further media appeals _ perhaps appearing on one or
more of the popular network morning programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects of a family reunion with their grandson
continue to look dim. The women are reluctant to go to Miami,
fearing for their safety, and the Miami family has refused to take
the boy elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Cuban American National Foundation _ the nation's
leading anti-Castro group _ offered a chartered jet to bring the
women to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them see for themselves ... that this is a community that
has always opened its arms to our brothers and sisters on the
island,'' said the group's leader, Jorge Mas Santos.
</P>
<P>
   Elian appeared briefly Sunday outside the home of his relatives
in Miami's Little Havana, waving to a crowd of about 200 people who
marched in honor of his mother, who drowned on the ill-fated boat
trip from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As the family drama played out, lawmakers prepared to file their
bills in Congress, a move that would shift the issue from an
immigration question to be handled by the bureaucracy to a custody
battle to be resolved in court.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he supports Meissner's decision in
early that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba, and
has indicated opposition to a citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal, also expected to be offered Monday, would
grant the boy permanent residency status without making him a
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of the bills were still being finalized last week,
but _ in the case of the citizenship bills _ are expected to
include waiving certain requirements such as understanding English
and taking the oath of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The first action will come Monday in the House of
Representatives. Florida Congressmen Bill McCollum, Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, and House Republican Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas, will introduce a bill granting Elian citizenship.
Meanwhile, Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., with support from Rep. Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla., will offer the bill granting Elian permanent
residency status.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, a citizenship bill is expected to be introduced
soon by Republican Sen. Connie Mack of Florida with support from a
bipartisan group of senators including Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi and North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, one of
the Senate's leading opponents of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   This week's actions will be largely ceremonial and behind the
scenes. Congress likely won't get down to business until next week,
after President Clinton's State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after the bills are introduced is unscripted.
Normally, bills are next referred to a committee. But with strong
support from House and Senate leaders, the bill could be taken up
quickly on the floor of either chamber.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely scenario is that it will be sent to one or more
committees for quick action. In the House, Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has promised to expedite the bill.
Senate leaders will decide early this week where the bill will be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the citizenship and permanent residency
status bills is a matter of degree. Granting citizenship would give
Elian the right to return to the United States as a full citizen
even if he is taken back to Cuba; permanent residency rights would
expire within six months if he is taken back to the communist
island.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Krauders, a spokesman for New Jersey's Menendez, said the
permanent residency bill would avoid ticklish questions of dual
citizenship and the issue of Congress granting citizenship to a
person who had not applied for it.
</P>
<P>
   But Krauders said the objective of both bills is the same: take
the issue out of the INS' hands and into the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Mack agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have the same objective, to try to get this to be a
custody hearing _ where what is in the boy's best interest is the
main concern _ as opposed to immigration law and INS'
interpretation of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart spokeswoman Yanik Fenton said the citizenship bill's
supporters are girding for a difficult battle led by New York Reps.
Charles Rangel and Jose Serrano, both Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides portray their actions as being in Elian's best
interest and the other side's actions as being political. Rangel
and Serrano have said the boy belongs with his father, and have
defended the INS decision to allow him to be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of congressional action action say it is the
Clinton administration that has acted politically by bowing to
pressure from Castro to return the boy through a bureaucratic,
rather than a judicial, process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My proposal doesn't determine the outcome, it says a fair
process ought to be followed,'' Mack said. ``I reacted when I saw
what the administration did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., has not signed on to Mack's bill, but
he also has urged a congressional review of the INS's actions and
has indicated that the final decision should be made by a family
court.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's McCollum, a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
said he is acting to support the wishes of Elian's mother _ who
died along with 10 other rafters after their boat capsized trying
to reach South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian's mother gave her life to bring her son to a free
country, and that cannot be ignored,'' he said. ``Since the proper
legal process has not been allowed to run its full course, this
bill is an added layer of protection to ensure that process is
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American and vocal critic of Castro's
Cuba, called the bill ``a hopeful step towards having Elian's day
in court, which is what the family has long desired.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The congressional action comes against a backdrop of legal and
political maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   Since being plucked from the waters off South Florida, Elian
Gonzalez has become the ultimate international political football.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has organized massive demonstrations in Cuba, mobilizing
his people
</P>
<P>
   into demanding that the boy be returned. In the latest such show
of force, nearly 150,000 people turned out at a rally in Cuba
Saturday night as Elian's grandmothers made their case to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner ruled that only the boy's father has the right to
request asylum on his behalf. Reno has repeatedly expressed support
for Meissner's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boy's Miami relatives, led by his great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, with the backing of much of Miami's vocal
Cuban-American population have vowed to block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives filed suit in state court seeking custody
over the child. A hearing on that suit is set for March 6 before
Miami-Dade County Family Court Judge Rosa Rodriquez, although Reno
quickly blocked that move by saying the family court judge had no
jurisdiction in the matter, since immigration issues are solely a
federal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Miami relatives also went into federal court
claiming INS had violated Elian's constitutional rights by refusing
to consider the family's claim for political asylum on his behalf.
The Justice Department has indicated it will oppose the suit,
perhaps filing a motion in the case as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., issued a subpoena for Elian
Gonzalez to appear before his Government Reform and Oversight
Committee on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the court and congressional actions, INS backed
away from its original Jan. 14 return date, but has maintained that
it still has the right to return him to his father.

   WASHINGTON _ This week, the U.S. Congress is expected to
consider a private bill waiving requirements for citizenship, or
granting permanent residency to 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In 1875, the U.S. Supreme Court declared immigration and
citizenship federal issues and Congress, in 1891, established a
federal agency to deal with them. But, citizenship has become as
much a legislative as bureaucratic issue. According to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, between 1992 to 1997,
Congress granted citizenship to almost 30 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As for the process, little is written in stone. The Congress can
bypass many of the usual steps for passing a bill, and a senator
can filibuster ad nauseam to stop it. The usual steps are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The private bill for citizenship is introduced in both the
House and in the Senate;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It is then sent to committees and subcommittees in both
chambers;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The committees review the bills, make changes and send it back
to the floors for debate;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If the bills in both chambers are passed, then it goes to a
conference committee of representatives and senators to make final
changes and again must be approved by Congress;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If approved it is then sent to the president for his
signature.
</P>
<P>
   The most common waivers set aside the oath of office
requirements for children or immigrants with disabilities, or
exempt residency requirements.

   WASHINGTON _ The fate of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez
has been debated in houses across the country. Now the debate moves
into the halls of Congress as several lawmakers Monday are expected
to offer up legislation to make him an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The expected move by Congress comes as the boy's two Cuban
grandmothers continue their whirlwind visit to the United States,
appealing to the American public and top government officials to
allow the boy to return home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in New York Friday, the women _ Raquel Rodriguez
and Mariela Quintana _ flew to Washington Saturday for a tearful
meeting with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Immigration and
Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner. A sympathetic Reno told
them she could do little now that the case is in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers are expected to return to Cuba Monday, but not
before making further media appeals _ perhaps appearing on one or
more of the popular network morning programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects of a family reunion with their grandson
continue to look dim. The women are reluctant to go to Miami,
fearing for their safety, and the Miami family has refused to take
the boy elsewhere.
</P>

TIME AND FORTUNE PLAY CATCH-UP ON AOL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was around cocktail hour on the Sunday night before Time
Warner and America Online announced the big deal that Norman
Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstine said he was first surprised, and then daunted by the
frustrating task of covering the news after he had just put all of
his magazines to bed. ``Fortune had closed 48 hours earlier and
Time had closed 24 hours earlier,'' he said last week. ``We were
left playing catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching up was only part of the problem. The coverage of the
deal by Time and Fortune would be the first test of how the
enormous new company would cover itself in its own pages. In the
end, Time and Fortune covered the deal _ a barely adolescent
new-media giant swallowing up their old-media parent company _ much
as in the punch line to that old joke about canoodling porcupines:
very carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a a balancing act when you cover yourself,''
Pearlstine said. ``There's no perfect way around it. There's
conflict. There's potential for conflict. What did you know as a
journalist and what did you know as a business partner? In the end,
you just sit down and write in a way that does not violate
corporate confidences.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew of news weeklies mostly hewed to the AOL-as-winner
line, and emphasized AOL's chairman, Stephen Case, over Time
Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, weighing in with 25 pages of coverage (compared with
Time's 15 pages), styled Case as a latter-day Charles Foster Kane,
a media titan for the next century. Its coverage included a solidly
skeptical essay about both companies' stock prices by the economic
correspondent Allan Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 pages of coverage, Business Week posed America Online as
the clear winner in the deal, and also criticized AOL stock as
volatile. Business Week used a mock magazine design brandishing the
letters AOL in the typeface of Time magazine's logo. U.S. News &AMP;
World Report and Newsweek, which is owned by Washington Post Co.,
both ran long profiles of Case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levin is a smart guy and a good businessman,'' Mark Whitaker,
the editor of Newsweek, said. ``But his is the story of a skilled
corporate insider. Compare that to the former Pizza Hut salesman
who by his early 40s has taken a start-up company in 10 years to be
so powerful that it can buy the biggest media and entertainment
company in the world. That's a better profile for our readers,
frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Time magazine featured Levin along with Case on its cover
and paired the two in a dual profile. Entertainment Weekly, another
publication of Time Inc., featured a caricature of Case as a macho
groom, Levin as a bride in drag and Ted Turner as a leering
bridesmaid. On its cover this week, Fortune features Bill Gates and
Case, in two separate stories for the issue that arrives on
newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Time's cover article, by Daniel Okrent _ who had been involved
in previous Time Inc. Internet forays and knew most of the players
in the deal on a first-name basis _ was an insider's account of the
deal, and was tough about the company's sorry performance in
developing an Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In the dual profile, while largely praising Levin, Time also
pointed out his ``half a dozen spectacularly costly crashes,'' like
the now-defunct TV-Cable Week. And two columns, by Michael Kinsley
and Victor Navasky, examined the pros and cons of media
concentration, respectively. Newsweek went with just one view on
this subject, a critical one, by Jonathan Alter.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Shepard, the editor in chief of Business Week, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill, said that although he felt there was some
added pressure to feature Levin on the Time cover, Time's coverage
was fair. ``Look, they used the word `dinosaur' to refer to Time
Warner, so I don't think they can be accused of going easy on
themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no lack of hand-wringing during the reporting
process. One Time staff member sent an e-mail to colleagues warning
them that the company's management would probably prefer the deal
to be referred to in print as a merger, not an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no pressure from Time Warner to refer to it as one
thing or another,'' Pearlstine said. ``But if I said, `Look, here
are the arguments for why it's a merger, not a purchase,' there is
a risk that someone thinks I am laying down an edict.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortune's coverage painted AOL as the dominant partner in the
deal. It began with a two-page editor's note defending the ability
of Time Inc. magazines to report on the new landscape, pointing out
such recent examples as Sports Illustrated's interview with John
Rocker, the Atlanta Braves player, in which the pitcher painted
himself as a xenophobe; the Braves are owned by Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Carol J. Loomis wrote an article critical of the new company's
ability to earn any money for investors, saying that the market
capitalization on AOL Time Warner would have to reach $2.4 trillion
(from her estimate for the company currently, which is $290
billion) to give an annual return of 15 percent. She compared the
task to ``pushing a boulder up an Alp.''
</P>
<P>
   John Huey, Fortune's managing editor, said: ``I think we have
the hardest time covering it. Those two companies operate at the
white-hot center of what we care about as a magazine.'' But, he
added, more concern went into the reporting for a positive story
about Time Warner that the magazine ran in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Huey said he heard mention of the deal as he was flying from his
home in Georgia to work in New York that Monday morning. ``I
overheard two people on the airplane and they had heard it on the
radio,'' he said. ``So that's how plugged in I am.''

AUTOBYTEL PLANS TO SELL CARS DIRECTLY OVER THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Autobytel.com, the Internet car-buying service,
plans to announce on Monday that it will act as a car broker by
selling cars directly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement at the annual convention of car dealers here
comes on the heels of Friday's news that Amazon.com would get into
the online car-selling business by taking a 5 percent stake in
Greenlight.com, and is part of a broader scramble by Internet
companies to get into the mundane business of selling cars and car
parts.
</P>
<P>
   These Internet services are now handling virtually the entire
process of buying a car, from supplying detailed information about
available models and options to delivering the car to the
customer's doorstep. While the cars still come from dealerships'
lots, the Internet companies say that many of their customers do
not want anything to do with dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large group of consumers out there that want a
dealerless transaction,'' said Mark W. Lorimer, chief executive of
Autobytel.com, which now refers about 45,000 customers a month to
dealers who sell them cars, and accounts for almost half of all
online car sales referrals. In the coming months, the company will
roll out its direct sales offerings nationwide, imitating smaller
direct Internet sellers like CarsDirect.com.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will also be able to go to Autobytel's Web site to
view a list of dealers' offerings, each with a set price. After
finding a car to buy, customers can finance it online and have the
new car dropped off at their homes. But the paperwork will show the
seller is a local car dealer. ``From the dealers' perspective,
we're outsourcing the closing for them at fixed costs'' ranging
from $150 to $300, said Lorimer.
</P>
<P>
   Other big dot-coms are moving toward click-and-buy car sales.
``We do know we have to evolve into the direct model,'' said
Lindsay A. Sparks, chief executive of Microsoft's CarPoint, which
currently refers car shoppers to local dealers to conclude deals.
Still, he predicted that in the near term, ``direct selling will
still be a small percentage of the overall consumer buying
experience,'' and that in the long term, there will be a wave of
consolidation in the Internet-selling arena.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com companies have been offering a range of services for
dealers at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention
here _ not just those that allow buyers to steer clear of car
dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   High Technology Solutions Inc. is expected to announce Monday
that its Virtual Dealership software, designed to help dealers sell
more bug deflectors, ski racks, head lamps and running boards, will
soon be found in Ford dealers nationwide. Kiosks, which High
Technology Solutions places in dealerships, allow customers to
configure a car with an assortment of accessories. Accessories are
a $20 billion market, said Allan J. Camaisa, chairman and chief
executive of High Technology, and dot-coms are trying to bridge a
``digital divide between the dealers,'' automakers and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobalt Group, a Seattle-based company that got its start by
building Web sites for thousands of car dealers, is promoting its
MotorPlace.com, a network that lets dealers use the Internet to
trade new and used cars and replacement parts. Last week, Cobalt
announced a partnership with the auto-dealer trade group, which
represents 19,500 of the nation's 22,400 car dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   And CarStation.com is attempting to remake the collision repair
business, which ``has been mostly a phone and fax business'' until
now, Charles L. Moore, CarStation.com's president and founder,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies have begun to focus on car dealers for
several reasons: existing inefficiencies in the car-selling system;
the belief that car buyers hate going into car dealerships, and the
size of the overall industry. ``There's a massive opportunity
that's sitting there,'' said Sparks of CarPoint. ``It's a $1.3
trillion business.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers have about $6 billion in auto parts sitting on shelves
nationwide, all waiting for just the right fender-bender.
Currently, said John W.P. Holt, co-chief executive of the Cobalt
Group, ``we can trade pork bellies but we can't trade parts.''
Holt's plan is to put parts inventories online so that a dealer in
need of a replacement muffler can quickly find one at another
dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneage.com announced that it would use the Internet to
advertise old-fashioned ``tent sales'' of used cars, filling fields
with used-car inventory from a handful of local dealers in various
markets on designated weekends, its chief executive, Mark J.
Campbell, said.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry strategists are skeptical of these efforts,
particularly of the prospects of companies trying to sell cars over
the Internet. ``I don't know where the legs are on this online
buying service,'' said Mark R. Rikess, president of the Rikess
Group in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And Lloyd G. Waterhouse, president of Reynolds &AMP; Reynolds, which
specializes in designing computer systems for auto retailing, said:
``Most of the dot-coms are really adding a veneer to an already
inefficient system. The category is already tremendously
overcrowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Car dealers are often willing to work with the Internet
companies as long as the online concerns do not bypass them to sell
cars.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Willingham, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, told dealers Saturday that the Internet is no
substitute for car dealers. ``It is a lot different than buying a
book or a VCR over the Internet,'' said Willingham, who has been a
Buick dealer in California for nearly 40 years. ``We are talking
about a titled piece of property and an average sales transaction
cost of $25,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But 75 percent of car dealers have their own Web sites, and many
have already signed up with companies like Priceline.com or
Autobytel.com that generate Internet sales leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is really something that every car dealer has to
be a part of,'' Bill Knauz, who runs Karl Knauz Motors in Lake
Bluff, Ill., said. Still, he also believes the Internet alone will
not sell any cars. ``That is really kind of a fallacy _ no matter
how much you can look at that boob tube,'' he said, ``it doesn't
allow you to put your hands on a car.''

then note in writing the arrival and departure times. The exact

FEBRUARY GOAL NOT REALISTIC IN TALKS WITH PALESTINIANS, ISRAELI
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel and the Palestinians will intensify their
peace negotiations over the next few weeks, but it is growing
increasingly unlikely that they will reach a framework agreement by
the goal of mid-February, Israel's senior negotiator said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to be realistic, it is difficult to reach this
date,'' Oded Eran, the negotiator, said in a breakfast meeting
Sunday morning with foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Eran was acknowledging publicly what Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. officials have been saying privately for weeks, and the way he
talked made it seem that he assumes the deadline will not be met.
This represents a real deflation of the hope of rapid progress that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak voiced last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Eran said he still believed that a full permanent peace
accord could be forged by September. That is the final deadline set
in the most recent interim peace accord, and the date by which
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has said he would make a
unilateral declaration of statehood if the talks were not
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials announced on Saturday that Arafat, Barak
and President Clinton would meet next weekend in Davos,
Switzerland, at the worldwide economic meeting. Senior Israeli and
U.S. officials said the meeting was not confirmed. It would be the
first three-way meeting since the leaders got together in Oslo,
Norway, in November.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not prepared to invite the parties to the
Washington area for the Camp David-style summit meeting that was
proposed in Oslo as a possibility for February, U.S. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and the Palestinians are too far apart on every
issue before them _ borders, Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
Jerusalem, refugees, security and water. There are no working
papers on any issue, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the working presumption is that both the Israelis
and the Palestinians will use the Feb. 13 deadline as a catalyst to
redouble their efforts in the next 20 days. And it is possible that
American peace envoys will travel to the region to oversee
intensified talks, a U.S. official said _ but probably only if the
Israeli-Syrian negotiations, which were suspended last week, are
not reactivated.
</P>
<P>
   Eran said he felt that the Israeli-Palestinian talks were taking
place in the shadow of the Israeli-Syrian negotiations, which
inevitably divided the peacemaking attention of Barak and the U.S.
peace team. He said he had to fight Barak's attempts to raid his
negotiating teams to assemble committees to meet with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   Eran, who was Israel's ambassador to Jordan before he was
assigned to oversee the peace negotiations, said there was
``nothing sacred'' in the original Feb. 13 deadline for the
broad-brush framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is, can we bridge the gaps?'' he said. ``Now we are
on the 23rd of January. We have three weeks to ready an agreement,
if we stick to the original plan. If I have to be realistic, it is
difficult to reach this date. But we can reach the two accords,''
the framework and the comprehensive agreements, ``in the eight
months until September.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked, Eran said he was not concerned about Palestinian
unrest if the February deadline was not met. He said that Arafat
had never been keen about Barak's idea of aiming for a framework
agreement halfway through the final status negotiations. Arafat's
eyes, he said, have always been trained on the full final accord.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official agreed that Arafat did not put too
much stock in the framework idea. But, he said, if the deadline was
broken, many Palestinians would see it as ``another Israeli promise
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Eran himself said he could not imagine that a framework accord
would have any meaning unless it contained very specific details
about the division of territory, including the fate of Jerusalem
and the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to overseeing the final peace talks, Eran is charged
with negotiating the plans for carrying out the most recent interim
agreement, signed in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, last September. With
surprising frankness, he said that the interim issues took too much
time and distracted negotiators from the more important permanent
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the Palestinian side,'' he said. ``What if there is
no final status agreement? But if there is no final status, both
sides are looking at larger problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the unresolved interim issues are two more land transfers
and the opening of a northern safe passage route between Gaza and
the West Bank, to complement the southern route opened last fall.
</P>
<P>
   One land transfer _ involving 6.1 percent of the West Bank _ is
overdue, and Eran said that the Israelis would make a decision
about what land to return in the next couple of days. He said that
the Palestinians had submitted requests for territory that were
believed to contain a request for villages like Abu Dis, which
borders on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Eran also said that Abu Dis, which some believe the Palestinians
are preparing to be the capital of their future state, would not be
included in the next Israeli transfer. Abu Dis is in an area under
Palestinian civilian control and Israeli military control, and it
presumably would be turned over to the Palestinians under a final
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises the whole conversation about Jerusalem prematurely
on the Israeli agenda, and I don't think it's useful from the
Palestinian point of view either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eran said there was a ``growing understanding'' between the two
sides on the issues involved, and he characterized the talks as
frank. He said that the rhetorical posturing that is often the
public face of the negotiations _ the assertions that progress is
not being made or that starting positions cannot be altered _ did
not go on behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Eran also said that one point of ``proximity'' was that both
sides agreed that an international agency ``or mechanism'' would
have to handle the Palestinian refugee issue, including
compensation. But there is no agreement on the more fundamental
question of whether Palestinian refugees have the right of return
to Israel.

REPORT THAT KOHL WOULD TELL DONORS' NAMES IS HOAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The scandal surrounding secret payments to Germany's
Christian Democratic Union took a bizarre turn Sunday with a hoax
in which a statement was falsely issued in the name of former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl saying he would reveal the names of the
donors who gave him more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several German and international news agencies published the
statement before hastily retracting their dispatches when Eva
Christiansen, a spokeswoman for the Christian Democrats, announced
that it was false.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was supposedly sent by the Christian Democratic
Union's Bonn office. It said that Kohl was ready to provide the
names of the secret donors to a special committee of senior
politicians who would investigate whether favors had in fact been
bought but who would not initially publicly identify those
involved.
</P>
<P>
   One of the politicians was to be Johannes Rau, the German
president, and suspicions about the document began to emerge when a
spokeswoman for Rau said the president knew nothing of such a plan.
Later, Michael Roik, a spokesman for Kohl, said the statement was a
complete invention.
</P>
<P>
   Why the statement was issued, and by whom, remained a mystery.
But the confusion it provoked reflected the atmosphere of extreme
uncertainty that has taken hold of Germany as Kohl appears to toy
with the fate of his party.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the former chancellor continues to withhold the names
of those who made secret payments to his party during his time in
office, and continues to insist that his assurances of anonymity
are more important than the law, it seems inevitable that support
for the Christian Democrats will continue to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has admitted taking over $1 million in secret payments, but
said he used the money solely for the good of the party and was
never bribed in the sense of selling a favor. He has refused to
comply with a law that says the source of any party donation of
over $10,500 must be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   His refusal has prompted the wildest speculation about the
identity of the donors. International Jewish groups, the French
government, arms dealers, real-estate magnates and others have been
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   So has the possibility that the donors do not exist at all and
that the story is a cover for kickbacks for various business deals
that might have been illegally held in overseas bank accounts
during the 16 years that Kohl was chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Among the transactions being investigated are a tank sale to
Saudi Arabia in 1991 and the sale of the East German Leuna refinery
to Elf Aquitaine of France in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Roik on Sunday described as ``pure character assassination'' a
report based on unnamed sources carried by French and German
television saying that former President Francois Mitterrand of
France had provided money for Kohl's party in connection with the
refinery sale in the interests of European political stability.
</P>
<P>
   A long-awaited audit by Ernst &AMP; Young, the accounting firm, of
Christian Democratic finances under Kohl, is due to be published on
Monday and is expected to provide more precise details on the
amount of money illegally obtained by the party.

MODERATION IN ALL THINGS, ESPECIALLY COUNTRY MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Boy, y'all are lively here tonight,'' said Alan
Jackson to the whooping crowd at Irving Plaza on Wednesday. The
Manhattan club is hardly a sawdust-floor honky-tonk, but it is a
long way from the coliseums and Las Vegas showrooms this
42-year-old country star normally fills.
</P>
<P>
   His comments to the thrilled audience seemed genuine. But it was
also part of a mystique that has allowed Jackson to keep topping
the country charts.
</P>
<P>
   Since he emerged as part of the country renaissance of 1989,
Jackson has acted as Nashville's conscience, proving that
well-written traditional songs can still have wide appeal. While
Garth Brooks turned himself into an action figure, and Shania Twain
offered up her midriff, the laconic Jackson had hits like ``Don't
Rock the Jukebox'' and ``Gone Country,'' based in country's
fundamental language of heartache and hell raising.
</P>
<P>
   Moderation, a quality he amply demonstrated at Irving Plaza, has
allowed Jackson to stay on top. His fellow torch-bearers, Dwight
Yoakam and Randy Travis, have paid commercially for being too arty
or schmaltzy. Jackson, conversely, has made an art of being the
strong, silent type. He's injected wry humor into songs like
``She's Got the Rhythm (and I've Got the Blues),'' written with
Travis, and stood up for populism with ``Little Man.'' But he uses
a light touch on those familiar tropes, right down to the reserved
melodies that let him keep his moist bass-baritone vocals mellow.
</P>
<P>
   A long acoustic set in the middle of his show allowed Jackson to
tell stories linking his hits together. His shy monologues weren't
always audible above the fans' screams, but what did come through
was a tale of success that has come from knowing one's place and
being proud of it. He told of how he had hoped that one song would
be recorded by Whitney Houston, but that its humble lyrics about
domestic life didn't suit the glamorous soul queen; the good old
girl Faith Hill had a smash hit with it instead.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of artistic propriety was reflected throughout the
night as Jackson moved through his own songs and some covers from
his new album, ``Under the Influence'' (Arista Nashville), a
tribute to his honky-tonk forebears. ``Pop a Top,'' a 1967 hit for
Jim Ed Brown, extols the lowly pleasures of canned beer. ``The
Blues Man'' by Hank Williams Jr. showed a tender side of that
notorious party guy. Jackson's own 1996 hit, ``Everything I Love,''
ruefully listed the earthiest of vices: cigarettes, Jack Daniels
and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he maintained such orthodoxies, however, Jackson slipped
in a bit of rock 'n' roll spirit. Danny Groah's guitar riff during
``Don't Rock the Jukebox'' recalled the legendary genre-crosser
Gram Parsons. And the band played both ``Summertime Blues'' and
``Mercury Blues,'' rock hits for other artists. Within these
moments Jackson stayed cool, able to step outside his norm for a
moment because he clearly knew how to get back in.

HOMELESS DEATHS FORCE ROMANS TO CONFRONT A NEW URBAN REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Termini, Rome's long-neglected central train station, now
gleams like a temple of traveler comfort and consumer delights.
After a 14-month renovation, there are polished floors, posh cafes,
computerized ticket sales and even a glossy, well-lit underground
shopping mall, patrolled by the police and private security guards
who politely but firmly expel vagrants.
</P>
<P>
   Only the huddled bodies lying on the dark surrounding sidewalks
suggest the social upheaval beneath the Italian capital's effort to
renovate and modernize itself for the year 2000. Train stations and
public parks that were once used by vagrants, immigrants, drug
addicts and alcoholics have been cleaned up and closed off.
</P>
<P>
   Eight homeless people have died on the streets of Rome since New
Year's Eve, the start of the Vatican's 2000 Jubilee, including a
60-year-old woman who died near St. Peter's Basilica. Those deaths
have caused shock and soul-searching in a usually balmy capital
where homelessness used to seem like a preoccupation of larger,
harsher cities like New York or Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that now that Termini is fixed up, the city
cannot allow the homeless to sleep there,'' said Francesca Zuccari,
a director of the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic charitable
institution. ``It's a question of public order.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke late last Tuesday night as she and a dozen volunteers
handed out sandwiches to hundreds of Kurdish immigrants lined up
outside the train station and tried to reassure a group of panicked
elderly Italian vagrants who had just been ordered to leave the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is also the question of our own decency as a
civilization: Where are these people supposed to go?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of New York _ where on any given night, 25,000
people bed down in shelters and thousands more roam the streets, a
rate three times higher than in Rome _ the homeless in the Italian
capital are almost undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and charitable institutions estimate that there
are as many as 6,000 homeless people in Rome, and that on any given
night, 1,800 sleep on the street. Even after the city hurriedly
added 200 additional cots in abandoned warehouses to cope with a
cold-weather emergency last week, there are only 1,030 shelter
beds. That is far fewer than needed, even by the most conservative
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rome's milder winters can kill people on the streets.
Autopsy reports in the eight recent deaths have not been completed,
and the victims range from a 60-year-old Swiss alcoholic whose name
is known only as Heidi, who died on Jan. 3 a few blocks from St.
Peter's, to a 51-year-old Italian man who died underneath his
cardboard boxes on the Piazza Augusto Imperatore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exact causes of death haven't been determined,'' said
Giuseppina Gabriele, the city supervisor of services to the
homeless. ``But we cannot deny that being on the street played a
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy, with its tradition of tight family ties and Catholic
charity, was long spared the homeless phenomenon that became acute
in the United States and some parts of Northern Europe in the
1980s. But recent budget cuts have left holes in Italy's relatively
generous welfare safety net, family solidarity has splintered, and
immigrants who pour in from the Balkans, North Africa and
elsewhere, lured by a mild climate and a relatively easygoing
police force, have put new strains on a once fairly homogenous
society.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the city of Rome spent relatively little of its
own money on the homeless, whose numbers have doubled in the last
two years. And city officials who work with the homeless contend
that more than half of those in their care are either from other
regions of Italy or foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of funds allocated to charities like the
Salvation Army, Sant'Egidio and Caritas, the Catholic aid agency,
for meals and shelters have been provided by the regional
government, and charities also rely on church and state funds and
private donations to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, without explanation, the region cut funds for
homeless projects from $3.5 million to $3.3 million. The city made
up the difference and earmarked an additional $3.8 million to open
special housing centers that would provide daytime care as well as
beds, and would try to find jobs and real housing for the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a solution to keep people on the street,'' Ms.
Gabriele said. ``We must aim to get them back into society.''
</P>
<P>
   But those longer-term efforts are costly and limited in scope.
This year the city will be able to accommodate 130 people in such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rome does not have the same grinding social debate over
homelessness that so divides New Yorkers. It has not been much of a
problem until recently, and a European social welfare tradition
leads most people to say there should be help for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian homeless people speak resentfully of the immigrants
they view as getting handouts from the government that should be
reserved for needy Italians, but no political party is pressing to
require the homeless to work for their food and shelter, or deny it
to illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squeegee men,'' mostly Sri Lankans, Pakistanis and Africans,
are usually tolerated by the police and taxpayers, as are beggars
and gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's mayor, Francesco Rutelli, a congenial center-left
politician with matinee-idol looks, is not as given to expressing
strong opinions on social issues as New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. Rutelli is under frequent attack, but the hot issues are
traffic and unfinished construction sites, not the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But after the eight deaths and resulting banner newspaper
headlines, the Italian government announced last week that it would
divide $16 million among nine major Italian cities to deal with
this winter's emergency. It was a signal that the existing systems
cannot cope with a new urban reality.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the phenomenon of homelessness here is new enough that
Italians do not have their own word for today's style of vagrant.
``Barbone,'' a word coined in the 1930s for a man with a long
beard, does not adapt easily to the new mix of alcoholics, drug
addicts, immigrants, mentally ill people and the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers use the English word, ``homeless'' or even the French
term for wino, ``clochard.'' Government documents use the unwieldly
term, ``people without a fixed abode.''
</P>
<P>
   Sant'Egidio publishes a yearly Rome guidebook for the homeless,
which lists where people can get free meals, find a bed, shower or
wash their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a canteen run by Caritas, which like Sant'Egidio has a
contract from the city to provide food and shelter for the
homeless, several hundred people line up daily for a free meal of
pasta, potatoes and cutlets spooned out by elderly volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   There are unemployed Italians who line up as well as pensioners.
The Italians sit at different tables from the foreigners _
middle-aged Ukrainian women, Albanians, Kurds and Africans, some of
whom appear as if shell-shocked by their downward spiral in a city
they hoped was paved with opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect Europe to be like this _ I thought I could
continue my education,'' Biniam Tesfai, 19, said, smiling wryly at
his own naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Tesfai, an Ethiopian university student who fled his war-ravaged
country seven months ago, eats at the canteen and at night sleeps
in a makeshift shelter, 40 men to a room, that is run privately by
an elderly nun outside the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to find work when you see so many Italians
unemployed,'' he said, adding that he hoped to go to another
country soon. ``I do not want to stay here and do nothing. If that
happens, sometimes you get crazy or do things you wouldn't normally
do.''

 HELMS IN ENEMY TERRITORY

 TEEN MATERNITY: LOWER BUT STILL HIGH

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As lawmakers return to the Capitol for a millennial
election-year session, the bar is being set low in terms of
anticipated accomplishments. With control of Congress at stake,
members of both parties predict the year will be notable more for
political posturing than productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't look for a lot,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La.,
who called it unrealistic to expect Congress to launch any
far-reaching legislative initiatives this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be a record-breaking year,'' agreed Rep.
Charles Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders are playing the expectations game, laying out a
modest agenda centered on a plan to eliminate a major portion of
the national debt by 2015 and adopting a compromise patients' bill
of rights. Any success beyond those goals could then be celebrated
as icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional agenda is not entirely under their
control. A nasty feud is developing over a decision by Republican
leaders in the House to bypass a Catholic candidate for chaplain,
sparking charges of religious bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on a China trade pact promise to be contentious, as could
an early debate over conferring citizenship on Elian Gonzalez, the
Cuban boy at the center of an international custody fight. And
congressional Democrats angling for campaign fodder will try to
thwart the GOP at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has his own priorities, unveiling a series of
costly health and education proposals in an effort to force
Republicans into going along or being seen as opposing popular
programs.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart believes they will ultimately
choose the former. `If you look at the issues that the president is
going to put forward, we're very confident that this will be a year
of legislative accomplishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SENATOR BITES BIG APPLE
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have quite the historic weight of Nixon's trip to
China, but it's noteworthy just the same: Jesse Helms visited New
York.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the headlines focused on Helms' unprecedented address before
the U.N. Security Council, an interesting development given the
North Carolina senator's long-standing criticism of the United
Nations. He loosened up his audience by noting that the U.N.
linguists faced a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you have a translator here who can speak Southern,
someone who can translate words like `y'all' and `I do declare,'''
he said to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, a Republican, has not been shy about using New York City
as a convenient foil over the years in his various speeches about
the moral decay of America. Whether it's gay activists, performance
artists, union leaders or liberal politicians, Helms has talked
about some of the city's denizens with something less than
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Given his U.N. trip, could a visit to the television set of
David Letterman be next?
</P>
<P>
   PLANNING FOR THE WORST
</P>
<P>
   With the creation of 17 new rapid response teams to contend with
weapons of mass destruction used on U.S. soil, the Pentagon is
extending its line of defense against domestic terrorism to a
broader section of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky and
Arkansas are among states getting the $2 million, 22-member squads
of specially trained, active-duty National Guard personnel. When
the first 10 teams were deployed last year, Georgia was the only
Southern state to serve as a base for one.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the teams will be on call to help local
emergency workers identify the chemical, biological or nuclear
agent used in any attack and how to contend with it, not treat the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said such preparation was warranted
considering ``there is no question that the threat of an attack on
American soil by terrorist, criminal, rogue or military groups is
very real.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard officials will select the communities that will host the
teams.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS HAVING KIDS
</P>
<P>
   Though teen birth rates are declining nationwide, Southern
states continue to record high levels of maternity among young
women ages 15 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Exceeding the 1997 national average of 52 births per 1,000 teens
of that age were Mississippi at 74, Alabama and Georgia at 67,
Louisiana at 66, North and South Carolina at 61 and Florida at 58.
</P>
<P>
   All, however, recorded drops from previous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the reductions stemmed from a lower proportion of
teens having sex and an increase in the use of contraception. The
rate of abortion also decreased.
</P>
<P>
   States with the lowest rates were Vermont at 27 births per 1,000
and New Hampshire at 29, according to Child Trends, the group that
compiled the report.

   Terry Edmonds is the keeper of the disk.
</P>
<P>
   With just days to go before President Clinton delivers the final
State of the Union speech of his presidency, there is a mad
scramble among aides and outsiders to insert a paragraph, or just a
sentence, or even a fleeting phrase, into the final text.
</P>
<P>
   As the president's chief speechwriter, Edmonds is the guardian
of the computer disk containing the speech's latest draft, and the
coordinator of the policy proposals, accolades, reflections and
humorous asides that will pop up on Thursday night on Clinton's
TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being lobbied, assaulted, bombarded, beseeched from all
quarters _ from within the White House, from the agencies, even
from outside,'' Edmonds said. ``Some little old lady called up from
somewhere and said, `How can I get something in the State of the
Union?' We were like, `Wow, how did you get our number?'''
</P>
<P>
   This is to be Clinton's last State of the Union speech, and
unlike the previous two, which were delivered in moments of
political crisis, it comes at a time when political eyes are
shifting toward the election _ all part of the challenge for
Edmonds, who became director of speechwriting in August 1999,
overseeing a staff of five speechwriters handling domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a touch of personal history at work here, too.
</P>
<P>
   As the only speechwriter in this White House who is
African-American _ and as far as administration officials know, the
first black person ever to fill the role _ he says he is ``aware of
the historic significance of what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to me to discover I was the first
African-American speechwriter to work in the White House,'' he
said. ``I hope I'm not the last. But once you get in there and once
you are inundated by the pace and demands of the job, historic
significances take a back seat to immediate actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, 49, moved from public relations work in 1993 to become
speechwriter for Donna Shalala, the secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he tried to mimic the cadences of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. in Shalala's speeches. It was a less than perfect
fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quickly learned that she was not Martin Luther King,''
Edmonds said. ``You really have to write to the style of the person
who you're writing for.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved to the White House in 1995 after drafting a
well-received sample speech for the president's advisers. From an
office in the Old Executive Office Building, Edmonds has relished
the chance to handle Clinton's speeches on race relations.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote Clinton's speech on the day of the Million Man March
and he wrote the stirring eulogy that Clinton delivered for former
Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas. Edmonds spent much of last year with
Harvard professor Christopher Edley ghost-writing a book on race
that Clinton intends to publish.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds does not have to do any research to describe vividly the
many people left behind in this booming economy. He grew up in a
housing project in Baltimore. He never knew his father. He spent
time in a foster home. He arrived home one day to see the family's
possessions tossed out on the curb after an eviction. ``There were
some rough times as we were growing up,'' he says simply.
</P>
<P>
   To write a president's words well, one must believe in the
leader. Edmonds does. During the heat of impeachment, he wrote a
letter to Essence magazine sticking up for his embattled boss.
Edmonds, who has a college-age daughter, recounted how the
president called him in the hospital in 1998 when his wife,
Antoinette, had suffered a massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my family, when my country were in our darkest hours,
Bill Clinton was there for us,'' he wrote. ``I, for one, think that
counts for something.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Without any slight intended toward the president, Edmonds does
acknowledge that the times of awe-inspiring oratory from public
leaders may have passed. One cause, Edmonds said, is the sheer
number of speeches presidents give. Harry S. Truman gave 88
speeches in 1949. In 1997, according to data compiled by Edmonds,
Clinton gave 545 speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that President Clinton, when he's on, can give a
great speech, but he has to speak so much on so many different
issues that don't lend themselves to high oratory,'' Edmonds said.
``Releasing the Thanksgiving Day turkey is not going to sound like
Martin Luther King.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds would not discuss any of the announcements Clinton will
make this week. But he did offer this much about the contents of
that disk. The speech will be long.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be a farewell address. ``He is an activist
president and has vowed to be one until his last day,'' Edmonds
said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds refuses to claim credit for any lines, describing the
process as a collaborative one that ultimately hinges on what
flashes through Clinton's mind at whatever podium he is standing
at.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is very prone to veer from the written
script,'' Edmonds said. ``If you're sitting there waiting for him
to give you your words back, you may be waiting a very long time.
He almost invariably improvises. And I'm not proud to admit that he
usually makes the speeches better.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, over a quarter-inch of ice glazed portions of
interior North Carolina as a low-pressure system crossed the
southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, wintry precipitation will once again threaten
sections of the interior Southeast as another low forms along a
front off the Atlantic coast. The circulation around the low will
draw moisture inland, causing rain near the southeast seaboard.
Meanwhile, breezes from the northeast directing chilly air into the
interior Carolinas will set the stage for patchy freezing rain and
light snow to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will affect much of Florida on Monday
as a cold front crossing the peninsula lifts humid air. A few of
the showers will produce tropical downpours, especially during the
afternoon when a potent jet-stream disturbance passing overhead
augments the ascent of the humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chilly air gathering moisture upon crossing the Great
Lakes will cause narrow bands of snow to form in northern Michigan
and portions of upstate New York. A growing ice pack on Lake Erie,
however, will limit the intensity of snow downwind of its shores.
</P>
<P>
   A rich supply of Pacific moisture will continue to fuel numerous
showers along the West Coast. The heaviest rain will impact central
and northern California where, locally, rainfall totals could
exceed 3 inches. As the moist air impacts the interior mountains,
it will ascend and cool, bringing locally heavy snow to the
southern Cascades. Heavy snow will also fall along many of the
west-facing slopes of the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Arctic Sunrise
</P>
<P>
   At Barrow, Alaska, the relentless darkness of the arctic night
has ended. The sun rose at 1:13 p.m. Sunday, after having been
below the horizon since November 18. It set 53 minutes later. Now
the amount of possible sunshine increases at least nine minutes
each day. By May 10, the nation's northernmost town will be in
constant sunshine until late August. This arctic sunrise is the
beginning of a slow steady process that modifies bitter air masses.
As the rest of the United States reaches a midwinter ebb, the
brightening Barrow skies are the first true sign of spring.

NEWSWEEK DROPS AN EXCERPT OF GORE BOOK  
 MS. IS READY TO GIVE EX-GLOBE COLUMNIST ANOTHER CHANCE  
 DREAMWORKS LOOKS FOR NEXT SEASON'S HIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An excerpt from a new biography of Al Gore was scheduled to run
in Newsweek in the issue dated Jan. 24, which arrived on newsstands
last week. But as the presidential primaries neared, the day before
closing the issue, Newsweek editors pulled the excerpt, which
featured new allegations of marijuana use by Gore 2 1/2 decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Inventing Al Gore: A Biography,'' by William Turque,
a Newsweek political correspondent in Washington, is to be
published by Houghton Mifflin in March.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to postpone the article was made by Richard M.
Smith, the chairman and editor in chief of the magazine, which is
owned by the Washington Post Co., and Mark Whitaker, the magazine's
editor. Whitaker said that the postponement had nothing to do with
political schedules and that he would not comment on internal
editorial decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   The excerpt, which magazine staff members said Whitaker now
plans to run closer to the book's publication date in March,
includes more contextual material about the 1988 campaign, during
which Gore admitted some marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Houghton Mifflin, Laurie Glaser, declined to
discuss the contents of the book. Newsweek has already run one
excerpt from Turque's book, in the Dec. 6 issue.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, said: ``As to the book,
the issue is old news in the sense that Al Gore raised the question
himself in 1987. He's been very clear that he has never used the
drug in question since entering public office.''
</P>

   Ms. Is Ready to Give Ex-Globe Columnist Another Chance
</P>
<P>
   If Mike Barnicle, the former Boston Globe columnist who admitted
recycling stories he heard from others without checking to make
sure that they were actually true, can get a job at a decent
newspaper like The New York Daily News, why shouldn't Patricia
Smith, his former colleague who admitted that she fabricated
characters and quotes, get a nice respectable job, too?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ms. magazine said Ms. Smith had joined the magazine
as a columnist. Her first column, called ``Fools in Love,'' will
appear in the February/March issue and concerns a visit to her
22-year-old son in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Ann Gillespie, the magazine's editor in chief, said that
she had long been an admirer of Ms. Smith's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disclosure that she had fabricated information shocked me,
and saddened me at the time,'' Ms. Gillespie said. Then she read an
essay Ms. Smith wrote in the September 1999 issue of Essence
magazine. ``That piece made me sit up and say, `Wow, this is a
voice that needs to be back out there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gillespie said Ms. Smith had served her time in the court of
public opinion. ``I don't know anybody who walks on water,'' Ms.
Gillespie said. ``We've all had something. But I don't think she
should have been banished to Coventry for the rest of her life.
She's a great writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. could use the help. The magazine _ which is now owned by
Liberty Media for Women, a group of roughly a dozen women that was
cobbled together by Gloria Steinem from her network of feminist
movers and shakers _ has seen its circulation drop from 540,000 in
1989 to about 220,000. The magazine's circulation is not audited.
</P>
<P>
   There is no advertising revenue because in 1990 the magazine
adopted a no-advertising policy, a plan taken up by Ms. Steinem for
its economic sense and because it assured editorial independence.
So the magazine depends on newsstand sales _ at $5.95 an issue _
and subscriptions for its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gillespie said that she was ``delighted'' to have Ms. Smith
on staff and that she had no qualms about the writer's editorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't even occur to me that there would be any issue,''
she said. ``And by the way, we also do fact-checking, so _ duh _ I
don't think it can be a problem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith did not respond to a request for an interview.

   DreamWorks Looks for Next Season's Hit
</P>
<P>
   It has been a rough television season for DreamWorks. First came
the cancellation of the studio's comedy ``It's Like You Know.''
Then, last week, Michael J. Fox announced his departure from the
studio's stalwart hit on ABC, ``Spin City,'' leaving the show with
a shaky future.
</P>
<P>
   Now DreamWorks heads into television's development season in
serious need of a new breakthrough hit. Fortunately, it had ramped
up its series development this season and has a number of projects
it hopes can bear some fast ratings fruit _ in one case, the studio
is counting on its biggest creative name, Steven Spielberg, to ride
to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DreamWorks would clearly be at a disadvantage if it is
forced to go into a new season without an established hit. ``It's
always tough when your flagship show is affected,'' said Garth
Ancier, the president of NBC Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said they will look closely at how the ``Spin
City'' creator, Gary David Goldberg, proposes keeping the show
running. But realistically, one ABC executive said, without Fox,
``Spin City'' may be considered as only equal to the crop of comedy
pilots the network looks at this spring. And Dan McDermott, who
heads the television division for DreamWorks, conceded: ``Everybody
kind of looked at it as Mike's show. I think you'd have to say its
future is questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, one of the most popular stars in television, decided that
his battle with Parkinson's disease had become too much of a
challenge to continue weekly series work after this season. ``Spin
City,'' which would have been a certainty to go to a fifth season
and likely more, now may end its run at four.
</P>
<P>
   That will supply DreamWorks with 100 episodes, just enough for
an effective sale in syndication. The show has already been sold to
stations around the country for a price estimated at about $2
million an episode. But a sale of 100 episodes of ``Spin City''
will bring in about $100 million less than one of 150 episodes,
often the number that long-running hits reach.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks has one other show on the air, and two ready to go,
all at NBC. The existing show, ``Freaks and Geeks,'' has been among
the season's most praised new series, but its ratings have been
modest at best. One upcoming show, ``The Others,'' is a drama with
supernatural overtones. Another is a new comedy from Goldberg,
``Battery Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The next big hope for DreamWorks is a series set for the fall on
NBC, ``Semper Fi,'' a big-budget drama about life in the Marine
Corps, to be produced by Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks also has a comedy for ABC, a co-production with the
Disney studio Touchstone. The unnamed project, a quirky, comic look
at police work, will star Dennis Leary and will be written by Peter
Tolan, who also wrote the film ``Analyze This.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always pressure in this job,'' McDermott said. ``I'd
like to have one more show headed toward syndication in the next
six to 12 months.''

SUIT FILED OVER FREE DAILY TABLOID IN PHILADELPHIA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Sweden)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A new breed of daily newspaper that has had phenomenal
success here and throughout Europe is about to face its first test
in the United States when Metro Philadelphia begins publishing on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Metro Philadelphia, a daily tabloid that is to be
distributed free throughout the public transit system, has come
under legal attack from several American newspaper companies.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit, filed Friday in Philadelphia, contends that the new
publication has made an unfair, exclusive distribution arrangement
with Philadelphia transit officials. The suit also argues that
because transit officials have authority to oversee the editorial
content of the publication, the publication violates First
Amendment rights to a free press.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the unit of
Knight Ridder that publishes The Philadelphia Inquirer and The
Philadelphia Daily News; The New York Times Co.; and the Gannett
Co., which publishes USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   A judge refused to grant an injunction against publication but
agreed to hear the case on Monday. Pending that hearing, Metro
Philadelphia agreed to temporarily not distribute copies of its
paper anywhere within the transit system that is barred to the
other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Philadelphia, published by a unit of the Swedish media
company Modern Times Group, will be the first version of Metro
published in the United States. It hopes to match the success of
more than a dozen other versions in Europe _ as well as a copycat,
Metro London, which has no business ties to Modern Times.
</P>
<P>
   Papers like Metro London are part of a new phenomenon _ the free
daily newspaper _ which is sweeping European cities and is swiftly
challenging the assumption that the Internet generation has all but
given up on reading newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in March, the Metro London tabloid is distributed
each morning inside subway stations through a contract with the
London Underground transit authority. The paper has increased its
circulation more than threefold in less than a year _ to 350,000
daily copies, up from an initial 100,000. And 50 percent of its
readers apparently never read newspapers before, according to its
publisher, Associated Newspapers Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Philadelphia has a similar arrangement with a local
transit agency, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, or Septa _ the distribution deal now being challenged in
court. Under the Philadelphia pact, the publisher will pay Septa a
minimum of $45,000 a month for access to distribute the paper
within the confines of its subway system and at its bus stops.
Septa will also receive one page of free advertising each day and
have at least nominal editorial control over the paper _ though
Metro officials said that the transportation agencies it works with
have never exercised this editorial power.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Philadelphia will have an editorial staff of 16, whose
work will mainly involve revising news stories from The Associated
Press and other news services to fit the paper's summary-style
format. The paper plans to include some original local reporting as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Initial plans call for a print run of 150,000 copies daily. The
paper will compete with The Philadelphia Inquirer and The
Philadelphia Daily News, which have struggled lately.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roberts, the managing director and publisher of Metro
Philadelphia, said he hoped his paper did not succeed at the
expense of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the easy thing to say is that I'm going to try rip the
heart of The Daily News and put them out of business. But that's
not what I'm after,'' he said, noting that he was once the city
editor at The Philadelphia Daily News.

   Free newspapers are nothing new here in Europe, or in the United
States. Most big cities have at least one widely distributed free
weekly. In Manhattan, for instance, the alternative weekly Village
Voice sits in street-corner news boxes for any passerby to pick up,
along with New York Press and numerous imitators.
</P>
<P>
   The first version of Metro was started in Stockholm in 1995 by
Transit Publications Inc., a unit of Modern Times. The company
negotiated a deal with local officials to be the exclusive
newspaper publisher for Stockholm's subway system. Modern Times
soon rolled out versions of the paper in other European cities.
After it announced plans to start a Metro in Britain about 18
months ago, Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Daily Mail and
The Evening Standard pay tabloids, set out to pre-empt the Swedish
company. Associated introduced a similar paper with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first looked at the concept and considered if it would
work in London, our first thought was a bit defensive about our own
papers,'' said Kevin Beatty, managing director of Associated
Newspapers. ``But when we did the analysis, our research showed
that over 50 percent of tube riders don't buy newspapers. And
that's what fascinated us.''
</P>
<P>
   With Associated getting to the market first, Modern Times has
since tabled its plans to produce a London version.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when newspaper readership among younger people
continues to dwindle at traditional newspapers in Europe and the
United States, the Metro genre is demonstrating that young people
may be interested in reading the news on paper _ provided it is
written for attention spans honed on MTV and surfing the Net.
According to Sifo, a media-consulting company in Stockholm, more
than half of Metro's audience there is younger than 40.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the format will do as well in the United States is an
open question, of course. The papers already in Philadelphia are
concerned. ``The issue is preferential treatment to Metro that no
other newspapers have,'' said Pamela Browner, a spokeswoman for
Philadelphia Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, a lawyer for The New York Times, said, ``It's
dangerous to have the government involved in a relationship with a
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Metro Philadelphia put out a release defending its
deal with Septa and quoting Roberts: ``As a journalist with more
than 25 years' experience, I can assure you that Metro will publish
a totally independent, objective and fair journalistic product.
Read our newspaper on Monday and judge for yourself.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Daniel L. Teafatiller, a rancher, sold all his
cattle, except his two prize bulls, which he asked his son-in-law
to look after while he is away. Patrick F. Martin, an account
manager for Microsoft, is trying not to think about the six-figure
stock bonus he will miss when he is gone. Ron De La Rosa, a lawyer
with his own practice down by the courthouse here, is scrambling to
try or settle as many cases as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a murder the judge wants me to finish before I go,''
he said the other day in his office.
</P>
<P>
   De La Rosa and the others are citizen-soldiers, members of the
Texas National Guard who serve one weekend a month and two weeks
each summer _ unless a national crisis compels them to answer the
call to duty. That was always a possibility, they knew, but for
years, a remote one.
</P>
<P>
   Now the call has come. Only there is no war, no tornado, no riot
to quell. Instead, the Army has ordered them to set aside their
civilian lives, their jobs and their families to serve as
peacekeepers in a faraway place that few of them gave much thought
to a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In February, about 700 men and women of the 49th Armored
Division _ the Lone Star Division _ are to board transport planes
and fly to Bosnia, not for a couple of weeks, but for nearly nine
months. On March 7, they will take command of the U.S. sector in
NATO's operation there, responsible for ensuring that Bosnia's
tenuous peace somehow endures.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has deployed guard and reserve units overseas
before; more than 265,000 guardsmen and reservists were called up
to support the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. But the 49th's
mission is something new. The division is sending its headquarters
company, which includes the commanders and senior officers, along
with aviation, engineering and military police units. Not since the
Korean War has a guard division been put in charge of an overseas
operation. And never before has one commanded regular Army combat
units.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th's deployment represents the culmination of a trend that
is transforming the nation's military, while roiling cities and
towns across America, with consequences that the Pentagon has only
now begun to assess.
</P>
<P>
   De La Rosa, 42, a staff sergeant in the 49th's aviation brigade,
has had his life turned upside down. He has served on active or
reserve duty since 1979, the last six years in the Texas Guard,
without ever having been mobilized. He joined because military
service is a family tradition. His father served in the 49th and
was once mobilized. His brother was killed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He is eager to serve _ ``I'll go wherever they need me,'' he
said _ but the deployment means leaving behind his elderly parents
and his small law office on San Antonio Street. He is the only
lawyer in his practice but hopes to keep it running, relying on his
office manager and wife, Olga, to hold on to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we'll be able to pay the bills,'' De La Rosa said.
``Then at least when I get back, I'll still have my business.''
</P>
<P>
   With overseas military operations proliferating and the armed
services having shrunk by a third since the Cold War, the Pentagon
has been forced to rely more heavily on the 870,000 men and women
in the Guard and Reserves to ease the strain. In the Army today,
guard and reserve soldiers actually outnumber those in the regular
force, 564,000 to 479,000.
</P>
<P>
   Once a place to go to avoid being sent to Vietnam or, more
recently, to earn some extra cash or sometimes college tuition, the
Guard and Reserves have become essential to U.S. military
operations from the Persian Gulf to Kosovo to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   As the 49th's members have learned, anyone who joins the Guard
or Reserves today is more likely than ever to be called up,
especially in critical units like medical, police and civil
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, reservists spent less than 1 million days on
active duty supporting military operations; last year they spent
nearly 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a one-time reliance or a short-term fix,''
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said in an interview. ``We
simply could not undertake a sustained operation anywhere in the
world without the Guard and Reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the first four years of the Bosnian operation, more
Army reservists have been activated than during the entire Vietnam
War, though never in a single group as large as the 49th's. At
Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, a third of the pilots and crew members
patrolling the ``no flight'' zone over northern Iraq have belonged
to the Air Guard or Air Force Reserves. Guard and reserve F-16
pilots have bombed Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no end in sight. A recent Pentagon study predicted
the demand for guard and reserve deployments ``is likely to remain
high over the next 15 to 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army has now designated guard units from Virginia and
Pennsylvania for rotations in Bosnia into 2003. Some 1,200
reservists have already served in Kosovo and more are expected to
go. The Army is also considering a plan to send reservists to
relieve the 800 soldiers serving in the international observer
force on the Sinai Peninsula, which has monitored the peace between
Egypt and Israel since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The increased reliance on the reservists, however, has come at a
cost.
</P>
<P>
   It has meant more money for training, equipment and pay. The
49th's deployment to Bosnia alone will cost an estimated $35
million. Citing the Army's dependency on them, Cohen last month
postponed a planned reduction of 25,000 guard and reserve
positions, a 4 percent cut that would have saved $900 million over
the next five years, according to Army officials.
</P>
<P>
   The greater demand has also raised questions about whether
part-time units are ready to take on missions important to the
nation's security. And it has tested the Pentagon's desire to
better integrate active-duty and reserve units, particularly in the
Army, where internecine rivalries of the past still simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest impact _ and the one that most worries
Pentagon officials _ is here at home.
</P>
<P>
   Deployments have forced the nation's so-called weekend warriors
to juggle their civilian lives and military service. While
reservists are used to being away for two weeks of drilling a year,
longer tours mean disrupting families and putting careers or
college on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Spc. Meghan A. Wood, an administrative clerk in the public
affairs office of the 49th, joined the Guard in 1998 to earn
tuition for the University of Texas. She was about to enter her
senior year last fall; her degree will now have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John R. Fitzgerald, an intelligence officer, is going to
Bosnia as a newlywed. He and his wife, Naima Mery, first planned to
marry in November, but he had to go to a three-week mission
rehearsal exercise at Fort Polk, La. So they squeezed in a ceremony
at the St. Louis Catholic Church here last week, with no time left
for a proper honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Mary E. Manley, who works for MCI-Worldcom's office
in Richardson, Texas, is going to miss a wedding altogether: her
25-year-old daughter's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She promised to videotape the wedding and send it to me,'' Ms.
Manley said as she completed a last round of training at nearby
Fort Hood. She paused wistfully, then added, ``She'd better.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Deployments have also forced employers large and small to
scramble to fill vacancies created when reservists leave, often at
a cost. By law, an employer cannot dismiss someone called to active
duty, but many reservists face subtle and not-so-subtle
retribution, as well as lost wages and missed opportunities for
promotions. Last year, the Department of Labor investigated 1,029
complaints against employers accused of violating the law; many
more are mediated locally, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing in it for the employer except losing
me,'' said Brig. Gen. Michael H. Taylor, deputy commander of the
49th _ and the vice president for human resources with the Memorial
Health System of East Texas, a small chain of hospitals based in
Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers are supportive of their workers called to active
duty. Some even supplement their pay, though they are not required
to do so. But conflicts over jobs are the leading reason reservists
quit, according to Pentagon surveys, followed by separation from
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repercussions are more severe than people think,'' said
Jerry Mendez, a major in the 49th who is an insurance manager in
San Antonio. ``People are going to have to choose'' between
military service and family. ``Guess what they're going to chose.
That's why the Guard is losing quality people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While officials insist there is not yet enough evidence to
establish a trend, there are signs that the increased use of guard
and reserve units has begun to hurt recruiting and retention. In
recent years, the Army and Air National Guards and the reserves for
the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps have all faced
difficulties signing up enough new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Plewes, chief of the Army Reserve, said that
active-duty soldiers, the biggest source of reserve recruits, have
shown a declining propensity to join the Guard or Reserves after
they retire, at least in part because of the increased deployments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Guard and Reserves fell more than 12 percent
short of their enlistment goals, leaving every reserve force except
the Army National Guard short of its authorized strength. While the
regular services have also had recruiting difficulties, the
reserves appear hardest hit by the increasing tempo of deployments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well be that the increased use of the Guard and
Reserves in the post-Cold War world has made it harder to attract
people,'' Charles L. Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense for
reserve affairs, warned the Defense Science Board last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Army, for the Pentagon, for communities across the
nation, the 49th's deployment has become a major test. A review of
the division's deployment to Bosnia over the next nine months will
show how well the Guard and Reserves are adapting to their new role
and whether the strains on families and employers put that new role
in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon prepares for its next strategic review, in 2001,
which will shape the military well into the new century, the
results are likely to affect all the services and their budgets, as
well as popular support for the nation's involvement in missions
like those in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the members of the 49th, which has its headquarters at Camp
Mabry here in Austin, the impact is felt closer to home. What has
happened in small ways as smaller guard and reserve units are sent
overseas is happening in larger ways in cities and towns across
Texas, from Dallas to San Antonio and De Kalb to Weslaco.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with nearly nine months away, the 49th's soldiers and
officers are scrambling to put their civilian lives in order,
making arrangements for their children, moving out of homes and
offices, wondering what will have changed when they get home in
October or November.
</P>
<P>
   They are a cross-section of life in Texas, which is why the
effects of their deployment will ripple across the state. Lt.
Christopher C. Ryan is a city prosecutor in Austin. Sgt. John P.
Casto is a customer service manager at Kroger's grocery store in
Houston. Staff Sgt. Bruce A. Devore works for the Central Texas
blood bank.
</P>
<P>
   Like De La Rosa, many came from families with military
backgrounds; the 49th is taking three sets of fathers and sons, a
married couple and twin brothers. Others previously served on
active duty and wanted to continue serving, although as
part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those going see the mission as an opportunity to put
into practice what they have learned in years of training. Many of
the 49th's 15,000 members volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Teafatiller, the rancher, is a master sergeant in a supply unit.
He was drafted into the Army in 1963 and served in Korea. Now, at
60, he is eager to go overseas again, even though it meant selling
the 50 head of cattle he kept at his ranch in De Kalb, in northeast
Texas. Having held on to his two Angus bulls, he says he can ``go
back to messing with cattle again'' when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe anyone who lives in this country owes it
something,'' he said. ``And every person doesn't get a chance to
pay it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The first word they were going to Bosnia came in October 1998.
The Army wanted to give the 49th enough time to prepare, as a unit
and individually, even though it is regarded as one of the most
combat-ready guard units in the country.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the president can only activate reservists for a maximum
of 270 days, but for most members of the division, their
mobilization orders do not actually take effect until Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the last year, the 49th's soldiers have spent 108
days drilling for the operation. For officers, the training,
including supervising a mock election at Camp Mabry this month to
prepare for Bosnia's municipal balloting in April, has consumed as
many as 150 days, far more than the 39 days a year they signed up
for.
</P>
<P>
   The training was necessary to prepare for a mission as complex
as this one, the division's commanders said, but the schedule has
bent the time-limits set by Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law says you can only serve for 270 days, but we couldn't
perform this mission if we didn't break that mold,'' said Col.
Garry D. Patterson, the division's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Until last fall, the 49th was scheduled to send more than 1,200
soldiers, but as NATO reduced the size of the peacekeeping force in
Bosnia to 20,000 troops, including 3,900 Americans, from 30,000,
the division has been able to reduce its contingent to about 700,
most of whom will work at the U.S. headquarters in Bosnia near
Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the reductions, the division commander, Brig. Gen.
Robert L. Halverson, has had some flexibility in selecting those
who will go. As the deployment neared, he was flooded with appeals
from members who had conflicts with jobs or families. Ultimately,
he let 35 people transfer to other parts of the 49th in order to
stay behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not out to ruin somebody's marriage, school, job,'' said
Halverson, who retired as deputy insurance commissioner for the
state of Texas when the deployment orders came.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I told a soldier, `I don't care about your marriage. I
don't care about your civilian job. You're going with me,' he might
go with me and come back,'' he said. ``But he wouldn't stay.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CAN ALSO END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Brinkman, the president of Brinkman Technologies Inc., a
software company in Carrollton, a suburb of Dallas, wrote to
Halverson last month pleading that one of his vice presidents,
Craig D. Yarbrough, be excused.
</P>
<P>
   Yarbrough, a lieutenant, oversees computer and online banking
projects for the company, which has only 23 employees. He is going
to Bosnia to be the 49th's contracts officer just as the software
company markets new products and spins off a publicly traded
company. ``This has come at the worst possible time in my civilian
career,'' Yarbrough said
</P>
<P>
   Halverson considered, but rejected Brinkman's appeal. ``Craig is
invaluable,'' Brinkman said. ``The general wrote that those same
qualities that Craig has were the reasons why the Army needed him
for this mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more difficult, for some, has been the disruption to their
personal lives, especially their families.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Deanne E. Lins, 39, is going to be an aviation supervisor
in the 49th's headquarters. Her husband, J. Anthony, is also a
major in the Guard and works full-time for the 49th's aviation
brigade. Parts of his unit were also called up for Bosnia, but
knowing his wife was already going, his commanders let him stay
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lins, a Blackhawk helicopter pilot, worked as a systems
engineer for Texas Instruments until her son, Matthew, was born
five years ago. Being in the Guard left her more time to be with
him and her daughter, Megan, 13. Matthew has not yet absorbed the
significance of her impending departure. On the other hand, it has
drawn Megan closer to her.
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple weeks before she leaves, she worries that she will
miss a critical time in her daughter's development. She worries
about how her son will adjust. She worries that her absence will
upset the family's routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay all the bills,'' Ms. Lins said, sitting in the living
room of their home on the northern edge of Austin. ``He doesn't
even have to look at the checkbook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' her husband interjected. ``I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lins, who joined the National Guard in 1981, strongly
supports the idea of serving, but she believes the increased use of
the Guard and Reserves will have an impact on soldiers and families
like hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make people think a lot more carefully,'' she
said, ``about why they join.''

 &HT;    Coke belt-tightening foreseen
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Wall Street analyst predicted Sunday that Coca-Cola
would announce this week $700 million in charges against earnings
to cover the cost of layoffs and underperforming investments in
Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello said about $150
million of that amount would be charged in this year's first
quarter for severance benefit costs associated with at least 2,000
job cuts around the globe. He believes about 600 of those cuts will
be in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The company had no comment. It is not planning to talk about
possible job cuts and fourth quarter earnings until Wednesday. But
Pecoriello and some other analysts spent the weekend crunching
numbers in anticipation of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello said the other $550 million in one-time charges
against earnings would come from reducing the value of
underperforming bottling assets in Russia and India, as well as
from smaller balance sheet items. Those charges will go against
last year's fourth-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this happens at Coke, it's because every company
occasionally needs a belt-tightening,'' said John Sicher, editor
and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``We saw it with IBM a few years
ago. Although difficult, trimming down is often the right
prescription for future health.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the one-time charges, representing about $300
million to $400 million, will be for the company's Russian
operations, where a devalued ruble and troubled economy have hurt
sales dramatically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're clearly going to re-evaluate their investment in their
Russian bottling business,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The company will write down the value
of their investment because the future growth prospects are lower
than they originally thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway said case sales in Russia have dropped about 50 percent
compared with what they were 18 months ago. He estimated that the
company would reduce the value of its Russian assets by between
$300 million and $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes the severance costs from job cuts will
``easily'' amount to another $100 million to $200 million in
charges. He expects consolidation of sales and marketing offices in
parts of Europe and elsewhere, with some people in Atlanta being
sent abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe Coke's U.S. operation in Atlanta will
experience jobs cuts as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in seeing where they cut people and why, and
its implications for future growth,'' Conway said. ``They need
people on the street to sell syrup. They need people in the field
to assess the demographic and market opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts and writedowns indicate ``Coke is retrofitting the
business for the gradually improving global growth prospects,
instead of a period of powerful volume growth,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other analysts believe the company needs to communicate
clearly about its long-term growth prospects. In fact, several
analysts said they expect top company officials to fly to New York
late this week to talk with them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key decisions the company will announce this week
have been in the works for nearly a year, Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Chairman M. Douglas Ivester initiated a ``complete
review of the entire global business system. ... Ivester started
this process about nine months ago. It just so happens (Doug) Daft
will carry it through.'' Daft, the company's current president,
will replace Ivester as chairman and chief executive officer in
April.
</P>
<P>
   That transition makes this a particularly good time for the
company to take restructuring charges. By announcing them now, Daft
could put the bad news behind him before he assumes the top spot in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is cleanup time,'' said Manny Goldman, global beverage
analyst with Merrill Lynch.

SURVEY SHOWS HIGH STRESS LEVELS IN COLLEGE FRESHMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's class of first-year college students, having
survived the most competitive higher-education admissions process
ever and being saddled with increased family and financial
responsibilities, entered school more stressed than any in a
generation, a national survey by researchers at the University of
California at Los Angeles has found.
</P>
<P>
   A record 30.2 percent of the freshmen polled in their first days
on campuses across the United States said they felt frequently
overwhelmed by what they had to do.
</P>
<P>
   There was a significant gender gap _ 38.8 percent of women and
20 percent of men reported high stress levels _ perhaps because
female students report spending more time studying, doing volunteer
work and participating in school clubs, while their male
counterparts log more hours exercising, watching television,
partying and playing video games.
</P>
<P>
   Stress levels have been rising since 1985, when 16 percent of
freshmen said they were frequently overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could question: Do they really have more going on than
students did 20 years ago, or do they just think they do?'' noted
Linda Sax, an assistant professor of education at UCLA who directs
the annual survey. ``In some ways, it doesn't matter, because they
feel the stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in four students surveyed said they expect to work
full-time while in college _ another record.
</P>
<P>
   A separate study by the Department of Education found that half
of the nation's college students work part time to defray their
educational expenses, clocking an average of 25 hours a week, and
another 30 percent work full time while taking some classes.
</P>
<P>
   Kendra Fox-Davis, president of the U.S. Students Association, a
Washington advocacy group, attributed the increased stress, in
part, to the cost of college and the need to balance conflicting
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are no longer able to go to college and devote
themselves to this pursuit of learning and just spend four years
being introspective,'' said Ms. Fox-Davis, a 1998 graduate of UCLA.
``Instead of just `How do I memorize this information for the
exam,' it's `How do I work enough hours, or apply for enough
scholarships or get enough grants so I can afford a full load of
classes?'''
</P>
<P>
   Conducted annually since 1966, this year's UCLA poll included
364,546 students at 683 of the country's two- and four-year
colleges and universities. Interviewed during orientation or the
first week of classes, the students were asked about the past year,
their last in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The high stress levels mirror trends found in other surveys
indicating that more college students have sought help at campus
counseling centers in recent years, and that an increasing number
arrive on campus with more severe psychological problems. In
response, Harvard University recently moved to hire more
therapists, extend counseling hours and improve mental health
training for faculty and resident advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are much more aware now of the demands that are going
to be placed on them,'' said Robert Gallagher, vice chancellor for
student affairs at the University of Pittsburgh, who conducts a
national survey of campus counseling center directors. ``They're
more aware that to get a good job, to do well in their lives,
they're going to have to perform better here. They realize the
level of competition is going up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The UCLA survey also found troubling trends related to high
school.
</P>
<P>
   A record 39.9 percent of the new college students reported
frequently having felt ``bored in class,'' and 62.6 percent, an
all-time high, said they had shown up late frequently or
occasionally. The percentage that had taken remedial courses was
also at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that alcohol and tobacco are losing
popularity among college students, with the lowest level of
freshmen, 50.7 percent, saying they drank beer frequently or
occasionally in the past year. That is down from 75.2 percent in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteerism is on the rise, with a record 75.3 percent of
students reporting having done community service during their
senior year in high school, but the percentage of freshmen feeling
it is important to ``influence social values'' fell to 35.8
percent, its lowest point since 1986.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Daniel L. Teafatiller, a rancher, sold all his
cattle, except his two prize bulls, which he asked his son-in-law
to look after while he is away. Patrick F. Martin, an account
manager for Microsoft, is trying not to think about the six-figure
stock bonus he will miss when he is gone. Ron De La Rosa, a lawyer
with his own practice down by the courthouse here, is scrambling to
try or settle as many cases as possible.
</P>
<P>
   De La Rosa and the others are citizen-soldiers, members of the
Texas National Guard who serve one weekend a month and two weeks
each summer _ unless a national crisis compels them to answer the
call to duty. That was always a possibility, they knew, but for
years, a remote one.
</P>
<P>
   Now the call has come. Only there is no war, no tornado, no riot
to quell. Instead, the Army has ordered them to set aside their
civilian lives, their jobs and their families to serve as
peacekeepers in a faraway place that few of them gave much thought
to a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In February, about 700 men and women of the 49th Armored
Division _ the Lone Star Division _ are to board transport planes
and fly to Bosnia, not for a couple of weeks, but for nearly nine
months. On March 7, they will take command of the U.S. sector in
NATO's operation there, responsible for ensuring that Bosnia's
tenuous peace somehow endures.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has deployed guard and reserve units overseas
before; more than 265,000 guardsmen and reservists were called up
to support the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. But the 49th's
mission is something new. Not since the Korean War has a guard
division been put in charge of an overseas operation. And never
before has one commanded regular Army combat units.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th's deployment represents the culmination of a trend that
is transforming the nation's military, while roiling cities and
towns across America, with consequences that the Pentagon has only
now begun to assess.
</P>
<P>
   For De La Rosa, 42, a staff sergeant in the 49th's aviation
brigade, it has turned his life upside down.
</P>
<P>
   He is eager to serve _ ``I'll go wherever they need me,'' he
said _ but the deployment means leaving behind his elderly parents
and his small law office on San Antonio Street. He is the only
lawyer in his practice but hopes to keep it running, relying on his
office manager and wife, Olga, to hold on to clients.
</P>
<P>
   With overseas military operations proliferating and the armed
services having shrunk by a third since the Cold War, the Pentagon
has been forced to rely more heavily on the 870,000 men and women
in the Guard and Reserves to ease the strain. In the Army today,
guard and reserve soldiers actually outnumber those in the regular
force, 564,000 to 479,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply could not undertake a sustained operation anywhere
in the world without the Guard and Reserves,'' Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the first four years of the Bosnian operation, more
Army reservists have been activated than during the entire Vietnam
War, though never in a single group as large as the 49th's. At
Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, a third of the pilots and crew members
patrolling the ``no flight'' zone over northern Iraq have belonged
to the Air Guard or Air Force Reserves. Guard and reserve F-16
pilots have bombed Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no end in sight. A recent Pentagon study predicted
the demand for guard and reserve deployments ``is likely to remain
high over the next 15 to 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army has now designated guard units from Virginia and
Pennsylvania for rotations in Bosnia into 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The increased reliance on the reservists, however, has come at a
cost.
</P>
<P>
   It has meant more money for training, equipment and pay. Citing
the Army's dependency on them, Cohen last month postponed a planned
reduction of 25,000 guard and reserve positions, a 4 percent cut
that would have saved $900 million over the next five years,
according to Army officials.
</P>
<P>
   The greater demand has also raised questions about whether
part-time units are ready to take on missions important to the
nation's security.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest impact _ and the one that most worries
Pentagon officials _ is here at home.
</P>
<P>
   Deployments have forced the nation's so-called weekend warriors
to juggle their civilian lives and military service. Long tours
mean disrupting families and putting careers or college on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Spc. Meghan A. Wood, an administrative clerk in the public
affairs office of the 49th, joined the Guard in 1998 to earn
tuition for the University of Texas. She was about to enter her
senior year last fall; her degree will now have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John R. Fitzgerald, an intelligence officer, is going to
Bosnia as a newlywed. He and his wife, Naima Mery, first planned to
marry in November, but he had to go to a three-week mission
rehearsal exercise at Fort Polk, La. So they squeezed in a ceremony
at the St. Louis Catholic Church here last week.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Mary E. Manley, who works for MCI-Worldcom's office
in Richardson, Texas, is going to miss a wedding altogether: her
25-year-old daughter's.
</P>
<P>
   Deployments have forced employers to scramble to fill vacancies
created when reservists leave, often at a cost. By law, an employer
cannot dismiss someone called to active duty, but many reservists
face subtle and not-so-subtle retribution, as well as lost wages
and missed opportunities for promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts over jobs are the leading reason reservists quit,
according to Pentagon surveys, followed by separation from their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repercussions are more severe than people think,'' said
Jerry Mendez, a major in the 49th who is an insurance manager in
San Antonio. ``People are going to have to choose'' between
military service and family. ``Guess what they're going to chose.
That's why the Guard is losing quality people.''

U.S. TO BE ON THE DEFENSIVE IN TALKS ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED
PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly a year after the United States blocked a proposed global
treaty to regulate trade in genetically modified products,
delegates from more than 130 nations will resume negotiations
Monday in Montreal in search of a breakthrough. After months of
international protest and concern about bioengineered food,
Washington will be even more on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations in Cartagena, Colombia, collapsed last February
when the United States and five other big grain-exporting nations
rejected a proposal supported by the other countries that would
have required exporters of genetically modified corn, soybeans and
other crops to obtain permission in advance from the importing
country.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, public concern about possible health and ecological
risks of foods made with biotechnology has intensified in Europe
and spread to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration recently
held three public hearings on the subject. Gerber and Heinz have
said they would avoid genetically engineered ingredients in baby
food, and Monsanto, the leader in biotech seeds, has been accused
in a lawsuit of selling these seeds without adequately testing
them, a charge the company denies.
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying debate is expected to put pressure on
Washington to make a deal in the new talks. ``Hopefully there's
been enough ferment in the U.S. that the U.S. is prepared to say,
`We need to get something in place,''' said Kristin Dawkins of the
Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in Minneapolis, a
nonprofit organization that favors such a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, divisions remain deep, and it is unclear whether an
agreement will be reached by Friday, the self-imposed deadline.
Talks on biotechnology at the World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle in December went nowhere amid wide disagreements and huge
street protests. Demonstrations are planned in Montreal, where
authorities say they do not expect the protests to cause the same
havoc as in Seattle. Hundreds of people did hold a protest on
Saturday, sponsored by Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Developing nations and those in Europe say the treaty, known as
the Biosafety Protocol, is needed to allow countries to restrict
the import of plants, seeds, animals and foods made with genetic
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, while not opposing a treaty in principle,
says the proposals under discussion would entangle agricultural
trade in red tape and endanger billions of dollars in American farm
exports. The United States leads the world in biotechnology, and
last year half of the American soybean crop and one-third of the
corn had genes introduced to resist herbicides or insects.
</P>
<P>
   American industry and government officials accuse Europe of
wanting a treaty to help it erect trade barriers and to justify the
restrictive stance it is already taking on genetically modified
foods.
</P>
<P>
   David Sandalow, assistant secretary of state for oceans,
environment and science and the chief U.S. negotiator, said,
``We'll be coming to Montreal to negotiate and hoping to make a
deal.'' He said that given the furor over genetically modified
foods in Europe, ``I'm worried that European leaders won't have the
flexibility they need to take reasoned, centrist positions on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Christoph Bail, the lead negotiator for the European Union, said
Europe does not need a treaty to restrict imports of biotech crops
because it already has its own legislation. Rather, it favors a
strong treaty to help developing nations. He said that Europe would
be flexible and that he was ``mildly optimistic'' that an agreement
could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   With Europe and some individual countries now regulating biotech
foods on their own, industry executives say they could actually
benefit from a treaty _ providing it is not too onerous _ that
would unify regulations around the world and assuage public
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be willing to put up with quite a bit of nonsense in
return for predictability,'' said L. Val Giddings, vice president
for food and agriculture at the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, an American trade association.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that proposed regulations look unworkable and are
not spelled out in enough detail. ``We're being told to jump off
the Empire State Building and make your parachute on the way
down,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The biosafety talks are an outgrowth of the 1992 Convention on
Biological Diversity. Since the Senate never ratified that
convention, the United States will not be able to vote in Montreal
and must rely on its allies _ Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile
and Uruguay _ to speak for it in the formal meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for the biosafety treaty was that genetically
modified plants, animals or micro-organisms could displace or
endanger native crops or microbes. But, much to the dismay of
biotech industry and Washington, the talks have moved well beyond
species preservation to broader trade and political controversies
surrounding still unproven health risks of bioengineered food.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the proposed Biosafety Protocol _ and the biggest
sticking point in the negotiations _ is a requirement that
exporters of ``living modified organisms'' notify the importing
nation in advance, giving that nation a chance to reject the
shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Washington contends that such a requirement is appropriate for
bioengineered seeds, bacteria or animals that are released into the
environment, but not for commodities like wheat and corn that are
eaten or processed, since they are not released into the
environment. Since genetically modified and unmodified grains are
now often intermixed in shipments, such a requirement would cost
billions of dollars, requiring crops to be tracked from the field
to the docks, it says.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe and the developing countries say that concerns about
high costs are exaggerated and that agricultural commodities should
be included because they contain seeds that can be planted or can
escape into the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point is that Washington, worried that the
biosafety rules will be a pretense for trade barriers, wants to
make sure the treaty does not take precedence over World Trade
Organization rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the developing countries and Europe say Washington's
proposed wording would subordinate the Biosafety Protocol to the
World Trade Organization, which they do not want.
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in this argument is that under World Trade
Organization rules, a nation must base a decision to bar imports of
a product on scientific evidence. But Europe and the developing
countries want the biosafety treaty to allow such decisions to be
made on the basis of reasonable concerns, even in the absence of
hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Some compromises have been put forward, but all sides agree they
have not gone far enough to bridge the gaps. Washington has offered
to disseminate information on the Internet as soon as genetically
modified crops are approved by federal regulators, giving other
countries time to decide whether they will allow imports.
</P>
<P>
   American and European officials do agree that the treaty should
not cover the labeling on store shelves of biotech foods. That is a
matter for domestic legislation, they say. What is at issue in
Montreal is the labeling on shipments of genetically modified crops
and seeds.

 NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY SYSTEM PREPARES A STOP IN 21st CENTURY  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

(bl) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a joke that got big laughs around New York
City Transit as the end of last year approached: The subways were
fully Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand why it was so funny requires a peek inside a
tiny mustard-yellow room deep within Grand Central Terminal, where
a handful of workers keep track of Manhattan's busiest subways. The
technology there _ Ticonderoga No. 2 pencils, sheets of paper
schedules, pairs of human eyes _ is not exactly vulnerable to
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most technologically advanced thing in here,''
said Barry Greenblatt, a subway superintendent, ``is the fax over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with the exception of radio, crude lighted maps and the
video cameras that were installed only within the last three years,
the system for recording the movement of each train and its
passengers on more than 650 miles of tracks has remained almost
unchanged since city subways first started rolling in 1904. Workers
basically watch for trains coming into stations, then note in
writing the arrival and departure times. The exact locations of the
trains are usually not known at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next three years, at a cost of $128 million, a
revolution will begin that will essentially drag the system out of
the 19th century directly into the 21st. Like electronic fare
collection installed over the last six years, new tracking
technology _ similar to that used by air traffic controllers _ will
take the New York subway to a level that its smaller cousins in
Washington, London, San Francisco and Montreal have been at for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then over the next 20 to 25 years, at a cost that will likely
reach into the billions, officials say, a system now in use only in
Paris will be installed, in which trains will be dispatched,
tracked, driven and stopped almost completely by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that has been talked about here for at least
20 years,'' said Lawrence Reuter, the president of New York City
Transit, adding that it was one of several major modernization
projects postponed by the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970s. ``Now
we are finally starting to see the light at the end of the
tunnel,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new tracking system, to be installed first on all IRT lines
except the No. 7, is being designed by Union Switch &AMP; Signal of
Pittsburgh, the same company that built many of the lighted maps
and bulky switching boards still in use in the 60 subway control
rooms, known as towers.
</P>
<P>
   The new system will rely on tiny transponders, placed at close
intervals inside the tunnels, that will send signals to passing
trains and receive signals identifying the trains in return. That
information, which will be conveyed on fiber-optic cables already
strung through the tunnels, can then be used to record the train's
speed and its exact location second by second.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the patched-together system now in use, the
innovations seem almost like science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday afternoon, for example, in the cramped control
tower that sits almost in the path of the No. 6 train inside Grand
Central, Greenblatt and six subway controllers were keeping track
of trains the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   At a gray metal desk with a fluorescent lamp and a small
American flag hanging overhead, Ometa Byrd was staring intently at
a typed-out train schedule, known as a gap sheet, that informed her
when Lexington Avenue 4, 5 and 6 trains were supposed to pull into
and leave Grand Central.
</P>
<P>
   For most of her career, as a kind of train spotter, Ms. Byrd was
required to note the arrival of the train by looking at it through
a window near the tracks, much like a waiting passenger would do,
then noting its identification number and the arrival and departure
times. For the last three years, though, cameras on the platforms
have allowed her to see the trains on miniature television monitors
in the tower.
</P>
<P>
   In front of her, too, was a huge black map with lights
indicating subway stations from Bowling Green to 125th Street. The
lights go on when a metal shoe on the bottom of a subway train
momentarily bridges a gap in the subway's electrified third rail,
completing a circuit. But the gaps are sometimes more than 500 feet
apart, meaning that the exact location of the train between gaps is
not known.
</P>
<P>
   It is exactly the same kind of circuitry system described in a
pamphlet published by the Interborough Rapid Transit Co. when the
subway opened on Oct. 27, 1904. The pamphlet included a description
of the construction of the first tunnels, which could apply just as
well today to the forthcoming installation of up-to-date
electronics: ``The engineering difficulties were well-nigh
appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   The essential problem with the system now, Greenblatt, the
superintendent, explained, is that ``we can tell if a train is
moving, but we can't say exactly where it is or how fast it is
moving unless we talk to the train operator.''
</P>
<P>
   And the radios that link train operators with controllers are
almost as unreliable as many of the public address speakers in
subway terminals, which sometimes emit only static when a train is
near.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, said Greenblatt, a man who comes across with the
techie enthusiasm of a computer programmer, ``The system is kind of
like watching the minute hand on a clock. It doesn't give you a lot
of details.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Grand Central control tower, which monitors more than 80
trains an hour during the morning rush, there is not a computer in
sight. The only computer ever installed there, which kept track of
employees' hours, is now locked away in a metal case to protect it
from the inky steel dust that is produced by train wheels on the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That computer really never worked anyway,'' said Ms. Byrd, who
worked as a train conductor and operator before she began tracking
trains 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, she said, looking up at the wide black map,
which shows subway trains as clusters of red lights, the tower
sometimes loses power, and ``this whole thing goes dark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen very often,'' she added, smiling, ``but more
than we would like.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So she relies mostly on her eyes, the radio and the paper
schedule in front of her, which identifies trains by the terminals
where they started their trips and the times that they left. (This
is the way the 1974 subway hijacking movie ``The Taking of Pelham
One Two Three'' got its name: the No. 6 train that was commandeered
left the Pelham Bay Park terminal at 1:23 in the afternoon.)
</P>
<P>
   When a train must be rerouted _ a situation that occurs rather
often, like last Wednesday when a passenger fell ill on the
northbound No. 6 at 86th Street _ a worker near the big lighted map
pulls out several silver knobs, much like the knobs on an old
cigarette machine, to throw the switches on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Ms. Byrd's eight-hour shift, she hands in her
train report, and it is carried, like hundreds of others around the
city, to a file room in New York City Transit's headquarters at Jay
Street in Brooklyn, where information about trains' timeliness,
mechanical problems and other incidents are then, finally, keyed
into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The paper schedules themselves are bunched together with rubber
bands and placed in boxes, where they are kept for a couple of
weeks and then shipped to a warehouse in East New York. They remain
stored there for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   E. Virgil Conway, the chairman of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, the parent agency of New York City
Transit, waxed almost nostalgic last week about the scrappy system
whose era will soon end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's served us well over all these years,'' said Conway, who
at 70 recalls the days of wicker seats on subway trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we could certainly run a much better system,'' he added,
``if we knew where every train was at any time.''

TIME WARNER TO BUY CONTROL OF EMI'S MUSIC OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time Warner Inc. plans to acquire control of the music business
of EMI Group and merge it with Warner Music, creating what could
become the world's largest record company, officials close to the
negotiations said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to be announced Monday in London,
would shrink the oligopoly of music companies that dominate the
world business from five to four. And coming two weeks after Time
Warner agreed to be acquired by America Online, the music merger
would create a force to be reckoned with in the fledgling business
of distributing music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly underscores the premise of the AOL-Time Warner
merger and adds more sustenance to that deal,'' Jill S. Krutick, an
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The merged music company, to be known as Warner EMI Music, would
sell about one out of four records in the United States and also
have a vast international presence. EMI, whose roster of artists
includes the Rolling Stones, the Spice Girls and Robbie Williams,
has been strongest in Europe and some other international markets
like Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's Warner Music, which has acts that include Madonna,
Eric Clapton and Jewel, has been strongest in the United States.
But its market share has plummeted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and EMI Group would each own 50 percent of Warner
EMI Music. But Time Warner would have a slight majority on the
board of directors and ultimate control. To gain this control, Time
Warner will pay EMI shareholders 1 pound per share, or about $1.65,
for a total payment of about $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EMI Group would continue as a company with its own stock trading
on the London Stock Exchange. Its operations would consist of its
50 percent interest in the new joint record venture, plus some
other business that include a stake in the music retailer HMV.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Ames, the chief executive of Warner Music, would be chief
executive of the new venture, which is to be based in New York. Ken
Berry, who heads EMI Records, would be chief operating officer. EMI
Group's chairman, Eric Nicoli, and Time Warner's president, Richard
Parsons, would be co-chairmen, the people close to the transaction
said.
</P>
<P>
   Talks about the merger have been under way since August, well
before the recent announcement of the $165 billion merger of Time
Warner and America Online. One person close to the negotiations
said America Online was not told of the EMI talks until after
America Online and Time Warner had reached their basic merger
agreement. But Steve Case, the chairman of America Online, signed
off on the music deal, which would make even more musical content
available for AOL to distribute over the Internet, this person
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simply combining the current sales of Warner Music and EMI
Records, the new company would have revenue of about $8 billion a
year. That would surpass the roughly $6 billion a year in sales of
the current industry leader, Seagram Co.'s Universal Music Group,
which itself became the leader through the 1998 acquisition of
Polygram. But some operations might be cut after the Warner
Music-EMI merger, people close to the deal said Sunday, so it is
possible that Seagram would remain the largest music company.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Warner is now No. 4 in terms of newly
released current album sales, and EMI is No. 5. The combined
company would be just behind Universal Music in the American
market, with a share of about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs and a realignment of record labels can probably be
expected within Warner Music and EMI. When Seagram bought Polygram,
for example, thousands of jobs were lost, some record labels were
eliminated and hundreds of artists found themselves suddenly
without record contracts as the company cut about $300 million in
annual costs.
</P>
<P>
   Warner EMI Music wants to cut $400 million in annual costs by
the third year after the merger, people close to the deal said. But
they said the realignment would be less tumultuous than in the case
of Seagram and Polygram.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Warner Music has seen its share of newly released album sales in
the United States shrink to 13.7 percent in 1999 from 20.9 percent
in 1996, dropping it from No. 1 to No. 4 in the rankings, according
to Soundscan, a monitoring firm. The company lost or removed many
experienced executives in the mid-1990s and has been criticized for
relying too much on aging stars like Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and
Madonna rather than developing new acts. Warner also has
historically relied on distributing American acts around the world,
but many overseas audiences are beginning to prefer homegrown acts.
</P>
<P>
   EMI, which has been rumored to be for sale for years, has been
recovering from troubles of its own, but its presence in markets
outside the United States could help bolster Warner there.
</P>
<P>
   Ames, who took over as head of Warner Music in August, began
talks with EMI almost immediately _ initially, about joint
manufacturing and distribution. Ames, a native of Trinidad, started
his career with EMI in 1975 and then spent 18 years at Polygram. He
is intimately familiar with the British music business and friends
with Berry, the head of EMI Records.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry is on the cusp of change as more people begin
to obtain music electronically over the Internet rather than on a
compact disk sold at a record store. Gerald Levin, the chairman and
chief executive of Time Warner, has said that music will be the
first entertainment business to benefit from the Internet. Music
companies will be able to sell their existing music in a new form,
which provides an incentive to increase a company's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   One executive close to the transaction said Sunday, ``You want
to bulk up in music, both in the catalog and new releases.'' The
merger, for instance, will reunite the complete catalog of Frank
Sinatra recordings, some of which are now held by EMI's Capitol
Records and some by Warner's Reprise label. EMI's catalog also
includes the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Further industry consolidation could be in store. Indeed,
Bertelsmann AG, the German conglomerate that owns one of the
biggest record companies, has been saying publicly that it is
interested in buying other record companies. But besides Seagram,
Warner-EMI and Bertelsmann, the only other giant is Sony Music,
which is owned by Sony Corp. and might not be for sale. ``This is
it for the big guys,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the Warner-EMI deal say they expect it to
get antitrust approval in the United States and Europe, citing the
approval of the Seagram acquisition of Polygram. But some analysts
said that with the number of companies becoming smaller, the
antitrust scrutiny could grow more intense. EMI and Warner are also
the two largest companies in music publishing, which means they own
the copyrights of songs and collect royalties when the songs are
played. The two companies own copyrights of nearly 2 million songs.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter acted as an adviser for Time Warner
in the deal, people close to the situation said. EMI was advised by
Warburg Dillon Read and Goldman, Sachs.

   NATIONAL-GUARD (Austin, Texas) _ Early next month, nearly 800
men and women of the 49th Armored Division will board transport
planes and fly to Bosnia. Ultimately, they will take command of the
American sector in NATO's multinational operation there. The
Pentagon has deployed Guard and Reserve units overseas before; more
than 265,000 were called up to support the Persian Gulf war in
1990. But the 49th's mission is something new. Not since the Korean
War has a National Guard division commanded an overseas operation.

train in the city subway system on more than 650 miles of track has
remained almost unchanged since the subways first started rolling
in 1904. Workers basically watch for trains coming into stations,
then note in writing the arrival and departure times. The exact
location of the trains is usually not known at any given moment.
But over the next three years, at a cost of $128 million, a
revolution will begin that will essentially drag the system out of

<P>
   LONDON _ A new breed of daily newspaper that has had phenomenal
success here and throughout Europe is about to face its first test
in the United States when Metro Philadelphia begins publishing on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Metro Philadelphia, a daily tabloid that is to be
distributed free throughout the public transit system, has come
under legal attack from several American newspaper companies.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit, filed Friday in Philadelphia, contends that the new
publication has made an unfair, exclusive distribution arrangement
with Philadelphia transit officials. The suit also argues that
because transit officials have authority to oversee the editorial
content of the publication, the publication violates First
Amendment rights to a free press.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the unit of
Knight Ridder that publishes The Philadelphia Inquirer and The
Philadelphia Daily News; The New York Times Co.; and the Gannett
Co., which publishes USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   A judge refused to grant an injunction against publication but
agreed to hear the case on Monday. Pending that hearing, Metro
Philadelphia agreed to temporarily not distribute copies of its
paper anywhere within the transit system that is barred to the
other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Philadelphia, published by a unit of the Swedish media
company Modern Times Group, will be the first version of Metro
published in the United States. It hopes to match the success of
more than a dozen other versions in Europe _ as well as a copycat,
Metro London, which has no business ties to Modern Times.
</P>
<P>
   Papers like Metro London are part of a new phenomenon _ the free
daily newspaper _ which is sweeping European cities and is swiftly
challenging the assumption that the Internet generation has all but
given up on reading newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in March, the Metro London tabloid is distributed
each morning inside subway stations through a contract with the
London Underground transit authority. The paper has increased its
circulation more than threefold in less than a year _ to 350,000
daily copies, up from an initial 100,000. And 50 percent of its
readers apparently never read newspapers before, according to its
publisher, Associated Newspapers Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Philadelphia has a similar arrangement with a local
transit agency, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, or Septa _ the distribution deal now being challenged in
court. Under the Philadelphia pact, the publisher will pay Septa a
minimum of $45,000 a month for access to distribute the paper
within the confines of its subway system and at its bus stops.
Septa will also receive one page of free advertising each day and
have at least nominal editorial control over the paper _ though
Metro officials said that the transportation agencies it works with
have never exercised this editorial power.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Philadelphia will have an editorial staff of 16, whose
work will mainly involve revising news stories from The Associated
Press and other news services to fit the paper's summary-style
format. The paper plans to include some original local reporting as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Initial plans call for a print run of 150,000 copies daily. The
paper will compete with The Philadelphia Inquirer and The
Philadelphia Daily News, which have struggled lately.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roberts, the managing director and publisher of Metro
Philadelphia, said he hoped his paper did not succeed at the
expense of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the easy thing to say is that I'm going to try rip the
heart of The Daily News and put them out of business. But that's
not what I'm after,'' he said, noting that he was once the city
editor at The Philadelphia Daily News.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Free newspapers are nothing new here in Europe, or in the United
States. Most big cities have at least one widely distributed free
weekly. In Manhattan, for instance, the alternative weekly Village
Voice sits in street-corner news boxes for any passerby to pick up,
along with New York Press and numerous imitators.
</P>
<P>
   The first version of Metro was started in Stockholm in 1995 by
Transit Publications Inc., a unit of Modern Times. The company
negotiated a deal with local officials to be the exclusive
newspaper publisher for Stockholm's subway system. Modern Times
soon rolled out versions of the paper in other European cities.
After it announced plans to start a Metro in Britain about 18
months ago, Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Daily Mail and
The Evening Standard pay tabloids, set out to pre-empt the Swedish
company. Associated introduced a similar paper with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first looked at the concept and considered if it would
work in London, our first thought was a bit defensive about our own
papers,'' said Kevin Beatty, managing director of Associated
Newspapers. ``But when we did the analysis, our research showed
that over 50 percent of tube riders don't buy newspapers. And
that's what fascinated us.''
</P>
<P>
   With Associated getting to the market first, Modern Times has
since tabled its plans to produce a London version.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when newspaper readership among younger people
continues to dwindle at traditional newspapers in Europe and the
United States, the Metro genre is demonstrating that young people
may be interested in reading the news on paper _ provided it is
written for attention spans honed on MTV and surfing the Net.
According to Sifo, a media-consulting company in Stockholm, more
than half of Metro's audience there is younger than 40.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the format will do as well in the United States is an
open question, of course. The papers already in Philadelphia are
concerned. ``The issue is preferential treatment to Metro that no
other newspapers have,'' said Pamela Browner, a spokeswoman for
Philadelphia Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, a lawyer for The New York Times, said, ``It's
dangerous to have the government involved in a relationship with a
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Metro Philadelphia put out a release defending its
deal with Septa and quoting Roberts: ``As a journalist with more
than 25 years' experience, I can assure you that Metro will publish
a totally independent, objective and fair journalistic product.
Read our newspaper on Monday and judge for yourself.''

TIME WARNER TO BUY CONTROL OF EMI'S MUSIC OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time Warner Inc. plans to acquire control of the music business
of EMI Group and merge it with Warner Music, creating what could
become the world's largest record company, officials close to the
negotiations said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to be announced Monday in London,
would shrink the oligopoly of music companies that dominate the
world business from five to four. And coming two weeks after Time
Warner agreed to be acquired by America Online, the music merger
would create a force to be reckoned with in the fledgling business
of distributing music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly underscores the premise of the AOL-Time Warner
merger and adds more sustenance to that deal,'' Jill S. Krutick, an
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The merged music company, to be known as Warner EMI Music, would
sell about one out of four records in the United States and also
have a vast international presence. EMI, whose roster of artists
includes the Rolling Stones, the Spice Girls and Robbie Williams,
has been strongest in Europe and some other international markets
like Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's Warner Music, which has acts that include Madonna,
Eric Clapton and Jewel, has been strongest in the United States.
But its market share has plummeted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and EMI Group would each own 50 percent of Warner
EMI Music. But Time Warner would have a slight majority on the
board of directors and ultimate control. To gain this control, Time
Warner will pay EMI shareholders 1 pound per share, or about $1.65,
for a total payment of about $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EMI Group would continue as a company with its own stock trading
on the London Stock Exchange. Its operations would consist of its
50 percent interest in the new joint record venture, plus some
other business that include a stake in the music retailer HMV.
</P>
<P>
   Simply combining the current sales of Warner Music and EMI
Records, the new company would have revenue of about $8 billion a
year. That would surpass the roughly $6 billion a year in sales of
the current industry leader, Seagram Co.'s Universal Music Group,
which itself became the leader through the 1998 acquisition of
Polygram. But some operations might be cut after the Warner
Music-EMI merger, people close to the deal said Sunday, so it is
possible that Seagram would remain the largest music company.

500,000 HOMES LEFT DARK BY ICE STORM IN SOUTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Tenn., N.C., S.C., Ala.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A sluggish winter storm dripped a crippling coating of
ice on much of the Southeast on Sunday, cracking thousands of
drooping pine trees and cutting off electric power to more than
500,000 households, mostly in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   From northeast Georgia to central North Carolina, hundreds of
roads were closed by fallen pines, never the sturdiest trees even
in normal conditions. In urban areas, the trees generally took
power lines down with them as they fell, leaving many neighborhoods
in Atlanta a chaotic mix of scattered branches, energized wires and
nonfunctioning traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 18 years, this is the most ice I've ever seen accumulate,''
said Tom Moore, senior meteorologist with The Weather Channel,
which is based here. ``The saving grace was that it was a Sunday
morning.'' Many other Atlantans were also thankful the storm did
not occur a week later, when the Super Bowl will be played at the
Georgia Dome downtown.
</P>
<P>
   About 320,000 homes in Atlanta _ a quarter of the metropolitan
area _ were without power by Sunday evening, said Lisa Frederick, a
spokeswoman for Georgia Power. Atlanta is one of the most heavily
forested cities in the country, and because of the large number of
fallen trees, the company said it might be two days before power is
restored. In some cases, lights that came back on went off again an
hour later when another tree succumbed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst storm in the area since crews took a week to
restore power to 570,000 customers after a blizzard in March 1993,
Ms. Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
   Most homes in the region are heated by forced-air furnaces,
which require electricity to operate. With temperatures hovering
around freezing, many people huddled around fireplaces for heat, or
relied on kerosene heaters, which sold briskly at warehouse stores.
Inevitably, the reliance on heaters produced a rash of house fires,
the worst of which killed three people on the southwest side of the
city early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many families lost both their power and their roof to falling
trees. Kent Harper arrived at his Dekalb County home Sunday morning
after his evening shift at the post office to find two large limbs
protruding from his roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like somebody had thrown a spear or a javelin through
it,'' said Harper, a transportation supervisor, surveying the
icicles that were building up in his living room. ``I knew I should
have had those pine trees cut down.'' His family, like many others,
cooked lunch in an iron skillet in the fireplace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chain saws echoed throughout the city, as people tried to move
limbs covered with a half-inch coating of ice. Many people in the
northern suburbs were trapped in their subdivisions until someone
with a saw or a winch could clear an entrance road.
</P>
<P>
   Even walking was hazardous, as any branch could fall with a
gunfire crack and a shower of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an explosion, and then I ran,'' said Germaine Dozier,
a receptionist who was walking in her midtown neighborhood Sunday
morning. ``This huge branch fell right where I was standing. It was
like wartime or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The ice coated about 40 counties in the northern third of
Georgia, according to the state emergency management agency, and
conditions in seven counties were serious enough that the state
declared emergencies, urging motorists not to go out. Similar
conditions prevailed in parts of southeastern Tennessee and western
portions of the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the ice was the result of a warm air layer that
floated atop a colder layer near the ground. Without the warmth,
the rain might have turned to less damaging snow, he said. The
storm extended from Alabama, where 33,000 customers were without
power, to around Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's major utilities reported approximately 20,000
customers without electricity Sunday after parts of that state got
a mixture of sleet, rain and snow. But a Carolina Power &AMP; Light
spokeswoman, Sally Ramey, said not all of the outages could be
blamed on the weather. Parts of South Carolina got up to 6 inches
of snow late Saturday, and traffic on parts of Interstate 85 came

accidents.

&HT;     BUSH, FOBES HIT SAME TURF ON FINAL DAY BEFORE IOWA CAUCUSES

   WATERLOO, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and publishing scion
Steve Forbes stumped for votes in dueling rallies here Sunday just
one day before Iowa's caucuses, with Forbes aiming a last indirect
shot at Bush on abortion while Bush urged his supporters to ``bring
a friend or relative'' out to vote Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both were fighting temperatures that barely rose out of single
digits. They also were competing with the afternoon telecast of the
NFC championship game, which campaign officials feared would
depress turnout Sunday. St. Louis Rams quarterback Kirk Warner
played college ball at the nearby University of Northern Iowa and
is a local favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush drew about 500 of his partisans, packed so
tightly in a middle school gymnasium that one woman fainted in the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Bush appeared
confident of a big night Monday night. The Des Moines Register,
Iowa's most influential newspaper, endorsed Bush on the Republican
side and former Sen. Bill Bradley on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   The final Register poll also showed Bush leading Forbes by 23
points, 43 percent to 20 percent. Radio commentator Alan Keyes,
conservative activist Gary Bauer and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. _
who is not campaigning in Iowa _ were tied for third with eight
percent each. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was fourth with one
percent, and 14 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll showed Vice President Al Gore ahead of Bradley, 56
percent to
</P>
<P>
   28 percent, with 16 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The Register editorial endorsing Bush said, ``There is something
about George W. Bush that draws people to him,'' and the
endorsement praised Bush for speaking ``with conviction of not
wanting to leave anyone behind in America.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Sunday, Bush did not mention the abortion
controversy. Instead he kept his remarks generally light, telling
the crowd the government can shore up the Social Security and
Medicare systems while instituting a tax cut, and that he supports
free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fearful people build walls; confident people tear them down,''
he said to light applause.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped speaking after a woman briefly fainted and was
escorted out of the gym by paramedics and security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush joked that his ``hot air'' had overcome her, later telling
the crowd she was OK.
</P>
<P>
   He told Republicans in his corner to ``bring a friend or
relative to your caucus tomorrow night.'' It was the classic
front-runner's anti-complacency plug: Don't assume that being ahead
in the polls means it is OK to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started the day in Des Moines and last night was to address
a rally in Mason City, the place upon which composer Meredith
Wilson based his Broadway hit ``The Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Forbes spoke to a crowd of 300 at the town's
convention center. In a veiled reference to Bush, he attacked
``others who for political expediency may hesitate'' in opposing
abortion. He reiterated his support for a constitutional amendment
banning abortion, as well as his pledge that his running mate and
judicial nominees also would be required to oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has proven to be a wedge issue for Forbes and an
irritation for Bush. On the one hand, Bush wants to appeal to
mainstream Republicans who are either pro-choice or who put
abortion below economic issues and taxes in importance. On the
other hand, social conservatives in Iowa are a vocal element of the
Republican Party whom he can ill afford to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has called Bush ``timid'' and a ``pretender'' on
abortion, and he has campaigned with veteran anti-abortion activist
Phyllis Schlafly. Bauer has made abortion the central focus of his
longshot campaign, appearing with Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey, the
Iowans who became parents of septuplets in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bush told reporters that he too supports the
``human life'' amendment to the Constitution, which has been a
plank in the Republican platform since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how much potency the abortion issue will
have in terms of Monday night's results. Two who attended the Bush
rally, Kim and Debra Reida of Waverly, said that although they
staunchly oppose abortion, they felt drawn to Bush on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole person we're looking at, not the one issue,''
said Debra Reida, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Bush describes himself as `pro-life'' but has argued for
exceptions including rape, incest and to protect the life of the
mother. In debates, Bush declined to say he would require his
running mate and federal judicial appointees to oppose abortion as
a condition for selection.

PARTIES STUDYING WAYS TO IMPROVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before the voting begins in this year's
primaries and caucuses, Republican and Democratic Party officials
are exploring ways to change a presidential nominating system that
critics say has become too chaotic, too fast for informed decision
making and even, in some fundamental ways, undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of the American political tradition to complain about
the system of nominating presidential candidates. But rarely is the
chorus as loud as it is this year _ or the talk of change so
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the whole issue of what happens beyond 2000 very
seriously,'' said Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic
National Committee. ``What's different is that both parties have
blue-ribbon committees out there studying whether front-loading is
a problem and seeking testimony on what the solution might be.''
</P>
<P>
   William E. Brock, the former senator and Republican National
Committee chairman who is heading his party's Advisory Commission
on the Presidential Nominating Process, said in an interview last
week, ``There is a very considerable number of states that feel
they have no voice, and frankly an awful lot of people feel they
have no effective voice in the selection process.'' He added,
``What we're trying to address is that need _ if people don't feel
they have a voice, there's no need to participate, and if they
don't participate, the system isn't working as well as it should.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states are always left behind in the nominating season,
holding primaries or caucuses long after a candidate has locked up
the nomination. But never has the process been more front-loaded,
or compressed with a flurry of big states, seeking greater
influence, having moved their primaries forward.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a six-week burst of voting that begins on Monday
in Iowa and reaches a climax on March 7 with primaries and caucuses
in 16 states, including California and New York. By mid-March, some
analysts say, the race for the nomination could well be resolved in
one or even both parties. Nobody knows what this will mean for the
voters, who some polls suggest are only beginning to pay attention.
But both parties are clearly worried.
</P>
<P>
   In one measure of how fast this calendar has become in recent
years, by March 15, 1984, seven states had held primaries, said
Rhodes Cook, the author of ``Race for the Presidency''
(Congressional Quarterly Press, 1999). By the same point this year,
25 states will have held primaries, so clustered together that some
analysts say they may pass most voters in a blur.
</P>
<P>
   A recent preliminary report by Brock's commission notes: ``There
has been increasing concern that a front-loaded nomination system
that ends almost as soon as it begins raises barriers to all but
the best-connected and well-funded candidates. Perhaps more
importantly, it may not allow voters adequate time to consider the
quality of various candidates and their views on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, when Democratic organizers pushed to create
the modern primary system after the tumultuous convention of 1968,
the question was how open the process should be _ how to get more
grass-roots involvement by voters in the choice of a nominee, which
had been largely the purview of elected officials and party
leaders. Now the question is more nuanced: whether a technically
open process can nevertheless force a result before most voters are
engaged.
</P>
<P>
   In the week before the first caucus, a poll by the Shorenstein
Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard
University found that two-thirds of the voters were paying ``only a
little'' or no attention to the campaign, and that 70 percent said
they had no favorite candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If the race is declared over before they tune in, some scholars
suggest, it could only further the voters' disaffection and the
decline in turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Iowa and New Hampshire, especially New Hampshire
this time around, will have a remarkable level of engagement with
the candidates and probably, at least by American standards, a very
high turnout in the primary,'' said William G. Mayer, a political
scientist at Northeastern University in Boston who studies the
nominating process. ``And voters in a handful of subsequent states,
like South Carolina and Michigan on the Republican side, New York
and California on the Democratic side, will have a reasonable
opportunity to hear the candidates debate and some opportunity to
compare them and reach a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, the system will probably reach a conclusion at
a very early stage _ in my view, about mid-March _ and for everyone
after that, they're not likely to see a lot of the candidates, the
press is not likely to spend a lot of time covering the process,
and turnout will fall off the table,'' Mayer added.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Sen. Bob Dole locked up the Republican nomination
with a blitz of early primaries in March, about 8.5 percent of the
eligible voters turned out in Republican primaries, substantially
below the comparable turnout 30 years ago, according to Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Gans added that there was no clear evidence that the compressed
schedule decreased turnout, but that once a winner was declared,
turnout plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both parties said they hoped their hearings and
reviews _ aimed at producing recommendations for action at the
Republican Convention this summer, later for the Democratic
National Committee _ would help answer the question of what this
primary structure does, if anything, to diminish political
participation. Both sides are hoping for bipartisan discussions
and, perhaps, a bipartisan consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, figuring out a way to ensure that states comply with a
new primary structure will be hard.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas that scholars and politicians have been debating
are a rotating series of regional primaries, a national primary and
primaries organized by time zone. Brock said there was particular
interest in organizing primaries by state populations: small states
would go first, allowing candidates an opportunity to do
small-scale grass-roots politicking; the biggest states would go
last. The primary clusters could be separated by as much as a
month, meaning that each group would get a chance at a full-blown
campaign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the parties' decisions will be affected by what
happens in the next few months. And there is always the chance that
voters will find a way to defy the predictions and make this race
more of a long march than now seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, for example, will not hold its primary until March 21,
but Jack Tatooles, a Republican township committeeman and ardent
supporter of Sen. John McCain, was the very picture of the happy
warrior on a recent afternoon, collecting ballot petitions and
taking calls from volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about other states,'' said Tatooles, the
co-chairman of McCain's Illinois campaign. ``But I can tell you
things are alive and well here and beyond my wildest
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat who is
supporting former Sen. Bill Bradley's presidential bid, voiced
similar sentiments about his man, but admitted he was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the tail end,'' Gutierrez said.

<P>
   The revolution begins at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Every afternoon, in thousands of schools across America,
students are staying after the final bell. They file back into
cafeterias for a snack, then filter through classrooms conducting
science experiments and creating art projects. They play, but they
also study. By the time they go home, the sun has already faded.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in after-school programs _ federal funding alone
has ballooned from $1 million in 1997 to $454 million this year _
represents nothing less than a re-imagining of the school day for
the first time in generations, as educators and policymakers seek
to respond to the realities of working families and what may be
missing from the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The lofty goal, according to the Afterschool Alliance, a
coalition of businesses, foundations and the federal government, is
for every American child to have access to high-quality programs by
the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many hours does it take to truly help a child learn and
grow in today's society?'' asked Jennifer Davis, executive director
of Boston 2 to 6, one of the programs sprouting in communities
across the country. ``It's no longer enough to just have a school
day.''
</P>
<P>
   With 78 percent of mothers of school-age children in the work
force, and welfare reform pushing even more into jobs, millions of
children are on their own between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., the hours when
youth are most likely to commit crime __ or be victimized by it. At
the same time, the public is increasingly frustrated with school
failures, worried both about poor performance on standardized tests
and that the renewed emphasis on basic skills has squeezed out
enrichment programs like art, music and gym.
</P>
<P>
   Typically offered free but with required attendance in poor,
urban neighborhoods, the burgeoning after-school programs in some
ways try to mimic the suburban activity calendar in which the
children of cul-de-sacs are shuttled between piano lessons and
soccer practice, with time for tutoring and play dates in between.
They also imitate the schedules of elite boarding schools, keeping
students scheduled until dark with experiential learning and
athletics _ an agenda laced with academics, yet distinct from what
happens during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give kids more time to learn,'' said Adriana DeKanter,
the special adviser to the U.S. secretary of education for
after-school issues, ``they're going to learn more.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, teenagers cook gourmet meals or stage mock trials
after apprenticeships with volunteer chefs and lawyers. In the San
Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, children at one school built their
own miniature golf course. Some 500,000 students in 1,000 school
districts in 45 states are using curriculums like ``Time Warp
Egypt'' and ``Do Cows Eat Sunshine?'' that were designed by the
Smithsonian Institution in conjunction with Voyager Expanded
Learning, a company based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Up to $5 billion in public and private money is being spent
annually on after-school programs, and estimates on how many
students are involved range from 2 million to 5 million. So far,
the programs have mostly blossomed in underprivileged
neighborhoods, but experts think the trend will soon spread to
middle-class suburbs, where most parents work but only a fraction
can afford nannies.
</P>
<P>
   While the notion of keeping idle youngsters out of trouble with
meaningful activities has universal appeal, some critics frown at
the notion of the government, rather than families, being
responsible for children for more hours each day. Considering the
shortcomings of public schools, others are skeptical about
expanding their reach _ will more time just produce more failure?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a lot more than just baby-sitting,'' said
Herbert Sturz, chairman of the After School Corp., an initiative
funded largely by George Soros which, by next month, will have
programs serving 26,000 students in 100 New York schools. At the
same time, warned Gil Noam, a professor of medicine and education
at Harvard, ``we have to be very careful not to overprogram,''
because it is ``very important just to kind of have downtime where
kids can be together.''

<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 130 in New York, the after-school program is
centered on a production of The Wiz, which took the stage last
week. Focusing on the musical's themes of home and family, the
elementary-school students did research projects about Kansas, drew
maps, and built cardboard houses modeled on Dorothy's, while also
rehearsing songs and dances and painting a backdrop for the set.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, Washington Chavez, a local artist, led a
group of second-graders through a lesson about detail as they
outlined the yellow-brick road, as Tamik Davis, who is in fourth
grade, tumbled across the auditorium practicing the tornado dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children that are very quiet and very shy are being more
expressive,'' said Juliet McBride, a reading teacher at the school
who also works in the after-school program, as she watched Tamik
twirl and leap. ``You can see it in their self-esteem. You can see
it in their grades.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A variety of small-scale studies have shown that enrollment in
after-school programs, particularly through grade 3, helps boost
attendance and reduce behavior problems during the school day and
even improves academic performance in class and on standardized
tests. Surveys done for the After School Corp. suggest that
students in the programs are more likely to finish their homework,
read, use computers and feel comfortable solving math problems,
while their parents report being able to work more hours while also
developing closer relationships with their children's schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, where youngsters with low test scores _ some 237,000
of them _ are required to attend the Lighthouse after-school
program, 89 percent of those enrolled saw their scores rise. In the
Cabrini Green housing project, the portion of students at the
Jenner Academy for the arts who meet the national average has
jumped from 14 percent to 21 percent in reading, and from 15
percent to 29 percent in math, since Lighthouse began.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some of the homes, there's either no parents to help with
homework or parents may not be capable,'' said Blondean Davis,
Chicago's chief of schools and regents. When the city instituted
mandatory homework in 1996, Dr. Davis said, ``parents wrote to us
and said, `How do I help with inversion of fractions? What do I
know about calculus?' The focus of Lighthouse is on the reading,
the math, and the homework assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the after-school movement skyrockets, with at least 26
states planning to increase funding, along with countless cities,
school districts, foundations and private companies, questions
abound about how to structure curriculum and recruit and train
staff. Many doubt the After School Corp.'s estimate that
high-quality programs can cost just $1,000 per child, pegging the
pricetag closer to $1,800 (the Children's Defense Fund puts it as
high as $3,000). And summer programs, the obvious next step in
needy neighborhoods, are even more complex and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement that the new after-school programs
should be situated in schools _ rather than the old model of the
YMCA _ to take advantage of insured public facilities currently
sitting empty, give the added hours an academic air, and help
school sites become the hubs of their communities. Most, though,
think they are best run not by school districts and teachers but by
neighborhood institutions _ the Dance Theater of Harlem, the
Children's Museum of Boston, or community-development organizations
_ able to bring something beyond books.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the programs contain a homework or tutoring
component, but the other hours are filled with recreation,
adventure or artistic activities. The federal government provides a
free snack and, in some places, a hot dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we extend the day, it cannot be more of the same,'' said
Deborah Lowe Vandell, a professor of educational psychology at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison who is perhaps the nation's
leading researcher on after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Schwarz, cofounder of Citizen Schools, the apprenticeship
program in Boston, said the key is to replace the ``drill and
kill'' approach of the test-focused classroom with something that
will ``allow kids to learn and have fun at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of times, kids who learn in nontraditional ways get
stigmatized,'' Schwarz said. ``They can flourish in these programs.
Teachers see that, and reimagine those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   One major dilemma is who should staff the programs. Some places,
like Chicago, use only teachers or retired teachers, but most say
that is unrealistic because of burnout or is simply too costly.
Instead, programs recruit lower-level school employees, college or
high school students, local artists and musicians and even
unemployed people from nearby neighborhoods, usually offering $6 to
$15 an hour. Turnover is brisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children need adults to help them grow up successfully,'' said
Carla Sanger, director of L.A.'s Best, whose employees typically
come from the low-income neighborhoods where the schools are
located and go through extensive training. ``Good adult supervision
requires a lot of generosity. That's not always intuitive. We have
to build what that means among staff.''
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 130, Rosetta Price is a cafeteria worker by
day, a counselor in the after-school program once the bell rings.
She has a special rapport with the children she leads in circle
games and helps to make glittery pins out of bow-tie pasta; they
relate to her in a different way than they do their more highly
educated teachers. And Ms. Price is learning, too, as she
orchestrates library research and workshops.
</P>
<P>
   There are often parents in the classroom as well, either as
volunteer helpers or as paid counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is good _ far better than in a pure reading program
targeted at weaker students in the same school _ and the children
seem thrilled with the array of activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, all you do is watch TV _ over here you do more
stuff,'' said Giovanni Vicenti, 8, as he squirmed in his small
chair in Ms. Price's class. ``You get to do art, you get to paint,
you get to do plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The children said they finish all their homework during the
after-school program, so in the evening, they are free to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go home and be bored,'' said Nieka Williams, another
8-year-old. ``It's fun here.''

JAPAN SECT'S NAME CHANGE BRINGS CONFUSION AND FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl&AMP;lb)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ By changing its name and denouncing its spiritual leader
last week, the religious sect that killed 12 people in a nerve gas
attack in the Tokyo subways in 1995 tried to convince Japanese
society that it was no longer a threat.
</P>
<P>
   But the name change from Aum Shinrikyo to Aleph, which is the
first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and signifies renewal for many
Japanese, appears to have raised more fears than it calmed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since Aum announced the name shift Tuesday, Japanese
businesses and organizations that use the name Aleph have been
flooded with telephone calls from people concerned that they were
associated with the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet sites of businesses and groups that use the name
Aleph have received so many hits in recent days that they have been
forced to shut down or post messages on their home pages
disclaiming any affiliation with Aum. Some companies are
considering abandoning the name Aleph altogether.
</P>
<P>
   At an Osaka-based cram school called Aleph, which prepares
students for medical school exams, the phones have been ringing off
the hook. Anxious students and their parents have expressed fears
that attending a preparatory school with the same name as the sect
will hurt their chances for admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hysterical because we are right in the middle of
exam period, and they have already submitted applications to
university medical faculties that have the name of Aleph as their
prep school,'' said Takeshisa Ueda, the school's director.
</P>
<P>
   When the school opened in 1990, officials chose the name Aleph
because they thought that it would distinguish the school from
others, Ueda said. But now officials are worried that they will
have trouble attracting new students.
</P>
<P>
   Such widespread concern over being linked to the sect, if only
by name, underscores the deep-seated fear of Aum Shinrikyo in
Japan, despite strict new laws and growing vigilantism that have
crippled the sect's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that assumptions by Japanese that
businesses and groups with the name Aleph were linked to the sect
were not unjustified because Aum Shinrikyo operates publishing,
computer and electronic equipment business under names that few
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since 1996, Aleph has been the name of an Aum Shinrikyo
company that manages the group's donations and seminars and
conducts business in computer parts, delivery services, warehousing
and travel.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many businesses and groups in Japan use
the name Aleph, but advertising and marketing executives estimated
the number to be in the hundreds. Aleph Choir, a musical group
based in Kyoto, has a site on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yuji Fukuda, senior research director for Dentsu Institute for
Human Studies, the research division of Dentsu Advertising, said
more and more Japanese companies were adopting names that are
foreign words, which are fashionable in Japanese society and useful
in conducting international business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Aleph is appealing because it has a mystical
connotation, which is also good for religious purposes,'' Fukuda
said. ``Words starting with an A are also advantageous in business
because it's the first letter of the Japanese alphabets and
English.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aleph Zero Co. Ltd., a graphics design firm, has found
little benefit in having a name associated with Aum Shinrikyo and
has decided temporarily to stop placing its name in publications
where its work appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate, and gives us a negative image,'' said
Saiichiro Suzuki, Aleph Zero's chairman. ``But we can't sue Aum to
stop them from using the name because we are in totally different
industries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aleph Inc., which operates several restaurant chains on
Hokkaido, said it had to shut down its Web site shortly after Aum
announced the name change it because it could not handle the
tremendous number of hits it received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply troubled by this misunderstanding, but we want
everyone to know that we are not linked to Aum Shinrikyo or engaged
in any type of religious activity,'' said Makoto Matsuo, an Aleph
Inc. spokesman. ``We haven't ruled out changing our parent company
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Aoyama, a chain of men's clothing stores, faced a similar
problem shortly after the subway gas attack in 1995 when the public
began to associate the retailer with Aum's lawyer, Yoshinobu
Aoyama. The lawyer became a household name after appearing
regularly on television to deny his clients' involvement in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The clothing store chain received scores of telephone calls and
letters from people who criticized it for being ``associated'' with
Aum. Sales at Aoyama stores plummeted along with its stock price,
which dropped to 1,100 yen a share from 4,000 yen in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing they might be solicited to join the cult, some customers
refused to come to the clothing stores to pick up their suits, even
though they had already paid for them.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the company's president, Goro Aoyama, held a news
conference, issued a written disclaimer to investors and posted
signs in store windows saying that the chain was not Aum-related.
The company also ran advertisements in the major daily newspapers
denying any link to Aoyama, the group's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never dreamed this could happen to us,'' said Hiroaki
Okito, a spokesman. ``The truth does not spread immediately, so
companies in the same situation should take measures to counter
these rumors as soon as possible.''

AS U.S. LEANS ON BELGRADE, RADIO SERVICES LIMIT BROADCASTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ While the Clinton administration
intensifies its efforts to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia through increased support for the Serbian opposition and
independent media, both Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America
have recently curtailed their Serbian-language transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts in broadcasting to Serbia came as a surprise to a
senior State Department official closely involved in Balkan policy,
who said he would look into the matter. The administration has just
doubled its financial support for Serbian democratization,
including direct and indirect aid to the opposition and to the
independent media, to $25 million this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has also tried to create a ``ring around
Serbia'' of international broadcasting, including aid and new
transmitters for stations in Bosnia and Montenegro. Washington is
doing so in an effort to get ``the truth'' into Milosevic's
authoritarian Serbia, officials say, where news is still dominated
by state broadcasting, and to try to help the opposition overthrow
Milosevic, through an uprising or elections.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has told senior aides that
one of her goals, before leaving office a year from now, is to see
Milosevic out of office.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America
acknowledged the cuts, which reduced the daily Serbian
transmissions to roughly what they were before NATO's air war
against Yugoslavia over Kosovo began late last March.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, Thomas A. Dine, president of Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty in Prague, Czech Republic, and Sanford Ungar, director of
Voice of America in Washington, emphasized that they had to make
difficult choices within their existing budgets, which Congress did
not increase.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, both services increased their broadcasting in
Serbian and Albanian to serve listeners and Kosovo refugees,
especially during a period of wartime press censorship in Serbia.
But with the war over, the refugees returned and the independent
radio station B92, now called B2-92, operating again, Dine and
Ungar decided that they could spend their tightened budgets more
usefully in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Radio Free Europe, which had broadcast news in Serbian from
midnight until 2 a.m. local time but extended its news
transmissions until 5 a.m., cut back on Jan. 2 by two-and-a-half
hours, going off the air at 2 a.m. _ the other day in the middle of
a sentence _ and starting up again at 4:30.
</P>
<P>
   Dine points out that RFE continues to broadcast 10 hours and 40
minutes a day in Serbian. ``We asked for another $750,000 in the
fiscal year 2000 so we could keep up 13-and-a-half hours a day, but
we didn't get it,'' Dine said.
</P>
<P>
   There was some research indicating that listeners dropped off in
the early hours, Dine said, and the cost of transmission is high.
``I think we're still fulfilling our mission,'' he said, and there
are other needs: concentration on the Internet and covering cost of
living increases from the existing budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadcasting Board of Governors, to which both radio
services report, is a presidentially appointed independent
commission now formally independent of the State Department and the
U.S. Information Agency. The secretary of state is an ex-officio
board member.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As for Congress, Dine said, ``the professional staff and the
members in Congress knew what they were giving us and what the
consequences would be. No one said, `Cut,' but a nonanswer means
they don't want the heat. It's diametrically opposed to all the
cheerleading,'' Dine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice of America's Ungar said similarly: ``We have an
incredibly tight budget for the fiscal year 2000. Congress gave us
the same amount as last year'' and told the station to absorb a
cost of living increase of 4.8 percent, ``so it was a cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Another broadcasting official said: ``This ought to put some egg
on some faces. Symbolically, this is foolish. Washington loves to
mandate stuff and then not fund it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The VOA still broadcasts two and a half hours of news a day in
Serbian, cutting the extra 15 minutes of news the station added in
March, when the bombing war began. Broadcasting in Albanian, which
went up to three and a half hours a day to serve Kosovar refugees
driven out of the province by the Serbs, has now been cut back to
one hour and 45 minutes a day, Ungar said. He noted that both
services include a 30-minute radio and television simulcast Monday
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Unger added that with continuing financial problems and the
desire to keep broadcasting in 53 languages, he was looking for
other trims, cutting hours and frequencies. As for the Serbian
service, he said, ``we've just cut the 15 minutes we added in
March, but on further re-examination, we may trim it more.''

 &HT;    Iowa caucuses keep candidates rallying for support
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The first presidential campaign of the new
millennium officially begins tonight here in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Voters from across the Hawkeye State attend caucuses,
essentially public meetings at local precincts, to make their
choices for president in the Republican and Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 10 percent of Iowa's 1.8 million registered voters
are expected to turn out amid cold temperatures that are predicted
to range from 10 degrees in the north to the mid-30s in the south.
There is a chance of snow in some parts of the state, which could
further dampen turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Bill Bradley and Al Gore and a Republican field of
five candidates plan to have a day of campaigning in a final effort
to turn their supporters out to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses begin at 7 p.m. CST, leaving all the candidates
time to generate some last-minute enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   For the front-runners and their closest competitors, the caucus
results will be a chance to claim some type of victory and create
momentum and positive media coverage heading into next Tuesday's
New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the candidates have been trying to lower
expectations for their own performance, while upping the ante for
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants do better than expected and they want their
opponent to do worse than expected,'' said Drake University
political scientist Art Sanders. ``You want two or three days of
good stories to get you on a roll into a New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook, author of the Cook Political Report, said Sunday
that 15 point margins of victory for either front-runner, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush or Gore, would be decisive wins in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say that someone who wins by 15 points didn't
win,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign here entered the home stretch with a new poll
published Sunday showing both Bush and Gore holding commanding
leads.
</P>
<P>
   The Des Moines Register, the state's largest and most
influential newspaper, found Bush leading his closest competitor,
publisher Steve Forbes, 43 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who hasn't actively campaigned in
Iowa, was in a statistical tie for third place with the two
religious conservatives in the race, former diplomat Alan Keyes and
Family Research Council founder Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes and McCain polled 8 percent, while Bauer polled 6 percent.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) placed last with 1 percent. The margin of
error was 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The percentages are essentially unchanged from a similar
newspaper poll taken two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's results could shrink the Republican field by at least
one. Hatch said he will reassess his campaign if he doesn't place
better than fourth.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore led Bradley 56 percent to 28
percent in the Register poll. Bradley's support slipped five points
from a poll taken two weeks ago, when he trailed Gore 33 percent to
54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The slip could be trouble for Bradley if it accurately reflects
Monday's results because Bradley set the 31 percent Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) got in the 1980 Iowa primary as the test of an
``insurgent campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Caucus polls tend to be unreliable because they can not
accurately foretell who will attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's 30 below zero, you don't have any idea who's going to
show up,'' said Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat who has remained
neutral. ``It's all up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictably of tonight's contest leaves room for a few
potential surprises.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Keyes has been drawing large crowds of
supporters attracted to his strident anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who has spent millions of his personal fortune
campaigning in Iowa, also has been aggressively campaigning on his
anti-abortion message in an effort to keep his conservative base.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes plans to continue the strategy in more than two dozen
radio interviews scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to talk to voters about the importance
of the campaign for conservatives,'' said Forbes spokesman Greg
Mueller. ``That's who turns out in caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller said Forbes merely had to out-perform his recent poll
numbers to be successful in Iowa and move on to New Hampshire,
where McCain and Bush are locked in a tight race for first place.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to hold a rally with Iowa and Texas state
legislators in downtown Des Moines today in his final bid to get
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a man who's campaigning as hard as I can to
turn out the vote in Iowa,'' Bush said Sunday on ABC's This Week
with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore planned to rally with supporters in Cedar Rapids,
Davenport, then Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley plans to attend a rally in Ames with university
students, who are a crucial part of his outsider challenge to Gore.

PRESIDENT FACES ACCUSATIONS WITH DEFIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Striking a note of somber defiance, President Ezer
Weizman of Israel on Sunday night refused either to resign or to
step down temporarily while police pursue a criminal investigation
of his receipt of hundreds of thousands of dollars from a French
businessman and political supporter.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief nationally televised address from his official
residence, Weizman proclaimed that he ``committed no crime,
committed no sin, and took nothing illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on Weizman to quit has intensified in recent days, with
calls for his resignation coming from former allies and every major
newspaper as well as from his longtime foes on the political right.
But his stubborn insistence on Sunday night that he should be
investigated and judged like ``any other citizen'' seemed
characteristic of a man who built a political career on impolitic
contrarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Looking weary but speaking firmly, the beleaguered 75-year-old
president said he would issue a statement about the facts of the
affair when the investigation is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he said, reading from a
prepared text.
</P>
<P>
   ``I repeat, I have no intention of resigning. A man whose
conscience is clean is not afraid and does not run away.''
</P>
<P>
   Several key figures in the current government, including Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin, have urged Weizman to step aside temporarily
until the police investigation is concluded. The president was
widely expected to announce on Sunday night that he was taking this
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said he had concluded that ``a leave of absence is
not a solution'' for a sitting president, who would nonetheless
remain Israel's official head of state. ``There is no difference
between a president on leave and an incumbent president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office has said it hopes the
investigation can be finished in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Through spokesmen, Weizman has acknowledged that when he was in
other government posts, he received more than $200,000 in publicly
undeclared gifts from Edouard Saroussi, a French-born textile
magnate and Israeli resident who was a key contributor to Weizman's
political campaigns in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Published allegations contend that Weizman received $453,000
from Saroussi between 1988 and 1993 and that his alleged failure to
declare the income could be evidence of tax fraud or bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman repeated on Sunday night his previous insistence that
his income statements from that period had been approved by
respected tax attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I erred, I made a human error in innocence,'' he said,
in the only indirect admission of any possible wrongdoing on his
part.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday night's address, few voices were raised in
Weizman's defense. ``I think that the president erred tonight,''
said Shaul Yahalom, the chairman of the National Religious Party.
``He ought to have taken a leave of absence.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the overall tone of commentary was one of empathy and
regret, mixed with head-shaking astonishment at the president's
seeming incomprehension of the wide consensus that he can no longer
perform the role of head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, conceived as a unifying and stabilizing
institution aloof from the partisan fray, has been occupied by
elder statesmen whose personal characters were considered above
reproach _ beginning with the president's uncle, the revered Chaim
Weizmann.
</P>
<P>
   And Ezer Weizman himself, though a more flamboyant figure than
his predecessors, was similarly seen as a selfless patriot, a
visionary air force commander who had devoted his life to his
country's defense rather than to personal enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Weizman were first made by a free-lance
journalist here, Yoav Yitzhak, who has called a series of news
conferences to publicize his charges.
</P>
<P>
   In an almost daily stream of elaborations and fresh allegations,
Yitzhak recently claimed that Weizman had also received funds in
1984 from another French millionaire in return for a pledge not to
join a coalition government then being formed under the leadership
of the right-wing Likud Party. Weizman's lawyers called these
latest allegations a ``fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Israel's presidency is largely a ceremonial position, the
president has the power to appoint judges and to grant pardons. He
is himself constitutionally protected against prosecution _ though
not against criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin, the justice minister, acknowledging that he was not
``pleased'' by what the president said on Sunday night, called on
him ``to take into account the law enforcement and legal systems,
and to avoid clemency decisions and the appointment of judges in
the period in which the investigation is under way.''

A MILLION PROTESTERS IN SPAIN DENOUNCE TERRORISM'S RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story does not carry a byline.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ A million people marched here Sunday in a
protest against the Basque separatist group ETA, government
officials said, two days after the government blamed the rebels for
a bombing that killed an army officer and appeared to reignite
separatist violence after a lull of 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and three former prime ministers
led the long march that capped a weekend of demonstrations
nationwide after two car bombings on Friday in Madrid. No one has
claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend protests almost uniformly scorned the rebels,
underscoring the popular anger and fear touched off by the
resumption of terrorism, apparently by the Basque group. But a
pro-rebel march attracted 10,000 people on Saturday in the Basque
city of Pamplona.
</P>
<P>
   The government blames the rebels for causing 800 deaths in their
31-year struggle for Basque independence. Aznar said Sunday that
the fight against the rebels ``will be difficult, tough and long.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``although we'll suffer, we'll end up winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The government and rebels have blamed each other for failing to
negotiate a lasting peace during the rebels' 14-month unilateral
cease-fire. The Basque group called it off late last year, raising
fears of renewed violence.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Sunday in the Madrid daily Diario 16 found that
half of the 400 people surveyed wanted new peace talks, while 29
percent said that the police alone could defeat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The march in Madrid, behind a banner that read ``For Peace and
Liberty. No to Terrorism,'' was the largest in the capital since
July 1997, when an estimated 1.5 million people demanded an end to
violence after the rebels killed a Basque town councilman.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Homeland and Freedom, had not made a fatal attack since June 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first of the two car bombs last Friday killed a lieutenant
colonel in the Spanish army, Pedro Antonio Blanco Garcia, 47. The
Interior Ministry Sunday distributed photographs of two suspected
rebels _ young men with close-cropped black hair _ who were
reportedly seen at the site of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in St. Peter's Square in Rome Sunday, Pope John Paul II
said, ``I wish to express my deep pain over the news of the recent
terrorist attack,'' in Spain, news agencies reported. The Vatican
has previously condemned Basque violence.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar marched Sunday next to his opponent in the March 12
general elections, the Socialist opposition leader, Joaquin
Almunia. They said little to each other, but they have agreed that
stopping separatist violence should transcend party politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the political fallout from the bombs on Friday continued in
the northern Basque region, where the leader of the moderate Basque
Nationalist Party, Xabier Arzalluz, accused the Madrid-based
national parties of unfairly blaming him for the fatal attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as if we ourselves placed the bomb,'' Arzalluz
complained, after his party was criticized for merely suspending on
Friday, and not fully breaking, its parliamentary deal for the
support of a leftist Basque coalition, Euskal Herritarrok, that is
widely considered to be the political wing of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The march in central Madrid was so long that thousands of
protesters reached the official destination in the Puerta del Sol
square more than an hour after the political leaders had already
left, after issuing a statement condemning the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not discouraged,'' said Esther Fernandez, 25, a Madrid
lawyer who has been to many protests against the rebels. ``You have
to have the desire and hope that this violence will end.''

body of top clerics and Islamic lawyers, have eliminated 402
candidates nominated by reform groups. Reformers see the exclusion
of some of their most experienced leaders as an attempt to
decapitate their campaign, reduce its electoral appeal and make
less likely a reformist landslide that had seemed possible on the
basis of other recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   The guardians' council acknowledged this month that it might
have made ``some mistakes'' and agreed to accept appeals, although
only a minority are expected to be successful. All the same, with
many reform candidates remaining among the thousands of Iranians
competing for the 290 parliamentary seats, many believe the
balloting on Feb. 18 could still shift the balance of power against
the hardliners who control decisive centers of authority in the
army, police and judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating disqualifications, the reformers _ Iranians who
oppose a strict form of Islamic government _ had swamped the
nominating process, daring the hardliners to order wholesale
exclusions. But the Islamic conservatives apparently were too wary
_ or too subtle in their exercise of control _ to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last three years _ in a presidential election that
was won in 1997 by Mohammed Khatami, a reformist cleric, and in
countrywide municipal elections last year _ the reformers took
nearly 70 per cent of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the electorate is under 30, and thus too young to
remember much of life under Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, who was
overthrown in 1979 by the Islamic regime that remains in power. But
their votes have so far had limited political effect, since even
Khatami, who is 53 years old and an acknowledged admirer of Western
political thinkers like Thomas Jefferson, has little real power in
face of the conservative clerical hierarchy under Iran's supreme
religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   By removing the reformers' most popular campaigners, Islamic
conservatives appear to be hoping to turn the political tide. But
even this may not be enough. The Muslim clergy are increasingly
divided. Many who were once hardliners have joined the reformers,
partly because they sense public wrath building against the
ayatollahs, mullahs and imams who have become a privileged elite.
</P>
<P>
   If the reformers gain control of parliament, they could initiate
constitutional changes that would return the clerical hierarchy to
the role that reformist clerics see as appropriate for an Islamic
system of government, one of religious guidance but not of direct
political control.
</P>
<P>
   Clerical hardliners might then have to choose between making a
fight of it and accepting a political evolution that would send
many of them back to the seminaries and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has an important stake in the outcome of the
voting, since Khatami and the reformers have said that they favor
improved relations that could end U.S. economic sanctions and the
bitterness that began with the seizure of the U.S. embassy and
hostages in November 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The final candidate list will only be announced on Feb. 9, and
campaigning is restricted to the last week before the vote. But
already the political temperature is running high.
</P>
<P>
   A leading conservative, Ayatollah Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, set the
tone in a sermon at the Friday prayers in Tehran 10 days ago, when
he called on his followers to use violence, if necessary, to answer
reformers' calls for a democratic society. ``If someone tells you
he has a new interpretation of Islam, hit him in the mouth,'' he
said, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers have responded in terms that by Iranian standards
are scarcely less incendiary. Ayatollah Ali Montazeri, a
77-year-old cleric who was once the nominated heir of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the 1979 revolution, said last week
that Khomeini believed that ``in this day and age when people are
politically aware'' it was ``impossible to continue ruling by force
or imposing authoritarian methods.'' He added: ``No stable system
of government can be established unless it is popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Montazeri's attack was all the more notable for the fact that
Khamenei, the man who displaced him as Khomeini's successor, had
placed him under house arrest in 1997 in the holy city of Qom,
where he remains under police guard.
</P>
<P>
   His tract, sent by fax to the Reuters office in Tehran, went to
the heart of Khamenei's claim to dictatorial powers. The country's
supreme religious leader, he said, was ``not infallible,'' and
under Iran's constitution, had ``no right to exercise absolute
power.''

<P>
</P>
<P>
   While key reform leaders have been jailed in recent years, and
some have been killed, and reformist newspapers have endured a
relentless campaign of harassment and closure, the conservatives
have given the reformers enough leeway to prevent popular
restlessness from boiling over. The prime tactician in this appears
to have been Khamenei, who has at times made concessions to the
reformers, and at other times hit back hard.
</P>
<P>
   The hardliners appear ready to concede to the reformers a larger
bloc than they have in the current parliament, where they are
heavily outnumbered, but not enough to make constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives would prefer to see a conservative umbrella
group, the Islamic Coalition Society, have a decisive voice in
parliament. Its election effort is led by a former president, Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who leaned toward the reformers until
recently, when swung back into Khamenei's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani is now favored for the parliamentary speaker's post
that until last fall had been expected to go to Abdullah Nouri, a
reformist cleric close to Khatami. But Nouri was eliminated from
the elections when a special clerical court convicted him of heresy
in November and sentenced him to five years in prison. Nouri had
entered candidate's papers from prison, hoping a successful appeal
would allow him to join the campaign. But his conviction was upheld
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The May 23 Movement, led by Khatami, had 90 of its 290
candidates for the election struck down. Among those eliminated
were Abbas Abdi, a newspaper columnist best known for having led
the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy, and Hamidreza Jalaiepour,
editor of a series of reformist newspapers that have been ordered
closed by the hardliners, only to reopen under new titles.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rafsanjani offered a foretaste of the hardliners'
campaign. In a sermon that was broadcast live on state radio, he
said reformers were ``unjust'' to question such things as Iran's
performance during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war _ in which an
estimated 500,000 Iranians were killed _ and the quality of dams
built under Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who say that every dam Iran has built had a hole in it
are committing treason,'' he said, according to an Associated Press
report. ``Killing people's confidence is more dangerous than
AIDS.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: BIG GUNS AT THE U.N.: HOLBROOKE'S DAZZLING CAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., skedded earlier as U.N.-U.S.)  
(js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Richard Holbrooke took over as Security Council president
for January, he declared it the month of Africa. But council
members have been getting more than an education on important
African issues, from an AIDS epidemic to multiple civil wars. They
have also been absorbing some lessons in American politics,
election year style.
</P>
<P>
   First, Holbrooke turned over his gavel and the Security Council
spotlight to Vice President Al Gore, who many expect will name
Holbrooke his secretary of state if elected president in the fall.
Gore, opening a daylong debate on the AIDS crisis on Jan. 10,
demonstrated his informed interest in a burning international issue
and how he might project U.S. leadership in an international arena.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the turn of Sen. Jesse Helms, the North Carolina
Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which can make or break presidential appointments and
long delayed Holbrooke's own. Helms basked in the glow of two days
of attention as he lectured the council last Thursday, at
Holbrooke's invitation, on what he sees as the United Nations'
shortcomings, even warning that the United States might withdraw
from the organization. The next day, Helms held a Senate Foreign
Relations Committee hearing on the same theme in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will occupy the
council president's chair for a star-studded debate on Africa's
biggest war, in the Congo. Half a dozen or more African presidents
will be in town, including the elusive Laurent Kabila, the Congo's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen other Security Council members, and those who track U.
N. affairs, are watching all this with fascination, and some
ambivalence. For some, the spectacle of a staid chamber being
turned over to theatrical meetings for an extended period of time
is troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Edward C. Luck, author of ``Mixed Messages: American Politics
and International Organization 1919-1999,'' said that hijacking a
month's agenda ``is sort of abusing what the Security Council
does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of American hubris that leads to a reaction
from other countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats who have taken part in these sessions say that the
mercurial Holbrooke, whatever his motives, has not only brought
some sizzle to the council but has also contributed immeasurably to
its understanding of significant facts of life. Both Helms'
hostility to the United Nations and Africa's unending wars fall in
that category, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Holbrooke's carefully orchestrated meetings and his
nonstop hospitality to influential members of Congress _ several a
week _ may have made the United Nations safe again for American
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, during the last U.S. presidential election, the
United Nations was anathema. Its secretary general, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali was the butt of jokes and lampoons by Republicans on
his unfamiliar foreign name. The Clinton administration quickly
reduced its public involvement in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a new chapter for America's
involvement and engagement in the affairs of the United Nations,''
said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
foreign relations committee. Helms agreed and, after a lavish
dinner with diplomats at the Metropolitan Club in New York on
Friday night, told those around him that he had met extraordinarily
interesting people, had learned a lot and hoped they did too. He
was wearing a blue-and-white U.N. cap.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.N. Association, an independent U.S. support and
research organization, Jeffrey Laurenti said that the last week
shows that ``even the most conservative senators can visit the U.N.
now without fear of being tainted with soft-headedness.'' This
pointed to ``a quiet sea change in how Washington's political class
views the United Nations,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard for any successor to Holbrooke to give the
U.N. this visibility and importance to Washington's movers and
shakers,'' Laurenti, the association's director of policy studies,
said. ``But his remarkable success to date at the United Nations
reflects the very real, if still fragile, American re-engagement
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. John Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said Friday in a meeting with U.N. officials that Helms
and Biden were brave to be there. ``No one in the history of the
Senate ever got elected on supporting the United Nations,'' said
Warner, a Virginia Republican who also urged the United Nations to
make sure it runs its operations in Bosnia and Kosovo well before
plunging into yet more difficult tasks in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke brushed aside Warner's statement as political
posturing. ``For these senators to come to the U.N., that's the
point,'' he said in an interview Saturday. ``They make those
statements later to protect themselves with their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has his critics, however. In particular, diplomats
were puzzled by the absence of a Democrat or an administration
official to rebut Helms at the same Security Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Council members who did not understand the political dynamics of
the event might have been left with a very bleak view of American
attitudes toward the organization, and a sense that foreign policy
is made in the Senate, not the State Department or the White House,
said one diplomat who attended the session.
</P>
<P>
   Biden made an effort to balance the portrayal of American
opinion at a closed-door lunch with diplomats, at which he was
outspoken in his disagreements with Helms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Biden also told Secretary-General Kofi Annan and reporters that
he was not in favor of the benchmarks the Senate placed on payments
of debts to the United Nations, which make demands on the
organization no country has ever tried to impose.
</P>
<P>
   However, he acknowledged that he did not have the votes to do
that _ and then defended his decision to agree to those conditions
in a deal with Helms in order to have any money released.
</P>
<P>
   Biden took issue with Helms' assertion to the council that the
United States would withdraw from the United Nations if the
organization failed to meet its demands. ``It will never happen,''
Biden said. He also attacked what he called the ``nostalgia'' for
the anti-communist Reagan doctrine, which Helms had said did more
for democracy in the world than the United Nations. ``Thank God
it's dead,'' Biden said.

JACKSON WON'T SECOND-GUESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Plenty went wrong in the second half of the Los
Angeles Lakers' Saturday-night loss to the Portland Trail Blazers,
but coach Phil Jackson wasn't in a second-guessing mood Sunday.
Particularly when the subject was Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was in the game for 47 minutes and looked tired and in
effective down the stretch. He also wasn't on the floor for the
crucial possession with 13.6 seconds left and the Lakers down by
two points.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jackson, noted, ``We had an ample opportunity to win that
game.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, but the Lakers wouldn't have needed to win on a
last-gasp effort had they protected a 10-point lead. That lead
disappeared when O'Neal, their best offensive weapon, struggled _ 2
for 8 in the second half, with two rebounds and no trips to the
foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Would Jackson rethink his reliance on O'Neal, who's now played
47 minutes in three of the past four games, with diminishing
returns?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see what that really has to do with anything but
playing,'' Jackson said. ``He got his blocks, he still was active
enough to block shots. He had five blocked shots the second half,
so obviously he still had a lot of energy. But somehow or other
things just weren't going, the ball wasn't bouncing for him. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``(In the third quarter) he had two point-blank shots, the ball
rolled off the basket. That makes a big difference. Some of that is
just bounces. Some of it's the fact that we were in (a defensive)
rotation to try and help ... and he wasn't in position to rebound.
He did look tired at the end of the game, but that's natural. He
should be tired at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said he probably would have removed O'Neal for the
final play even if he hadn't been struggling from the line recently
(14 for 39 in the past four games). ``No, I like what we did,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Without O'Neal or the fouled-out Kobe Bryant on the floor, and
with Glen Rice covered, Derek Fisher took the potential
game-winning shot and threw up an airball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the fact that Derek didn't hit iron,'' Jackson
said. ``We did everything to put ourselves in position to win. Shaq
shooting foul (shots) ... I don't know. Maybe going back to that
again and re-look at it, you're right.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversify: Jackson admitted the Blazers, led by his former
student, Scottie Pippen, used their familiarity with the Lakers'
offense to adroitly defend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things that Portland did to disrupt our
offense the second half. They kept dislocating our players so that
we couldn't make passes in our offense,'' he said. ``Pippen was in
the midst of what we were trying to do a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lakers are still running a simplified version of the
triangle offense, Jackson said they're not becoming predictable
``just not executing sharply enough.''
</P>
<P>
   If teams are learning the Lakers' tendencies over time, they
could be in trouble today at Utah. The Lakers are facing the Jazz
for the third time this season; both the Blazers and Seattle
SuperSonics beat the Lakers in their third meetings last week.

CRAIG CLAIBORNE, 79, FOOD WRITER AND POPULARIZER OF FINE CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.)  (Eds: A shorter version of this story, OBIT-CLAIBORNE-ABRIDGED, is
also being filed.) 
(mk) 
 By BRYAN MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Craig Claiborne, who emerged from the Mississippi
Delta to become the nation's pre-eminent food journalist, and whose
writings coaxed millions of meat-and-potato Americans to the table
of fine cuisine, died Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center. He was 79 and lived in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne joined The New York Times in 1957 and for 29 years
served as both its food editor and, intermittently, its restaurant
critic. During that time, Claiborne, more than any writer of his
day, introduced gastronomically sheltered Americans to the greatest
chefs of France, Italy and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Through his recipes and more than 20 books, many with his
colleague Pierre Franey, he encouraged home cooks to broaden their
culinary horizons. Along the way, he created a widely imitated
system of restaurant criticism that is standard practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's reviews for The Times, which concluded by rating a
restaurant on a four-star scale after repeated visits, were a
striking change for American newspapers, most of which considered
restaurant reviewing a feckless adjunct of the advertising
department.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Claiborne's most notorious gastronomic adventure was his
$4,000 dinner in Paris, in November 1975, the result of a winning
bid on a television fund-raiser. Reports of the 31-course meal for
two built his reputation for audacity and panache but also garnered
widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne retired from The Times in 1986 and continued to write
books, to travel and to lecture. Perhaps his most enduring work is
``The New York Times Cookbook,'' which was published in 1961 and
has sold more than a million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's laconic and diffident manner belied a flamboyant,
even whimsical spirit. He gave extravagant birthday parties for
himself on ocean liners and in restaurants; and he frequently held
the most lavish _ and celebrity-studded _ dinner soirees at his
home in East Hampton. A man of robust passions and, at times,
confounding candor, he wore his tumultuous personal life on his
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was born in the hamlet of Sunflower, Miss., on Sept.
4, 1920. His father's financial setbacks forced the family to move
several times, eventually to the nearby town of Indianola, where
his mother, Kathleen, established a boarding house. It was here
that the young Craig Claiborne became fascinated with the heady
alchemy of cooking. Kathleen Claiborne was described by her son
years later as a born cook, especially adept at the rib-sticking
foods of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   While he grew up to travel the world, Claiborne always clung to
his Southern roots, in conversation, in writing and in recipes. In
1987 he published ``Craig Claiborne's Southern Cooking'' (Times
Books), which celebrated Southern culture through food. To the end
of his life, the aroma of chopped onions, celery, green pepper and
garlic would sweep him back to his mother's kitchen on a powerful
wave of memory.
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``A Feast Made for Laughter'' (Doubleday,
1982), was his most controversial book. In it he dealt with more
difficult aspects of his childhood, describing a boyhood sexual
encounter with his father as well as his lifelong struggle to
escape from the smothering presence of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding against premedical studies at Mississippi State
College, Claiborne went on to the University of Missouri, where he
studied journalism. After graduating in 1942, he joined the Navy as
a communications specialist, later becoming the executive officer
on a submarine chaser.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Claiborne took on a series of jobs in public
relations, first in Chicago and later in New York. He was able to
sample the better restaurants when taking clients and food editors
out to lunch, but his small salary forced him into the kitchen, a
copy of ``Joy of Cooking'' in hand. ``I decided that if I wanted to
eat good food, I'd have to cook it myself,'' he said later. ``The
more I tried, the more hooked I became, and it's never worn off.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an unhappy period for Claiborne. ``I was a psychological
mess,'' he said. ``I only knew that I liked to cook, and I liked to
write.'' In 1949, though he had little money, Claiborne moved to
France, where the epiphany of French cuisine, even on a modest
level, changed his life forever. ``I was consummately happy,'' he
wrote later, recalling a meal of scrambled eggs with tarragon and a
glass of white wine. ``I had never tried such heavenly food.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne re-entered the military for the Korean War, and one
day, sitting alone on a Pacific atoll, dissatisfied with his life,
he came to a decision. ``I thought about some way to combine the
two things I liked most, and the answer that came out _ to be food
editor of The New York Times _ was so ambitious, I didn't let
myself think about it. At that time I only knew a little about a
certain kind of Southern cooking, and had never written a
professional word in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   All that would change. After his discharge, Claiborne entered
the Ecole Hoteliere de la Societe Suisse des Hoteliers, near
Lausanne, Switzerland, where he earned certificates in table and
banquet service and classical French cuisine. He returned to New
York and began his career in food journalism at Gourmet magazine,
where he was hired as a receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he moved into an editor's post.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, The New York Times was looking for a new food editor.
Claiborne applied even though it was widely assumed that the post
would go to a woman, as had been the tradition. The executive
editor, Turner Catledge, a fellow Southerner and alumnus of
Mississippi State, broke the mold and took a chance on a man.
</P>
<P>
   Within several years of taking over the restaurant critic's job,
Claiborne developed a system of reviews that involved visiting a
restaurant at least three times with three or four people. He went
anonymously whenever possible and paid his own checks.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne, with his culinary training, talked about the chef's
cooking in detail, rating a restaurant rigorously on its food,
ambience and service.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a gentlemanly and authoritative style to restaurant
reviewing, never strident, never mean, and in doing so won legions
of loyal followers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the restaurants he appraised in his early years on the
beat were La Caravelle, Lutece, Jack &AMP; Charlie's ``21'' (later the
``21'' Club), Chambord, Quo Vadis, Le Voisin and Le Pavillon.
</P>
<P>
   His eye for detail could make even tough restaurateurs wince. In
a review of Le Pavillon in its later days, for example, he zeroed
in on the red pencil that protruded from the maitre d'hotel's
pocket as evidence of sad decline.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement party for Claiborne upon his departure from The
Times, Andre Soltner, who was the chef and owner of Lutece, which
Claiborne eventually awarded four stars, recalled Claiborne's first
review of the restaurant, in 1961. ``When I saw the paper I was so
happy to get a star, even though I couldn't read English too
well,'' Soltner said. ``Then, one of my customers told me that
Claiborne also gave one star to Chock Full o' Nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   When Claiborne first arrived at The Times, he surveyed the
culinary landscape in Manhattan and found it unimpressive. ``There
were relatively few celebrated (I will not say great) restaurants
in New York or in the United States for that matter,'' he wrote in
his autobiography. When it came to fine dining, he wrote, New York
was a ``hick town.'' Yet, he did eventually find one restaurant
worthy of the term great, Le Pavillon, which was the offspring of
the French restaurant at the 1939 World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Le Pavillon was a starched and sumptuous place on Fifth Avenue,
run by a brilliant martinet named Henri Soule. During an interview
with Soule, Claiborne was taken to the kitchen, where he met the
genial 38-year-old chef, Pierre Franey. The two men struck up an
immediate friendship, bound by a common love for classic French
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Franey quit Le Pavillon in 1960 over a disagreement with Soule,
and after that began accompanying Claiborne on his restaurant
rounds and developing recipes for Claiborne's food columns. Their
collaboration led to seven books and numerous other projects for
The Times, including Franey's 60-Minute Gourmet column. Claiborne
left The Times in 1970 to collaborate with Franey on a food
newsletter. The venture was not a success, and Claiborne returned
to the newspaper in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne worked in the enormous kitchen of his East Hampton
home, frequently with Franey, who died in 1996, developing recipes
for The New York Times Magazine and later for The Living Section.
Such was his influence as a food writer that when, in the late
1970s, Claiborne was advised by his doctor to limit fat and salt in
his diet, the nation followed his progress as if it were a soap
opera. His book ``Craig Claiborne's Gourmet Diet'' (Times Books)
introduced the concepts of low-sodium and low-fat cooking to
millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His many books included ``The New York Times Guide to Dining Out
in New York'' (1965); ``The New York Times International Cook
Book'' (1971); ``The Chinese Cookbook'' (1972), written with
Virginia Lee; and four volumes under the title ``Craig Claiborne's
Favorites From The New York Times.'' The books he wrote with Franey
include ``Classic French Cooking'' (1970); ``Veal Cookery'' (1978);
and ``Craig Claiborne's New York Times Cookbook'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was an avid traveler, and his bylines, from places
ranging from New Orleans to New Delhi, India, carried endless
vicarious treats for readers. Claiborne also was recognized as a
genius at identifying young and unheralded talent. In his columns
he frequently boosted a young chef's career by giving him exposure
in The Times. Among those who benefited from Claiborne's
journalistic perspicacity were French chefs like Paul Bocuse, Roger
Verge, Alain Ducasse, Jean Troigros and Gaston Lenotre, as well as
the Italian cookbook writer Marcella Hazan and the Cajun chef Paul
Prudhomme.
</P>
<P>
   After his restaurant reviewing days, Claiborne became a resolute
and generous friend to those he loved and admired in the world of
gastronomy. Prudhomme recalled last week a conversation he had with
Claiborne in the late 1970s, before Cajun cooking became all the
rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I planned to renovate my restaurant,''
Prudhomme said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really sure, then Craig said to me, `If you don't
have the money I'll lend it to you!'''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne regularly invited chefs to his home kitchen for
interviews and cooking demonstrations _ usually followed by a
festive dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the age of computers and modems, he preferred to stand
at his typewriter, peering through half glasses, while pecking out
notes and peppering the cooks with questions. In his will,
Claiborne left the majority of his estate, including his library
and papers, to the Culinary Institute of America.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by several nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   One of Claiborne's legacies as a journalist is how he
demystified for his readers the world of haute cuisine, and even
made it look like fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent my first five years in this country at those cooking
sessions,'' recalled Jacques Pepin, the chef and cookbook author.
``Craig broke down the formality of cooking, like we had in France,
and in the process made it accessible to all.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what qualities made a good food critic, Claiborne
said, ``the ability to write and a conversance with food.'' Both,
he said, were instinctive. ``I think you are born with a seed for
making a sentence that reads well, as well as one for learning to
be discriminating where food is concerned.'' Claiborne was
confident that he possessed both. But he was also afflicted by
feelings of inadequacy and racked by self-doubt, and the burden of
constant reviewing weighed heavily on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many's the night I've lain in bed worrying about the stellar
worth of one restaurant or another,'' he wrote, ``about whether I
was justified in referring to a chef's Mornay sauce as pure
mucilage, or whether that unaccustomed flavor in the hollandaise
sauce was actually basil or rosemary as I had judged it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   His newspaper readers never sensed the turmoil within. In print,
Claiborne communicated with ease, assurance and style. ``All my
life I'd been miserable and anxious and frightened,'' he once told
an interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have everything. All I want is for it to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to Claiborne's notorious dinner in Paris began one
evening in 1975 when he was at home watching an auction to raise
money for Channel 13, the PBS station in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prizes was dinner for two, anywhere in the world and
sky's-the-limit on expenses, sponsored by American Express.
Claiborne bid $300, not expecting to win. To his surprise, the
dinner was his. He immediately called Franey, and the two boarded a
plane to Paris for a scouting expedition.
</P>
<P>
   They chose a restaurant called Chez Denis, where the chef
assured them that he could produce an extraordinary 31-course menu.
A few months later Claiborne and Franey returned to the restaurant
and sat down to a five-hour, 31-course dinner, a cascade of Beluga
caviar, foie gras, ortolans and truffles, parfait of sweetbreads,
chaud-froid of woodcock, and a dish made from hundreds of
sots-l'y-laisse, the ``oysters'' found in chickens just above the
thigh bone.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wines served were a 1918 Chateau Latour, a 1928
Chateau Latour and an 1835 Madeira.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his autobiography, Claiborne maintained that the
dinner was not perfect in all respects. The lobster in the lobster
gratin was chewy and the oysters arrived lukewarm. ``The
presentation of the dishes, particularly the cold dishes, such as
the sweetbread parfait and the quail mousse tart, was mundane,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the meal were printed on the front page of The New
York Times. Reader response was immediate and angry. Nearly a
thousand letters poured in, most of them expressing outrage that
anyone could spend thousands of dollars on dinner when people all
over the world faced starvation. Anti-Claiborne sentiment ran 4-1.
The Vatican pronounced the stunt ``scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   As testament to Claiborne's legendary stamina, when the two left
the restaurant Franey turned to his partner and asked him to sum up
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what was so amazing about that meal?'' Claiborne
replied. ``I don't really feel that stuffed.''

CRAIG CLAIBORNE, 79, FOOD WRITER AND POPULARIZER OF FINE CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.)  (A long version of this story, OBIT-CLAIBORNE, has also been
filed.) 
(mk) 
 By BRYAN MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Craig Claiborne, who emerged from the Mississippi
Delta to become the nation's pre-eminent food journalist, and whose
writings coaxed millions of meat-and-potato Americans to the table
of fine cuisine, died Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center. He was 79 and lived in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne joined The New York Times in 1957 and for 29 years
served as both its food editor and, intermittently, its restaurant
critic. During that time, Claiborne, more than any writer of his
day, introduced gastronomically sheltered Americans to the greatest
chefs of France, Italy and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Through his recipes and more than 20 books, many with his
colleague Pierre Franey, he encouraged home cooks to broaden their
culinary horizons. Along the way, he created a widely imitated
system of restaurant criticism that is standard practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's reviews for The Times, which concluded by rating a
restaurant on a four-star scale after repeated visits, were a
striking change for American newspapers, most of which considered
restaurant reviewing a feckless adjunct of the advertising
department.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Claiborne's most notorious gastronomic adventure was his
$4,000 dinner in Paris, in November 1975, the result of a winning
bid on a television fund-raiser. Reports of the 31-course meal for
two built his reputation for audacity and panache but also garnered
widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne retired from The Times in 1986 and continued to write
books, to travel and to lecture. Perhaps his most enduring work is
``The New York Times Cookbook,'' which was published in 1961 and
has sold more than a million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was born in the hamlet of Sunflower, Miss., on Sept.
4, 1920. His father's financial setbacks forced the family to move
several times, eventually to the nearby town of Indianola, where
his mother, Kathleen, established a boarding house. It was here
that the young Craig Claiborne became fascinated with the heady
alchemy of cooking. Kathleen Claiborne was described by her son
years later as a born cook, especially adept at the rib-sticking
foods of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   While he grew up to travel the world, Claiborne always clung to
his Southern roots, in conversation, in writing and in recipes. In
1987 he published ``Craig Claiborne's Southern Cooking'' (Times
Books), which celebrated Southern culture through food. To the end
of his life, the aroma of chopped onions, celery, green pepper and
garlic would sweep him back to his mother's kitchen on a powerful
wave of memory.
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``A Feast Made for Laughter'' (Doubleday,
1982), was his most controversial book. In it he dealt with more
difficult aspects of his childhood, describing a boyhood sexual
encounter with his father as well as his lifelong struggle to
escape from the smothering presence of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding against premedical studies at Mississippi State
College, Claiborne went on to the University of Missouri, where he
studied journalism. After graduating in 1942, he joined the Navy as
a communications specialist, later becoming the executive officer
on a submarine chaser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, though he had little money, Claiborne moved to France,
where the epiphany of French cuisine, even on a modest level,
changed his life forever. ``I was consummately happy,'' he wrote
later, recalling a meal of scrambled eggs with tarragon and a glass
of white wine. ``I had never tried such heavenly food.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne re-entered the military for the Korean War, and one
day, sitting alone on a Pacific atoll, dissatisfied with his life,
he came to a decision. ``I thought about some way to combine the
two things I liked most, and the answer that came out _ to be food
editor of The New York Times _ was so ambitious, I didn't let
myself think about it. At that time I only knew a little about a
certain kind of Southern cooking, and had never written a
professional word in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   All that would change. After his discharge, Claiborne entered
the Ecole Hoteliere de la Societe Suisse des Hoteliers, near
Lausanne, Switzerland, where he earned certificates in table and
banquet service and classical French cuisine. He returned to New
York and began his career in food journalism at Gourmet magazine,
where he was hired as a receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he moved into an editor's post.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, The New York Times was looking for a new food editor.
Claiborne applied even though it was widely assumed that the post
would go to a woman, as had been the tradition. The executive
editor, Turner Catledge, a fellow Southerner and alumnus of
Mississippi State, broke the mold and took a chance on a man.
</P>
<P>
   Within several years of taking over the restaurant critic's job,
Claiborne developed a system of reviews that involved visiting a
restaurant at least three times with three or four people. He went
anonymously whenever possible and paid his own checks.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne, with his culinary training, talked about the chef's
cooking in detail, rating a restaurant rigorously on its food,
ambience and service.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a gentlemanly and authoritative style to restaurant
reviewing, never strident, never mean, and in doing so won legions
of loyal followers.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with Henri Soule, who ran the restaurant Le
Pavillon on Fifth Avenue, Claiborne was taken to the kitchen, where
he met the genial 38-year-old chef, Pierre Franey. The two men
struck up an immediate friendship, bound by a common love for
classic French cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Franey quit Le Pavillon in 1960 over a disagreement with Soule,
and after that began accompanying Claiborne on his restaurant
rounds and developing recipes for Claiborne's food columns. Their
collaboration led to seven books and numerous other projects for
The Times, including Franey's 60-Minute Gourmet column. Claiborne
left The Times in 1970 to collaborate with Franey on a food
newsletter. The venture was not a success, and Claiborne returned
to the newspaper in 1974. Franey died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborn's many books included ``The New York Times Guide to
Dining Out in New York'' (1965); ``The New York Times International
Cook Book'' (1971); ``The Chinese Cookbook'' (1972), written with
Virginia Lee, and four volumes under the title ``Craig Claiborne's
Favorites From The New York Times.'' The books he wrote with Franey
include ``Classic French Cooking'' (1970); ``Veal Cookery'' (1978),
and ``Craig Claiborne's New York Times Cookbook'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   In his will, Claiborne left the majority of his estate,
including his library and papers, to the Culinary Institute of
America.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by several nieces and nephews.

 McCAIN ACCEPTS LABEL OF `LIBERAL'  
(rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Is Sen. John McCain a ``liberal in Republican
clothing?''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire for a final 10-day push to the nation's first
primary, McCain, an Arizona Republican, was confronted with that
question at one of the day's three town hall meetings. It echoed
the charges of some of his Republican rivals who have compared him
to Vice President Al Gore or suggested that his modest tax cut plan
is one that President Clinton could favor.
</P>
<P>
   At first McCain pointed to his bedrock conservative voting
record across 17 years in Congress, saying votes can be ``a better
barometer than someone's rhetoric.'' But soon he was making an
impassioned plea for his party to consider the plight of the poor
and the weak and refusing to disavow a political label that even
Democrats flee from.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called himself a disciple not just of Ronald Reagan and
Theodore Roosevelt, but Abraham Lincoln too. ``That means we do
care about those in our society who can't care for themselves,'' he
told a crowd packed into a school here. ``We do care about the
elderly. We do care about the poor. We do care about those
Americans with disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the gap between the haves and the have nots in
society ``is not healthy for America'' and described the Republican
Party as an ``inclusive party'' that recognizes anyone who shares a
philosophy of less government, less regulation, lower taxes, and
caring for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you quote call me a liberal because of those
positions that I have, than I would gladly accept that label,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had the state of New Hampshire to himself as the other
presidential contenders campaigned in Iowa, where the precinct
caucuses take place on Monday. The senator long ago wrote off Iowa
to focus on New Hampshire.

UNIVERSITY PROGRAM TAKES ENTERTAINMENT SERIOUSLY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here in the city where ``entertainment'' means
everything from a televised freeway chase to a multimillion-dollar
movie, the University of Southern California is embarking on an
ambitious interdisciplinary effort to study entertainment as a
defining concept of 21st-century life, in fields from law to
architecture, from business to journalism, with the dual goal of
prompting intellectual debate and training the next generation of
media moguls.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, believed to be the first of its kind, takes a
page from earlier multidepartmental academic programs, like
environmental studies, American studies and the program in history
and literature at Harvard. It offers as its organizing thesis
nothing less than the assertion that today, in every advanced
industrial economy on earth, the largest and most important
component of cultural content is entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say their ultimate goal is to coordinate
some 100 existing courses and add a range of new ones to examine
the impact on the culture of everything from theme parks and
casinos to music videos and attention-grabbing graphics in
television news.
</P>
<P>
   The program is the brainchild of Martin Kaplan, associate dean
of the Annenberg School for Communication at USC, which houses the
university's courses in journalism and communication.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, a former chief speechwriter for Vice President Walter
Mondale and a former studio executive and screenwriter at Disney,
describes the program as an effort to bring the intellectual rigor
long applied to topics like politics, education and high culture to
a study of the driving engine of mass culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of those areas is supposed to have standards and
hierarchies and epistemologies that stand up to the world, so
journalism, for example, depends in part on understanding what it
is not,'' said Kaplan, whose varied background includes the
presidency of The Harvard Lampoon when he was an undergraduate, a
Ph.D. from Stanford in modern thought and literature, and a
screenwriting credit for the Eddie Murphy comedy ``The
Distinguished Gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment's only value is do I like it, am I bored, does
it keep my attention?'' Kaplan said. ``When you apply that to these
other realms, very interesting distortions begin to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort got under way quietly with an undergraduate survey
course last fall that used texts like Neal Gabler's ``Life the
Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality.'' It is now being
greatly expanded with a $5 million gift from the television
producer Norman Lear, creator of cultural touchstones like ``All in
the Family,'' to start the Norman Lear Center at the Annenberg
School.
</P>
<P>
   The center will sponsor seminars, conferences and scholarly
writing on topics from children and media to the effects of
celebrity on politics to the ownership of intellectual property and
imagery in a digital age, when presidents can be inserted into
fictional films and dead actors can be revived for cameos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an idea whose time has come,'' said Kevin Starr,
a university professor at USC and the author of an acclaimed series
of social histories of California, who is on the advisory panel for
the new program. ``This is an international business that
profoundly affects politics, family life, intellectual life and
every area of American life. The university has got to be looking
at it the way the university looks at other phenomena. There's no
one discipline that can contain it, and Los Angeles is ground zero
for this business.''
</P>
<P>
   To Lear, who has used his fortune to support scores of
philanthropic causes from environmental protection to civil
liberties, the effort ``couldn't be more timely.'' The power of the
media broadly defined is now such, he said in an interview, ``that
the heads of major corporations will have more impact on the values
of people worldwide than the heads of governments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a time to be thinking about how we make some intelligent
diagnosis,'' Lear added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Neil Postman, chairman of the department of culture and
communication at New York University and the author of such
critical studies of the media as ``Amusing Ourselves to Death:
Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,'' said the efforts of
the Lear Center struck him as timely and potentially valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of taking what people call the entertainment culture
as a focus of study, including historical perspective, is not a bad
idea,'' Postman said. ``It's always dangerous because of the
temptation _ especially in California, I imagine _ to just get a
lot of movie stars and directors and producers to come and tell you
how wonderful it all is. But if it's done from a critical point of
view, to examine what is wrong and right with the entertainment
culture and what problems it creates, then I think it's a good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Cowan, the dean of the Annenberg School, said the goal
was to bring both dispassionate criticism and firsthand knowledge
to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kaplan, Cowan is something of a polymath. A Yale-trained
lawyer who spent over 20 years teaching communications at the
University of California at Los Angeles, Cowan is the son of Louis
G. Cowan, who created the game show ``The $64,000 Question'' and
also served as president of the CBS television network and director
of the Voice of America, a job that Cowan himself held decades
later under President Clinton before coming to Annenberg three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Marty and I may bring to this, hopefully, is an
understanding of the industry, which makes us not just critics,''
Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   And since the new program aims in part to make the next
generation of agents, entertainment lawyers and moguls think
critically about their own business, he added, ``The vocational and
intellectual fit together very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, Cowan will teach one of the eight new
undergraduate courses planned for the program, ``Fact and Fiction:
From Journalism to the Docudrama,'' a study of the ``historical,
legal and ethical limits to the misrepresentations of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other elements of the program is a planned two-year
faculty seminar, ``Celebrity, Politics and the Public Sphere.'' The
seminar will be led by Leo Braudy, an English professor and author
of ``The Frenzy of Renown,'' an acclaimed study of fame through the
ages, and Steven J. Ross, a historian and author of ``Working-Class
Hollywood: Silent Film and the Shaping of Class in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do in the fame book is to avoid the horrible
alternatives of throwing up your hands and saying the culture's
going down the tubes, or indulging in the superficiality of it all,
but instead being able to stand back and see what serious issues
are intertwined with what seem to be superficial issues,'' Braudy
said. He added that he hoped the faculty seminar could help break
down an academic culture that tends by its nature to be
``discipline-bound and isolating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way in which the country itself appeared on the
stage of world history as this kind of ingenue country, this
Cinderella nation, and immediately tried to make a name for
itself,'' he added. ``That's very interwoven in American history,
and knowing that history lets you see what's going on in the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional expert at the USC law
school, will lead a conference next year on how technology has
affected intellectual property rights, using case studies of real
situations to examine the issue with experts including producers,
writers and academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this so exciting is that it is interdisciplinary,''
Chemerinsky said. ``It's a chance to deal with a cutting-edge legal
issue, and bring to bear all the different perspectives on it,
within the university community and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said his goal was to examine such topics from every
angle, eventually producing everything from Congressional testimony
to discussions on the Lear Center's new Web site,
entertainment.usc.edu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment industry could profit from more leaders who
grasp its impact on society,'' a glossy brochure for the program
says, adding, ``The society could benefit from more conscience, and
more critical self-consciousness, in the creative process.''

 &HT;    Titans solve Jaguars a third, final time
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ For three years, the Tennessee Titans were
the team nobody wanted. Now, they might just be destiny's team.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, a seven-point underdog, used a quick 16-point
barrage in the third quarter to stun the Jaguars 33-14 in the AFC
Championship game Sunday at Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium. The
victory sends the Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV in the Georgia Dome
next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, we are a team of destiny,'' Tennessee
strong safety Blaine Bishop said. ``Now, the whole world knows
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is only the sixth wild-card team to advance to the
Super Bowl since the NFL playoffs were expanded in 1978. It is the
team's first trip to the Super Bowl in the 40-year history of the
franchise and follows three consecutive 8-8 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a step behind Jacksonville all year,'' Tennessee coach
Jeff Fisher said. ``We just couldn't catch them. When people said,
`There's no way that you're going to win three times against the
same team,' we never batted an eye. When people said the Jaguars
were indeed looking forward to playing us again, nobody batted an
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also helped erase one of the most forgettable
episodes in NFL history, when the Oilers/Titans played before
half-empty stadiums and apathetic crowds in Houston, Memphis and
Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' said owner Bud Adams, who founded the
franchise in Houston in 1960. ``I'm getting pretty old. I didn't
want to go to the Super Bowl in a wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was a huge disappointment for Jacksonville, which had
the league's best regular-record (14-2) and seemed invincible in a
62-7 blowout of the Dolphins a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   All three of Jacksonville's losses this season were to the
Titans. ``No way to explain it,'' Jaguars running back Fred Taylor
said. ``It just happened.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars offensive tackle Leon Searcy said: ``It doesn't even
seem like it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the Titans' wild ride through the postseason.
Playing in its first season in Adelphia Coliseum, Tennessee needed
an improbable kickoff return for a touchdown _ dubbed the
``Immaculate Deception'' _ to beat Buffalo 22-16 in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   In the divisional playoffs, the Titans upset No. 2 seed
Indianapolis 19-16. The Titans were again seven-point underdogs
playing Jacksonville, the top seed in the AFC. But Tennessee
matched the Jaguars punch for punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jaguars thought they were going to blow us out,'' Titans
defensive tackle Josh Evans said. ``But this was like a heavyweight
fight. We kept trading punches, but they didn't think ours were
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars threw the first blow. On the Jaguars' opening drive,
quarterback Mark Brunell hit tight end Kyle Brady with a 7-yard
touchdown pass with 11:20 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee answered on its ensuing possession. After an
interception was nullified by pass interference, receiver Yancey
Thigpen scored on a 9-yard catch to tie the score at 7 with 9:51
left in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville took a 14-7 lead in the second quarter on James
Stewart's 33-yard touchdown run with 4:36 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Titans, after trailing 14-10 at halftime, took over with
a 16-point scoring outburst in about four minutes of the third
quarter. Quarterback Steve McNair scored on a 9-yard run to take a
17-14 lead with 9:24 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   After Tennessee tight end Frank Wycheck lost a fumble at the
Jaguars' 1, Brunell was sacked in the end zone for a safety and a
19-14 Titans lead about four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing free kick, Titans receiver Derrick Mason fielded
Bryan Barker's punt and ran 80 yards for a touchdown and a 26-14
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed the momentum when we got the safety and then the
return,'' Wycheck said. ``That was a breath of fresh air, new life
into our team. We knew we had them on the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who battled turf toe on his left foot all week,
delivered the knockout blow in the fourth quarter. Facing
third-and-1, McNair broke loose for a 47-yard run to the Jaguars'
1. He scored on the next play for a 33-14 lead with 6:59 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of guys on this team that were told their entire
lives that they'd never play in the NFL,'' Evans said. ``But we're
a blue-collar team. Somebody had to go down and, fortunately, we
were the last ones standing.''

IN IOWA, THE NEWS MEDIA ARE EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Over coffee at the Waveland Diner on Sunday,
the NBC anchor Tom Brokaw was telling a group of Iowans that by his
calculation, if the reporters and editors covering the caucuses
were voting in them, they would make up 1 percent of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   This did not faze Steve Kopf, a supporter of Steve Forbes who
was one of several local people being interviewed by Brokaw. ``The
media,'' Kopf argued, ``should pay more attention to Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw looked stricken. ``I don't think that's possible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It does seem, at times, that if one more journalist were to set
foot here, Iowa would collapse under the weight of ink and wiring.
For if the caucuses, the inaugural election-year test of the
candidates for president, are normally an event of immense interest
for the news media, they are being even more intensively
scrutinized, analyzed and reported on this year than ever before,
especially by the electronic press.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the 24-hour cable news channels _ two of
which, Fox News Channel and MSNBC, had not even been launched by
this time four years ago _ the rise of political coverage on the
Web and contested races in both parties, the caucuses are destined
to be one of the most plugged-into political events the Midwest has
ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to be here now than ever before,'' said David
Yepsen, the chief political writer for The Des Moines Register, who
has been covering politics here for 26 years. ``Satellite time is
cheaper. The gear is cheaper.'' Several newscasts on the Web are
starting this week, he added, ``And Fox and MSNBC didn't exist last
time,'' said Yepsen. ``There's more media altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is enough public affairs programming being beamed
out of Des Moines this week to send the most rabid political addict
into a kind of sugar shock. CNN, the granddaddy of all-news on
cable, has 200 staff members here working on a total of eight
separate talk shows, political shows, legal shows and newscasts.
``Our level of coverage is not driven by the level of viewer
interest,'' said Bernard Shaw, the CNN anchor and the host with
Judy Woodruff of the popular ``Inside Politics'' show. ``This is a
compelling story because it is the first event in a yearlong drive
to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The network Sunday talk shows all originated from Des Moines
this weekend. C-SPAN took out a full-page advertisement in the
Register on Friday, trumpeting its ``All politics all weekend''
coverage, including live transmissions from caucuses in towns with
names like Mingo. The Fox News Channel secured the State Capitol
rotunda and chambers of the state legislature as the sets for the
variety of political talk and news shows it is broadcasting all
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining the embodiment of government for the visuals was
viewed by Fox as a coup. ``We first came here in September,'' said
Marty Ryan, executive producer for Fox News. ``We wanted a location
that said `Iowa.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fox also wanted a talking head who spoke Iowan. So they put
Yepsen under contract. On Saturday, he was a guest on ``The Beltway
Boys,'' one of the seemingly countless cable gabfests chewing on
Iowa politics. It is hosted by Morton Kondracke and Fred Barnes,
formerly panel members on ``The McLaughlin Group.'' The show was
taped in the ornate rotunda, with the Boys' high-tech desk _ its
circular Lucite lights made it look like a piece of office
furniture from ``The Jetsons'' _ added to the historic
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and Kondracke have day jobs as editors, respectively, at
two Washington-centric publications, the Weekly Standard and Roll
Call. On cable, they compete weekly for the loyalty of a rather
small subset of the American viewing public, a pool Barnes defines
as ``the 10 million who are political junkies, who are interested
in public affairs.'' Their 18-month-old show, each installment of
which is rerun several times on the channel, has a viewership in
the hundreds of thousands, as opposed to millions, said a
spokeswoman for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more exciting than golf,'' Barnes maintained, adding
that more and more, political discourse is moving from the networks
to cable. Many in the cable news business cite as a watershed event
the decision by Ted Koppel and ``Nightline'' four years ago to
depart the Republican National Convention before it ended.
``Network television once served them, and now it's C-SPAN and Fox
and MSNBC,'' Kondracke said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is network stars like Brokaw who generate the most
buzz. After he finished a roundtable interview with a group of
voters in the diner, for broadcast on Sunday night, the congenial
anchor autographed copies of his best-seller, ``The Greatest
Generation,'' for the interviewees and one for Nancy Holmes, a Des
Moines high school teacher who was waiting with her own copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokaw is a hero of mine,'' said Ms. Holmes, who majored in
journalism in college. ``I'd rather meet Brokaw than any of the
candidates _ except maybe Bradley.''

BRADLEY GATHERS ENDORSEMENTS FROM 5 PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Mass., N.H., Calif.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley spent the final
day before the Iowa caucuses at three college campuses, trying to
energize the students and professors he hopes will help power his
insurgent candidacy to a strong finish in the first vote of the
presidential primary season.
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell College in Mount Vernon, more than 400 people crowded
into a small room to hear Bradley's call to reduce poverty, bring
health care to all Americans and help people ``find meaning in life
that is deeper than material things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not lead unabashedly from your ideals in this country so
you can give people a North Star to guide by,'' said Bradley, who
was loose and animated.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bradley addressed enthusiastic crowds at the University
of Iowa in Iowa City and Drake University in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling through one of the most difficult weeks of the
campaign, Bradley's aides were almost triumphant Sunday in
announcing endorsements from five newspapers: the Des Moines
Register and Fort Dodge Messenger in Iowa, the Nashua Telegraph and
Valley News in New Hampshire, and the Lawrence Eagle Tribune in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anna Eshoo of Palo Alto, Calif., on Sunday became the 11th
member of Congress to endorse Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley took four hours off in the middle of the day to attend a
memorial service for John Crystal, the honorary chairman of his
campaign, who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on ABC's Face the Nation Sunday morning,
Bradley articulated a message his aides said he plans to repeat
often in the coming week: that he would be better at managing the
nation's prosperity than Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the
Democratic nomination, because of his ability to predict changes in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC, Bradley also rejected suggestions that he might drop out
of the race if he loses in both Iowa, as is expected, and New
Hampshire, where the race is tight. ``I hope that we're going to
have major wins down the road, and we'll be able to move on to the
convention, no question about that,'' he said.

A DAY OF POLITICAL THEATER FOR FORBES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Sunday did not start out particularly well for
Steve Forbes. The Des Moines Register carried its endorsement of
George W. Bush and published a recent poll showing that Forbes, who
has spent more than $25 million on his current presidential bid,
has not budged from the 20 percent standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   That poll still has a large number of undecided voters, and the
Forbes campaign has long said that they must get a healthy share of
the uncommitted vote. A strong showing in Iowa is vital for Forbes
to propel his long-shot bid as he campaigns in New Hampshire, where
he is a distant third, behind Bush and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance before around 170 people at Iowa State
University here, Forbes reiterated his opposition to abortion and
called again for lower taxes _ when he said ``we are overtaxed in
this country,'' the crowd roared back a hearty ``yes, yes'' and
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a day of high political theater. At a press
conference following his appearance, Forbes accused the Bush
campaign of calling Forbes supporters and, when they say they are
supporting Forbes, their phone call gets patched into a
``pro-abortion group that is tacitly supporting Bush and they do a
job on me,'' said Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes identified that group as the Republican Leadership
Council, an independent liberal Republican group. ``The RLC is
financed by Bush people and they've attacked me before,'' said
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore Forbes' anti-abortion stand, he is running graphic
anti-abortion television ads, featuring a fetus shown in a
sonogram, with the heavy sound of a beating heart. A woman's voice
says that she doesn't understand that if the killing of animals is
illegal, why the same shouldn't be true for babies.

POLL SHOWS GORE'S LEAD OVER BRADLEY WIDENING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Iowa _ With a new poll showing his lead growing over
former Sen. Bill Bradley, Vice President Al Gore Sunday went after
another opponent _ complacency.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in The Des Moines Register Sunday showed Gore's lead over
Bradley widening to 28 points from 21 points two weeks ago. Gore
was ahead 56 percent to 28 percent, with about 10 percent of likely
caucusgoers undecided.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore raced across central and eastern Iowa Sunday by bus and
airplane, he pleaded with audiences to turn out for him in this
state's caucuses on Monday. He canvassed door to door in a
neighborhood in Des Moines. He spent hours on his bus telephoning
precinct captains to urge them to ferry voters to the caucuses. And
he attended a training session for precinct workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please do not believe the polls,'' he implored about 150
campaign workers Sunday morning at a meeting at Rastrelli's
Restaurant in Clinton. ``Don't let anyone foster the slightest hint
of complacency or overconfidence, because the only decision that
matters is the one that will come out of the caucus itself, the one
in your precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   In the only shadow over the Gore campaign, The Des Moines
Register, the biggest and most influential newspaper in Iowa,
endorsed Bradley Sunday. Its editorial said that Gore ``is sharp on
the issues and can recite the details of just about every
government program'' and that he ``campaigns with an intensity that
borders on excess.''
</P>
<P>
   But, it said, Bradley ``has the better appreciation of the
possibilities'' for overcoming the partisanship in Washington and
has ``the right kind of leadership to realize them.''

HE HAS A REID ON TRINIDAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Reid is hesitant to say exactly what he
learned about Felix Trinidad by watching the Trinidad-Oscar De La
Hoya bout. He just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot. I'm just not going to tell you,'' he said,
laughing, at a news conference to promote his bout against Trinidad
on March 3 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after more prodding, he spoke generally about his
impressions of Trinidad's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked a little slow,'' he said, trying not to be
inflammatory. ``... After watching that fight, yes, I'm very
confident because Oscar De La Hoya ... he exposed him.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Reid is biased. He has to defend his WBA junior middleweight
championship against Trinidad in the most compelling matchup (with
Fernando Vargas-Ike Quartey) scheduled this year. He's supposed to
say that his opponent is vulnerable and he will take advantage of
it.
</P>
<P>
   He just happens to be right in this case. Trinidad was exposed,
at least to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   Sound ridiculous? Tell that to the bettors.
</P>
<P>
   The Reid-Trinidad odds opened at roughly 3-1 for Trinidad on
Wednesday. However, that dropped immediately to 2-1 because heavy
early betting was on Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, such a thing seems strange in a sense. Big, bad Trinidad,
the pride of Puerto Rico, has been welterweight champ since he
knocked out Maurice Blocker to win the IBF title in 1993. He's had
15 title defenses and beat De La Hoya in September to add the WBC
version.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad would seem to be seasoned: He's 36-0 with 30 knockouts.
And, generally, his performances have been impressive: He has
dominated most opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Reid? The only American to win a gold medal in the 1996 Olympics
would seem a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   However, a few things just don't seem right on Trinidad's side
of the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   One, aside from De La Hoya, his most significant opponents have
been Oba Carr and an aging, shell-of-himself Pernell Whitaker. It
remains difficult to gauge Trinidad because of mediocre
competition.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, there's that darned De La Hoya fight.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, who struts around as if he's Sugar Ray Robinson,
didn't win as much as De La Hoya lost. The Tarnished Boy, thinking
he'd won the fight, ran the final three rounds and Trinidad
narrowly won on points.
</P>
<P>
   We saw what we saw _ a seemingly ordinary, frustrated boxer who
couldn't touch De La Hoya for three quarters of a fight. Most
conspicuously, Trindad looked painfully slow, which was shocking in
light of his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I have any advantages except my speed,''
Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, is picking Reid to beat Trinidad going too far?
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Reid a babe in terms of experience, he hasn't looked
particularly impressive. He beat a marginal champion in Laurent
Boudouani to win his title and outpointed Kevin Kelly and Keith
Mullings in his two defenses. Not exactly a glorious run to the
top.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he'll win on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   He's bigger, stronger and faster than Trinidad. Simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad will be fighting at 154 pounds for only the second time
in his career. He stopped Troy Waters in 1997 at 153 pounds, which
he says gives him confidence that he can handle himself at junior
welterweight.
</P>
<P>
   However, his knees were buckled a few times when De La Hoya hit
him. What's going to happen when a solid 154-pounder with a good
punch lands a big right on his suspect chin? It'll be interesting
to find out.
</P>
<P>
   OK, no one will be surprised if Trinidad wins. He has had twice
as many fights as Reid. And there's Reid's droopy eyelid, which has
caused him problems in his past.
</P>
<P>
   It might turn out that Trinidad's ability _ which he has yet to
display against an elite fighter _ will compensate for Reid's
advantages. And, after all, Trinidad is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In light of evidence, the underdog is simply the better choice
in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won a gold medal, he won a championship,'' Trinidad said
through an interpreter. ``He must be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too good for Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad-De La Hoya: Trinidad is tired of questions about
passing up $20 million to fight De La Hoya for about $5 million to
face Reid, the result of failed negotiations between his promoter,
Don King, and De La Hoya's, Bob Arum.
</P>
<P>
   His response: ``Ask De La Hoya why he passed up $20 million to
fight me (for a smaller payday when he faces Derrell Coley on Feb.
26)?
</P>
<P>
   ``. .. People have to understand. I was willing to fight one
more time at welterweight. !ital!He didn't want it. Now I'm not
going to worry about it. I'm focusing on Reid.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum has said he will try to make a second De La Hoya-Trinidad
fight in June, presumably if Trinidad will come back down to 147
pounds. Trinidad believes De La Hoya and Co. purposely delayed the
fight because they know Trinidad won't return to 147.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I think? I think he's afraid of me,'' Trinidad
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still around: Julio Cesar Chavez, 37, is scheduled to fight on
the Reid-Trinidad undercard. Organizers have yet to sign an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, King put the popular Chavez on the card to bolster
pay-per-view sales because the card is on Friday and he's competing
against a March 4 card featuring WBA bantamweight champ Paulie
Ayala against Jimmy Bredahl.
</P>
<P>
   If Chavez wins, he's expected to face WBC junior welterweight
champ Kostya Tszyu next in what could be Chavez's final title
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley-De La Hoya? If they can't make Trinidad-De La Hoya, Shane
Mosley Might face De La Hoya in June at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley made that prospect even more interesting with his third-
round knockout of Willy Wise on Saturday. There's no doubt that
Mosley is a legitimate welterweight.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right: Mike Tyson, who faces Julius Francis on Saturday in
Manchester, England, said he would've beaten both Evander Holyfield
and Lennox Lewis in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   He believes his stints in prison had a devastating effect on his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't been in trouble and been off so many times, you
wouldn't have heard of those guys. I would have gutted them like
fish,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom inside the boxing world is that Holyfield
has had Tyson's number since they were amateurs and the style and
courage to beat him consistently. And remember: Holyfield wasn't
exactly in !ital!his prime when he beat the you know what out of
Tyson in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know how Tyson might've done against Lewis in his
prime. However, we do know that Lewis would've towered over Tyson
and outweighed him by about 30 pounds. With that advantage and
Lewis' solid skills, he certainly wouldn't have been ``gutted.''

   Holyfield is launching Real Deal Records to provide

announced by Trans World Entertainment, which will be Real Deal's

<P>
   KHANKALA, Russia _ Sunday's flag-raising ceremony in northwest
Grozny was supposed to be a made-for-television event that would
illustrate the progress Russian forces have made in taking back the
tattered ruins that are the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   But when a group of reporters and photographers arrived at the
outskirts of the city, they were abruptly turned away. Even the
Russian-occupied areas of Grozny were filled with rebel snipers, a
military press officer explained.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian forces began their latest assault on Grozny early
last week, they boasted that they would make short work of the
militants in the city. But the Russian blitz has begun to stall.
</P>
<P>
   Russian gains are measured in yards. The Russian military's most
important accomplishment Sunday was not the seizure of a new
building or compound, but the recovery of the body of Maj. Gen.
Mikhail Malofeyev, one of the commanders of the Grozny operation,
who vanished in the fighting on Tuesday. Another commander, of the
Interior Ministry troops who have been doing the main fighting in
the streets of Grozny, has been replaced. Senior Russian officers
have voiced fears that they have become mired into a war of
attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many units which I know in the defense and interior forces are
exhausted,'' Lt. Gen. Arkady Baskayev, a senior Interior Ministry
commander in the Moscow region, told a Russian radio station
Sunday. ``They must be supported by new forces, by new equipment,
by new arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying on the eastern outskirts of Grozny, Khankala is a major
base for the Russian assault on Grozny. It is an unsightly panorama
of rusty railroad cars, a military airstrip and makeshift command
posts, erected out of concrete piles and camouflage nets. Russian
artillery here send 122 mm shells flying toward the city, and
attack helicopters hover overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Staropromyslovsky district of Grozny is just a short
helicopter ride away. The district extends like a finger toward the
northwest. It was the first Grozny district the Russians attacked
when they began their assault on Grozny on Dec. 25, and they claim
to have had it under control since late December. Russian forces
even established a local militia office there in the beginning of
January, as they sought to bring the situation back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to raise Russia's tricolor in Staropromyslovsky was
intended as a symbolic affirmation of Russian progress. It came
after a difficult week for the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   First, Malofeyev disappeared, with the rebels declaring that he
had been kidnapped. But Sunday, Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, the
deputy commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, said that
the general's body had been recovered in a no-man's land and that
Russian artillery had been used to prevent the rebels from seizing
it.
</P>
<P>
   Territory that the Russians had previously claimed to seize has
also become the scene of bitter fighting. Russian officers boasted
that they controlled Minutka Square in central Grozny several days
ago, only to acknowledge Sunday that it was still the object of
fierce firefights.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the Russian military's problems, the rebels staged a
surprise counterattack on soldiers in the Staraya Sunzha area, just
north of the city. And Chechen paramilitary units allied with
Moscow have suffered heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, fighting rages in the Chechen highlands as
rebels in the Argun gorge try to fight their way back to Grozny.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Given the political stakes involved for acting President
Vladimir Putin and the firepower Russia has at its disposal, it
seems virtually certain that Russian forces will eventually retake
the city. The question is at what cost to the troops, to the
Kremlin's prestige and to the thousands of civilians who live in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russian generals have said their goal is to win the war
before the March 26 presidential elections, Putin said in an
interview broadcast on RTR television Sunday night that the end of
the war in Chechnya ``will not be linked to any date in the
political calendar in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said the war would be over with ``the total liquidation of
the groups of bandits,'' the deployment of a permanent security
contingent in place of federal forces and the start of a
``democratic process'' in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently seeking to regain the initiative this weekend, Putin
replaced the head of the Interior Ministry troops, Vyacheslav
Ovchinnikov, with Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, who led Russian troops in
Chechnya during the final year of the 1994-96 war, which ended in
de facto independence for Chechnya. Tikhomirov was known for his
hard-nosed attitude toward the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian military report Sunday sought to paint an upbeat
picture of the fighting. It insisted that the rebels' morale was
plunging and added that the Russian forces were in the process of
``mopping up'' the Russian-controlled areas of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   But Baskayev, the Interior Ministry officer, had a more caustic
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no `mopping up,' because that term implies that
we are already in control of the situation,'' he said.

TALKS ON BIG MERGER CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   Discussions by executives at Procter &AMP; Gamble and the drug
makers Warner-Lambert and American Home Products continued over the
weekend as Procter &AMP; Gamble explored whether to buy one or both
drug companies in a deal that would create one of the largest
consumer-products and pharmaceutical companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble _ whose consumer brands include Tide, Pampers
and Crest _ could announce as early as Monday that it is proceeding
with formal merger negotiations, a person close to the talks said.
Industry executives and analysts say that if the company's chief
executive, Durk I. Jager is going to strike a deal, he needs to do
so quickly or risk having the uncertainty do further damage to his
company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``P&AMP;G can't drag its feet,'' said Neil B. Sweig, a drug analyst
at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's share price fell 9 percent on Friday to
$102.6875 _ down 12 percent for the week _ suggesting that
shareholders are concerned about the prospect of spending more than
$142 billion to buy the two drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   An executive who talked with P&AMP;G officials over the weekend
agreed with Sweig's assessment. ``The people that own P&AMP;G _ the
investors _ don't have the stomach for roller-coaster rides,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   American Home is primarily a maker of over-the-counter remedies
like Advil but also makes drugs like Premarin, a
hormone-replacement treatment. Warner-Lambert is best known for
Lipitor, a prized cholesterol-lowering drug, and consumer brands
like Schick razors.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies announced in November that they would merge in
a stock deal that was worth $78 billion at the time. But the deal
was thrown into immediate uncertainty by the drug maker Pfizer
Inc., which made an $82 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
Pfizer's products include the popular male-impotence treatment
Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Warner-Lambert finally agreed to talk to Pfizer,
even as it seeks other suitors. People close to Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert said the two companies had been discussing a
possible price, but no figure had been agreed upon. The discussions
centered on an exchange of three shares of Pfizer stock for every
Warner-Lambert share, higher than the 2.5-share offer now on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the executive who spoke with Procter officials over
the weekend said discussions continued between Procter and
Warner-Lambert ``at the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   To signal Procter's eagerness to grow faster by buying its way
into new, potentially lucrative businesses _ especially
pharmaceuticals _ the company lately has described itself as a
technology company that just happens to be in consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have the misimpression that P&AMP;G is a marketing
company,'' Dr. Ralph Snyderman, a Procter board member, said
Sunday. ``In the future, it will be a technology-driven company.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts have speculated that Procter might be
seeking a different partner, possibly in lieu of a deal with
American Home or Warner-Lambert. Snyderman would not comment on
that, but did say, ``P&AMP;G, I have found, is always looking around.''

 &HT;    Georgia ice storm puts freeze on power
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A winter storm coated much of the northern third of
the Georgia in a sheet of ice Sunday, leaving downed trees, snapped
power and phone lines and darkened homes.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, about 200,000 customers remained without power.
Power company officials said outages were so widespread it could
take several days before electricity is fully restored.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency in 15 counties.
</P>
<P>
   At one time Sunday morning, more than 500,000 customers were in
the dark, the biggest power failure in the area since Hurricane
Opal in 1995. It took six days to fully restore power after that
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power called in crews from south Georgia and Alabama and
had about 1,000 people working to restore power to homes and
businesses. The effort was hampered by poor weather that kept power
lines falling throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbs are still falling on lines, and that is not helping us
make progress. It's a little like sliding backward when you're
climbing on a hill,'' said Tal Wright, Georgia Power spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Power outages were reported over a widespread area in Georgia,
but they were scattered. On some streets, power remained on at some
homes and off at others. In other areas, entire neighborhoods lost
power.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2.5 million phone lines in metro Atlanta, only 3,000
lines were reported out Sunday, said BellSouth spokeswoman Lynn
Bress. However, Bress said repair crews expected that number to
grow as more trees fall and people come home to find their phones
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The problems stretched all the way to North Carolina, where
major utilities reported about 20,000 customers without electricity
Sunday after parts of that state got a mixture of sleet, rain and
snow. However, Carolina Power &AMP; Light spokeswoman Sally Ramey said
not all of the outages could be blamed on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters say the Atlanta area is not out of the woods.
Temperatures were expected to drop overnight to freezing, meaning
areas still wet could refreeze, said Matt Sena, meteorologist with
the National Weather Service in Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Precipitation is expected to end today, with
temperatures warming to the low 40s, according to the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writers Diane Stepp, Chris
Quinn, Janet Frankston, Gary Hendricks, Rick Badie, R. Robin
McDonald, Doug Payne and Joshua B. Good contributed to this report.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Daniel L. Teafatiller, a rancher, sold all his
cattle, except his two prize bulls, which he asked his son-in-law
to look after while he is away. Patrick F. Martin, an account
manager for Microsoft, is trying not to think about the six-figure
stock bonus he will miss when he is gone. Ron De La Rosa, a lawyer
with his own practice down by the courthouse here, is scrambling to
try or settle as many cases as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a murder the judge wants me to finish before I go,''
he said the other day in his office.
</P>
<P>
   De La Rosa and the others are citizen-soldiers, members of the
Texas National Guard who serve one weekend a month and two weeks
each summer _ unless a national crisis compels them to answer the
call to duty. That was always a possibility, they knew, but for
years, a remote one.
</P>
<P>
   Now the call has come. Only there is no war, no tornado, no riot
to quell. Instead, the Army has ordered them to set aside their
civilian lives, their jobs and their families to serve as
peacekeepers in a faraway place that few of them gave much thought
to a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In February, about 700 men and women of the 49th Armored
Division _ the Lone Star Division _ are to board transport planes
and fly to Bosnia, not for a couple of weeks, but for nearly nine
months. On March 7, they will take command of the U.S. sector in
NATO's operation there, responsible for ensuring that Bosnia's
tenuous peace somehow endures.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has deployed guard and reserve units overseas
before; more than 265,000 guardsmen and reservists were called up
to support the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. But the 49th's
mission is something new. The division is sending its headquarters
company, which includes the commanders and senior officers, along
with aviation, engineering and military police units. Not since the
Korean War has a guard division been put in charge of an overseas
operation. And never before has one commanded regular Army combat
units.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th's deployment represents the culmination of a trend that
is transforming the nation's military, while roiling cities and
towns across America, with consequences that the Pentagon has only
now begun to assess.
</P>
<P>
   De La Rosa, 42, a staff sergeant in the 49th's aviation brigade,
has had his life turned upside down. He has served on active or
reserve duty since 1979, the last six years in the Texas Guard,
without ever having been mobilized. He joined because military
service is a family tradition. His father served in the 49th and
was once mobilized during the Berlin crisis of 1961. His brother
was killed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He is eager to serve _ ``I'll go wherever they need me,'' he
said _ but the deployment means leaving behind his elderly parents
and his small law office on San Antonio Street. He is the only
lawyer in his practice but hopes to keep it running, relying on his
office manager and wife, Olga, to hold on to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we'll be able to pay the bills,'' De La Rosa said.
``Then at least when I get back, I'll still have my business.''
</P>
<P>
   With overseas military operations proliferating and the armed
services having shrunk by a third since the Cold War, the Pentagon
has been forced to rely more heavily on the 870,000 men and women
in the Guard and Reserves to ease the strain. In the Army today,
guard and reserve soldiers actually outnumber those in the regular
force, 564,000 to 479,000.
</P>
<P>
   Once a place to go to avoid being sent to Vietnam or, more
recently, to earn some extra cash or sometimes college tuition, the
Guard and Reserves have become essential to U.S. military
operations from the Persian Gulf to Kosovo to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   As the 49th's members have learned, anyone who joins the Guard
or Reserves today is more likely than ever to be called up,
especially in critical units like medical, police and civil
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, reservists spent less than 1 million days on
active duty supporting military operations; last year they spent
nearly 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a one-time reliance or a short-term fix,''
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said in an interview. ``We
simply could not undertake a sustained operation anywhere in the
world without the Guard and Reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the first four years of the Bosnian operation, more
Army reservists have been activated than during the entire Vietnam
War, though never in a single group as large as the 49th's. At
Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, a third of the pilots and crew members
patrolling the ``no flight'' zone over northern Iraq have belonged
to the Air Guard or Air Force Reserves. Guard and reserve F-16
pilots have bombed Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no end in sight. A recent Pentagon study predicted
the demand for guard and reserve deployments ``is likely to remain
high over the next 15 to 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Army has nearly a half-million regular troops, its
commanders argue that the length of the U.S. involvement in Bosnia
has strained regular divisions in Germany and at home, leaving them
unready for their wartime missions. In addition to the 49th, guard
units from Virginia and Pennsylvania have been designated for
rotations in Bosnia into 2003. Some 1,200 reservists have already
served in Kosovo and more are expected to go. The Army is also
considering a plan to send reservists to relieve the 800 soldiers
serving in the international observer force on the Sinai Peninsula,
which has monitored the peace between Egypt and Israel since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The increased reliance on the reservists, however, has come at a
cost.
</P>
<P>
   It has meant more money for training, equipment and pay. The
49th's deployment to Bosnia alone will cost an estimated $35
million. Citing the Army's dependency on them, Cohen last month
postponed a planned reduction of 25,000 guard and reserve
positions, a 4 percent cut that would have saved $900 million over
the next five years, according to Army officials.
</P>
<P>
   The greater demand has also raised questions about whether
part-time units are ready to take on missions important to the
nation's security. And it has tested the Pentagon's desire to
better integrate active-duty and reserve units, particularly in the
Army, where internecine rivalries of the past still simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest impact _ and the one that most worries
Pentagon officials _ is here at home.
</P>
<P>
   Deployments have forced the nation's so-called weekend warriors
to juggle their civilian lives and military service. While
reservists are used to being away for two weeks of drilling a year,
longer tours mean disrupting families and putting careers or
college on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Spc. Meghan A. Wood, an administrative clerk in the public
affairs office of the 49th, joined the Guard in 1998 to earn
tuition for the University of Texas. She was about to enter her
senior year last fall; her degree will now have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John R. Fitzgerald, an intelligence officer, is going to
Bosnia as a newlywed. He and his wife, Naima Mery, first planned to
marry in November, but he had to go to a three-week mission
rehearsal exercise at Fort Polk, La. So they squeezed in a ceremony
at the St. Louis Catholic Church here last week, with no time left
for a proper honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Mary E. Manley, who works for MCI-Worldcom's office
in Richardson, Texas, is going to miss a wedding altogether: her
25-year-old daughter's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She promised to videotape the wedding and send it to me,'' Ms.
Manley said as she completed a last round of training at nearby
Fort Hood. She paused wistfully, then added, ``She'd better.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Deployments have also forced employers large and small to
scramble to fill vacancies created when reservists leave, often at
a cost. By law, an employer cannot dismiss someone called to active
duty, but many reservists face subtle and not-so-subtle
retribution, as well as lost wages and missed opportunities for
promotions. Last year, the Department of Labor investigated 1,029
complaints against employers accused of violating the law; many
more are mediated locally, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing in it for the employer except losing
me,'' said Brig. Gen. Michael H. Taylor, deputy commander of the
49th _ and the vice president for human resources with the Memorial
Health System of East Texas, a small chain of hospitals based in
Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers are supportive of their workers called to active
duty. Some even supplement their pay, though they are not required
to do so. But conflicts over jobs are the leading reason reservists
quit, according to Pentagon surveys, followed by separation from
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repercussions are more severe than people think,'' said
Jerry Mendez, a major in the 49th who is an insurance manager in
San Antonio. ``People are going to have to choose'' between
military service and family. ``Guess what they're going to chose.
That's why the Guard is losing quality people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While officials insist there is not yet enough evidence to
establish a trend, there are signs that the increased use of guard
and reserve units has begun to hurt recruiting and retention. In
recent years, the Army and Air National Guards and the reserves for
the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps have all faced
difficulties signing up enough new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Plewes, chief of the Army Reserve, said that
active-duty soldiers, the biggest source of reserve recruits, have
shown a declining propensity to join the Guard or Reserves after
they retire, at least in part because of the increased deployments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Guard and Reserves fell more than 12 percent
short of their enlistment goals, leaving every reserve force except
the Army National Guard short of its authorized strength. While the
regular services have also had recruiting difficulties, the
reserves appear hardest hit by the increasing tempo of deployments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well be that the increased use of the Guard and
Reserves in the post-Cold War world has made it harder to attract
people,'' Charles L. Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense for
reserve affairs, warned the Defense Science Board last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Army, for the Pentagon, for communities across the
nation, the 49th's deployment has become a major test. A review of
the division's deployment to Bosnia over the next nine months will
show how well the Guard and Reserves are adapting to their new role
and whether the strains on families and employers put that new role
in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon prepares for its next strategic review, in 2001,
which will shape the military well into the new century, the
results are likely to affect all the services and their budgets, as
well as popular support for the nation's involvement in missions
like those in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the members of the 49th, which has its headquarters at Camp
Mabry here in Austin, the impact is felt closer to home. What has
happened in small ways as smaller guard and reserve units are sent
overseas is happening in larger ways in cities and towns across
Texas, from Dallas to San Antonio and De Kalb to Weslaco.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with nearly nine months away, the 49th's soldiers and
officers are scrambling to put their civilian lives in order,
making arrangements for their children, moving out of homes and
offices, wondering what will have changed when they get home in
October or November.
</P>
<P>
   They are a cross-section of life in Texas, which is why the
effects of their deployment will ripple across the state. Lt.
Christopher C. Ryan is a city prosecutor in Austin. Sgt. John P.
Casto is a customer service manager at Kroger's grocery store in
Houston. Staff Sgt. Bruce A. Devore works for the Central Texas
blood bank.
</P>
<P>
   Like De La Rosa, many came from families with military
backgrounds; the 49th is taking three sets of fathers and sons, a
married couple and twin brothers. Others previously served on
active duty and wanted to continue serving, although as
part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those going see the mission as an opportunity to put
into practice what they have learned in years of training. Many of
the 49th's 15,000 members volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Teafatiller, the rancher, is a master sergeant in a supply unit.
He was drafted into the Army in 1963 and served in Korea. Now, at
60, he is eager to go overseas again, even though it meant selling
the 50 head of cattle he kept at his ranch in De Kalb, in northeast
Texas. Having held on to his two Angus bulls, he says he can ``go
back to messing with cattle again'' when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe anyone who lives in this country owes it
something,'' he said. ``And every person doesn't get a chance to
pay it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The first word they were going to Bosnia came in October 1998.
The Army wanted to give the 49th enough time to prepare, as a unit
and individually, even though it is regarded as one of the most
combat-ready guard units in the country.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the president can only activate reservists for a maximum
of 270 days, but for most members of the division, their
mobilization orders do not actually take effect until Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the last year, the 49th's soldiers have spent 108
days drilling for the operation. For officers, the training,
including supervising a mock election at Camp Mabry this month to
prepare for Bosnia's municipal balloting in April, has consumed as
many as 150 days, far more than the 39 days a year they signed up
for.
</P>
<P>
   The training was necessary to prepare for a mission as complex
as this one, the division's commanders said, but the schedule has
bent the time-limits set by Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law says you can only serve for 270 days, but we couldn't
perform this mission if we didn't break that mold,'' said Col.
Garry D. Patterson, the division's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Until last fall, the 49th was scheduled to send more than 1,200
soldiers, but as NATO reduced the size of the peacekeeping force in
Bosnia to 20,000 troops, including 3,900 Americans, from 30,000,
the division has been able to reduce its contingent to about 700,
most of whom will work at the U.S. headquarters in Bosnia near
Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the reductions, the division commander, Brig. Gen.
Robert L. Halverson, has had some flexibility in selecting those
who will go. As the deployment neared, he was flooded with appeals
from members who had conflicts with jobs or families. Ultimately,
he let 35 people transfer to other parts of the 49th in order to
stay behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not out to ruin somebody's marriage, school, job,'' said
Halverson, who retired as deputy insurance commissioner for the
state of Texas when the deployment orders came.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I told a soldier, `I don't care about your marriage. I
don't care about your civilian job. You're going with me,' he might
go with me and come back,'' he said. ``But he wouldn't stay.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CAN ALSO END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Brinkman, the president of Brinkman Technologies Inc., a
software company in Carrollton, a suburb of Dallas, wrote to
Halverson last month pleading that one of his vice presidents,
Craig D. Yarbrough, be excused.
</P>
<P>
   Yarbrough, a lieutenant, oversees computer and online banking
projects for the company, which has only 23 employees. He is going
to Bosnia to be the 49th's contracts officer just as the software
company markets new products and spins off a publicly traded
company. ``This has come at the worst possible time in my civilian
career,'' Yarbrough said
</P>
<P>
   Halverson considered, but rejected Brinkman's appeal. ``Craig is
invaluable,'' Brinkman said. ``The general wrote that those same
qualities that Craig has were the reasons why the Army needed him
for this mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more difficult, for some, has been the disruption to their
personal lives, especially their families.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Deanne E. Lins, 39, is going to be an aviation supervisor
in the 49th's headquarters. Her husband, J. Anthony, is also a
major in the Guard and works full-time for the 49th's aviation
brigade. Parts of his unit were also called up for Bosnia, but
knowing his wife was already going, his commanders let him stay
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lins, a Blackhawk helicopter pilot, worked as a systems
engineer for Texas Instruments until her son, Matthew, was born
five years ago. Being in the Guard left her more time to be with
him and her daughter, Megan, 13. Matthew has not yet absorbed the
significance of her impending departure. On the other hand, it has
drawn Megan closer to her.
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple weeks before she leaves, she worries that she will
miss a critical time in her daughter's development. She worries
about how her son will adjust. She worries that her absence will
upset the family's routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay all the bills,'' Ms. Lins said, sitting in the living
room of their home on the northern edge of Austin. ``He doesn't
even have to look at the checkbook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' her husband interjected. ``I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lins, who joined the National Guard in 1981, strongly
supports the idea of serving, but she believes the increased use of
the Guard and Reserves will have an impact on soldiers and families
like hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make people think a lot more carefully,'' she
said, ``about why they join.''

   Craig Claiborne loved anything French; lamb, his favorite meat;
and slow cooking, especially braising, in which flavors intensify
pleasantly. This recipe, adapted from ``Craig Claiborne's New York
Times Cookbook'' (1979), written with Pierre Franey, combines all
these elements in only six steps.
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED LAMB WITH BASIL AND GARLIC STUFFING
</P>
<P>
   1 5-pound leg of lamb, boned
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound bacon or salt pork
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   10 fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup coarsely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coarsely chopped carrot
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped, peeled tomatoes, fresh or canned.
</P>
<P>
   1. When the lamb is boned, ask the butcher to reserve the bones
and crack them.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine the bacon, garlic, parsley and basil in a food
processor or use an electric blender. Blend the ingredients to a
fine puree.
</P>
<P>
   3. Sprinkle the lamb inside with salt and pepper. Spread the
bacon mixture inside the lamb to fill it. If some of the stuffing
oozes out, no matter. Sew up the lamb, tucking in torn pieces of
lamb as necessary. Sprinkle the lamb all over with salt and pepper.
Rub the lamb with any excess bacon and herb mixture.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place the lamb, fat side down, in a heavy casserole, and
arrange the bones around it. The lamb and bones should fit snugly
inside the casserole. Brown the lamb on all sides, and sprinkle the
chopped onion and chopped carrot around it. Cover and cook for
about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Carefully pour off and discard all the fat that has
accumulated. Add the wine, tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste.
Cover and bring to a boil. Cook over moderate heat for about 2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   6. Remove the lamb, and strain the sauce into a saucepan. Bring
to a boil, and skim the surface as necessary to remove as much fat
as possible. Cook the sauce down until it is thick and properly
concentrated. Slice the meat, and spoon a little of the sauce over
each serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 to 12 servings.

U.S. HEALTH OFFICIALS REJECT PLAN TO REPORT MEDICAL MISTAKES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal health officials say they are unwilling at
this time to embrace the National Academy of Sciences' recent call
for a new federal law requiring hospitals to report all mistakes
that cause serious injury or death to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal came from the academy's Institute of Medicine,
which also recommended that the information on medical errors be
made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal health officials said the proposal for mandatory
public reporting could have unintended consequences and might
elicit less information than a well-designed, well-run system of
voluntary reporting. So far, federal health officials said, they
have been unable to agree on the right mix of mandatory and
voluntary reporting.
</P>
<P>
   But members of Congress are nonetheless moving ahead with plans
to require some new form of reporting, which could resemble the
comprehensive system used by airlines and federal agencies to
report aviation accidents and safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, issued in late November, the Institute of
Medicine said that medical errors caused 44,000 to 98,000 deaths a
year _ more than the number resulting from auto accidents, cancer
or AIDS, and far more than the numbers killed or injured in plane
crashes each year.
</P>
<P>
   When the academy presented its report to President Clinton on
Dec. 7, he instructed federal health officials to evaluate the
proposals and report back by Feb. 5. Clinton seemed to favor
mandatory reporting of serious errors, as recommended by the
academy. But doctors and hospitals fear that such reports could
expose them to more lawsuits, liability and damages.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John M. Eisenberg, who is leading the administration's
review of the proposals, said, ``We are generally enthusiastic
about the framework of the Institute of Medicine report.'' But he
said officials were not prepared to endorse mandatory reporting of
serious medical errors at this time.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Eisenberg, who is also director of the Agency
for Health Care Research and Quality, said: ``The evidence and
experience with reporting systems is scattered and pretty
rudimentary. We want to know more about how mandatory reporting has
worked in states where it has been tried. What does mandatory
reporting get you that voluntary reporting does not? What are the
costs of each?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James P. Bagian, director of the National Center for Patient
Safety at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he and other
officials shared the academy's desire to reduce errors, but had
reservations about enacting a federal law to require reporting and
allow disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be some level of national reporting, so we can
learn from our mistakes,'' Bagian said. ``But to allow disclosure
of hospital names and practitioners' names would be
counterproductive. It could inhibit reporting and drive the
problems further underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety experts have long known that medical errors were a major
cause of death and suffering. But the academy's report shined new
light on the problem and ignited public interest in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few weeks, Clinton and other officials plan to
announce initiatives to enhance patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Sue Bailey, assistant secretary of defense
for health affairs, said she would soon instruct military hospitals
across the country to report medical errors, but she said the
reports would be confidential. One of her deputies, Dr. John F.
Mazzuchi, said the Pentagon would require reporting only of certain
types of errors, where it saw a potential problem or a significant
opportunity to improve the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the administration's plans exceed anything recommended
by the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bailey said she intended to reduce the working hours of
interns and residents at military hospitals. These doctors, like
trainees at private civilian hospitals, often work 36-hour shifts
and 100-hour weeks, Dr. Bailey said. She said the Defense
Department should follow the example of New York state, which for
the last decade has had rules limiting most interns and residents
to 24-hour shifts and 80-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said, ``The Institute of
Medicine report pushed an alarm button, and we are responding to it
as quickly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is leading a bipartisan group of six senators drafting
legislation to reduce errors in Medicare, Medicaid and health care
programs for military personnel, veterans and civilian federal
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health programs cover 90 million people and account for
more than 40 percent of health care spending in the United States.
But the sweep of the legislation would be much broader. The
senators are considering a proposal that would require hospitals to
report errors as a condition of participating in Medicare and
Medicaid. That would affect nearly all hospitals in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lieberman said, ``We've got to make it
mandatory, but we should also protect confidentiality so hospitals
don't have to fear a lawsuit every time they report a preventable
error.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials advising Clinton said they had agreed
on these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ When a hospital investigates its own errors to improve the
quality of care, it should, as a rule, not have to disclose the
results of its internal deliberations or its analysis of the
causes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whenever possible, doctors should use computers to order drugs
from hospital pharmacies, to avoid the misinterpretation of
handwritten prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Food and Drug Administration should step up its efforts to
prevent medication errors involving drugs with names that look
alike or sound alike.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government should develop a standard format, definitions
and terminology for reporting medical errors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald M. Berwick, a member of the National Academy of
Sciences panel, said federal officials were justified in worrying
about the possibility that the disclosure of injuries might
discourage reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear how much mandatory reporting will help patient
safety, but it will address deep public concern about whether the
health care system is open and honest and accountable,'' said
Berwick, who is president of the Institute for Health Care
Improvement, a nonprofit research and education group in Boston.
``Suppose an airline could crash a plane and not tell anybody about
it. That would be wrong. Likewise, if people are seriously injured
because of errors in medical care, don't they or their families
have a right to know?''
</P>
<P>
   The patient safety program of the Department of Veterans Affairs
is often described as a model for the nation. The department
requires its hospitals to report mistakes to the agency's regional
offices, which in turn send the information to Washington. Veterans
hospitals must try to identify the causes of each incident, to
reduce the likelihood of a repetition. But the reports are not
generally made public.
</P>
<P>
   Bagian said it might be premature to require the nation's 5,000
community hospitals to follow the procedures of veterans hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community hospitals operate in a competitive environment
where public embarrassment can have business implications,'' Bagian
said. ``If you're not careful here, legislation could have a
chilling effect on people's willingness and ability to report
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said that federal
laws requiring colleges to disclose campus crime statistics had
stimulated them to take precautions to prevent crime. He suggested
that a reporting requirement for hospitals could have similar
beneficial effects.

 &HT;    Regulators try to find way to ensure drug safety
 &HT;    By Irwin Spivak
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Spend 25$ _ get $25$ credit! Online
Pharmacy _ no prescription needed! Foreign pharmacy will give
discounts up to 75% for non-FDA approved drugs!''
</P>
<P>
   So go the pitches made by some Internet pharmacies. Others
tantalize consumers with promises of 30 percent to 50 percent
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Come-ons like these are hard to ignore if you are one of the 44
million uninsured Americans or among the 75 percent of seniors on
Medicare who lack prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers indeed might find some of the best prices by buying
prescription medicines over the Internet. But an informal survey
suggests the savings are generally modest and may vanish when
shipping charges are included.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug shoppers may be able to match the best Web
prices by going to Publix or Costco, according to The Palm Beach
Post's survey of five local and five Internet pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing is an issue because corner drugstores are increasingly
being replaced with a click onto the Internet, where one can find
hundreds of Web sites selling prescription drugs and other health
products.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 Web sites dispense drugs but don't prescribe them,
according to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. The
association estimates that a far greater number of online
pharmacies provide prescriptions through ``patient questionnaires
and cyberspace consultations.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, online drug shopping can save money. A survey
last fall by Consumer Reports showed that buyers could save as much
as 29% by purchasing certain drugs online. But another 1999 study _
conducted by the University of Pennsylvania and published in the
Annals of Internal Medicine _ found that Viagra and Propecia cost
an average of 10 percent more online than at Philadelphia-area
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   SENIORS BIGGEST MARKET
</P>
<P>
   The elderly, who make up 12 percent of the U.S. population,
frequently have little or no insurance coverage for prescription
drugs. At the same time, they're the biggest users of such drugs:
The National Association of Chain Drug Stores reports that the
typical 65-year-old takes nine different prescription medicines a
year at an average of about $38 per bottle. Refilling all nine
prescriptions once a month would cost more than $4,000 over a year.
But experts urge consumers to use caution online.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should use the same kind of common sense you use when
buying from any business,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, a medical
officer at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ``You look for a
reputable dealer. You get recommendations from a friend. You check
the place out.''
</P>
<P>
   Online sales are booming because the Internet makes drugs easily
available for those who live far from the local pharmacy and makes
it easier to comparison shop. Some sites also offer a greater
variety of products, and consumers can order products and consult
with a pharmacist in the privacy of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   HOLES IN SAFETY NET
</P>
<P>
   Sales of drugs via the Web, however, make it easy to bypass the
FDA guidelines that protect consumers from harmful or ineffective
drugs as well as improper prescribing or dispensing. The FDA is
concerned about improper storage and shipping _ particularly of
drugs from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs offered by foreign Web sites are more likely to raise
safety concerns about contamination or subpotent strengths,
according to the FDA. The majority of drugs ordered from foreign
Web sites are coming in from Thailand, China, Mexico and
Switzerland, reports the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said they seized 9,725 packages of
prescription drugs ordered over the Internet last year because they
had not been approved for use in this country, did not comply with
American labeling requirements or fell below U.S. standards for
quality and purity. They also impounded almost 2 million pills and
tablets because they did not meet FDA guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has given us a lot more work,'' reported Raymond
W. Kelly, commissioner of the customs service, on the agency's Web
site. ``We've been deluged with prescription drugs coming in from
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers, however, rarely are prosecuted. Consumers can find
licensed pharmacies that comply with laws through a new service set
up by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. The VIPPS
program, or Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites, was created
to protect consumers by ensuring patients have privacy, secure
orders and the option to consult with pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacies that volunteer for the program and meet its criteria
can display the VIPPS hyperlink seal on their Web site. By clicking
on the seal, consumers are linked to the association's site _
www.nabp.net _ and can verify that the pharmacy qualified for the
program. Consumers also can check the association's Web site for an
Internet pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   PHYSICIAN'S INPUT NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   For Internet pharmacies to work properly, the patient's
physician should be involved in requesting the drug, said Jeff
Trewitt, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America. Patients who buy drugs online without
their doctor's knowledge might receive inappropriate drugs or
suffer side effects _ particularly if they don't tell the Internet
pharmacist about other drugs that they're taking.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Zelman _ president of SaveWell, one of the newer online
pharmacies _ said people need to be smart shoppers. Some walk-in
pharmacies such as Publix and Costco may be able to match online
prices because they want to bring in customers who will buy other
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping electronically offers convenience, but consumers should
beware of ``rogue'' sites that use unapproved, imported drugs or
dispense drugs without prescriptions, Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   States and the federal government are grappling with how to
police online pharmacies at a time drug sales are soaring. Last
year, pharmacists from walk-ins and the Web combined to fill nearly
2.8 billion prescriptions, according to the Consumer Reports Web
site. That figure is expected to jump to about 4 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has set up a task force to study the growing number of
questions arising about Internet drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, Michigan's Attorney General threatened to sue 10
online pharmacies because Michigan bars prescribing drugs without
having an in-person physical. President Clinton's administration
has proposed strengthening the penalties for selling drugs
illegally and giving the FDA more authority to investigate online
pharmacies. It also has recommended investing $10 million in a
``rapid-response team'' and FDA computer technology to identify,
investigate and prosecute illegal Internet pharmacies.

 &HT;    Questions and answers about buying drugs online
 &HT;    By
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Q: Some Web sites offer to prescribe a
medication for the first time based on a questionnaire. Is this
safe?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Many online practitioners issue prescriptions in the
absence of a physical exam or direct medical supervision. Patients
may receive an inappropriate drug and sacrifice the opportunity for
a correct diagnosis. The patient may have an underlying condition
unknown to the online pharmacist and could be hurt by the drug
dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can consumers find out of they are paying too much for an
Internet prescription?
</P>
<P>
   A: Compare prices with your local pharmacy. An online pharmacy
may be able to offer a drug at a lower price because of lower
operating costs. However, sometimes, online pharmacies offer a drug
at a reduced price because the product is not the real thing or is
a foreign copy of a drug approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the FDA cracking down on Internet drug sales?
</P>
<P>
   A: FDA and state boards of pharmacy and medicine are responding
to the increasing number of Web sites offering prescription drugs
in violation of state and federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is FDA concerned about unlawful drug sales?
</P>
<P>
   A: Patients who buy prescription drugs from an illegitimate site
are at risk of side effects from inappropriately prescribed
medications, dangerous drug interactions, contaminated drugs and
possible ill effects from impure or unknown ingredients in
unapproved drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any benefits to purchasing approved drugs online?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. The chief benefits are the speed and ease of
choosing and ordering and the relative privacy of the Internet. In
general, online pharmacies don't have a physical building and
significant savings can be passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What charges will FDA bring against illegal Internet sellers
or prescribers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Depending on the nature and severity of the violation, a
person may face civil and criminal penalties, including seizure of
their product, fines and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do foreign Web sites pose any greater danger to U.S.
consumers than domestic sites?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The FDA cannot ensure that imported drugs are made under
the same standards or stored and distributed under the same
conditions as drugs made for U.S. use.

 JEAN MacARTHUR, 101, WIDOW OF GEN. DOUGLAS MacARTHUR  
(lb) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean MacArthur, the widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who
remained at her husband's side through the darkest days of World
War II and was often introduced by him as ``my finest soldier,''
died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. She was 101.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their 27-year marriage, the couple, who met when she
was 36 and he was nearly 20 years older than her and was the
survivor of an earlier unhappy marriage, maintained an
old-fashioned formality. Mrs. MacArthur referred to her husband as
``the general.'' He called her ``ma'am'' and in his later years
confided that she was his ``constant friend, sweetheart and devoted
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacArthur, whom William Manchester, the MacArthur
biographer, described as ``a poem of womanhood,'' married Gen.
MacArthur in New York in 1937. They had met two years previously
when he was a fellow passenger on the S.S. President Hoover, en
route to the Philippines to assume his duties as military adviser
to the government there.
</P>
<P>
   Later he became the supreme allied commander in the Southwest
Pacific, waged the campaign against Japan and accepted the
surrender of Japanese forces in 1945 in Tokyo Bay aboard the USS
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended, he oversaw the occupation of Japan as
supreme commander of allied forces in Japan. After North Korean
forces invaded South Korea, he also became supreme commander of the
U.N. forces in Korea until April 1951, when, in a dispute over the
prosecution of the war, he was relieved of both commands by
President Harry S. Truman.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States and a hero's welcome and became
chairman of Remington Rand and then of Sperry Rand Corp. He died in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacArthur displayed an indomitable spirit and determination
in the face of wartime trials.
</P>
<P>
   After the Japanese invaded the Philippines, it was decided to
abandon Manila in 1942 and move the government to the island of
Corregidor. Mrs. MacArthur packed a few necessities and, as she was
leaving the apartment, she passed a cabinet containing the
decorations awarded to her husband. She removed the medals from
their cases, wrapped them in a towel and made room for them in her
suitcase by discarding some of her own clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the military situation on Corregidor rapidly
deteriorated, the general informed her that President Manuel Quezon
of the Philippines had offered her and their young son, Arthur,
passage to Australia. ``We have drunk from the same cup; we three
shall stay together,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthurs and their 4-year-old son lived in an underground
bunker during months of bombardment before agreeing to evacuation
on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacArthur, the former Jean Marie Faircloth, was born in
Nashville, Tenn., on Dec. 28, 1898. Her father, Edward C.
Faircloth, was a banker and businessman. She was 8 when her parents
divorced and her mother, a native of Murfreesboro, Tenn., took her
young daughter and her two sons, Cameron and Frederick, back to her
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Murfreesboro household was her grandfather,
Capt. Richard Beard, a Confederate veteran, and Mrs. MacArthur was
raised in a home where a Confederate uniform was a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow members of the Daughters of the American Revolution
recalled that ``every time Jean Faircloth heard a Fourth of July
firecracker go off, she jumped to attention and saluted.'' Young
men were advised, ``If you want to win Jean Marie, you better get a
uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Faircloth married again in 1907 and there were two children
of that marriage to Frederick Smith _ Harvard Smith and Donna
Angeline Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacArthur was educated at Ward-Belmont College in Nashville
and at Soule College in Murfreesboro, from which she graduated.
</P>
<P>
   As a girl, she had not been close to her father, but when he
grew older and wealthier, he often took her on trips and cruises
with him. When he died, he left her a substantial fortune, and she
used it to travel extensively, visiting friends in Manila, cruising
in Europe and taking her half-sister on a South American cruise and
her half-brother on a three-month round-the-world cruise.
</P>
<P>
   A vivacious woman with meticulous manners, Mrs. MacArthur took
seriously the social duties connected with her husband's position,
both in the military and later in private life. After his death,
she refused to bask in reflected fame, leading a quiet social life
within a select circle of well-known New Yorkers. She pursued her
interests in fashion, theater and opera.
</P>
<P>
   Friends recalled that on one occasion at the Metropolitan Opera,
she paused as she walked down the aisle to make sure that the
plaque bearing her name was still attached to an orchestra seat.
``I paid $1,000 for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also worked on behalf of several civic and philanthropic
activities, and was honorary chairman of the board of the Gen.
Douglas MacArthur Foundation in Norfolk, Va. In 1990, at age 91,
with her friend Barbara Bush at her side, she cut the ribbon
opening the research center of the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk,
where her husband is buried.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacArthur received the distinguished public service award
from the Department of Defense in 1984, and in 1988, President
Ronald Reagan presented her with the Medal of Freedom, the highest
award given a civilian in peacetime, for her patriotic service to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The government of the Philippines honored her in 1993 with its
Legion of Merit medal. She was one of the few private citizens to
receive a visit from the emperor and empress of Japan during their
trip to the United States in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite stories when she reached the last decade of
her life was about her conversation with the driver as she was
bouncing around in a New York City taxi. ``I'm 90 years old,'' she
said. ``Can you go a bit slower please?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Mrs. MacArthur,'' the driver said. ``I remember you
from the Philippines and how you bounced around in the jeeps there
and it didn't bother you.''
</P>
<P>
   Her intimate friends also recalled that although she would order
a martini ``to be social'' when dining out, she had earlier briefed
the waiters and bartenders in her favorite restaurants on what that
really meant. A martini glass filled with water and decorated with
a lemon twist would be brought to her, and she would smile
appreciatively as she sipped.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her son, Arthur, of New York, and her
half-sister, Angie McCarthy, of Murfreesboro, said Col. William J.
Davis, executive director of the MacArthur Foundation in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacArthur will be buried beside her husband at the
MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk after a private service for her on
Wednesday, Davis said.

JETS EXPECTED TO NAME GROH HEAD COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets will name Al Groh their coach Monday and will
also announce that former coach Bill Parcells will remain in an
advisory capacity for the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Groh, who has coached under Parcells for more than 15 years, was
linebackers coach of the Jets the past three years and defensive
coordinator with the Patriots when they went to the Super Bowl
under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Groh was the personal choice of Parcells after Bill Belichick
resigned from the position less than 48 hours after becoming coach
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, by a contractual arrangement he had with late Jets
owner Leon Hess, moved into place as head man when Parcells retired
following the final game of the regular season against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   However, two days later, Belichick resigned and subsequently
filed a grievance with National Football League commissioner Paul
Taglaibue trying to free himself from the Jets to accept an offer
as coach and general manager of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Tagliabue ruled against Belichick, saying he had a
contract for the next three years with the Jets and he could not
coach in the league during that time unless allowed to do so by the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots offered New York two draft choices, neither in the
top two rounds, to pry Belichick loose, but the Jets rejected the
deal. Reportedly they still are looking for a first-round and a
middle-round pick as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and new Jets owner Robert Wood Johnson IV met with Groh
over the weekend, the first time Johnson had met Groh. But after
the meeting, Johnson decided to go along with the strong
recommendation by Parcells, who considered Groh the best available
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   There was no movement on the Belichick issue over the weekend,
which is fueling speculation that the Patriots are losing interest
in Belichick and turning their attention toward University of Miami
coach Butch Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said in the last couple of weeks that he wants to stay
at Miami. There also have been reports Davis might be the next
coach in Dallas, where he served on Jimmy Johnson's staff when the
Cowboys won two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Crennel, longtime defensive line coach with the Giants,
Patriots, and Jets under Parcells, left over the weekend to become
defensive coordinator with Chris Palmer in Cleveland, leaving New
York depleted on the defensive side of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Belichick was the coordinator, Groh the linebackers
coach, and Crennel the line coach. The Jets' offensive staff is
expected to stay intact, with the possible exception of coordinator
Charley Weis, who testified on behalf of Belichick in the grievance
hearing and is very close to Belichick.

PATRIOTS SEEK ALTERNATES TO BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There were no talks over the weekend between the
Patriots and Jets regarding compensation to free Bill Belichick
from his contract with New York, so New England began to formulate
an alternative regarding its coaching situation.
</P>
<P>
   With Jacksonville being knocked out of the playoffs Sunday, the
Patriots have asked for permission to speak to Jaguars defensive
coordinator Dom Capers about their coaching job. And New England
will interview former Pittsburgh director of football operations
Tom Donahoe for the general manager's job Tuesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Capers-Donahoe likely would come as a team, having worked
together for three years in Pittsburgh (1992-95) when Capers was
defensive coordinator under Bill Cowher and Donahoe was director of
football operations, a position he held until he was fired at the
end of the season, losing a power struggle with Cowher.
</P>
<P>
   Donahoe has been highly sought after. He could take the GM job
in Miami and work with another friend, Dave Wannstedt. But Donahoe
is attempting to see if he and Capers would be attractive to teams
looking for a coach-GM tandem. Another team that might be
interested would be New Orleans. Dallas also has a coaching
vacancy, but is reportedly looking for someone more offense-minded.
</P>
<P>
   By talking with Capers and Donahoe, the Patriots may be sending
a message to the Jets that they could get nothing for Belichick if
they don't play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Capers's Jacksonville defense didn't have the best of games in a
33-14 loss to Tennessee in Sunday's AFC Championship Game. But
Capers is known for being tough and instilling discipline, and he
has experience leading a team into the playoffs. His resume is
similar to Belichick's in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   Capers was 31-35 from 1995-98 in Carolina, but was fired after
going 4-12 and replaced by George Seifert. He landed as Tom
Coughlin's defensive coordinator in Jacksonville and did a good job
upgrading an already decent defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have scheduled a news conference for Monday to announce
they've signed Al Groh to a five-year deal to be their new coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have the 16th pick in the first round this year and
are trying to hold on to it, believing there's a chance they could
get a top offensive lineman or Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have distanced themselves from former Kansas City
coach Marty Schottenheimer, who also would require compensation.

COMPTROLLER CAREFULLY LAYING FOUNDATION FOR GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ H. Carl McCall has a reputation as a most
cautious politician. So as he contemplates the most incautious of
acts, challenging a popular incumbent governor, he is going about
it in the most cautious way _ starting almost three years before
the election.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, McCall, the state comptroller, has laid
the groundwork for a run for governor in 2002 with a seriousness
that has impressed even those who question his nerve. He has
established a campaign committee, opened a Web site and begun a
concerted, very early attempt to lock up the support of all the
Democrats who matter and head off any potential primary challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going through a process of assessing a candidacy, and to
date the indications are very, very positive,'' McCall, a Democrat,
said on Friday in his first interview on the subject. He said he
needed to begin now to raise the $15 million to $20 million he
estimates he will need for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to hundreds of elected officials and other
prominent Democrats over the weekend, McCall's committee said,
``While he will not make an announcement until later this year,
Carl has begun making plans to run for governor in 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic elected officials and strategists say that McCall's
jump on the race is aimed at positioning him to take on not only
Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republican incumbent who has hinted that
he will seek a third term, but also a fellow Democrat, Andrew M.
Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development and son of
former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo says he may run for governor, though he could have
a prominent role in the White House if his friend, Vice President
Al Gore, wins the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCall conceded that one reason for starting so early is ``to
develop the kind of support so that there's the possibility of
avoiding a primary,'' though he insisted that he had no particular
opponent in mind.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether he expects Pataki or Cuomo to run, he said: ``I
have no idea. My efforts and my final decision will have nothing to
do with any other candidate in a primary or in a general
election.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat who has been talked about as a potential candidate,
Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, took himself out of the running
in an interview on Friday by endorsing McCall. ``I will be 100
percent behind his effort to get the nomination and to get
elected,'' Spitzer said. ``I think Carl is the best candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the 2002 election, there will be contests for
the U.S. Senate, for president and for mayor of New York City, yet
the talk among the state's Democratic political strategists is of
the race for governor, and in particular, of a McCall-Cuomo
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The contest offers enough rich story lines to fill a gothic
novel. McCall, the first black person elected to statewide office
in New York and the state's first serious black candidate for
governor, would be expected to energize the black vote and draw
money from black contributors around the country. Cuomo would be
seen as seeking to avenge himself against Pataki, who defeated his
father in 1994. And there is history aplenty: Mario Cuomo wanted
McCall as his running mate in 1982, but McCall lost the primary for
lieutenant governor to Alfred B. Del Bello.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A sure sign of Cuomo's interest came on Friday, when a reporter
received a number of unsolicited calls from people close to him _ a
Cuomo aide, a political consultant and a few politicians _ saying
that they had heard the reporter was working on an article about
McCall and the 2002 race, and offering to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
   One caller, Mayor Gerald D. Jennings of Albany, said he had
heard about the article ``from some people in Washington,'' and
added that while he had not endorsed anyone, ``there are a lot of
positives that Andrew has.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Cuomo himself said: ``I think we should focus
on the foreseeable future. We have two very important goals. One is
to elect the next president of the United States and the other is
to elect the next senator from New York. That should be the focus
of the Democratic Party. There's plenty of time for the governor's
race. This is a very early start for a political contest that's
basically three years away.''
</P>
<P>
   Though polls show Cuomo faring better than McCall in
hypothetical matchups against Pataki, most Democratic strategists
interviewed said they thought McCall, assuming he raised enough
money, would defeat Cuomo in a primary, mostly because of heavy
support from black and Hispanic voters. Political analysts say that
based on the experience of black candidates in other states, race
could hurt McCall in a general election, though how much is
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCall's intentions right now are to close everybody else in
the party out, to line up support early and line up money early,''
said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who does not
have strong ties to either McCall or Cuomo. ``The specter of Andrew
Cuomo will always be looking over his shoulder, but I would expect
him to beat Cuomo. McCall should certainly be competitive against
Pataki, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCall, the challenge now is to persuade Democrats that he
is serious about this race, and that he will make the kind of
all-out effort that a statewide campaign demands _ and that he is
not known for. All this at an age, 64, when most people are
thinking about retirement, though he looks and seems a decade
younger. (Cuomo is 42, and his supporters make it clear that if he
ran, they would make his youth and energy an issue.)
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have grumbled for years that McCall was too unwilling
to attack Pataki. Black politicians complained that he did not
identify with the issues of concern to their community _ it was
only after considerable lobbying that he joined hundreds of others
in being arrested in protests after the police shooting of Amadou
Diallo last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the most damning and frequent criticism of McCall is that he
does not have the fire needed for a real contest. After months
spent publicly weighing a run against Pataki in 1998, he declined.
He passed up the chance to run for the Senate this year, before
Hillary Rodham Clinton's name had been floated, even after Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan said that McCall would be his preferred
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '98, I had only served one term, George Pataki had $20
million, the economy was good and he was very strong,'' McCall
said. As for the Senate race, he said: ``I've devoted my energy to
New York state, to executive positions. The Senate wasn't some
place I wanted to go, start from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall certainly has the kind of resume that makes for an
attractive candidate: son of a single welfare mother graduates from
Dartmouth and becomes a high school teacher and an ordained
minister in the United Church of Christ, is elected to the state
Senate from Manhattan, is appointed U.S.ambassador to the United
Nations, serves as a vice president of Citicorp, and becomes
president of the New York City Board of Education. His wife, Dr.
Joyce F. Brown, a former deputy mayor, is president of the Fashion
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by the Legislature in 1993 to fill the vacant
comptroller's office, he won it in his own right in 1994 and 1998.
In that job, he has sole control of investments made by the $120
billion state pension fund, making him probably the single biggest
investor in the world and thus a prominent figure in the world of
high finance, where he has won generally high marks. In state
government, he has espoused prudence so often that Democrats chide
him that he sounds more like a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has had a diffident relationship with the assembly
speaker, Sheldon Silver, who is closer to Cuomo, but most
strategists do not think that would pose a real threat if McCall
proved to be a serious candidate. Silver's office declined to
comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all signs are that McCall means to do what it will take
to mount a serious run for governor. He has a well-known antipathy
to fund-raising and has taken more than a year off from it. (He has
$72,000 in his campaign treasury, to more than $2 million for
Pataki.) But he has hired Shawn Thompson, a former fund-raiser for
the Assembly's Democratic majority, and has scheduled two
fund-raising events next month.
</P>
<P>
   He has gathered an impressive roster of backers, including
Spitzer; Rep. Charles B. Rangel; the Assembly majority leader,
Michael J. Bragman, a power in the Assembly and in central New
York; Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic chairman;
Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Manhattan chairman; and
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the Brooklyn chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there remains the nagging question: why would a cautious
politician leave a job in which he is courted by financiers from
every part of the world for an arduous and uncertain campaign?
McCall said, ``You just can't do the same thing forever.''

COMMENTARY: A COLD WIND BLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We were in the middle of a brutal cold snap last
week, just like the winters of old, with temperatures diving into
the single digits and winds as sharp and merciless as a razor
slicing through the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before dawn on Wednesday the temperature in Central
Park was 11 degrees. For the police and the Department of Homeless
Services this was the perfect moment to inflict further torment on
that group that has become a favorite target of the Giuliani
regime, the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in coordinated raids in all five boroughs, the regime
struck. The homeless, some of them mentally ill, never had a
chance. There was no resistance. They awoke startled in their
temporary bunks and watched in absolute astonishment as cops swept
through several shelters and arrested 129 men and women who had
outstanding warrants for such dire offenses as _ get this _
relieving themselves in public, drinking beer in the open air,
trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said five or six of the miscreants who were
pulled from their beds, handcuffed, dragged into the bitter cold
and taken to jail had been wanted for felonies. As for the rest,
the other 123 or 124 _ well, who cares about them? A bunch of bums
and mental cases as far as the city is concerned. And if they're
reluctant after this harrowing experience to go into the shelters
again, choosing instead to remain in an alley or a park in the
life-threatening cold _ well, that's their call. The winter wind is
not the only thing that's merciless in this town.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Markee of the Coalition for the Homeless told me that 18
mentally ill homeless men were arrested at the Fort Washington
shelter in Upper Manhattan, which provides special services for the
mentally ill. Two of the men had not been heard from by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them is an older gentleman who suffers from major
depression and hypertension,'' said Markee. ``The staff is very
worried about what has happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the criticism of the raids was the stark fact that
two homeless men died last week as a result of the cold. One was
found dead in the back of a station wagon that he had crawled into
for shelter, and the other died near a loading dock on which he had
been living in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brosnahan, the executive director of the coalition, said
the raids were part of a ``reign of terror'' against the homeless
in New York. ``They send a very strong message to the folks out in
the street who are trying to make a calculated decision on a bitter
night about whether to come in out of the cold. That message is: no
matter how small the infraction is that you may have in your past,
if you come into the shelters you are running a very severe risk of
being rounded up and hauled off to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not a matter of concern to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
vigorously defended the raids. And his commissioner of homeless
services, Martin Oesterreich, told me on Friday that they will
continue because last week's sweep ``was very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Oesterreich was not at all moved by complaints that the raids
took place on one of the coldest days of the year. ``It takes a
while to gin up these kinds of operations,'' he said. ``And then
they fall on a certain date and it doesn't matter whether it's a
driving rain or snowstorm or it's, you know, 2 degrees below zero.
That doesn't really concern us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would take a look at the impact of the raids on the
mentally ill, however.
</P>
<P>
   The city had never before conducted a sweep of the shelters that
was as broad as last week's. ``The reason that it's never happened
before,'' said Oesterreich, ``is that I now have a director of
security who works very closely with the Police Department to
coordinate all of our security issues, including these warrant
sweeps. I just hired the guy two months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Oesterreich said the homeless advocates were putting an entirely
incorrect spin on the sweeps. They should, he said, be happy about
last week's operation and the predawn raids to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some way to deter people from coming into the
shelters,'' he said. ``It is to encourage people to come in by
making them the safer spots that the homeless have a right to
demand of us.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: BUSH SETS JAW AND COURSE, IF NOT VIEWS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ At no point in the last several months did
Gov. George W. Bush seem quite as rattled as he did at a news
conference on Thursday, when reporter after reporter challenged him
to elucidate his feelings about the Supreme Court and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As the questions multiplied, pressing him ever harder to fill in
the blanks, his answers grew briefer, his lips narrower, his jaw
tenser. He clearly wanted to talk about something _ anything _
else.
</P>
<P>
   That was also true on Saturday, when reporters tried to prod
Bush into discussing the abortion plank in the Republican Party's
platform. The Texas governor and his aides responded with a
concerted effort to change the topic to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And that should come as no surprise, because as Bush goes
through a Republican primary process in which his ultimate victory
seems almost foreordained, his greatest challenge is arguably not
the loftiness of the numbers he posts in the precinct caucuses here
on Monday or even his fate in New Hampshire, a state he could lose.
</P>
<P>
   It is to emerge from this obstacle course with a record of
statements and an overall image that can play in the general
election, which will likely be fought in the center of the
political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Sunday that he is toeing a straight and steady line
and hewing to unwavering principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about me is I'm a candidate who has run
consistently throughout this primary,'' Bush told reporters here
Sunday morning. ``And I'll run the same kind of campaign in the
general election.''
</P>
<P>
   But in what Bush emphasizes and what he does not, what he
embraces and what he avoids, he seems to be exhibiting a fair
degree of caution about not picking up any ideological baggage that
will weigh him down come summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Republican rivals like Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes, and some of their ideological allies, have made that
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly arrived in the state to beat the conservative
drums for Forbes; Bauer went so far as to hold a prayer service
over the gravesite of an aborted fetus. And Forbes repeatedly
portrayed Bush as soft on abortion, leading reporters to grill Bush
on the topic and compelling Bush to make some strong statements
about his opposition to abortion that may well come back to haunt
him.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has also been trying to signal to voters outside of
Iowa and New Hampshire what many political observers in Texas have
noted: he is not a politician who cares to spend his political
capital on highly divisive, emotional battles, nor is he fond of
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview that he taped with CNN on Saturday, he
would not be roped into a firm statement about whether or not he
would consider a vice presidential candidate who supports legal
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Bush be lured into a negative analysis of Supreme
Court Justice David Souter, who turned out to be much more liberal
than Bush's father, who appointed him, perhaps expected him to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice try,'' Bush said. ``I am not going into all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has held a news conference with reporters on the
campaign trail almost every day since the beginning of the year,
that ritual suddenly ended after Thursday's session, which was
intended to highlight an endorsement from a farmers' group but
turned into a tense back-and-forth about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides explained that with the caucuses just days away,
Bush was simply too busy with events more closely related to
getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign,
answered a question from several reporters about Bush's
availability this week by saying that a daily news conference is
``not in our best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a message of the day and we're going to stick to it,''
Ms. Tucker said. ``We are not going to have one big, fat news
conference on our schedule where you can come and ask what you
think is the news of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Karen P. Hughes, the communications director of
the campaign, said that Bush would continue to be available to
reporters, and she pointed out that he had done two extended
national television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump in Iowa, Bush has avoided the subject of abortion
entirely, instead talking about improving education for poor
children, ushering lower-income people into the middle class and
finding a ``purpose to our prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the specific proposals he is advocating will
accomplish any of this is open to debate, but what is unequivocal
is Bush's desire to cast himself as a more sensitive, moderate
Republican. And that is an effort that has less to do with handy
victories in caucuses and primaries and more to do with wooing
swing voters in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of winning Iowa, Bush did not need to have
three black children right behind him on a stage in Waterloo
Sunday. For the purposes of the general election, and for changing
the Republican Party in the ways he has said he wants to change it,
that kind of image could be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   There are positions that Bush has taken, whether out of genuine
conviction or political expedience, that may prove to be
liabilities down the line. He has said that it is up to South
Carolinians to resolve the debate over the Confederate flag at the
Statehouse, drawing fire from people who find the symbol racially
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   And the enormity of his proposed tax cut, which his aides
believe will play well with Republicans in New Hampshire, may be
seen as fiscally irresponsible by voters elsewhere and give the
Democrats ammunition against him.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has one eye obviously on the general election when he
sells the plan by talking about how much it will help the less
prosperous, especially, to use his example, a single mother with
two children making $22,000 a year, and reflects that audiences may
be surprised to hear a Republican focusing on such a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that what's lacking in a lot of the rhetoric in the
course of the campaign on the Republican side is not talking about
the people that live on the outskirts of poverty,'' Bush explained
to reporters in New Hampshire earlier this month.

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice president Al Gore has representatives
from organized labor working the phones and stuffing envelopes.
Bill Bradley has turned to the Internet to try to reach voters.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas tapped into his vast network of
friends and supporters. And Steve Forbes, the publisher, wants to
make sure everyone has a ride.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. on Monday night, registered voters will fill church
basements, meeting halls and school auditoriums to cast their vote
and argue about party platforms in one of the 2,142 caucus
precincts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   To get his supporters to the meetings, Bush is relying on
``captains'' in each precinct to help staff members work through an
elaborate phone tree of supporters and registered Republicans. The
captains supply the campaign with a list of friends and neighbors
to be contacted for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captains ask voters who they plan to support, answer
questions on what to expect on caucus night and help explain the
process,'' said Eric Woolson, a spokesman for the Bush campaign.
``They're getting people on board.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has the labor force. In addition to making
about 30,000 telephone calls, members of the Iowa Federation of
Labor are mailing letters to local union leaders on behalf of the
Gore campaign. Letters are then reproduced over the local leader's
signature for personalized mailings that will be sent to all
150,000 union households in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has about 400 volunteers in the state, working the
precincts. Over 1000 precinct leaders are in place to urge voters
to go to the caucuses. According to the Bradley campaign, staffers
at phone banks have reached more than 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who trails Bush in Iowa polls, has implemented a
Neighbor to Neighbor program that Jim Tobin, national policy
director for the Forbes campaign, called a ``ground game
organization'' to turn out voters for the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Each supporter recruits five people, who in turn reach out to
five others, and so on, thus spawning a web of support throughout
the state. And on caucus night, Tobin said, the campaign will do
``whatever it takes to get everyone to their precinct.'' Volunteers
will spread out across the state in their own cars, and staffers
will employ minivans ``to provide transportation for all of our
Iowa supporters,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will be left out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing. The forecast for Monday: a low of 12 degrees and
snow.

MICROSOFT INVESTS IN INTERACTIVE TELEVISION BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In another step toward extending its reach from
the personal computer to the television set, Microsoft Corp. will
invest $56 million in Intertainer Inc., a privately held company
that provides a video-on-demand service, Microsoft executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was expected to be formally announced Monday,
would give Microsoft a stake of slightly more than 20 percent in
Intertainer, making it the largest single shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The investment would allow Intertainer, which is based in Culver
City, Calif., to more quickly role out its service, which offers
pay-per-view movies, music, television programs and electronic
shopping to personal computers connected to cable modems,
high-speed digital telephone lines or television sets with digital
set-top boxes. The company has started offering its service
commercially in some cities, but has fewer than 1,000 subscribers
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is trying to position itself as a leading software
provider for interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make this whole marketplace come true,'' Jon
DeVaan, senior vice president for Microsoft's consumer group, said
Friday. The investment in Intertainer, he said, would give
Microsoft ``an innovative broadband service committed to using its
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft also hopes to work with similar services.
Microsoft agreed in May to invest $5 billion in AT&AMP;T in exchange
for a promise that the company, which owns cable provider
Tele-Communications Inc., would use Microsoft software in 7.5
million to 10 million digital set-top cable boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also bought an 11 percent stake in Comcast Corp., a
cable company, several years ago and acquired Web TV, a company
that allows Web surfing using a television set.
</P>
<P>
   Intertainer was formed in 1996 by Jonathan Taplin and Richard
Baskin, veteran Hollywood executives. It has received smaller
investments from Comcast, the Intel Corp., NBC, and US West.

COMMENTARY: BRADLEY'S RESURGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A couple of months ago, Al Gore was suffering the
tortures of the media-damned.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was derided for running a Washington-based
campaign with a sclerotic staff. He was falling behind in fund
raising. He was seen by even his knee-jerk union supporters as the
Ultimate Stiff. He was overpaying media advisers to give him an
earth-tone transplant to turn him into an Alpha Male.
</P>
<P>
   At that nadir moment, a piece appeared in this space headed
``The Gore Comeback.'' Based on the pendulum theory of political
popularity, as well as on the media's needs for a spirited contest,
it laid out the likelihood of a roaring return of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   See? The contrarian theory sometimes works. The loosened-up,
slashing debater, supposedly advised to press the flesh by his
daughter (a reliance on family advice that didn't help Boris
Yeltsin), is now the favorite to win in Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   As promised here back then, the moment has come to reveal the
blueprint for the ``Bradley resurgence.'' (The best advice for
lefties comes from righties, because we're not emotionally
involved.)
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's media problem is that the bloom is off his
challenger's rose. A savage analysis in The Washington Post derides
his attempt to overcome in photo ops what had been criticized as
aloofness. He is pilloried as well for not running the gentle,
intellectual, sure-fire-loser's campaign he promised at the start.
On top of all that, his ticker's been kicking up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's personal problem is that he has been much too
comfortable in his own skin. This internal easiness is not the
attribute it is cracked up to be. Rather than merely being himself,
Bradley must become Himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: Stop complaining about Gore's exaggeration about the
cost of your big-idea proposals. The let's-not-go-negative pitch is
posited by goo-goos who don't vote. Instead, embrace the ``upbeat
negative'': attacking the other guy's cheap, weaselly, crackbrained
ideas is a necessary counterpoint to presenting your own.
</P>
<P>
   In going upbeat negative, don't dredge up ancient history about
Gore's first use of Willie Horton. In this week's debate, be
realistic about the great danger to Democrats in the fall campaign:
Gore's shameful record in abetting Clinton's 1996 political money
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   When a huge GOP ad campaign zaps fund-raisers by Gore at
Buddhist temples; when Gore's ``no controlling legal authority'' TV
clips become as familiar as the clip of Clinton's finger-wagging
lie; when new facts emerge about Clinton-Gore fund-raising
predations, Democrats in 2000 will suffer from ``Clinton-Gore
fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Your central point to Democrats: Gore Can't Win. Recount the
influence-peddling charges sure to come from Republicans as
stipulated in Orrin Hatch's recent damning speech. When all this
sleaze was going on, where was Al? Up to his hips in it. Where were
you? Miles away, earning an honest living.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been able to portray your revulsion at this kind of
contracts-and-China-policy and Lincoln-bedroom-for-sale as being a
``quitter.'' Don't let him get away with that twist: He's the one
who stayed and choked. Only a Democrat who is clean of the scandals
can win. That's you.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the dire outside possibility of a McCain candidacy:
Because he would have the independents, and Republicans would
``come home,'' McCain would clobber Gore and carry the House with
him. Only you, unencumbered by the baggage of the impeachment
trauma, could compete with McCain for the decisive swing vote. And
if the market bubble pops in October, the GOP can't blame you.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, be a real Democrat and promise the moon. Where's your
``I see an America where'' speech? Let's hear those ideals, boiled
down to a triple pledge: health insurance for all, the end of gun
violence, a new era of honest politics not dominated by fat cats.
</P>
<P>
   Use your big war chest now to create spots that take up that
simple, triple theme. Your low-key delivery can be at its most
effective if the words uplift. Contrast Gore's strident
niggardliness with your sincere generosity. And don't look guilty
about taking the good fight to the front-runner: It shows you're
able, as Gore was, to get up off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Go to it, fellas. I'll hold your coats.

   AUTOBYTEL TO SELL CARS DIRECTLY OVER INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel, the Internet car-buying service, plans to announce
Monday that it will act as a car broker by selling cars directly
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement at the annual convention of car dealers in
Orlando, Fla., comes on the heels of Friday's news that Amazon.com
would get into the online car-selling business by taking a 5
percent stake in Greenlight.com, and is part of a broader scramble

<P>
   Ms. magazine said it had hired Patricia Smith, the former Boston
Globe columnist who admitted fabricating information. Ms. Smith's
first column for the magazine, titled ``Fools in Love,'' will
appear in the February/March issue, and center on a visit to her
22-year-old son in prison. Marcia Ann Gillespie, the magazine's
editor in chief, said that she had long been an admirer of Ms.
Smith's work, adding that she was ``delighted'' to have Ms. Smith
on staff and that she had no qualms about the writer's editorial
integrity.

   NASDAQ'S BEST WEEK VS. DOW
</P>
<P>
   The technology-saturated Nasdaq composite index had its best
week ever, relative to the Dow. The Nasdaq rose 4.2 percent last
week to yet another closing high, with gains in every trading
session, while the Dow fell 4 percent as it declined each day. Last
week's divergence reflects continued speculation in small
technology stocks at a time when rising interest rates have hurt
many stocks _ including the bigger, bluer-chip technology stocks.

   `SPIN CITY' STARTS FROM SCRATCH

   DreamWorks heads into television's development season in serious

</P>
<P>
   TURNING CARS INTO SNOW PLOWS
</P>
<P>
   An inventor in Wilton, Conn., has designed a plow blade for his
car that is 5 millimeters thick, is made of steel and can be
attached to the pre-existing tabs on a car chassis, called ears,
which are normally used for tying a car down during shipping. The

REPUBLICANS COURT CORE BLOC, IN AN EVENING WITH SOCIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The pale, slight 14-year-old in a severe
black suit stood before a crowd of more than 1,000 at the Family,
Faith and Freedom rally on Saturday night while her mother gave a
graphic account of how, ``under the influence of pornographic
videos,'' the girl's father had sexually abused her ``on her very
first birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was the girl's turn to speak, she stepped behind the
pulpit of the First Assembly of God Church and, without affect,
said quietly, ``I feel there is a place within me, a dark place of
unknown things.'' Hospitalized for anorexia at one point, and
battling depression, she helps with what she called her mother's
anti-pornography ministry, Kids Hurt, Too.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the program was Frances Johnston, who said her son
Michael ``found out he could walk away from homosexuality, but he
walked away too late; he has AIDS.'' And Mike Gabbard, with Stop
Promoting Homosexuality International, who spoke about the need for
laws ``basically saying marriage between a man and a woman will be
valid,'' before playing ``The Wedding Song'' on his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Then three Republican presidential candidates, Alan Keyes, Gary
L. Bauer and Steve Forbes, showed up to court the social
conservatives gathered here. George W. Bush sent a surrogate, Sen.
John Ashcroft, R-Mo., who spoke on his behalf in an upstairs
classroom before the event.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Christian right is splintered this year, divided
among Bush and the other candidates, they remain active here. This
gathering represents a core constituency of the Republican Party _
and one voting bloc that seems to be searching for a candidate
whose themes will  &UR; not &LR;  make them feel good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for someone I might even disagree with but who is
a moral leader with the good of the country at heart,'' said Josh
Eshelman, 39, who was browsing the books for sale at the event:
``Ministry to the Homosexual,'' ``The Bible and Homosexuality,''
and ``Informed Answers to Gay Rights Questions.''
</P>
<P>
   A mother standing next to Eshelman with her young son picked up
another book, ``On Wings Like Eagles,'' and was ready to buy it for
him until she saw the subtitle: ``Convincing evidence that Christ
provides hope for those who feel trapped by homosexual desires.''
``Oh no,'' she said, dropping it. ``It's about homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why all the focus on homosexuality, Eshelman said,
``Homosexuality is one of the tough issues facing young people.''
And certainly, the speakers here did not shy away from tough
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote address, from Christian writer Josh McDowell,
scolded Christians _ who should not, he said, be so sure that they
hold the moral high ground. Quoting a study that he said showed
that more born-again Christians than atheists are divorced, he
thundered, ``Until we are willing to live the Ten Commandments
ourselves, we have no right to hang them up in schools!''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the candidates. Forbes was introduced by Phyllis
Schlafly, the founder of the anti-feminist Eagle Forum, who
reminded the crowd that ``you're not going to pick the best-looking
candidate,'' or the one with the best personality, and asked them
to consider Forbes instead. ``Steve Forbes is not running for
president because he needs a job; He had a better life before he
got into this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes mostly stuck to his stump speech, and on the 27th
anniversary of Roe v. Wade, promised religious conservatives that
he would consign the decision ``to the dustbin of history.''
</P>
<P>
   He also asked, ``Who determines what reality is, in the United
States of America? Those power elites in Washington, or we the
people?'' And he promised to retrain the lobbyists who will be
thrown out of work when he dismantles the tax code: ``We'll bring
them to Iowa and they can learn to shovel snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Keyes, who chided the crowd to stop applauding.
``I'm skeptical about you all. I've seen it all too often; they
applaud, then vote for someone who's going to do God knows what.''
</P>
<P>
   And he suggested that God wants them to vote for him, to cast a
vote ``which accords with what God wishes with all his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The next speaker, Bauer, had attended several anti-abortion
rallies earlier in the day and visited a cemetery where he placed
roses on the headstone of a stillborn infant found here in a ditch
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you happy with your country?'' he asked the crowd. ``Are
you happy they're passing out condoms and telling our kids they're
no better than barnyard animals, who can't restrain themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' shouted one man in the crowd. ``Preach it!''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest applause of the night, in a standing ovation,
went not to any of the candidates but to Michael Johnston, who said
God helped him go straight. ``Mr. Bush, you can't say you won't
meet with the Log Cabin Republicans,'' a group of gay Republicans,
``just because it might create a controversy,'' he said, as the
crowd roared its approval. ``Tolerance of wickedness and sin is no
family value.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also Johnston who got the biggest laugh, on a night when
there were very few light moments, by addressing another candidate
who was not present, Sen. John McCain: ``And Mr. McCain, you can't
stand for the family and say you can foresee a day when a
homosexual could be president. Who would be the first lady, Ru
Paul?''

3 COPYRIGHT LAWSUITS TEST LIMITS OF NEW DIGITAL MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A flurry of court activities last week revealed a growing
conflict between the entertainment industry, which is struggling to
protect its products and profits in the Internet age, and consumer
groups, which accuse the industry of interfering with free speech
and people's rights to control their watching or listening
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The digital media market is still small compared to traditional
media, but record companies, film studios and publishers are
preparing for what they see as an inevitable migration of
entertainment online.
</P>
<P>
   Three lawsuits in play last week all dealt with different
aspects of protecting copyrighted works. But at the heart of each
is the question of what framework will govern the distribution of
digital content. It will fall to the courts to set the scope and
application of existing copyright laws _ both new laws and those
enacted long before the Internet _ to digital content.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really going on in these legal skirmishes is a broader
conflict between traditional means of media distribution and
digital means,'' said Mark Lemley, a professor specializing in
Internet law at the University of California at Berkeley. ``The
media companies have a legitimate concern that the medium of the
Internet enables piracy, but there is also an unsavory concern that
they are losing their traditional distribution mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemley added: ``The statutes are frighteningly complex, and it's
not clear how to apply them to the Internet. The result that we get
when we work through the statutes and figure it all out may not be
the one that we want.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, said Peter Jaszi, a professor specializing in
copyright law at American University, is that ``there are things in
some of the laws which may tilt the results in a direction that is
too restrictive as far as consumer interests are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Recording Industry Association of America filed
suit against MP3.com, a Web site that last week started a service
allowing customers to store and listen to their CD collections and
newly purchased CDs from a password-protected account online.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson, MP3.com's chief executive, described the
service as a benefit to consumers, letting them listen to music
from any place with an Internet connection. The company took
measures intended to protect copyrights, like allowing the music to
be played but not recorded on a hard drive and limiting the
accounts to one user at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the recording industry filed suit on Friday. In a
letter to Robertson that same day, Hilary Rosen, chief executive of
the recording association, wrote: ``Simply put, it is not legal to
compile a vast database of our members' sound recordings with no
permission and no license. And whatever the individual's right to
use their own music, you cannot exploit that for your company's
commercial gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemley, the Berkeley law professor, said he doubted that the
association's lawsuit would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accuses MP3.com of violating a part of the Copyright
Act of 1976 that grants copyright holders the exclusive right to
make reproductions of their copyrighted sound recordings. But
Lemley said the MP3.com service was technologically equivalent to a
user's making a copy for personal use _ something specifically
allowed under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Jaszi said, though, that it was not clear that the fair-use
exemption applied to MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cases in play last week are considered crucial tests
of a much newer law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a
sweeping piece of legislation enacted in 1998 but largely untested
in the courts so far. This law, which makes it illegal to
circumvent copyright-protection technologies, was pushed by the
entertainment industry. But consumer advocates managed to work in
an exemption that allowed software developers to engage in
``reverse engineering'' of copyright protection codes as they try
to create products compatible with the protection technology.
</P>
<P>
   This exemption is an issue in cases that involve software for
cracking encryption codes designed to protect DVDs from illegal
copies. Also on Friday, a federal district judge granted in New
York a request by the Motion Picture Association of America for a
preliminary injunction prohibiting three Web-hosting sites from
distributing the code-cracking software.
</P>
<P>
   The studios say the software, written by a Norwegian teen-ager,
is a piracy tool. But the defendants argue that the purpose of
their program is to allow DVDs to be played on computers that run
the Linux computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Jaszi said, the case addresses the issue of
whether the newer law overrides the fair-use provision of the 1976
Act, which has sometimes been construed to embrace reverse
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary injunction does not necessarily indicate that
the plaintiffs will prevail, since there is a general bias in the
courts toward granting injunctions in intellectual property cases.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a similar injunction was issued on Tuesday in Seattle
in a case by RealNetworks Inc., a leading provider of software for
distributing multimedia content over the Internet. A federal
district judge there barred Streambox Inc. from further
distributing a product that enables Internet users to record
so-called streaming audio and video on their hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge did not bar distribution of another product, the
Streambox Ripper, which enables users to convert RealNetwork's
proprietary media format into other formats _ most notably that of
RealNetworks' rival, Microsoft Corp. That ruling, Jaszi said,
suggests that the judge may believe Streambox is likely to prevail
in the case of the Ripper.
</P>
<P>
   Jaszi noted that the Ripper tool did not clearly circumvent
copyright protection technologies. Rather, he said, the judge may
believe that it is a threat mainly to RealNetworks' interest in
maintaining the exclusivity of its proprietary format, which would
not be protected under the 1998 law.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Alben, the RealNetworks vice president for government
affairs, said that the company would continue to pursue the case.

GROH IS NOW AT THE CENTER OF THE JETS' STORY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Groh likes to tell a story about how he met his
wife and Bill Parcells on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Those momentous meetings came back in 1968 at West Point, where
Parcells was an assistant coach, Groh was in the Army hoping to
coach the freshman team, and his future wife, Anne Stahle, was home
from college and working in the officers' club. More than 30 years
later, Groh remains with both of them.
</P>
<P>
   What is the moral? That Groh is a creature of habit? That he
sticks with what he knows? Or that he just likes to tell a story _
that every situation that man or football player or coach faces can
be made simpler by just looking at history?
</P>
<P>
   The new head coach of the New York Jets, whose ascension will be
announced Monday, considers himself a teacher. The Jets, seeking
stability and a continuation of the success that Parcells brought
to the franchise, have given Groh a four-year contract worth
$800,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Groh tells a story that he somehow relates to football.
It could be a metaphor about Christopher Columbus or Mark McGwire,
but the aim is the same: to get his players to play better
football.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, his second season as the Patriots' defensive
coordinator, he saw the club fall to 3-6. Groh and his son Matthew
ransacked the garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with him looking for the shovel in the garage,''
Matthew, now a freshman quarterback at Princeton, said Sunday.
``The shovel took on a celebrity of its own. I have T-shirts with
the shovel on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh took the shovel and planted it in front of the team.
``We've got to dig ourselves out of this hole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere the Patriots went the rest of the season, the
shovel went, too. The Patriots won their final seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Before another game, Groh asked the defensive players if they
had ever heard of Christopher Columbus. Well, he told them:
``People thought he was crazy sailing to America. But it turned
out, he wasn't crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   That was by way of introducing the defense to the fact it was
about to shift from an eight-man front _ which everyone thought was
necessary to stop a running game _ to a seven-man front. The
Patriots used it and won with it.
</P>
<P>
   To focus last season's Jets linebackers, he told them they
should think of themselves as the most important unit on the team.
He likened them to McGwire's role on the Cardinals; they were the
cleanup hitters, and they had to accept the responsibility that
that entailed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Groh, with Parcells continuing as the head of football
operations, will have to try and control the story line. He has the
top post because Bill Belichick quit on Jan. 4 after a day on the
job, and even Groh may not have an analogy for this situation.
</P>
<P>
   Groh reads the works of Tom Clancy and Richard Ludlum. He just
saw ``The Green Mile.'' This Jets saga has become an equally
improbable and twisted tale, but the 55-year-old Groh seems to be a
sensible sort and has certainly been around. He was even a head
coach once, leading Wake Forest from 1981 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Groh went 26-40 with the Demon Deacons, but when he left he had
the second-most victories of any football coach in that school's
history.
</P>
<P>
   He has been with Parcells for two college stints (Army and Air
Force), and with three pro teams (the Giants, the Patriots and the
Jets).
</P>
<P>
   He was the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach during
Parcells' four years in New England. Patriots quarterback Drew
Bledsoe once asked Groh to teach him defense, so Groh would draw up
various formations the quarterback might face and advise him on the
best way to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Groh remained as coordinator and defensive play caller in 1996
when Belichick joined the Patriots as assistant head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Groh left New England and went to the Jets with Parcells, for
whom he has been the linebackers coach, one of the assistants
Parcells derides as ``the geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has favored a 3-4 defense, and Belichick often shifted
midgame between a three-man front and a four-man alignment. Groh's
preferred basic defense is a 4-3 when he has the manpower.
</P>
<P>
   Now Groh needs a coaching staff. With the defensive line coach
Romeo Crennel's decision on Saturday to take the defensive
coordinator's post at Cleveland, with Groh's ascension from
linebackers coach to head coach, with Belichick's departure after
being both coordinator and defensive backs coach, there is no
carry-over coach from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   What Groh will be facing immediately, then, will be daunting.
The question of assistants will be addressed Monday, and he has
already spoken to several candidates. The new Jets owner, Robert
Wood Johnson IV, will also explain Parcells' role in the front
office Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Groh, who grew up in Manhasset, N.Y., will be adjusting to
his new role, six miles south in Hempstead.
</P>
<P>
   Groh was a varsity football star at Chaminade High School and
then the University of Virginia. His father, Al, was the first
football coach at Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Groh followed his Army stint with a return to Virginia, then he
was on to North Carolina, where he helped recruit and coach
Lawrence Taylor. His first pro job was in 1987, a one-year layover
as special teams and tight ends coach with the Falcons. Parcells
hired him to coach the Giants linebackers in 1989-1990.
</P>
<P>
   Groh also was the Giants' defensive coordinator, in 1991, with
Ray Handley as head coach. A year later Groh joined Belichick in
Cleveland for one season, then rejoined Parcells for four years in
New England before moving back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Groh taught Parcells' daughter Suzy in the second grade at
West Point, also has a football background. Her father, Buck Stahle
was on the 1943 Army team. Her godfather is Glenn Davis, the famed
Mr. Outside and a Heisman Trophy winner in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Al and Anne have three children: Michael, now a stockbroker in
Richmond, Va., who was a quarterback at Virginia; Ashley Anne, who
teaches hearing-impaired children; and Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a big screamer,'' Matthew said Sunday. ``But he's a
pretty intense guy. He's as intense as Parcells is. As a child, I
used to see my father's intense stare.'' Fans, he added,
``shouldn't be worried.''

 &HT;    Late TD saves St. Louis from stingy Tampa
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was hardly an artistic achievement, or anything
remotely similar to the fashion in which the St. Louis Rams had
advanced to Sunday's NFC Championship Game. Their powerful offense
was rendered impotent. Their self-esteem, which bordered on
overconfidence, was tweaked. And yet, in the face of dire
circumstances, the Rams refused to succumb.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they rallied around their MVP quarterback, a reserve
receiver and an underappreciated defense to outlast the
irrepressible Tampa Bay Buccaneers 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the edict has been lifted in St. Louis. The Rams can not
only talk about the Super Bowl without the threat of a fine, they
are Atlanta-bound.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played in Atlanta (on Oct. 17), I told the team when
we come back here it's going to be a bigger game,'' said coach Dick
Vermeil, who last made the title game in 1981 as coach of the
Philadelphia Eagles. ``When we look at the tapes, we will say,
`Geez, there was a lot of things we could have done or should have
done.' But I do know that our destination is to go to the Super
Bowl in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Just barely. The Buccaneers showed a defense that was as fierce
and quick and relentless as advertised. The Rams' offense that
averaged a league-high 33 points in the regular season _ and scored
49 points against Minnesota a week earlier _ was limited to 309
total yards.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tampa Bay was protecting a 6-5 lead deep into the
fourth quarter. And considering how the Rams were unable to solve
the Bucs' two-deep zone and multiple blitz packages, that thin
margin was significant. However, Kurt Warner, who was underwhelming
for the first time this remarkable season, convened with third
receiver Ricky Proehl during a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt said that if the safety blitzed, to run a fade pattern,''
Proehl said. ``He blitzed and I ran past him.''
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-4 from the 30-yard line, Warner lofted a pass
toward the left corner of the end zone. Proehol slowed down in
order to shield the Bucs' Brian Kelly, then went up and made the
touchdown catch with 4:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that kicker Jeff Wilkins had a bad knee, ``I just
thought we had better complete it,'' Vermeil said. ``You don't want
to dump a game in a kicker's lap if you don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The score gave the Rams an 11-6 lead after a failed two-point
conversion try, and the trip to the Georgia Dome rested with the
St. Louis defense.
</P>
<P>
   London Fletcher and his group of linebackers had instituted $50
fines for anyone saying the words ``Super Bowl'' before Sunday. And
with that destination in the balance, Fletcher and Co. produced.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie quarterback Shaun King showed significant moxie in
leading the Buccaneers to the St. Louis 22-yard line in the last
minute. But that was as far as they got. Defensive end Grant
Wistrom sacked King for a 13-yard loss, moving the ball to the 35.
On second down, King connected with Bert Emanuel for what was ruled
on the field to be a 12-yard gain. But the replay official
overruled the call, making it an incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials made what they thought was the right call,''
said King, who was 13-for-29 for 163 yards and two interceptions.
``You have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers died with it. Two incompletions later, Tampa Bay
relinquished the ball on downs with 34 seconds left, touching off a
sustained celebration among the 66,396 at the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed we can play any type of game,'' said running back
Marshall Faulk, who was held to 49 yards total offense. ``It was
back and forth for a long time. But we felt our defense would make
more plays than theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, it made one more play than the Bucs. And it was an
interception by rookie cornerback Dre Bly that set up the
game-winning TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge,'' said cornerback Todd Lyght, who also had a pick. ``As
a defense, we had to get the ball back.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 5-3 at halftime was almost like a victory for Tampa
Bay. The Bucs were within striking distance, which is all coach
Tony Dungy wanted. They were there because their defense's speed
and aggression grounded the potent Rams attack, giving up just 159
yards and no touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to score against them,'' said Warner, who threw
three interceptions. ``We didn't finish drives. We were struggling,
but it wasn't us. They were play-making.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs' play-making began with the game's first play. Warner
dropped back and attempted to hit Faulk with a screen pass.
However, defensive end Steve White snagged the ball for an
interception, giving the Bucs possession on St. Louis' 20-yard
line, just 15 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa managed a first down, but had to settle for a field goal
and 3-0 lead. St. Louis then drove to the Bucs' 6 in 16 plays, but
the league's No. 3 defense stiffened, and St. Louis reluctantly
took Wilkins' 24-yard field goal to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been tied at halftime if Tampa center Tony
Mayberry had not snapped the ball over the head of quarterback
King. Wisely, King ran the ball down and knocked it out of the end
zone for a safety. St. Louis took that 5-3 lead into halftime.

UCLA'S GADZURIC WAS TALL MAN OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't center Dan Gadzuric's four turnovers
that limited him to 17 minutes Saturday against Arizona State, UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said. It was Gadzuric's size.
</P>
<P>
   He was too big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dan he didn't do anything wrong, it was just the
matchups,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter ASU's small but speedy lineup, the Bruins removed
Gadzuric, moved forward Jerome Moiso to center and inserted
athletic forward Matt Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The quintet of Moiso, Barnes, Jason Kapono, Ray Young and Earl
Watson played extensively, including the final eight minutes of
UCLA's 83-77 victory. It accounted for 76 points, 27 rebounds and
held ASU to 33.3 percent shooting in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smaller lineup was a more difficult matchup for them,''
Lavin said. ``Last year we went small to win a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins might use the lineup this week at the Oregon schools,
which often align four perimeter players around one big man.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The small lineup) is good for us because all the guys can do
so many things,'' Kapono said. ``Jerome plays (center) but he's
really a (forward), Matt plays (power forward) but he's really a
(small forward). It's a skilled, versatile, quick team.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Junior guard Rico Hines believes he broke his
right big toe Saturday and will have X-rays today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke it last year, and I know how it feels,'' Hines said.
``I heard it snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines started Saturday in place of Young for the third
consecutive game. The injury occurred on UCLA's second possession,
when he jammed his toe into ASU guard Eddie House's foot. Hines
departed a few seconds later and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA called the injury a sprain, pending results of the X-rays.
But if Hines is right and his toe is broken, watch for Young to
return to the starting lineup.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: MCNAIR'S NEXT STOP ENDS AN ODD JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ About six years ago, Steve McNair stood in
front of his mother's modest home in Mount Olive, Miss., and
contemplated questions I asked about the path he had chosen. Why
hadn't he gone to one of the prestigious colleges that had
recruited him? Why had he opted for tradition and followed his
brother to Alcorn State?
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he wanted to play quarterback, but then he spoke
about the importance in life of going through a process. He had
seen so many of his friends go for the quick strike, trying to get
from point A to point Z without going through all the steps in
between. McNair said back then that he was willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Football Conference championship game Sunday,
McNair took a tremendous step in his stunning process of becoming a
star National Football League quarterback. Running and passing like
a latter-day Jim Thorpe, minus mud on his uniform and a leather
helmet, McNair led the Tennessee Titans to a berth in the Super
Bowl with a 33-14 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   As stunned fans shuffled out of Alltel Stadium, some cursed the
lack of a Jaguars pass rush and questioned the defensive line's
effort. They did not get it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pass rush _ the problem was, the rush could not
consistently get to McNair. When the rush found McNair, he escaped
and punctured the defense with a long run or a pass. At least three
times defenders had McNair cornered, and each time McNair shook off
tackles, changed direction and broke down the defense. On one
drive, with his team trailing by 7-0, McNair took off and ran for a
backbreaking 8-yard gain. On the same drive, facing second-and-5,
McNair ran for 4 yards. On third-and-goal from the 9, McNair threw
a touchdown pass to Yancey Thigpen to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   On Tennessee's first possession of the third quarter, McNair
dropped back to pass, eluded two defenders who appeared to have him
trapped, wheeled and sprinted left before throwing a pass to a
wide-open Eddie George for a 15-yard gain. The Jaguars, frustrated
by their inability to reach McNair, hit him late and drew a 15-yard
penalty. Three plays later, McNair scored on a 1-yard run to give
Tennessee a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mark Brunell, McNair's counterpart on the Jaguars,
who had been touted as the better, prettier passer, was chased,
harried and harassed without mercy. Jacksonville fumbled five times
and lost four of them. Brunell threw two interceptions and was
sacked three times. His sack in the end zone with 5 minutes 13
seconds left in the third quarter gave Tennessee a 19-14 lead. On
the ensuing free kick, Derrick Mason went 80 yards for a touchdown.
Game over.
</P>
<P>
   Just to put an exclamation point on the day, McNair _ on a
third-and-1 at the Tennessee 48-yard line _ raced 51 yards to the
Jacksonville 1-yard line. He scored on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   His line for the day: 23 passes, 14 completions for 112 yards,
one touchdown, one interception. But here are the more stunning
statistics: McNair had nine rushing attempts for a team-leading 91
yards and two touchdowns. The only other Titan to run Sunday was
Eddie George, who ran 25 times for 86 yards. The Titans defeated
Jacksonville with two runners _ their fullback and their
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   McNair is 12-2 as a starter this season and has led the Titans
to the Super Bowl in his third season as a starter. Still, in many
minds, McNair flies too low to be picked up on some fans' radar,
too high for others. After the game, McNair was peppered with
questions about the perceived lack of respect from those who said
he would never lead his team to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   During a six-game stretch this season, McNair threw just one
touchdown pass with seven interceptions. Titans fans booed him at
Adelphia Coliseum. On radio talk shows they called for the backup
Neil O'Donnell to start and openly lobbied for a trade for Peyton
Manning, their favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms were familiar:
</P>
<P>
   McNair can't read (defenses).
</P>
<P>
   McNair can't think (on his feet).
</P>
<P>
   McNair can't win (the big game).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out there to play football,'' he said Sunday. ``Regardless
of what numbers I put up, people talk about not throwing
touchdowns, or not getting 300 yards passing. We're winning. That's
what counts. You have to do what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For McNair this season, that has included playing with a flak
jacket to protect his bruised ribs, playing with an arm-length pad
on an injured elbow. He underwent back surgery early in the season
and has played with a severely sprained toe throughout the season.
Bruce Matthews, the Titans offensive lineman and a veteran of 17
NFL seasons, called McNair the toughest football player he has ever
played with.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, as he attempted to put this season in
perspective, McNair repeated the themes of process, endurance and
the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot this whole season, from start to
finish,'' he said. ``I've been through a lot to make this moment
special: not winning the Heisman, not throwing for as many yards as
other quarterbacks. But of all the things I've been through this
year, this means the most to me. Taking this team to the Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, 75,206 mostly Jacksonville fans saw Tennessee defeat
their Jaguars for the third time this season. You get the sense
that the Jaguar fans still don't know what hit them.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more to Steve McNair than meets the eye.

FREE E-MAIL FOR SIMPSONS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The word AT in parentheses has been used instead of the

<P>
   News Digital Media, the online publishing arm of News Corp.'s
Fox Network, has joined the fray of companies offering free
Internet service. But unlike other companies, which provide access
through shopping sites and search engines, News Digital uses a fan
club.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Bart Simpson and family can now sign up for free e-mail
and Internet access at www.Simpsons.com, a new World Wide Web site
whose debut marks the 10th anniversary of the animated sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes just after Kmart said it would provide
free Internet service through its shopping site, following similar
announcements by Yahoo, Excite(AT)home and others. America Online
offers free access in Britain through a Netscape-brand site.
</P>
<P>
   To create the new service, News Digital Media contracted with
1stUp.com, a San Francisco-based company owned by CGMI that
supplies advertising-based Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 1stUp.com said it had a million subscribers to its
free service, indicating that the idea appears to be catching on.
</P>
<P>
   For free service via Simpsons.com, users must first download an
application that becomes an add-on feature to their browsers _ a
sponsored navigation bar that becomes part of the browser screen.
They are then given e-mail addresses at Simpsons.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site is supported by advertising, and is intended to
complement the TV show and give fans a place to congregate, said
Jordan Kurzweil, vice president of development for Fox.com in New
York. The site also helps Fox gauge viewer reaction to individual
episodes of the show, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is able to aim advertising at individuals based on
their usage of the site, Kurzweil said. But he added that Fox has a
strict policy against selling user information to other companies
or for use in direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not appear concerned that people might sign up
for the free service and then change their opening page to another
portal. Such users, Kurzweil said, would probably sign up for free
service from a search engine or other general site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assumed that if they're signing up through Simpsons.com
rather than through one of the portals that offer free service,
it's because they're a fan,'' he said.

JACK SEGAL, 98, A TALENT AGENT REPRESENTING THE COLORFUL FRINGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Segal, a talent agent known for booking prodigious numbers
of singers and comedians at hotels in the Catskills and the
personal manager for a menagerie of eccentric and largely
uncelebrated performers, died on Jan. 12 in Livingston, N.J. He was
98 and lived in West Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the basis for `Broadway Danny Rose,' but everybody
thought he was,'' his son, Mort, said of the 1984 Woody Allen film
about a lovable, hard-working but somewhat hapless talent agent.
``My father always used to say, `In addition to the ones that made
it, there are better ones that never got a break.' He looked for
acts far and wide, so people related to him from the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In decades of being on the colorful fringes of show business,
Segal had his brushes with celebrity, working with the likes of
Jackie Mason, Joan Rivers and Buddy Hackett early in their careers.
And some of his more unusual clients _like Pegleg Bates, the
one-legged tap dancer, and Pierce Knox, a blind xylophonist _ were
genuinely gifted.
</P>
<P>
   But he left his biggest impression on generations of Borscht
Belt entertainers _ singers, comedians, animal acts (like the
piano-playing pigeons), novelties (like the harmonica player who
tap-danced on a piano keyboard) and other oddities (like the
stuttering mind reader) _ for whom he found gigs in what once were
dozens if not hundreds of hotels and bungalow colonies in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first agents to insist that hotels house and
feed the acts they employed in addition to paying them; at one
point he and his wife, Shirley, who died in 1986, even opened a
rooming house where entertainers stayed on the nights they worked.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1901, the son of immigrants from Romania, Segal grew up
in Brooklyn. He dropped out of school before he was 10 and held
various jobs before going into show business in the 1920s with a
friend who was a talent agent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, who lives in Wayne, N.J., he is survived
by a daughter, Joan Feldman of Parsippany, N.J., five grandchildren
and eight great-grandchildren.

RAMS HAVE ENOUGH TO SQUEAK PAST BUCS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ This is what can happen when a team gets a little
too smug. Kurt Warner, the league's most valuable player? Three
interceptions. Isaac Bruce, the wide receiver who basically said
the Tampa Bay secondary could not cover his grandmother? Just three
catches. Coach Dick Vermeil, the man who bragged that his offense
had no weaknesses? Stumped.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had averaged 33 points a game this season in what was
one of the most marvelous offensive displays in NFL history. But
the Rams were shut down Sunday by Tampa Bay's physical,
intimidating style of football.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a play late in the fourth quarter of the NF C
championship game that overcame the Rams' dreary offensive
performance and sent them to the Super Bowl next Sunday against the
Tennessee Titans. On third-and-four at the Tampa Bay 30, Warner
connected with wide receiver Ricky Proehl down the left sideline,
the football barely staying within Proehl's grasp as he tumbled
into the end zone for an 11-6 lead with 4 minutes 44 seconds
remaining. It was his first touchdown catch of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay still had a chance to win the game. After an
instant-replay ruling overturned what appeared to be a catch by
wide receiver Bert Emanuel, which would have given Tampa Bay a
first down at the St. Louis 23-yard line, the Buccaneers still had
two more downs. Both times, however, the rookie quarterback Shaun
King was sacked.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams advance to Super Bowl XXXIV against the Titans with the
victory, capping their spectacular but unpredictable season with a
spectacular but unorthodox victory against a great Buccaneers
defense.
</P>
<P>
   No team has a better collection of inspirational stories than
the Rams do. There is Vermeil, the former coach of the Philadelphia
Eagles who retired in 1982 because of burnout; Warner, who was once
unwanted by most teams and played in the Arena Football League; and
Marshall Faulk, who was traded from Indianapolis, but this season
set an NFL record for all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis will most likely be favored to beat the Titans, but to
win the Rams will need to play much better than they did against
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the type of game most had expected. It was a
defensive struggle. The Rams were out of sync, and at one point the
crowd booed the team, especially after they wasted a timeout to
avoid a delay-of-game penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took the lead at 6-5 early in the fourth quarter when
Martin Gramatica kicked a field goal from 23 yards. The field goal
came after a deep pass to Jacquez Green, who also had his face mask
nearly ripped off by defensive back Taje Allen. The penalty tacked
15 yards onto the play, giving Tampa Bay the ball at the Rams' 12.
</P>
<P>
   King was 13 for 29 passing for 163 yards but was intercepted
twice and sacked five times.
</P>
<P>
   While Warner was not sacked, he was pressured all afternoon and
on occasion hit hard after delivering the ball. It was all part of
Tampa Bay's game plan. The Buccaneers wanted to knock Warner
around, and they did, and after a Rams offensive player made a
play, the Buccaneers wanted to batter him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's secondary was brilliant, holding Bruce to one catch
for 7 yards going into the fourth quarter, and only three catches
for 22 yards over all. Warner wound up 26-for-43 passing for 258
yards; Faulk gained only 44 yards on 17 carries and 5 yards on
three receptions.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment of Warner paid off for Tampa Bay with about 12
minutes left in the game. Warner, jittery in the pocket, rushed a
pass down the left sideline to Torry Holt. Defensive back Steve
Kelly stepped in front of the ball and returned the interception to
the St. Louis 42. The Buccaneers were not able to convert the
turnover into points, but had, once again, stopped the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, perhaps more than any other of the final four teams,
was the most talkative, especially Vermeil, who chirped that he
could find few weaknesses in his offense. Two days before playing
Tampa Bay, Bruce criticized the Buccaneers' secondary, specifically
safety John Lynch, saying it was an unimpressive group.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay plays an abundance of ``cover two,'' a type of zone
defense, and thus Lynch plays very little man-to-man in that
coverage. Bruce jumped on this, saying that because of the speed of
the St. Louis wide receivers, Lynch would be forced at times to
cover a receiver one-on-one. The implication was that Lynch was too
slow to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The bragging by Vermeil and Bruce was somewhat surprising. Most
coaches and players tend to make their public comments as bland as
skim milk at this time of year. But their talk said a lot about the
Rams' confidence going into this game. As the second half of the
season unfolded, the Rams began to believe they were unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers took notice, storing away the comments, using
them as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the game, the Tampa Bay defense showed why
it is one of the best in the league. When Warner dropped back to
pass, he was immediately pressured, and a planned screen was
hurried. Tampa Bay defensive lineman Steve White tipped the ball,
then caught the errant pass, giving the Buccaneers the football at
the 20. Tampa Bay could not capitalize with a touchdown but did
take a 3-0 lead after a 25-yard field goal by Gramatica.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that supposedly has few weaknesses on offense, the
Rams looked mortal early on. The reason was Tampa Bay. The
Buccaneers' defense is a hard-hitting, disciplined unit, and when
St. Louis receivers caught passes, they paid for it. The Rams' Holt
was hit so hard in the ribs after making a catch, he had to leave
the game temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay was also doing something that other teams had been
unable to accomplish against St. Louis. Rams players rarely broke
tackles, especially Faulk, who has made a living out of making the
first defender miss, and then the second and third as well. And
Tampa Bay was succeeding even though the Pro Bowl defensive end
Warren Sapp was quiet, thanks to triple teams.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Tampa Bay, as it has been all season, was the
offense. The score was tied at 3-3 after the first quarter, and
then it was a baseball-like 5-3 after Buccaneers center Tony
Mayberry snapped the ball several feet over King's head. As the
ball skipped into his end zone, King made a smart move, batting it
out of play, but it was still a safety, and the Rams got the two
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' offense was shaken. That showed late in the second
quarter when, on fourth-and-one at the Tampa Bay 26, it decided to
try a 44-yard field goal instead of going for the first down. That
would never have happened during the regular season when the Rams
were racking up more than 400 yards of offense a game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wilkins' kick was wide right, and Tampa Bay, at least for a
half, had done exactly what it wanted. It had held the best offense
in football to no touchdowns. &QL;

NOW PRO WRESTLING FANS HAVE A HOME IN TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The long line that snaked down 43rd Street from
Broadway to Eighth Avenue and the screaming fans who rushed to get
inside were reminiscent of the days when Frank Sinatra played the
old Paramount Theater in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   But it was professional wrestlers like the Rock and Chyna, not
pop singers, who climbed out of the limousines last week in front
of 1501 Broadway, once the theater's home, to celebrate the formal
opening of the latest generation of theme restaurant: WWF New York.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the $25 million restaurant, retail store and
entertainment center are betting that their venture with the World
Wrestling Federation can succeed when many other expensive theme
restaurants closed. Most have failed because of poor food,
declining sales and customer indifference.
</P>
<P>
   While wrestling fans lined up in a snowstorm for a chance to get
the Rock's autograph, Robert Griese, one of the owners of WWF New
York, said his 610-seat restaurant would go a step beyond other
theme restaurants, tapping the popularity of professional wrestling
and providing live entertainment, television broadcasts, World
Wrestling Federation T-shirts and dolls, a nightclub and good food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly the same as the old theme restaurant,'' said
Ron Paul, president of Technomic, a restaurant consulting company
based in Chicago. ``They have constantly changing entertainment
available, and if they tie into contemporary TV, maybe there's a
niche. But they better have a concept with lasting appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, less than 48 hours after WWF New York's formal
opening, Planet Hollywood, the chain that touched off the
theme-restaurant fad in the mid-1990s, completed reorganization
under bankruptcy court protection, claiming that it too had a
future. ``We're on our way back,'' said Robert Earl, chairman of
Planet Hollywood. ``We're leaner, meaner and raring to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has abandoned its plans for world domination,
selling or closing 30 restaurants and stores. There will no longer
be a Planet Hollywood Hotel in Times Square. The 50-story hotel, at
47th and Broadway, is nearly finished but will no longer be a
Planet Hollywood site, and WWF New York occupies the very space
where Earl once planned to open a new live music chain, Sound
Republic. He has spruced up the Planet Hollywood menu and interior
design.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to revive the beleaguered chain, Planet Hollywood
also plans to move its flagship restaurant from 57th Street into
the Official All Star Cafe, a site it owns at Broadway and 46th
Street. The All Star, in turn, will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Planet Hollywood's move would be only the latest indication that
the center of gravity for tourism in New York has shifted to Times
Square from 57th Street, where theme restaurants and brand stores
like Warner Bros. proliferated in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains whether WWF New York or a relocated
Planet Hollywood can survive, even in Times Square. Most analysts
say that the first generation of theme restaurants, where
merchandise sales accounted for up to 40 percent of the revenue and
70 percent of the profits, faltered because they overexpanded,
thereby undercutting the chain's appeal, and gave patrons few
reasons to visit more than once.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   WWF New York, like the ESPN Zone, a sports-theme restaurant at
42nd Street and Broadway, has a tie-in to television and a ready
supply of athletes or, as they prefer, entertainers, to attract an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   It may succeed, but analysts are divided over what will happen
to Planet Hollywood. Arnold Ursaner, who follows Planet Hollywood
for CJS Securities, said Earl had refocused the company on food and
entertainment in major cities and tourist markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcy bought them some time,'' Ursaner said. ``They're
only in key markets now and they may be able to recreate some
cachet.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure _ Paul for one. ``You've got to be a real
gambler to bet on this one,'' he said. ``It's far too late to fix
the food.''

TITANS HAVE JAGUARS' NUMBER: IT'S XXXIV
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ With two minutes left and ahead by 19
points, the Tennessee Titans paced their sideline and offered mild
and measured congratulations among themselves. The Titans, though,
looked worried. They wondered if this three-peat against the
Jacksonville Jaguars was really complete, if their apparent spot in
Super Bowl XXXIV would somehow vanish in an odd twist of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Was it truly over?
</P>
<P>
   Had Jacksonville hidden a miracle in its pocket? Or, indeed,
were the Tennessee Titans these playoffs' lone miracle team?
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minute 22 seconds left, Titans linebacker Eddie Robinson
forced a fumble _ the sixth Jacksonville turnover this afternoon _
and cornerback Denard Walker recovered the ball near midfield. Jeff
Fisher, the Tennessee coach, then jumped higher than any player had
managed all afternoon. Fisher leaped into the waiting arms of
Titans place-kicker Al Del Greco. Their embrace was joyful and
their words flowed while focusing on each others' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over with!'' Fisher yelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going!'' Del Greco responded.
</P>
<P>
   To the Super Bowl. To play the St. Louis Rams, 11-6 winners over
Tampa Bay on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As Fisher and Del Greco completed their merry spin, all of the
Tennessee Titans turned Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium into their
house. Their dance floor. Their party. It was fitting, especially
since the Titans had done that all afternoon in a too-physical,
too-confrontational, too-tough game for the Jaguars. It was
Tennessee in a breezy 33-14 victory in the American Football
Conference championship game Sunday before 75,206 fans, the largest
crowd ever in this stadium and the quickest group ever to exit,
exasperated after their Jaguars were disjointed and exposed.
</P>
<P>
   As the game's final seconds ticked away, the Titans _ having
scored the game's final 26 points _ were celebrating on the
sideline full throttle, handshakes and hugs all around. Some
players were even shooting with their own personal video cameras,
savoring the scene, the moments. Out came the AFC championship
shirts and hats. It was bizarre that in this conference
championship title game, with a Super Bowl berth at stake, with
Tennessee on the road trying to beat Jacksonville in a historic
manner, that the final seconds would end this way, not with any
twinge of drama, but so relaxed and carefree for the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   But that was exactly what happened for Tennessee, a team that
has won seven straight games. A team that opened its postseason
with a victory at home in the wild-card game, beating Buffalo on a
miracle lateral on a last-seconds kickoff, on a majestic play when
it seemed there was no Titans pulse, no Titans chance. A team that
won at Indianapolis against Peyton Manning and Edgerrin James and
Marvin Harrison, controlling a dynamic offensive threesome that few
teams contained this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans are a team of destiny and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here today to make history!'' yelled receiver Yancey
Thigpen across the Titans' locker room. Thigpen, who will miss the
Super Bowl because of a broken right foot sustained Sunday, knew
that no team had ever won a conference championship game on the
road as part of a three-games-in-one-season sweep of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee did it Sunday and made glimmering history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in ourselves, we've got a lot of talent, a lot of
depth, team speed and aggressive guys that fly to the ball and with
the ball,'' said Anthony Dorsett, a Titans safety. ``We expected
Jacksonville to start fast. We also expected them to be unable to
sustain that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations became reality.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville exploded to a 7-0 lead. Tennessee tied the game at
7-7. Jacksonville jumped ahead, 14-7, with 4:36 left before
halftime. And then, with 1:34 left, came one of the game's two
signature plays _ the Jaguars' Reggie Barlow fumbled a punt at his
19-yard line that was recovered by Titans safety Steve Jackson.
That play led to Del Greco's 34-yard field goal only 20 seconds
before halftime. The Jacksonville lead at halftime was 4 points
instead of 7.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee absorbed that momentum. It won the third quarter,
16-0. It won the final quarter, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half there were two 1-yard touchdown runs by
quarterback Steve McNair, a safety and Derrick Mason's 80-yard
return of a free kick for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A fast Jacksonville start _ and then a Jaguars crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked all week about matching us as a physical team,''
Thigpen said. ``But their mouth said one thing and their mind said
another. Any time you've already lost twice to a team that stays
close at the start of the next game, you start to doubt yourselves.
That's what they did. They made a lot of mistakes but we forced
them into some of those mistakes. They tried to get physical with
us, but if you haven't played that way all year, how are you going
to do that in one game?''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell, on a
pass from the Tennessee 6, was intercepted in the Tennessee end
zone by safety Marcus Robertson. (Robertson later broke his left
ankle and, like Thigpen, will miss the Super Bowl.) And then, to
end the half, there was the Barlow fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked up, they weren't that close to me,'' Barlow
said. ``But those guys came full speed and after I dropped it, I
should have just fallen on it. I messed up. I catch balls like that
every day during the week, in practice before the game, and that
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first two turnovers, Jacksonville was tight. It would
make four more for a total of two interceptions and four fumbles.
It would commit nine penalties for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties, the turnovers, you're not going to win football
games that way,'' said Tom Coughlin, the Jacksonville coach. ``They
work you to the point where you are the team that makes the errors.
When we play them, we find the way to make the errors. However it
happens, when we play Tennessee, we get a little out of our element
and we turn the ball over, for whatever reason. We were never able
to get the crowd back in the game and energize ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the stern Tennessee defense and the marvelous legs of
McNair that helped bury Jacksonville for good. In addition to
scoring twice in the second half, he offered the game's second
signature play in spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It was McNair's third-and-1 run of 51 yards to the Jacksonville
1 that set up his final 1-yard touchdown run, with 6:59 left. It
put the game squarely in Tennessee's hands. McNair scrambled nine
times for 91 yards, outrushing running back and teammate Eddie
George (25 carries, 86 yards).
</P>
<P>
   And McNair did it with a sore big toe that had hampered him in
practice all week. McNair passed for a touchdown and ran for two
more and that easily offset Brunell's 226 passing yards and minus-1
rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville too frequently lost both line battles. It got
pushed around more than it shoved. It could not effectively tackle
McNair.
</P>
<P>
   The game proved too big for too many Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fourth quarter came, they couldn't score and pretty
much knew it was over,'' Tennessee safety Blaine Bishop said.
``They knew we had their number.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans are made of miracles and more.

 &HT;    BATTLE LOOMS IN CONGRESS OVER COLLEGE SPORTS BETTING

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is gearing up for a battle over whether to
outlaw gambling on college sports, with the politically powerful
gaming industry opposing legislation that colleges say would
protect their students.
</P>
<P>
   National Collegiate Athletic Association members were rocked by
eight major point-shaving scandals during the 1990s, as many as in
the previous 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of the NCAA, the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission recommended to Congress last year that wagering on
collegiate and amateur athletic events be banned.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sens. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., plan to introduce a bill that would ban gambling on high
school and college sports, as well as the Summer and Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must protect the integrity of high school and college
athletics and reduce the unseemly influences that gambling has on
our student athletes,'' Brownback said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last moved to restrict sports wagering in 1991, banning
it in all states except Oregon, Nevada and Delaware. Oregon allows
wagering on football through a lottery, and Delaware, despite a
1976 public vote approving it, has not adopted sports betting.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the bulk of sports betting in Nevada, where $2.3
billion is wagered legally each year on sporting events, one-third
of it on college athletics. The NCAA men's basketball tournament
each March and football bowl games account for between $50 to $60
million each.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming
Association, said the Brownback-Leahy bill would cost Nevada's
economy thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ``would be a crippling blow to our industry,'' agreed
Pete Korner, operations manager of Las Vegas Sports Consultants, an
independently owned odds-making firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf said that when Congress holds hearings on the bill,
he will argue that instead of banning college sports wagering,
colleges should focus on rooting out illegal bookmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every college campus in America, there is an illegal
student bookie taking bets on college games,'' Fahrenkopf said in
an interview. ``So what the NCAA and the senators are talking about
is what's going on at (the institutions), not Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing'' to work with the NCAA if given the chance,
Fahrenkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that once during the 1994 basketball season,
bookmakers in Nevada discovered that the betting pattern on Arizona
State University changed tremendously, and the bookies alerted the
FBI. That led to the arrest of two players who pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Dixon, NCAA director of federal relations, acknowledged
that the gaming industry was responsible for blowing the whistle on
the players. But if gambling on games had been illegal, she said,
the players might not have been involved at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you did alert the FBI, but it was only after the damage
had been done,'' Dixon said. ``By helping put those kids in jail,
you only help end their careers and whatever opportunities they may
have had. (The gaming industry's) whole reason for being is to make
money, not to protect the students. We are trying to protect our
students.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf responded that if the Association is trying to
protect students, ``why hasn't it required the schools to put in
place programs to educate the students?''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said the NCAA acknowledges that it is responsible for
imposing stiffer penalties and educating students. She said the
organization is working with the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators to educate students about the dangers of
gambling. In addition, the NCAA requires TV networks to air
anti-gambling public service messages during games.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA also funded a study on gambling behavior that found
that wagering on college sports is a gateway for many gambling
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   In different study released last year by the University of
Michigan, a survey of 750 male and female student athletes found
that 72 percent had gambled in some form since entering college. Of
that, 80 percent were males.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the student athletes said they wagered $57.25 on a
single sporting event through a bookmaker. Those same students
gambled $225 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight percent of student athletes said they had wagered at
a casino, while 35 percent bet on sports. Five percent said they
provided inside information for gambling purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Student athletes wager so much money because their judgment is
not always as sound as adults', Dixon said. ``They are big in size,
but they are kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said that because gambling is legal in Nevada, most
newspapers publish betting lines for college games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every school can be listed for people to bet on them, and we
feel that's wrong,'' Dixon said. ``All the students have to do is
open the paper and find out the betting lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the gambling bill is introduced, Fahrenkopf said his
office has contacted several senators about it.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that one was Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is
in charge of raising campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone on my staff may have spoken with someone on his
staff,'' Fahrenkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the public interest group Public Citizen, in recent
election cycles the casino gambling industry has contributed a
total of $4.23 million to three national Republican Party election
committees, while the corresponding Democratic Party committees
received $2.29 million.

GRANNY D MAKING IMPACT IN WALK FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Few followed when Doris ``Granny D'' Haddock set out from
Pasadena a year ago on a cross-country trek for campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive activist, trudging through the first major winter
snow to sock the East, now has the ear of Congress and presidential
candidates Bill Bradley and John McCain. The national magazine
George ranks her among the most fascinating women in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock expects to cross the 3,000-mile mark today in
Cumberland, Md., where she will celebrate her 90th birthday. She's
coming around the mountain with 200 miles remaining to the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Alice in Wonderland, I can't really believe it,''
Haddock said from a snowbound home in aptly named Frostburg, Md.
``It's madness, absolute madness. But here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming bouts of pneumonia and a troublesome bunion on her
left big toe, Haddock has mostly kept to a 10-mile-a-day pace since
leaving Pasadena in the wake of the Tournament of Roses Parade on
New Year's Day 1999.
</P>
<P>
   She's aiming for a Feb. 29 arrival in Washington. Legions of
supporters ``Granny's angels'' -- from across the nation are
expected to join Haddock for the last stretch of her walk, from
Arlington National Cemetery down the Capital Mall and along K
Street -- home to major lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The retired shoe company clerk from southern New Hampshire has
come a long way in both distance and impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as a river starts with a drop of water, I hope the
efforts of Granny D will build into a stream of public support for
campaign finance reform that flows into Washington and washes our
democracy clean of special interest money,'' Bradley, the former
Senate Democrat from New Jersey, said in a statement during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of her,'' McCain said during his campaign. ``It
tells me that I have to do a better job of making connections to
Americans, the way Granny D does.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates credit Haddock with helping generate
a grass-roots movement to ban large, unregulated contributions
known as soft money. Both political parties have used soft money to
influence presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Bradley on the stump in Claremont, N.H., that
October day was Haddock, making one of the many side trips that
have delayed her trek but bolstered her activism.
</P>
<P>
   On another, she made an early appearance in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Haddock walked with McCain and Sen. Russell Feingold
from their offices to the U.S. Senate for the opening debate on
their campaign finance reform legislation. Joining the Republican
from Arizona and Democrat from Wisconsin were the House sponsors of
a broader reform measure, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was pretty funny, this old lady walking with
them. But it made me feel that I was maybe making a mark,'' she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Being there was not enough. Haddock demonstrated her activism
and delivered personal letters to all 100 senators urging fairness
and an open mind in considering the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure died even though it was stripped down to focus on
soft money after it passed the House. Supporters fell seven votes
short of the 60 needed to end a Republican filibuster and force a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the great-grandmother who once trembled when speaking to
crowds vows to take her reform crusade through the political
campaign season. She is convinced a soft-money ban is a year or two
from passage and that public financing will follow in decades to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to rattle some more cages around the states,'' she
said. ``There's no sense in stopping while you're rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddock has challenged all members of Congress to sign a 25-word
pledge to support the soft-money ban. She will target those who
don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to proceed now is to change a few minds or change
a few seats and she's going to try to do both,'' said Dennis Burke,
director of Arizona Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was one of the first volunteers to help Haddock, who
initially set out with a 25-pound backpack and planned to camp when
she couldn't find hosts or lodging for a night. Burke would find
lodging on the route ahead and rented a camper so Haddock could
have meals and rests during her daily walks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Granny D entourage has included at least a
driver and often several supporters walking with her.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock's faith in people has been continually rewarded.
``Granny's Angels'' number more than 200, and more will follow in
the miles to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we were fortunate,'' said Susan Conley, who
hosted Haddock over Thanksgiving in Cincinnati, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Conley's two young sons were particularly fascinated with
Haddock. They asked her a lot of questions about why she's walking
across the country and why people get involved in causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they will talk about her for years,'' Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   For Haddock, days and nights walking and resting with strangers
drawn to her has become a love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Morgantown, W.V., she remembered Sandy Pierce, mayor
of tiny Parker, Ariz. Haddock recalled how Pierce embraced campaign
finance reform after they met and then introduced her around town
as a defender of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, all I would have to do is smile and shake hands after
Sandy introduced me. People would immediately see that what I was
doing, did, in fact, relate to serious issues that disturbed them
too,'' Haddock recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Her honors have been many. Haddock has received too many city
keys to count, thrown out the first pitch for a minor league
baseball game, been feted at a rodeo and joined several parades.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Haddock was asked to speak during her home state's
commemoration of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire officially recognized the national holiday for the
first time this year. The state's civil rights coalition invited
Haddock, knowing she has drawn inspiration from the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great day. Doris has a deep commitment to what is
fundamental to all progress in America,'' said John Rauh, a New
Hampshire political activist who walked with Haddock through
stretches of Arkansas and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am almost finished with this walk, but I am far from
finished with this work,'' Haddock said.

EDITORIAL: ONE LAST YEAR AT 1600 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 24:
</P>
<P>
   As he commented on the end of his seventh year in office last
week, President Clinton professed to be ``feeling good and
grateful'' about his time in the White House, and he spoke about
his eagerness ``to milk every last moment of every day.'' For all
that, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue seems to radiate an aura of
isolation and missed opportunities these days. Presidential friends
speak of his ``lonely voice'' on the telephone. Clinton's two
closest political associates _ Vice President Al Gore and Hillary
Rodham Clinton _ do not want him hovering as they launch their new
careers. The image of a home-alone presidency was reinforced when
Clinton was asked if he felt mournful about starting his final year
in the White House. ``When I go in a room in the White House now I
look around more carefully to make sure . . . that I've actually
noticed something that I may not have seen.'' He added, ``I wish I
didn't have to sleep at all for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all retiring presidents, Clinton will experience a cruelly
abrupt loss of power at this time next year. But the winding down
of this presidency _ a 12-month process that began last Thursday _
has its own special poignancy. Clinton entered office on a wave of
generational optimism that was tamped down by incrementalism,
triangulation, partisanship and the devastating X-factor of his own
indiscipline. Nothing he said in his first Inaugural Address about
breaking the hold of special interests in Washington will be quoted
as often as ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky.'' Friends and political allies speak with increasing
openness about how he disappointed them. Historians are beginning
to categorize Clinton as a politician of splendid natural talent
and some significant accomplishments who nonetheless missed the
greatness that once seemed within his grasp. All this contributes
to the wistful aura at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and to the
president's obsessive determination to continue work on his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself recently joked that given peoples' fondness for
alliteration, ``It's just one small step from legacy to lame
duck.'' Yet he does not need Congress to add positive checkmarks to
his record through executive actions on the environment and through
international diplomacy. A lasting Middle East peace would be an
indisputable accomplishment. Congressional Republicans will clearly
resist the ambitious domestic agenda that Clinton is expected to
lay out Thursday in his final State of the Union address. But by
pushing for broader health-insurance coverage, expansion of the
earned-income tax credit, Medicare drug benefits, a patients' bill
of rights and a higher minimum wage, Clinton can keep himself in
the thick of the political game for most of the campaign year. Some
supporters would like to see him use the political freedom of this
last roundup to take another crack on truly tough issues like as
gays in the military, gun control, campaign finance or a revival of
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of one more State of the Union address seems to
have brightened the president's mood. He has promised some
surprises beyond the items that have already been revealed. A
graceful final year and the choice of a dignified post-presidential
career could partially restore the respect Clinton squandered.
Nothing that happens in the next 12 months, however, seems likely
to alter the enduring puzzle of his life and a political career
that aimed to bring fundamental change to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Arkansas boy who shook Jack Kennedy's hand and then
achieved the dream inspired by that moment not do more with his
hard-won opportunity? History will give him due credit for
preserving peace, for presiding over prosperous times, for
balancing the budget, ushering in welfare reform and pushing free
trade. But Clinton, who aspired to be a social-legislation pioneer,
has not so far achieved his transforming victory on health care.
With seven years gone, he seems to have no guaranteed hold on the
affections of the American people. He has not established a
trademark leadership style that other presidential aspirants are
eager to embrace. He will, to be sure, be remembered for stirring
speeches and good intentions. But the betting today would have to
be that the rooms and hallways that Clinton says he is trying to
fix in his memory will always be haunted by sad questions about
what might have been. &QL;

RAMS HAVE ENOUGH TO SQUEAK PAST BUCS
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS ``triple-teaming'' to ``double-teaming'' in graf
beginning: Tampa Bay was also doing something...) 
 (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ This is what can happen when a team gets a little
too smug. Kurt Warner, the league's most valuable player? Three
interceptions. Isaac Bruce, the wide receiver who basically said
the Tampa Bay secondary could not cover his grandmother? Just three
catches. Coach Dick Vermeil, the man who bragged that his offense
had no weaknesses? Stumped.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had averaged 33 points a game this season in what was
one of the most marvelous offensive displays in NFL history. But
the Rams were shut down Sunday by Tampa Bay's physical,
intimidating style of football.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a play late in the fourth quarter of the NF C
championship game that overcame the Rams' dreary offensive
performance and sent them to the Super Bowl next Sunday against the
Tennessee Titans. On third-and-four at the Tampa Bay 30, Warner
connected with wide receiver Ricky Proehl down the left sideline,
the football barely staying within Proehl's grasp as he tumbled
into the end zone for an 11-6 lead with 4 minutes 44 seconds
remaining. It was his first touchdown catch of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay still had a chance to win the game. After an
instant-replay ruling overturned what appeared to be a catch by
wide receiver Bert Emanuel, which would have given Tampa Bay a
first down at the St. Louis 23-yard line, the Buccaneers still had
two more downs. Both times, however, the rookie quarterback Shaun
King was sacked.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams advance to Super Bowl XXXIV against the Titans with the
victory, capping their spectacular but unpredictable season with a
spectacular but unorthodox victory against a great Buccaneers
defense.
</P>
<P>
   No team has a better collection of inspirational stories than
the Rams do. There is Vermeil, the former coach of the Philadelphia
Eagles who retired in 1982 because of burnout; Warner, who was once
unwanted by most teams and played in the Arena Football League; and
Marshall Faulk, who was traded from Indianapolis, but this season
set an NFL record for all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis will most likely be favored to beat the Titans, but to
win the Rams will need to play much better than they did against
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the type of game most had expected. It was a
defensive struggle. The Rams were out of sync, and at one point the
crowd booed the team, especially after they wasted a timeout to
avoid a delay-of-game penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took the lead at 6-5 early in the fourth quarter when
Martin Gramatica kicked a field goal from 23 yards. The field goal
came after a deep pass to Jacquez Green, who also had his face mask
nearly ripped off by defensive back Taje Allen. The penalty tacked
15 yards onto the play, giving Tampa Bay the ball at the Rams' 12.
</P>
<P>
   King was 13 for 29 passing for 163 yards but was intercepted
twice and sacked five times.
</P>
<P>
   While Warner was not sacked, he was pressured all afternoon and
on occasion hit hard after delivering the ball. It was all part of
Tampa Bay's game plan. The Buccaneers wanted to knock Warner
around, and they did, and after a Rams offensive player made a
play, the Buccaneers wanted to batter him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's secondary was brilliant, holding Bruce to one catch
for 7 yards going into the fourth quarter, and only three catches
for 22 yards over all. Warner wound up 26-for-43 passing for 258
yards; Faulk gained only 44 yards on 17 carries and 5 yards on
three receptions.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment of Warner paid off for Tampa Bay with about 12
minutes left in the game. Warner, jittery in the pocket, rushed a
pass down the left sideline to Torry Holt. Defensive back Steve
Kelly stepped in front of the ball and returned the interception to
the St. Louis 42. The Buccaneers were not able to convert the
turnover into points, but had, once again, stopped the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, perhaps more than any other of the final four teams,
was the most talkative, especially Vermeil, who chirped that he
could find few weaknesses in his offense. Two days before playing
Tampa Bay, Bruce criticized the Buccaneers' secondary, specifically
safety John Lynch, saying it was an unimpressive group.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay plays an abundance of ``cover two,'' a type of zone
defense, and thus Lynch plays very little man-to-man in that
coverage. Bruce jumped on this, saying that because of the speed of
the St. Louis wide receivers, Lynch would be forced at times to
cover a receiver one-on-one. The implication was that Lynch was too
slow to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The bragging by Vermeil and Bruce was somewhat surprising. Most
coaches and players tend to make their public comments as bland as
skim milk at this time of year. But their talk said a lot about the
Rams' confidence going into this game. As the second half of the
season unfolded, the Rams began to believe they were unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers took notice, storing away the comments, using
them as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the game, the Tampa Bay defense showed why
it is one of the best in the league. When Warner dropped back to
pass, he was immediately pressured, and a planned screen was
hurried. Tampa Bay defensive lineman Steve White tipped the ball,
then caught the errant pass, giving the Buccaneers the football at
the 20. Tampa Bay could not capitalize with a touchdown but did
take a 3-0 lead after a 25-yard field goal by Gramatica.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that supposedly has few weaknesses on offense, the
Rams looked mortal early on. The reason was Tampa Bay. The
Buccaneers' defense is a hard-hitting, disciplined unit, and when
St. Louis receivers caught passes, they paid for it. The Rams' Holt
was hit so hard in the ribs after making a catch, he had to leave
the game temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay was also doing something that other teams had been
unable to accomplish against St. Louis. Rams players rarely broke
tackles, especially Faulk, who has made a living out of making the
first defender miss, and then the second and third as well. And
Tampa Bay was succeeding even though the Pro Bowl defensive end
Warren Sapp was quiet, thanks to double teams.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Tampa Bay, as it has been all season, was the
offense. The score was tied at 3-3 after the first quarter, and
then it was a baseball-like 5-3 after Buccaneers center Tony
Mayberry snapped the ball several feet over King's head. As the
ball skipped into his end zone, King made a smart move, batting it
out of play, but it was still a safety, and the Rams got the two
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' offense was shaken. That showed late in the second
quarter when, on fourth-and-one at the Tampa Bay 26, it decided to
try a 44-yard field goal instead of going for the first down. That
would never have happened during the regular season when the Rams
were racking up more than 400 yards of offense a game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wilkins' kick was wide right, and Tampa Bay, at least for a
half, had done exactly what it wanted. It had held the best offense
in football to no touchdowns. &QL;

A BAD DAY AT THE OFFICE DRIVES THE JAGUARS OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell was
asked to pinpoint the moment it all started to slip away, the play
that irrevocably turned the tide in Sunday's American Football
Conference championship game and swept the Jaguars out of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And so he began his chronicle of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were bad reads, bad blocks, bad throws,'' Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
   There was bad everything for the Jaguars, a team that scorched
Miami for 62 points only a week ago but Sunday self-destructed
after being physically overwhelmed by Tennessee. The Jaguars turned
the ball over six times. Four of the turnovers came in the second
half, when the game got away from Jacksonville entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars were penalized for 100 yards, 83 in the second half.
They dropped passes as if the ball had just come out of the
microwave, allowed a safety and gave up a kick return for a
touchdown on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the second half,'' Jaguars Coach Tom Coughlin said.
``We were never able to put anything together to get the crowd back
in the game and energize ourselves and keep us from shooting
ourselves in the foot. You worry early on when you have a turnover
and a penalty negates a turnover. You think, `I hope it's not going
to be that kind of day.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day. Still, Jacksonville led by 14-10 at
halftime, although the Jaguars' first drive of the third quarter
ended on an incomplete pass. Brunell had 19 of those, although at
least a dozen seemed to bounce off his receivers' hands or chests.
</P>
<P>
   On Tennessee's first drive of the third quarter, two penalties
for a total of 43 yards meant that the Jaguars essentially grabbed
the Titans' hands and pulled them downfield. One came after a
15-yard Steve McNair completion to Eddie George for a first down.
But because of a roughing-the-passer penalty on Tony Brackens,
Tennessee wound up at Jacksonville's 35-yard-line.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans gained just 1 yard on first down, and McNair's pass
to Kevin Dyson on second down was incomplete. But Fernando Bryant
was penalized for pushing off on Dyson down the right sideline,
giving the Titans the ball on Jacksonville's 6-yard line. Two plays
later, the Titans scored to begin their roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penalty, penalty, penalty,'' Coughlin said. ``We escorted them
the length of the field, and they finished it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Jaguars had to play catch-up, which forced them out of
their conservative game plan. Brunell threw incomplete on first
down. He failed to complete another pass on second down, but
offensive lineman Ben Coleman was called for a false start to back
up the Jaguars five yards more. On second-and-15, Brunell completed
a throw to tight end Kyle Brady. But linebacker Eddie Robinson
grabbed Brady and forced a fumble, which was recovered by the
Titans.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans did not score on that drive because tight end Fred
Wycheck fumbled on the Jaguars' 1-yard line as he was struggling to
score. But in the next 1 minute 5 seconds, the Jaguars' season
effectively ended. With Jacksonville trying to jam the ball out of
its own red zone, Fred Taylor gained nothing up the middle. The
Jaguars took a timeout. On second down, Brunell backed up to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called a maximum protection scheme, we kept everybody in
except the two wide receivers,'' Coughlin said. ``We got the
coverage we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Titans left tackle Josh Evans had been set loose and, as he
got to Brunell, his teammate, right tackle Jason Fisk, was there to
meet him. They sacked Brunell for a safety to make the score 19-14.
On the free kick that followed, the Titans' Derrick Mason caught
the ball at the 20, juked past Jason Craft _ the only player with a
legitimate shot at him _ and was gone for a touchdown. Suddenly,
the Titans' lead was 12 points with five minutes left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell went into the shotgun even on short-yardage situations
as the Jaguars abandoned the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get out of your element like that, the numbers may
look good, but it's not the quality game,'' Coughlin said. ``When
you're in a mode of almost needing two scores, you're exposed not
only because you're going to throw on every down, but because there
is more of a chance of turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   The next drive ended with an incomplete pass on fourth down. And
the one after that ended on a Brunell interception after the drive
had sputtered early because of two consecutive penalties. The
Titans scored off that interception to complete the scoring and
send the Jaguars into their devastated locker room.
</P>
<P>
   There, Taylor insisted that Tennessee deserved only a small bit
of credit for the victory because, he reasoned, Jacksonville is
still the better team and gave the game away with turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have got to learn in a game of this magnitude, you
can't afford turnovers,'' offensive lineman Leon Searcy said. ``If
you don't play error-free football, you're going to get beat.
Everything started rolling downhill. Turnovers, safety, kickoff
returns, breakdowns. We didn't have too many breakdowns, but all
you need is a couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has our number. They own the Jaguars right now.''

TAMPA BAY LETS SECRET SLIP AWAY AT WRONG TIME
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had been keeping a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rams didn't think they could be stopped,'' said Buccaneers
safety John Lynch. ``The secret was that we knew they were wrong.
And we were positive we could prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all but the final five minutes of Sunday's NFC championship
game, the Buccaneers had not only kept their secret, they had kept
their promise. Tampa Bay's defense had held St. Louis'
record-setting offense to one field goal.
</P>
<P>
   But on a third-down-and-four, with 4 minutes 44 seconds left in
a game Tampa Bay led by one point, the Buccaneers' defense made the
mistake that would cost them a trip to the Super Bowl. The
Buccaneers blitzed, leaving cornerback Brian Kelly alone to cover
Rams receiver Ricky Proehl.
</P>
<P>
   Rams quarterback Kurt Warner recognized the advantage and threw
the football into the end zone for Proehl, who outjumped Kelly for
the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Proehl made the pivotal play in the Rams' 11-6 victory an
instant before a sprinting Lynch arrived from the middle of the
field _ back-up help that was a step tardy to salvage 55 minutes of
brilliant defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had stopped them like we did,'' Lynch said after the
game. ``Then again, we didn't stop them for the whole game. That's
all it takes sometimes _ one play and you lose. That's the story of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Buccaneers did not blitz often their gamble on the
game's only touchdown was a calculated risk. At the 30-yard line,
the Rams, who trailed, 6-5, were in field-goal range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to either get them out of field goal range or make
it a longer kick,'' Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said of his
strategy. ``It's a bitter pill because we did so much of what we
wanted to do. But in the end, they found a way into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Tampa Bay disrupted the Rams' offensive
timing. Defensive end Steve White deflected and then intercepted
Warner's first pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see him,'' Warner said of White. ``It wouldn't be the
last time something like that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who completed 26 of 43 passes for 258 yards, was
intercepted three times. The Buccaneers defensive game plan was to
stop running back Marshall Faulk in his early rushing attempts,
which worked as Faulk had only 44 yards on 17 carries. Then they
took the Rams' top receiver Isaac Bruce out of the game _ he had
only two catches for 8 yards in the first three quarters and only
three for 22 yards in the game. And finally, they collapsed the
pocket on Warner, who had to rush a lot of his decision making.
</P>
<P>
   When Kelly intercepted a Warner pass intended for Torry Holt
early in the fourth quarter _ another pass Warner hurried _ it
looked like the Buccaneers, who were nearly two touchdown
underdogs, were going to pull off the biggest pro football upset
since last year's NFC title game, when Atlanta beat Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly might have been thinking that way. He taunted the Rams
bench, doing an impersonation of the Rams' receivers touchdown
dance, near their sideline. After Proehl caught his touchdown, the
video screen on the Trans World Dome scoreboard displayed a tape of
Kelly's dance from earlier in the quarter and added the words: Not
in our house.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly didn't discuss his antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was in good position,'' he said of Proehl's
touchdown. ``I was stumbling a little bit and couldn't really jump
like I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was obvious disappointment in the Buccaneers locker
room, there was clearly a sense of satisfaction, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gave us a chance,'' defensive end Warren Sapp said.
``But we told you it would be a war and it was a war. We went toe
to toe with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in most of their 12 victories this year, the Buccaneers
defense could be counted on for one or two game-changing plays.
They did not get them Sunday. Sapp, for example, was double-teamed
for most of the game and did not have a tackle or a sack.
</P>
<P>
   The one game-changing play belonged to the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We surprised them, I think,'' Lynch said. ``I don't know if
they thought we could do that to them. But you have to give them
credit. They got us back with that one play.''

COMMENTARY: BRADLEY'S RESURGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct syntax in sentence beginning `Gore has been
able...)  
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A couple of months ago, Al Gore was suffering the
tortures of the media-damned.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was derided for running a Washington-based
campaign with a sclerotic staff. He was falling behind in fund
raising. He was seen by even his knee-jerk union supporters as the
Ultimate Stiff. He was overpaying media advisers to give him an
earth-tone transplant to turn him into an Alpha Male.
</P>
<P>
   At that nadir moment, a piece appeared in this space headed
``The Gore Comeback.'' Based on the pendulum theory of political
popularity, as well as on the media's needs for a spirited contest,
it laid out the likelihood of a roaring return of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   See? The contrarian theory sometimes works. The loosened-up,
slashing debater, supposedly advised to press the flesh by his
daughter (a reliance on family advice that didn't help Boris
Yeltsin), is now the favorite to win in Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   As promised here back then, the moment has come to reveal the
blueprint for the ``Bradley resurgence.'' (The best advice for
lefties comes from righties, because we're not emotionally
involved.)
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's media problem is that the bloom is off his
challenger's rose. A savage analysis in The Washington Post derides
his attempt to overcome in photo ops what had been criticized as
aloofness. He is pilloried as well for not running the gentle,
intellectual, sure-fire-loser's campaign he promised at the start.
On top of all that, his ticker's been kicking up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's personal problem is that he has been much too
comfortable in his own skin. This internal easiness is not the
attribute it is cracked up to be. Rather than merely being himself,
Bradley must become Himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: Stop complaining about Gore's exaggeration about the
cost of your big-idea proposals. The let's-not-go-negative pitch is
posited by goo-goos who don't vote. Instead, embrace the ``upbeat
negative'': attacking the other guy's cheap, weaselly, crackbrained
ideas is a necessary counterpoint to presenting your own.
</P>
<P>
   In going upbeat negative, don't dredge up ancient history about
Gore's first use of Willie Horton. In this week's debate, be
realistic about the great danger to Democrats in the fall campaign:
Gore's shameful record in abetting Clinton's 1996 political money
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   When a huge GOP ad campaign zaps fund-raisers by Gore at
Buddhist temples; when Gore's ``no controlling legal authority'' TV
clips become as familiar as the clip of Clinton's finger-wagging
lie; when new facts emerge about Clinton-Gore fund-raising
predations, Democrats in 2000 will suffer from ``Clinton-Gore
fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Your central point to Democrats: Gore Can't Win. Recount the
influence-peddling charges sure to come from Republicans as
stipulated in Orrin Hatch's recent damning speech. When all this
sleaze was going on, where was Al? Up to his hips in it. Where were
you? Miles away, earning an honest living.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been able to portray your revulsion at this kind of
contracts-and-China-policy and Lincoln-bedroom-for-sale as being
characteristic of a ``quitter.'' Don't let him get away with that
twist: He's the one who stayed and choked. Only a Democrat who is
clean of the scandals can win. That's you.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the dire outside possibility of a McCain candidacy:
Because he would have the independents, and Republicans would
``come home,'' McCain would clobber Gore and carry the House with
him. Only you, unencumbered by the baggage of the impeachment
trauma, could compete with McCain for the decisive swing vote. And
if the market bubble pops in October, the GOP can't blame you.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, be a real Democrat and promise the moon. Where's your
``I see an America where'' speech? Let's hear those ideals, boiled
down to a triple pledge: health insurance for all, the end of gun
violence, a new era of honest politics not dominated by fat cats.
</P>
<P>
   Use your big war chest now to create spots that take up that
simple, triple theme. Your low-key delivery can be at its most
effective if the words uplift. Contrast Gore's strident
niggardliness with your sincere generosity. And don't look guilty
about taking the good fight to the front-runner: It shows you're
able, as Gore was, to get up off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Go to it, fellas. I'll hold your coats.

ECUADOR'S NEW PRESIDENT SWORN IN &HT;     

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
QUITO, Ecuador _ After a weekend rebellion forced out a president
and briefly ushered in a military junta, Ecuadoreans have turned to
a low-key lawyer to lead them back from the abyss.
<P>
   ``Today, I had a dream. Today, I dream of a different country, a
new country,'' said President Gustavo Noboa, who arrived at the
national palace Sunday to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa was sworn in after the ouster of President Jamil Mahuad on
Friday in a military-backed coup. But the coup leaders decided to
give way to Noboa, who was Mahuad's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, calm prevailed across the country. Stores reopened,
buses and taxis were back on the streets, and thousands of
anti-government protesters, who converged on Quito last week, had
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa named the first five members of his Cabinet and flew to
his home in the Pacific coast city of Guayaquil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ecuadorean government has returned to normal,'' said
Francisco Huerta, the newly appointed minister of government.
``Stability is guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stable is how many observers describe Noboa.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Roman Catholic, the 62-year-old Noboa comes from a
family of public servants. A distant relative was once president of
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa's heroes include the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
Abraham Lincoln. In fact, he said, he styles his beard to look like
Lincoln's. Noboa was governor of Guayas state, and law professor
and rector of the Catholic University in Guayaquil. He also was a
member of the government commission that negotiated the end to a
long border war with Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mahuad, who dithered so long before making decisions that
cartoonists depicted him as Shakespeare's Hamlet, Noboa appears to
have a sense of mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mahuad never said what he was going to do,'' said political
analyst Simon Pachano. ``Noboa is already defining his path.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Noboa was vice president for 17 months, he was not part
of Mahuad's inner circle and kept his office in Guayaquil rather
than Quito, the capital. He spent much of his time supervising the
rebuilding of coastal roads damaged by floods during the 1997 El
Nino weather pattern.
</P>
<P>
   With Ecuador mired in its worst economic crisis in 70 years,
Noboa further distanced himself from the unpopular Mahuad. In fact,
he was so out of the loop that he learned about Friday's coup
through TV reports.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the strategy paid off, allowing Noboa to come across
as a newcomer rather than as a retread from a failed government,
said Fernando Bustamante, a political science professor at San
Francisco University near Quito.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noboa didn't want to get burned,'' Bustamante said. ``He
always thought that this could happen and that he had to be
untainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Mahuad, Noboa has vowed to pursue free-market reforms to
resurrect the economy. But the opposition-controlled Congress
rejected most of Mahuad's initiatives, and the resulting gridlock
has been one of the main reasons for the current economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Noboa may enjoy a brief honeymoon with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close to having a dictatorship, and now the Congress
is scared about what could happen,'' said a Quito banker who
requested anonymity. ``In this atmosphere, it's easier to get
things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Nebot, leader of the powerful Social Christian party,
warned that Noboa could be in for a rough term if he ignores the
poor, tries to raise taxes, or focuses on paying off Ecuador's
debt. ``If we have a government that's concerned only about the
holders of Ecuador's foreign debt, I will have to say `no.' My
party will have to say `no,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Noboa said he would go forward with a controversial
plan proposed by Mahuad to scrap the local currency for the U.S.
dollar. In the past year, the sucre has fallen from 7,000 to 25,000
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa also said he would address the concerns of impoverished
Indians, farmers and other Ecuadoreans who were involved in last
week's protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here have suffered... They have been tricked and have
good reason not to believe'' in the government, Noboa said in an
interview on Ecuadorean television.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa also pledged to stamp out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mahuad was accused of accepting millions of dollars
in campaign donations from a banker who later benefited from a
multi-billion-dollar government bailout of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to be personally involved in this issue,'' Noboa
said. ``There are honest bankers but what has happened in this
country is very grave... We have witnessed outrages.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Noboa was magnanimous when asked about Mahuad's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that Mahuad was intelligent... and someone
that the country needed,'' Noboa said. ``I'm very sad about what
happened. I think he deserved better.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Craig Claiborne, who emerged from the Mississippi
Delta to become the nation's pre-eminent food journalist, and whose
writings coaxed millions of meat-and-potato Americans to the table
of fine cuisine, died Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center. He was 79 and lived in East Hampton, N.Y., and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne joined The New York Times in 1957 and for 29 years
served as both its food editor and, intermittently, its restaurant
critic. During that time, Claiborne, more than any writer of his
day, introduced gastronomically sheltered Americans to the greatest
chefs of France, Italy and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Through his recipes and more than 20 books, many with his
colleague Pierre Franey, he encouraged home cooks to broaden their
culinary horizons. Along the way, he created a widely imitated
system of restaurant criticism that is standard practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's reviews for The Times, which concluded by rating a
restaurant on a four-star scale after repeated visits, were a
striking change for American newspapers, most of which considered
restaurant reviewing a feckless adjunct of the advertising
department.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Claiborne's most notorious gastronomic adventure was his
$4,000 dinner in Paris, in November 1975, the result of a winning
bid on a television fund-raiser. Reports of the 31-course meal for
two built his reputation for audacity and panache but also garnered
widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne retired from The Times in 1986 and continued to write
books, to travel and to lecture. Perhaps his most enduring work is
``The New York Times Cookbook,'' which was published in 1961 and
has sold more than a million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's laconic and diffident manner belied a flamboyant,
even whimsical spirit. He gave extravagant birthday parties for
himself on ocean liners and in restaurants; and he frequently held
the most lavish _ and celebrity-studded _ dinner soirees at his
home in East Hampton. A man of robust passions and, at times,
confounding candor, he wore his tumultuous personal life on his
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was born in the hamlet of Sunflower, Miss., on Sept.
4, 1920. His father's financial setbacks forced the family to move
several times, eventually to the nearby town of Indianola, where
his mother, Kathleen, established a boarding house. It was here
that the young Craig Claiborne became fascinated with the heady
alchemy of cooking. Kathleen Claiborne was described by her son
years later as a born cook, especially adept at the rib-sticking
foods of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   While he grew up to travel the world, Claiborne always clung to
his Southern roots, in conversation, in writing and in recipes. In
1987 he published ``Craig Claiborne's Southern Cooking'' (Times
Books), which celebrated Southern culture through food. To the end
of his life, the aroma of chopped onions, celery, green pepper and
garlic would sweep him back to his mother's kitchen on a powerful
wave of memory.
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``A Feast Made for Laughter'' (Doubleday,
1982), was his most controversial book. In it he dealt with more
difficult aspects of his childhood, describing a boyhood sexual
encounter with his father as well as his lifelong struggle to
escape from the smothering presence of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding against premedical studies at Mississippi State
College, Claiborne went on to the University of Missouri, where he
studied journalism. After graduating in 1942, he joined the Navy as
a communications specialist, later becoming the executive officer
on a submarine chaser.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Claiborne took on a series of jobs in public
relations, first in Chicago and later in New York. He was able to
sample the better restaurants when taking clients and food editors
out to lunch, but his small salary forced him into the kitchen, a
copy of ``Joy of Cooking'' in hand. ``I decided that if I wanted to
eat good food, I'd have to cook it myself,'' he said later. ``The
more I tried, the more hooked I became, and it's never worn off.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an unhappy period for Claiborne. ``I was a psychological
mess,'' he said. ``I only knew that I liked to cook, and I liked to
write.'' In 1949, though he had little money, Claiborne moved to
France, where the epiphany of French cuisine, even on a modest
level, changed his life forever. ``I was consummately happy,'' he
wrote later, recalling a meal of scrambled eggs with tarragon and a
glass of white wine. ``I had never tried such heavenly food.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne re-entered the military for the Korean War, and one
day, sitting alone on a Pacific atoll, dissatisfied with his life,
he came to a decision. ``I thought about some way to combine the
two things I liked most, and the answer that came out _ to be food
editor of The New York Times _ was so ambitious, I didn't let
myself think about it. At that time I only knew a little about a
certain kind of Southern cooking, and had never written a
professional word in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   All that would change. After his discharge, Claiborne entered
the Ecole Hoteliere de la Societe Suisse des Hoteliers, near
Lausanne, Switzerland, where he earned certificates in table and
banquet service and classical French cuisine. He returned to New
York and began his career in food journalism at Gourmet magazine,
where he was hired as a receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he moved into an editor's post.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, The New York Times was looking for a new food editor.
Claiborne applied even though it was widely assumed that the post
would go to a woman, as had been the tradition. The executive
editor, Turner Catledge, a fellow Southerner and alumnus of
Mississippi State, broke the mold and took a chance on a man.
</P>
<P>
   Within several years of taking over the restaurant critic's job,
Claiborne developed a system of reviews that involved visiting a
restaurant at least three times with three or four people. He went
anonymously whenever possible and paid his own checks.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne, with his culinary training, talked about the chef's
cooking in detail, rating a restaurant rigorously on its food,
ambience and service.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a gentlemanly and authoritative style to restaurant
reviewing, never strident, never mean, and in doing so won legions
of loyal followers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the restaurants he appraised in his early years on the
beat were La Caravelle, Lutece, Jack &AMP; Charlie's ``21'' (later the
``21'' Club), Chambord, Quo Vadis, Le Voisin and Le Pavillon.
</P>
<P>
   His eye for detail could make even tough restaurateurs wince. In
a review of Le Pavillon in its later days, for example, he zeroed
in on the red pencil that protruded from the maitre d'hotel's
pocket as evidence of sad decline.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement party for Claiborne upon his departure from The
Times, Andre Soltner, who was the chef and owner of Lutece, which
Claiborne eventually awarded four stars, recalled Claiborne's first
review of the restaurant, in 1961. ``When I saw the paper I was so
happy to get a star, even though I couldn't read English too
well,'' Soltner said. ``Then, one of my customers told me that
Claiborne also gave one star to Chock Full o' Nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   When Claiborne first arrived at The Times, he surveyed the
culinary landscape in Manhattan and found it unimpressive. ``There
were relatively few celebrated (I will not say great) restaurants
in New York or in the United States for that matter,'' he wrote in
his autobiography. When it came to fine dining, he wrote, New York
was a ``hick town.'' Yet, he did eventually find one restaurant
worthy of the term great, Le Pavillon, which was the offspring of
the French restaurant at the 1939 World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Le Pavillon was a starched and sumptuous place on Fifth Avenue,
run by a brilliant martinet named Henri Soule. During an interview
with Soule, Claiborne was taken to the kitchen, where he met the
genial 38-year-old chef, Pierre Franey. The two men struck up an
immediate friendship, bound by a common love for classic French
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Franey quit Le Pavillon in 1960 over a disagreement with Soule,
and after that began accompanying Claiborne on his restaurant
rounds and developing recipes for Claiborne's food columns. Their
collaboration led to seven books and numerous other projects for
The Times, including Franey's 60-Minute Gourmet column. Claiborne
left The Times in 1970 to collaborate with Franey on a food
newsletter. The venture was not a success, and Claiborne returned
to the newspaper in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne worked in the enormous kitchen of his East Hampton
home, frequently with Franey, who died in 1996, developing recipes
for The New York Times Magazine and later for The Living Section.
Such was his influence as a food writer that when, in the late
1970s, Claiborne was advised by his doctor to limit fat and salt in
his diet, the nation followed his progress as if it were a soap
opera. His book ``Craig Claiborne's Gourmet Diet'' (Times Books)
introduced the concepts of low-sodium and low-fat cooking to
millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His many books included ``The New York Times Guide to Dining Out
in New York'' (1965); ``The New York Times International Cook
Book'' (1971); ``The Chinese Cookbook'' (1972), written with
Virginia Lee; and four volumes under the title ``Craig Claiborne's
Favorites From The New York Times.'' The books he wrote with Franey
include ``Classic French Cooking'' (1970); ``Veal Cookery'' (1978);
and ``Craig Claiborne's New York Times Cookbook'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was an avid traveler, and his bylines, from places
ranging from New Orleans to New Delhi, India, carried endless
vicarious treats for readers. Claiborne also was recognized as a
genius at identifying young and unheralded talent. In his columns
he frequently boosted a young chef's career by giving him exposure
in The Times. Among those who benefited from Claiborne's
journalistic perspicacity were French chefs like Paul Bocuse, Roger
Verge, Alain Ducasse, Jean Troigros and Gaston Lenotre, as well as
the Italian cookbook writer Marcella Hazan and the Cajun chef Paul
Prudhomme.
</P>
<P>
   After his restaurant reviewing days, Claiborne became a resolute
and generous friend to those he loved and admired in the world of
gastronomy. Prudhomme recalled last week a conversation he had with
Claiborne in the late 1970s, before Cajun cooking became all the
rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I planned to renovate my restaurant,''
Prudhomme said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really sure, then Craig said to me, `If you don't
have the money I'll lend it to you!'''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne regularly invited chefs to his home kitchen for
interviews and cooking demonstrations _ usually followed by a
festive dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the age of computers and modems, he preferred to stand
at his typewriter, peering through half glasses, while pecking out
notes and peppering the cooks with questions. In his will,
Claiborne left the majority of his estate, including his home and
books, to the Culinary Institute of America.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by several nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   One of Claiborne's legacies as a journalist is how he
demystified for his readers the world of haute cuisine, and even
made it look like fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent my first five years in this country at those cooking
sessions,'' recalled Jacques Pepin, the chef and cookbook author.
``Craig broke down the formality of cooking, like we had in France,
and in the process made it accessible to all.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what qualities made a good food critic, Claiborne
said, ``the ability to write and a conversance with food.'' Both,
he said, were instinctive. ``I think you are born with a seed for
making a sentence that reads well, as well as one for learning to
be discriminating where food is concerned.'' Claiborne was
confident that he possessed both. But he was also afflicted by
feelings of inadequacy and racked by self-doubt, and the burden of
constant reviewing weighed heavily on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many's the night I've lain in bed worrying about the stellar
worth of one restaurant or another,'' he wrote, ``about whether I
was justified in referring to a chef's Mornay sauce as pure
mucilage, or whether that unaccustomed flavor in the hollandaise
sauce was actually basil or rosemary as I had judged it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   His newspaper readers never sensed the turmoil within. In print,
Claiborne communicated with ease, assurance and style. ``All my
life I'd been miserable and anxious and frightened,'' he once told
an interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have everything. All I want is for it to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to Claiborne's notorious dinner in Paris began one
evening in 1975 when he was at home watching an auction to raise
money for Channel 13, the PBS station in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prizes was dinner for two, anywhere in the world and
sky's-the-limit on expenses, sponsored by American Express.
Claiborne bid $300, not expecting to win. To his surprise, the
dinner was his. He immediately called Franey, and the two boarded a
plane to Paris for a scouting expedition.
</P>
<P>
   They chose a restaurant called Chez Denis, where the chef
assured them that he could produce an extraordinary 31-course menu.
A few months later Claiborne and Franey returned to the restaurant
and sat down to a five-hour, 31-course dinner, a cascade of Beluga
caviar, foie gras, ortolans and truffles, parfait of sweetbreads,
chaud-froid of woodcock, and a dish made from hundreds of
sots-l'y-laisse, the ``oysters'' found in chickens just above the
thigh bone.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wines served were a 1918 Chateau Latour, a 1928
Chateau Latour and an 1835 Madeira.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his autobiography, Claiborne maintained that the
dinner was not perfect in all respects. The lobster in the lobster
gratin was chewy and the oysters arrived lukewarm. ``The
presentation of the dishes, particularly the cold dishes, such as
the sweetbread parfait and the quail mousse tart, was mundane,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the meal were printed on the front page of The New
York Times. Reader response was immediate and angry. Nearly a
thousand letters poured in, most of them expressing outrage that
anyone could spend thousands of dollars on dinner when people all
over the world faced starvation. Anti-Claiborne sentiment ran 4-1.
The Vatican pronounced the stunt ``scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   As testament to Claiborne's legendary stamina, when the two left
the restaurant Franey turned to his partner and asked him to sum up
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what was so amazing about that meal?'' Claiborne
replied. ``I don't really feel that stuffed.''

</P>
<P>
   Claiborne retired from The Times in 1986 and continued to write
books, to travel and to lecture. Perhaps his most enduring work is
``The New York Times Cookbook,'' which was published in 1961 and
has sold more than a million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was born in the hamlet of Sunflower, Miss., on Sept.
4, 1920. His father's financial setbacks forced the family to move
several times, eventually to the nearby town of Indianola, where
his mother, Kathleen, established a boarding house. It was here
that the young Craig Claiborne became fascinated with the heady
alchemy of cooking. Kathleen Claiborne was described by her son
years later as a born cook, especially adept at the rib-sticking
foods of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   While he grew up to travel the world, Claiborne always clung to
his Southern roots, in conversation, in writing and in recipes. In
1987 he published ``Craig Claiborne's Southern Cooking'' (Times
Books), which celebrated Southern culture through food. To the end
of his life, the aroma of chopped onions, celery, green pepper and
garlic would sweep him back to his mother's kitchen on a powerful
wave of memory.
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``A Feast Made for Laughter'' (Doubleday,
1982), was his most controversial book. In it he dealt with more
difficult aspects of his childhood, describing a boyhood sexual
encounter with his father as well as his lifelong struggle to
escape from the smothering presence of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding against premedical studies at Mississippi State
College, Claiborne went on to the University of Missouri, where he
studied journalism. After graduating in 1942, he joined the Navy as
a communications specialist, later becoming the executive officer
on a submarine chaser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, though he had little money, Claiborne moved to France,
where the epiphany of French cuisine, even on a modest level,
changed his life forever. ``I was consummately happy,'' he wrote
later, recalling a meal of scrambled eggs with tarragon and a glass
of white wine. ``I had never tried such heavenly food.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne re-entered the military for the Korean War, and one
day, sitting alone on a Pacific atoll, dissatisfied with his life,
he came to a decision. ``I thought about some way to combine the
two things I liked most, and the answer that came out _ to be food
editor of The New York Times _ was so ambitious, I didn't let
myself think about it. At that time I only knew a little about a
certain kind of Southern cooking, and had never written a
professional word in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   All that would change. After his discharge, Claiborne entered
the Ecole Hoteliere de la Societe Suisse des Hoteliers, near
Lausanne, Switzerland, where he earned certificates in table and
banquet service and classical French cuisine. He returned to New
York and began his career in food journalism at Gourmet magazine,
where he was hired as a receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he moved into an editor's post.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, The New York Times was looking for a new food editor.
Claiborne applied even though it was widely assumed that the post
would go to a woman, as had been the tradition. The executive
editor, Turner Catledge, a fellow Southerner and alumnus of
Mississippi State, broke the mold and took a chance on a man.
</P>
<P>
   Within several years of taking over the restaurant critic's job,
Claiborne developed a system of reviews that involved visiting a
restaurant at least three times with three or four people. He went
anonymously whenever possible and paid his own checks.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne, with his culinary training, talked about the chef's
cooking in detail, rating a restaurant rigorously on its food,
ambience and service.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a gentlemanly and authoritative style to restaurant
reviewing, never strident, never mean, and in doing so won legions
of loyal followers.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with Henri Soule, who ran the restaurant Le
Pavillon on Fifth Avenue, Claiborne was taken to the kitchen, where
he met the genial 38-year-old chef, Pierre Franey. The two men
struck up an immediate friendship, bound by a common love for
classic French cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Franey quit Le Pavillon in 1960 over a disagreement with Soule,
and after that began accompanying Claiborne on his restaurant
rounds and developing recipes for Claiborne's food columns. Their
collaboration led to seven books and numerous other projects for
The Times, including Franey's 60-Minute Gourmet column. Claiborne
left The Times in 1970 to collaborate with Franey on a food
newsletter. The venture was not a success, and Claiborne returned
to the newspaper in 1974. Franey died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborn's many books included ``The New York Times Guide to
Dining Out in New York'' (1965); ``The New York Times International
Cook Book'' (1971); ``The Chinese Cookbook'' (1972), written with
Virginia Lee, and four volumes under the title ``Craig Claiborne's
Favorites From The New York Times.'' The books he wrote with Franey
include ``Classic French Cooking'' (1970); ``Veal Cookery'' (1978),
and ``Craig Claiborne's New York Times Cookbook'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   In his will, Claiborne left the majority of his estate,
including his home and books, to the Culinary Institute of America.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by several nieces and nephews.

KINGS BEAT AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Point to the return of Glen Murray and Jozef
Stumpel on Sunday afternoon and Kings coach Andy Murray says look
at Stephane Fiset instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Murray and Stumpel scored goals in their first game back
in weeks, but Andy Murray thought the team's biggest lift in a 3-2
victory over the Colorado Avalanche was Fiset, who sat the past
three games with hopes his own game would come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question getting Murray and Stumpel was worth two
goals,''Murray said. ``But I think the biggest factor was we had
solid goaltending. Steph played very strong for us. When we were
putting wins on the board early in the season our goalie was always
one of our best players. He was again tonight. That's what we are
going to need down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have seemed enough to open a game against the Avs with
a three-goal lead in the first period, including two by Glen Murray
and Stumpel. The sellout crowd of 18,118 at Staples Center roared
continually for Murray, who has been out with a bruised chest
muscle, and for the oft-injured Stumpel, who has been sidelined
with a torn muscle in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Kings dropped into the eighth and final playoff
spot in the Western Conference after Thursday's 5-2 loss to the
Dallas Stars, it was clear they would slide even further if they
could not keep the other team from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the victory, they now go on the road to face the
Dallas Stars, who have not lost to the Kings in 21 consecutive
games. Then it is on to Nashville and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need everybody,'' said Ziggy Palffy, who opened the scoring
with a power-play goal 8:51 into the game. ``The way Steph played
for us tonight was so important. It's good to get our lines back in
order; we're almost there. But defense is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was forced to face four consecutive power-play attempts by
Colorado late in the first period and early in the second,
including a breakaway by Avalanche center Joe Sakic.
</P>
<P>
   But until Adam Deadmarsh tipped in a blast by Sandis Ozolinsh
with 3:26 left in the second, Fiset had stopped them all.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which lost just once in its past 11, got a goal by
Dave Reid early in the third to cut the lead to 3-2. But that was
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are the league's most-penalized team and have not been
able to curb their bad habits while trying to re-capture their
early-season success. But in this game it looked as if they might
have enough offense to win.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy scored first, with Peter Forsberg off for roughing. Rob
Blake took a slap shot from the point and Luc Robitaille took a
shot off the rebound. But the puck rolled through the crease and
Palffy poked it in for his 17th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who missed three games with a chest contusion, said he
was a little nervous before the game. But with 10:48 gone in the
period, he scored on his second try after Jere Karalahti's blast
from the point.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to Stumpel, who has missed most of the past 10 weeks
with abdominal and knee problems, was the reason the club had taken
a hard look at Carolina holdout center Keith Primeau, who was
traded Sunday to the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   One game is not the answer, but the team was encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so skilled to have him back gives you a great
advantage,'' Fiset said. ``He is so important to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   No more so than Fiset. The Kings acknowledge they brought him
back too soon from a bruised right hand when Jamie Storr went down
with a concussion. He often looked out of sync, letting in a series
of bad goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making mistakes in practice and they carried over to the
games,'' said Fiset, who stopped 21 shots. ``I've had some time off
to work on some things in practice without the pressure of playing
the games. I think it helped a lot.''

RACIST HATRED FROM PAST RESONATES IN EXHIBITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thay Bowser of Manhattan remembers being a little
girl in Pickens, S.C., when a black man was lynched some 30 miles
away. ``My mother was told to keep her children in, her boys in,
because there might be problems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bowser, 72, stood quietly and alone on Saturday afternoon in
a line of spectators crowded into a tiny one-room gallery on
Manhattan's Upper East Side to see photographs of Americans _ the
vast majority of them black men _ who were hanged from dogwood
trees and telephone poles, and the throngs of white people who had
come to watch, often with children in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to hold back sobs, Ms. Bowser said, ``I knew I had to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   When she neared the end of the show and stood looking at a
triptych of a man named Frank Embree, his eyes looking straight at
the camera just before he was lynched, Ms. Bowser said she could
bear no more. ``I'm going to have to come back,'' she said, burying
her head in her coat. ``It's just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went Saturday afternoon at the Roth Horowitz gallery at
160A East 70th St., as the exhibition, called ``Witness,'' evoked
emotions as varied as the people who had come to see it. The show
contains some 60 photographs, picture postcards and assorted
artifacts chronicling the practice of lynching from Illinois to
Mississippi, between 1883 and 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds have seen the exhibition since it opened 10 days ago.
Visitors on Saturday said they had heard about the show through
reviews in newspapers, on black talk radio and on the Cable News
Network's Web site and the America Online home page.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, between noon and 4 p.m., about 300 visitors went to
the gallery, so small that it can accommodate no more than about 25
people at one time. By midafternoon, nearly 30 people were lined up
outside in frigid temperatures, most waiting for about 20 minutes
on the sunless street.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday before, 200 people visited the gallery, which had
drawn only about 15 or 20 visitors on Saturdays for previous shows,
according to one of the gallery's owners, Andrew Roth.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the show lighted memories. For others, it brought to
light their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevenson, 45, of Brooklyn, saw two photographs that his
father, who was raised in Montgomery, Ala., had in his own
collection. He said he was 10 when his father pulled them out of a
loose-leaf binder, as a history lesson on what it meant to be black
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Slotnick, a Manhattan shoe-store owner, said she could
only compare the pictures to what she could relate to as a Jew:
Hitler's Germany. A white college student said she was horrified to
see the picture of a white couple casually watching the hanging of
a black man. A Korean-American woman from Queens said simply,
``That could be us.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars of race in America are not in complete agreement about
what to make of the zeal with which Americans _ blacks, whites and
others _ have flocked to an exhibition so explicitly devoted to
racist violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it signals a greater willingness to face past
injustices, sparked most notably by efforts to ensure that the
Holocaust is not forgotten. Perhaps, they say, Americans,
particularly whites, are willing to suspend what the Civil War
historian Eric Foner called ``a historical amnesia about slavery,
about racism.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, they point to the renewed attention on the
Confederate flag that flies over the state Capitol in South
Carolina and the widely publicized discovery of Thomas Jefferson's
liaison with his former slave, Sally Hemings; the latter is even
the subject of an upcoming television miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the popularity of this exhibition, Foner added, should
serve as an argument for a museum devoted to slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Berger, a cultural historian, said the exhibition points
to ``a zeitgeist moment in the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hit a chord,'' Berger said. ``Americans, particularly
white Americans, have been reluctant to look at their own racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that the lynching exhibition has drawn attention
because of the 1998 murder of James Byrd, a black man dragged to
death by three white men in Jasper, Texas. Others question whether
the willingness to look at lynchings _ associated with another era
and another place, mostly in the South _ equates with a willingness
to confront racism today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mainstreaming of black collective history,'' observed
Patricia J. Williams, a professor of law at Columbia University.
``We all know it. Yet there's a disbelief in the dominant culture,
because it's not yet in the history books. The longer test is
whether it will be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery was full soon after it opened at noon on Saturday.
The first to walk in, Bruce Chambers, a bank worker from the Bronx,
had arrived two hours early. Looking at the photographs, he said,
he was struck by the faces of both the executed and the
executioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an African-American, you try to put yourself in the
perspective of the people that this actually happened to,'' he
said. ``Considering the fact that human beings have been executed,
for people to smile, to be actually jostling to be in the picture,
that's more stunning than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the afternoon, the crowd inside the gallery
surrounded the collector of the photographs, James E. Allen,
peppering him with questions, for most of the images are
unaccompanied by explanatory text.
</P>
<P>
   They asked: Who are these people? (The townspeople who came to
watch were ordinary people, Allen, an antiques dealer from Atlanta,
told them.) What were the alleged crimes of those who were lynched?
(It could have been anything, often entirely unsubstantiated, he
said.) Why were strands of human hair affixed next to a photograph
of a man hanging from a tree? (Because spectators liked to collect
body parts.) Why were postcards made of these events? (To publicize
them far and wide.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What country is this?'' Ms. Slotnick asked rhetorically. In a
whisper, she added: ``Are we so violent? Don't you feel ashamed?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Taylor, a stenography student from Queens, looked at the
faces of the men who had been lynched and said he could see
pleading in their eyes. ``I don't know these victims, but I feel a
connection, emotionwise,'' said Taylor, 23, whose family came from
Jamaica. ``It's difficult. I see them pleading not to be lynched,
begging for their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser Robinson, the owner of a Manhattan Internet company,
stared at a picture of four black men hanged from the same tree and
said they still seemed to him slightly unreal, like dummies
suspended. ``Look at those guys _ doesn't even seem like real
people,'' said Robinson, 27, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and his friend Dwight Williams, 23, said they wished the
exhibition had been publicized more widely for their generation _
like on the hip-hop radio stations they listen to. But even if it
were, Taylor said, many would probably pass it by.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of African-Americans, they don't want to remember
this,'' he said. ``They want to focus on the present, not look at
the past. I don't think that's good. Why wouldn't you want to see
this, as graphic as it is? It's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The historian David Levering Lewis agreed, saying he was not
convinced that Americans _ either black or white _ are willing to
face the past. ``There's a sense of a kind of success ethos
overtaking much of black America,'' Levering Lewis, a Rutgers
University professor, contended. ``We now want to emphasize, in
this half-full, half-empty glass, the full.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, whose collection is on display through Feb. 12, suggested
that the attention on the exhibition was fueled precisely by the
suppressed nature of the subject of lynching. Remarkably, although
numerous photographs were taken and circulated, they have rarely,
if ever, been displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were discussed openly, if this were part of our
consciousness, there wouldn't be this response,'' he said.
``Vestiges of this cruelty exist in our system today.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stevenson, who was reminded of his father's collection, the
surprise came from seeing these bone-chilling pictures in the
company of so many whites, and not just in a roomful of
African-Americans like himself. How did it make him feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say more hurt than anything, that they could do this,'' he
said quietly. ``When I walked in, I was a little bit taken aback. I
also know a lot of whites are remorseful.''

SPORTS COLUMN: RAMS' WARNER GOES FROM THE SUPERMARKET TO THE SUPER
BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ He had one of the most improbable seasons in
football history. A virtual rookie, Kurt Warner threw 41 touchdown
passes and was the most valuable player of his sport. No
quarterback had ever came from so far, so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knew his story: stacking groceries at the Hy-Vee back
in Iowa for $5.50 an hour, sometimes tossing a roll of toilet paper
to a co-worker, just to keep the arm limber. Playing quarterback in
cramped indoor arenas. Showing up with a rose to court the lady
with the two children who is now his wife.
</P>
<P>
   So much has happened this season, but late Sunday _ very late
Sunday _ the trip to the Super Bowl pretty much depended on Kurt
Warner's right arm. He had earned that responsibility by playing so
magnificently for this entire improbable season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of this team has been that somebody has stepped
up to make a play every game,'' he said after slinging the 30-yard
touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl with 4 minutes 44 seconds left that
gave the St. Louis Rams an 11-6 victory over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Even more improbable was that if Kurt Warner had not won this
game with one perfect throw down the sideline, another improbable
quarterback would be flying to Atlanta on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers had their own outsider, Shaun King, fresh out of
Tulane, who was playing the likes of Rutgers and Army in the past
four years. King, a true rookie, was third string until late
November, but he nearly played the Buccaneers to the Super Bowl,
with his powerful arm and his quick mind.
</P>
<P>
   In this game of strange football scores, more of a Mark
McGwire-Sammy Sosa long-ball contest a few blocks away at Busch
Stadium, the two quarterbacks battled gamely to get a handle on the
ball and the game.
</P>
<P>
   King made the defining play of the first half, a snap judgment
that quite possibly saved 5 points for his team. His stratagem came
on the first play of the second quarter, from the Bucs' 27-yard
line, when the center, Tony Mayberry, snapped a floater that
wobbled past King, bouncing on the hard artificial turf and heading
toward the end zone, with King in chase.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rams retrieved the ball in the end zone, they would have
a touchdown and presumably 7 points. If King retrieved the ball in
the end zone, it would have been a safety and 2 points. But there
was no reason to think King could reach the ball and control it
with a phalanx of Rams coming down on him.
</P>
<P>
   So King made the split-second call on the run, extending his arm
and swatting the ball clear through the end zone, for the automatic
safety that put the Bucs behind, 5-3, which was better than 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bucs went ahead, 6-5, early in the third quarter, this
gave them points and space to maneuver. The Rams, who had been
behind for only a few minutes all season, now had to play from
behind.
</P>
<P>
   There had not been a single touchdown scored in this conference
championship game. The Rams could not count on any long-distance
field goal to save their season because their kicker, Jeff Wilkins,
was playing on a wobbly knee. They needed a touchdown, a jolt from
the blue, from their improbable quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time for Ricky to make a big play and Kurt Warner to
make a big play,'' an emotional Coach Dick Vermeil said later.
</P>
<P>
   All the noise in the Trans World Dome favored the Rams. It was
home _ a familiar blur of blue and yellow _ but Warren Sapp had
been brutalizing the Rams' line all afternoon. It was second-and-4
on the Tampa Bay 30.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who was not a starter at Northern Iowa until his last
year, his fifth in college, has been learning the game with the
Iowa Barnstormers, with the Amsterdam Admirals in Europe. Going
into this season, he had thrown only 11 passes in one game in the
National Football League. Now he had to read a defense under
pressure with the Super Bowl in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety blitzed, and Kurt had to read it,'' Proehl said
later.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that Proehl would be racing down the left sideline,
one-on-one with a cornerback, Warner made the link between his
brain and his right arm and unleashed a perfect pass. Proehl stuck
out his right elbow, holding off Brian Kelly, and caught the ball
over his shoulder, leaving his feet and tumbling into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Warner would give witness to his Christian faith, but there was
also the matter of his dedication to his craft. He had stacked
shelves, he said, only because he was helping out at his old high
school during the day, keeping his arm warm for his next arena
football gig.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been back to the supermarket or his hometown of Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, recently. He won't make it this week. The improbable
quarterback is going to the Super Bowl.

PARNEVIK IS FINDING THE PGA TOUR TO HIS LIKING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. _ After hitting a spectator on the head
with an errant tee shot on the 15th hole Sunday, Jesper Parnevik
was shaken. His concern eased, however, when the fan was not
seriously injured and displayed a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was down on the ground, and it looked like a big golf ball
was growing out of his forehead,'' Parnevik said. ``It was a
terrible sight. I asked if he was OK, and he said: `I'm fine. As
long as you win the tournament, I'm OK'''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik followed instructions. With a decisive birdie on the
final hole for a closing 65, Parnevik continued his torrid start to
the 2000 season and won the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic by one stroke
over Rory Sabbatini and by two strokes over J.L. Lewis and David
Toms. Parnevik finished the 90-hole tournament at 27-under-par 331
to defeat Sabbatini, who shot a 68 Sunday. Lewis and Toms both had
final-round 65s.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive top-six finish for Parnevik, who
tied for sixth at the Mercedes Championships and then tied for
third at last week's Sony Open in Hawaii. Sunday's $540,000
first-place check put Parnevik atop the PGA Tour's early-season
money list at $808,700, and instead of splitting time between the
United States and the European Tour as he normally does, Parnevik
will consider playing exclusively in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to play full time on the U.S. tour one year, just
to see where I end up on the money list,'' said Parnevik, a native
of Sweden who played brilliantly for Europe during last year's
Ryder Cup. ``It would be fun to play 25 tournaments in one year,
just to see how well I can do. I know Tiger Woods can play 15
tournaments and win by miles, but it would be fun to challenge
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge Sunday for Parnevik came from Sabbatini, not
from David Duval, the world's No. 2-ranked player, who shot a
disappointing 69 and settled for a fifth-place tie with Hal Sutton
at 23-under-par. Starting the day tied with Parnevik just two
strokes behind the fourth-round leader, Sabbatini, Duval had a
terrible day with his putter, missing many putts from short range
and squandering numerous birdie opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for me now is to regain confidence with my
putter, which is not something that I'm usually lacking,'' said
Duval, who shot a 59 in the final round last year to win this
tournament. ``Whatever I tried didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   While Duval struggled from the beginning, Sabbatini started
boldly, making birdies on five of his first nine holes, bidding to
win for the first time on the tour at age 23. But the outcome was
decided on the par-5, 513-yard finishing hole at Bermuda Dunes
Country Club, which Parnevik birdied, while Sabbatini settled for
par.
</P>
<P>
   Playing one group ahead of Sabbatini, Parnevik hit an excellent
tee shot at No. 18 and then blasted a superb 5-wood shot from 255
yards away that landed on the green, 40 feet from the cup.
Parnevik's putt for eagle stopped five feet short, but he made the
next putt for birdie, giving him a one-stroke lead over Sabbatini.
</P>
<P>
   While a nervous Parnevik went to the driving range in case there
was a playoff, Sabbatini knew he needed at least a birdie on the
final hole. But Sabbatini pulled his tee shot into the left rough,
about four feet behind a tree that blocked his path to the green.
Then Sabbatini made another mistake when he struck the ball too
hard trying to hit a wedge shot back into the fairway. The ball
crossed the fairway and landed in the right rough, still 114 yards
from the flag, with more trees in the way.
</P>
<P>
   But Sabbatini kept the suspense going with a splendid approach
shot, lofting a wedge shot over trees and onto the green, stopping
the ball about 25 feet from the pin. Sabbatini's birdie attempt to
force a playoff slid past the cup, however, giving Parnevik the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, who will turn 35 in March, lit a victory cigar on the
driving range, celebrating his third tour victory in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbatini, a native of South Africa, pondered what might have
been. After his early rash of birdies, Sabbatini, bogeyed No. 10
and No. 11 and finished with six consecutive pars, pulling several
tee shots on the back nine and showing his anger after poor shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few distractions out there; I lost a little bit
of concentration,'' said Sabbatini, who was irritated by a marshal
who almost stepped on his ball twice on No. 10. ``The positive
aspect is that I managed to stay in it, even when I wasn't at my
best.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Parnevik, it was a victory that will be appreciated by
his father, Bo, who is a comedian in Sweden. Bob Hope is one of Bo
Parnevik's favorite comedians. And Sunday the Bob Hope tournament
became one of Jesper Parnevik's favorite events.

 CIVILIANS SUFFERING INFLICTED BY BOTH SIDES IN cHECHEN WAR 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ Svetlana Kapustina picks her way through the
rubble in the bombed-out wasteland that is Chechnya's capital,
Grozny, as she waits for her daughter to return.
</P>
<P>
   She has been waiting for two months.
</P>
<P>
   A tattered overcoat barely protecting her from the chilly fog
engulfing the city, Kapustina stands in the entrance to a gutted
apartment building and recalls the day when armed men took away her
15-year-old daughter, Irina. Several floors above her, Russian
soldiers peer through broken windows, watching for Chechen snipers.
Overhead, Russian warplanes streak toward Grozny's center as
artillery shells explode in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Nov. 22. They bombed our home, they bombed us and then
they took away my little girl,'' Kapustina said, her voice cracking
as she tried unsuccessfully to fight back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wearing uniforms. They had beards. Maybe they were
Chechens, maybe not. They didn't even talk,'' she said. ``They just
pushed us apart. They put my mother in one room, me in another. And
my daughter, she was hardly dressed when they took her away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of civilians like Kapustina remain trapped in
Grozny, once home to about 400,000 people. About 2,500 rebel
fighters are also dug in throughout the capital, fighting off
Russian troops from bunkers or from rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trapped civilians are women, children, and the
elderly, too weak, poor or infirm to leave. Helpless victims in a
war both the Russian government and Chechen separatists claim to be
fighting in their name, they huddle for shelter in the city's
basements.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin says its four-month-old military campaign in
Chechnya is an ``antiterrorist operation'' aimed at protecting
Chechnya's civilians from ``bandits.'' The Chechen rebels say they
are fighting to liberate their republic from Russian occupation.
But human rights organizations have accused both sides of abusing
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived over there,'' Kapustina said, pointing to the
smoldering remains of a five-story apartment building that was once
her home. ``There are a lot of us here. We have nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In reports released last week, the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, which has placed observers in the region, accused both
Russian troops and Chechen rebels of endangering the lives of
civilians throughout the breakaway region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechen fighters have repeatedly beaten and threatened
civilians who have attempted to spare their villages from Russian
bombardment. They have also endangered civilians by taking
positions in areas that were heavily populated by civilians and
firing at Russian aircraft,'' the report, released Thursday, said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also criticized the Russian military for
indiscriminate bombing of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how provocative Chechen conduct may be, it cannot
justify the targeting of civilian objects by Russian forces,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch also accused Russian soldiers of raping
Chechen women. Citing witnesses, the report described rapes in
Shali, 16 miles southeast of Grozny, and Alkhan-Yurt, just
southwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides need to take the necessary steps to limit the
impact of their fighting on the civilian population, as required by
the rules of war,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Emergencies Ministry announced Sunday that 500
civilians escaped Grozny safely over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian warplanes flew more than 100 bombing raids
across Chechnya as ground troops continued to battle separatist
rebels for control over the capital. Military officials said that
Russian forces had ``liberated'' residential areas, a railway
depot, a hospital and a factory near central Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   But rebel forces staged a surprise attack in Staraya Sunzha, a
suburb east of Grozny. There, a group of separatist fighters
attacked Russian troops in an early morning ambush that reportedly
killed eight soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Russian troops found the body of Major General
Mikhail Malofeyev, who disappeared during fighting last week,
Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced in Moscow.
Earlier, Chechen rebel leaders had said that Malofeyev had been
taken prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leaders, meanwhile, denied claims made earlier by Russian
officials that Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov had been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops marched into the breakaway region in late
September after Chechen militants made a series of raids against
villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan. The Kremlin
also blamed Chechen separatists for a series of deadly bombings of
apartment houses in Moscow and two other cities that killed more
than 300 people. The rebels have repeatedly denied involvement in
the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   During the military operation's first three months, Russian
troops met little resistance and easily occupied Chechnya's flat
northern regions. Their advance, however, stalled last month when
they tried to take Grozny, where rebel forces had dug in. While
Russian forces have since been making slow progress, winning
control of the capital's outlying districts, the rebels have
stubbornly held their ground in the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Kapustina's neighborhood, in Grozny's northeastern outskirts, is
among those areas that the Kremlin said it had ``liberated'' on
Saturday. Russia's tricolor flag was hoisted as soldiers fired
their weapons into the air.
</P>
<P>
   But Kapustina said she feels anything but liberated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't left because I thought maybe they would bring her
back,'' she said. ``Without my little girl I have nothing to live
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalganov reported from Grozny. Whitmore wrote and reported from
Moscow.

GEORGE FOERSTNER, 91, AMANA FOUNDER AND ADVOCATE OF THE MICROWAVE
OVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Foerstner, an Iowa entrepreneur who founded Amana
Appliances during the Depression and led it for 48 years while
introducing the microwave oven and the side-by-side refrigerator to
American homes, died Monday in Miami, near his winter home in Bal
Harbour, Fla. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving school at 13 to work in his father's auto parts
business, Foerstner proved a natural salesman and promoter,
founding in 1934 what became Amana when he was challenged by a
local businessman to build a reliable commercial beverage cooler.
Over the years he built Amana into an internationally recognized
brand with the help of such Hollywood stars as Groucho Marx, Cecil
B. deMille and Gary Cooper hired to appear in its advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Foerstner started with two employees in a corner of a small
furniture shop, with production of beer coolers leading to the
making of refrigerators for butchers and then to frozen-food
lockers that farmers could use to store foods outside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Its reputation for high quality drew on the meticulous work of
craftsmen and cabinetmakers in the Amana Colonies, a communitarian
German settlement founded in east central Iowa in the mid-1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Foerstner's original Electrical Equipment Co. was renamed Amana
Refrigeration when it was sold to the Amana Society in 1936 but he
remained as principal manager. In 1950 Foerstner and a group of
investors that included Howard Hall, an industrialist, bought Amana
back from the society. They in turn sold it in 1965 to the Raytheon
Co., which had developed the microwave oven and needed an
established appliance company to manufacture and market it.
</P>
<P>
   When Amana's Radarange came under inevitable attack as unsafe,
Foerstner ``took the media head on,'' an official said, in a
fervent defense that included bringing in a scientist from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration who said he would be
willing to sit on a Radarange for a year.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to lead the company, which had long been the
world's leading producer of home freezers, until 1982, when he
retired as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Raytheon sold the company to Houston-based Goodman
Manufacturing, but refrigerators continue to be made at the plant
in Middle Amana, Iowa, across the street from the house where
Foerstner spent most of the year. On one occasion, he was the first
person on the scene when the plant caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Foerstner was a demanding but generous man, paying the highest
wages in the area, the company official said, and was often found
at the plant in off-hours, dressed like a farmer. One of his
innovations was to sponsor a sales competition among dealers that
offered as prizes shares in a mutual fund, which Foerstner
described as ``an investment rather than a one-shot reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Hollywood stars he enlisted to promote Amana
products, Foerstner, who lived modestly, had associations with
Vince Lombardi, the football coach, as well as with Dwight D.
Eisenhower and other Washington notables, on at least one occasion
leading an Iowa contingent to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Foerstner is survived by a daughter, Joanne Meyer, of Middle
Amana and a son, Richard, of Iowa City. His wife, Nora, died in
1990.

HAZEL WOLF, 101, WHO FOUGHT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (Eds: The word TILDE in parentheses has been used instead of the
symbol, which is nontransmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
(lb) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hazel Wolf, an ardent environmentalist whose life spanned the
20th century and whose causes encompassed the era's social turmoil,
died in Port Angeles, Wash., on Jan. 19. She was 101 and lived in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1960s Ms. Wolf had been a leader in the Audubon
Society, serving as secretary of the Seattle chapter for 37 years
and helping to establish 21 of the 26 Audubon chapters in
Washington. She was also active in the Federation of Western
Outdoor Clubs, as its one-time president and as editor of its
newsletter until her death.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the 19th century, Ms. Wolf had long spoken of wanting to
witness the 21st. She told the oral historian Studs Terkel, who
profiled her in his 1995 book ``Coming of Age,'' that she intended
to live until the year 2000. ``Then I'm going,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the Seattle region, but also beyond, she was elder
stateswoman in a community of intersecting social causes,
recognized by the Association of Biologists and Ecologists of
Nicaragua for conservation work there, by the Washington Physicians
for Social Responsibility with their Paul Beeson Peace Award, by
the National Audubon Society with its medal of excellence and last
year by Seattle with its Spirit of America Award.
</P>
<P>
   But long before the environmental movement blossomed, providing
a cause that made her celebrated in her later years, Ms. Wolf was
steeped in struggles over human rights, communism, labor issues,
peace, feminism and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Anna Cummings Anderson was born on March 10, 1898, in
Victoria, British Columbia. Her father was Canadian and her mother
was American. After separating from her first husband, Edward
Dalziel, she moved to the United States in 1923 with her daughter,
finding work as a legal secretary, her lifelong career.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the Communist Party during the Depression, attracted
by its support for social welfare programs like food subsidies,
unemployment aid and social security.
</P>
<P>
   Her first party meeting, she recalled in a speech years later,
was at a home where the local sheriff was at that moment trying to
evict a family. ``I joined in what was occurring,'' she said. ``As
the sheriff's men brought the furniture out to pile it on the
sidewalk, the rest of us picked it up and took it into the house by
the back door. This went on for quite a while until the sheriff and
his men, who were not very enthusiastic in the first place, left in
despair and frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf said she lost interest in the party during World War
II, as the wartime boom made issues of economic security less
compelling to her. But years after she left the party, the
government tried to expel her, starting a personal and legal
struggle that shaped her life. That fight lasted 15 years, as
McCarthyism rose and fell. She once joked that a lawyer she worked
for at the time spent so much effort on her case that it was not
clear who was working for whom.
</P>
<P>
   The experience led her into advocacy for the rights of
immigrants, a cause she never gave up. ``The foreign born were the
earliest victims of the McCarthy witch hunt,'' she said 10 years
ago in a talk to a high school class. ``They still have a hard and
uncertain life.''
</P>
<P>
   In that lecture, as on many other occasions, Ms. Wolf recounted
being thrown in jail briefly in 1958, charged with sedition though
she had left the Communist Party 13 years before. She told the two
other women in her jail cell that she had been accused of
conspiring to overthrow the government by violent means. ``What a
wonderful idea,'' one of her fellow prisoners said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did try to overthrow the government, or if I did, I
didn't do a very good job,'' Ms. Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   But her associates said she never gave up trying to overthrow
whatever she saw as unjust, whether it was the behavior of big
corporations or the policies of the United States in Nicaragua. Her
reputation grew, and she became a frequent public speaker (many of
her speeches can be found on the World Wide Web at
members.tripod.com/(TILDE)HazelWolf).
</P>
<P>
   Only a broken hip prevented her from joining the protests by
unions and environmentalists in Seattle during the recent meeting
of the World Trade Organization, said Brock Evans, president of the
Western Outdoor Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of her major causes was always for labor to join with
environmentalists,'' he said. Another was for environmentalists to
include Native Americans, blacks, Hispanics and other minority
groups in their movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People gang up to protect all kinds of things _ civil
liberties, freedom of speech,'' Ms. Wolf once wrote. ``It's in our
genes to gang up. Anytime we want anything, we gang up.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up her many causes, she told the American Immigration
Lawyers Association last year, ``We lost most of the battles but we
won the war in all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   She told them insouciantly that when she finally became an
American citizen in 1974, after taking the oath and forswearing
allegiance to foreign potentates, she went to a bar to celebrate
with friends. ``I proposed the following toast: `To hell with Queen
Elizabeth and to hell with Richard Nixon, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her daughter, Nydia Levick of Port Angeles,
five grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and four great-great
grandchildren. Her second marriage, to Herbert Wolf, also ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf was already at most people's retirement age when a
friend persuaded her to join the Audubon Society in the early
1960s. It was the era when Rachel Carson was warning that
pesticides and the eradication of habitats were threatening the
earth with a silent spring that would have no song birds, but more
than that book or her friend's arm-twisting, it was bird-watching
(specifically, observing a brown creeper grubbing in the woods)
that sparked her deep involvement with Audubon.
</P>
<P>
   For decades more, she continued to go to the woods for
inspiration and to urge others along the environmental path.
</P>
<P>
   But she spiced her advocacy with a dollop of salt. In a speech
last year on saving the endangered salmon of the Pacific Northwest,
she reminded her Seattle University audience of the first reason to
do so: The fish are ``good to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a speech on sustainable forestry practices in 1998, she
said her goal was not, as she quoted the poet, to ``spare that
tree, cut not a single bough,'' but rather to make sure there would
always be forests for wild creatures and to provide homes,
furniture, paper and ``probably even skateboards.''

BIG EAST IS IDEAL CRUCIBLE TO MOLD CHAMPION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why not another national basketball champion from the Big East?
Why not two teams representing the conference on Final Four weekend
in Indianapolis? Halfway through this strange college basketball
season, neither one is a fanciful notion.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East has three teams as good as any in the nation:
Syracuse, Connecticut and St. John's. It has two more intent on
filling tournament brackets come March in Seton Hall and Miami. For
the most part, rosters throughout the conference blend young stars,
like Notre Dame's Troy Murphy and Rutgers' Dahntay Jones, with
seasoned senior performers.
</P>
<P>
   Just check out the No. 6 Orangemen Monday night against the
defending titleholder, eighth-ranked Connecticut. The reason
Syracuse is the only undefeated team in the top 25 is its threesome
of seniors: point guard Jason Hart, shot-blocker Etan Thomas and
forward Ryan Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   What players hanging around for four years means is that seven
times this season a different Orangeman has led the team in
scoring. Against Pittsburgh last Wednesday, the freshman DeShaun
Williams, who was scoreless in the previous three games, scored a
career-high 23 points in an 82-72 victory. Syracuse, which is 15-0,
no longer has to live and die by its 2-3 zone defense; it now has a
confident and stifling man-to-man defense to employ.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better than senior leadership,'' Coach Jim
Boeheim said. ``This is a more veteran team that has to play hard
and together. We won't blow anybody out. We get the ball to more
people. If you just throw zone, teams get a feel and can beat you.
We can do some different things.''
</P>
<P>
   At Connecticut, Coach Jim Calhoun clicks off similar strengths
of his team. In Kevin Freeman and Jake Voskuhl, he has inside
senior strength. In the junior Khalid El-Amin he has perhaps the
best player in the conference. They were the cornerstones of last
year's national championship.
</P>
<P>
   At 13-3, the Huskies still haven't discovered a replacement for
the departed Richard Hamilton and his instant scoring from any
place on the floor. But like Syracuse, Connecticut will only get
better over the next month of conference play.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   In a season in which the traditional power North Carolina has
lost four straight games, underclassmen-heavy West Coast teams like
Arizona and Stanford have a slippery hold near the top of the polls
and newcomers like Auburn try to show they are for real, the Big
East is perhaps the most reliable testing ground.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for balance? In 32 Big East games so far this season,
the home team has won only half of them, so there are no easy
games. In addition, unlike the helter-skelter-run-the-floor style
in the Pacific-10 or the bang-and-cut of the Big Ten, Big East
teams are harder to fit in one style of play. Notre Dame's
first-year coach, Matt Doherty, compares it to the diverse and
balanced Atlantic Coast Conference he played in alongside Michael
Jordan, Sam Perkins and Kenny Smith at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me where you can go in and circle a victory,'' asked
Doherty, whose 12-7 Irish beat Connecticut on the Huskies' home
floor. ``Rutgers plays you physical. Syracuse has more long and
quick athletes. Connecticut is more pressing. You see a far wider
style of play, which is challenging to me as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is the perfect preparation for March, when 64 teams with
a variety of styles converge in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. Last year, Ohio State and Michigan State
made sure the Big Ten owned half the Final Four. When St. John's
met the Buckeyes in the South Regional final, the Red Storm needed
30 minutes to figure out the poised backcourt of Scoonie Penn and
Michael Redd, as well as the inside presence of the 6-foot-11-inch
shot-blocker Ken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 19 Red Storm (12-4) lost again to No. 13 Ohio State on
Saturday at Madison Square Garden, but for nearly 37 minutes it was
the better team and nettled practically the same Final Four team.
The reason? Four days earlier, the Storm got beat by a Seton Hall
team remarkably similar to the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' freshman center, Samuel Dalembert, defended the
middle with 11 blocks _ the same number Johnson had Saturday. Their
senior backcourt of Shaheen Holloway and Rimas Kaukenas bombed from
the perimeter _ just as Penn and Redd did.
</P>
<P>
   Two tough losses in January mean St. John's will have learned by
March. And in Bootsy Thornton and Lavor Postell _ seniors, of
course _ St. John's has the right makeup to heed those lessons.
</P>
<P>
   When Miami Coach Leonard Hamilton was asked recently about
Syracuse's national title chances, he was really thinking about his
own 11-7 team _ winner of six of its last eight, including an
impressive 71-64 victory at Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big East Conference will test them,'' Hamilton said. ``If
they get through this league, they can go pretty far.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-year players. Brutal conference games. Grind it out or run
it up. Syracuse, Connecticut, even St. John's, are taking the right
road to Indianapolis.

RANGERS' STEVENS IS ARRESTED IN DRUG-RELATED CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin Stevens, a 34-year-old left wing who serves as
an alternate captain of the New York Rangers, was arrested in
Collinsville, Ill., early Sunday morning and charged with
soliciting a prostitute and possessing drug paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was arrested at a motel hours after the Rangers' 4-1
victory over the Blues in St. Louis on Friday night, said Maj. Ed
Delmore, assistant chief of the Collinsville Police Department.
Collinsville is a St. Louis suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens remained in custody Sunday night and was being held
without bail, Delmore said. Bail was scheduled to be set Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives will also seek felony drug charges and other charges
on Monday, according to a news release issued by the Collinsville
police. According to Delmore, a date for Stevens' preliminary
hearing will be set Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts are with Kevin and his family at this time,''
Neil Smith, the team president and general manager, said in a
statement released by the Rangers. ``The New York Rangers
organization will fully support Kevin in any possible way.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL and the NHL Players' Association issued a joint
statement that said Stevens had been placed under the supervision
of the substance abuse program run jointly by the league and the
union. Two program doctors are in charge of Stevens' care, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, Stevens was arrested with a
prostitute in Collinsville after a disturbance at the motel had
been reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Crack cocaine was found on all of the room's occupants, said the
police, who indicated that Stevens had been smoking crack.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Stevens took a cab from a nightclub in Sauget,
Ill., to nearby East St. Louis, Ill., where the cab driver
contacted a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the woman told them that Stevens was already
smoking crack when she got into the cab with him. Stevens gave her
$500, also bought $500 worth of crack on an East St. Louis street
corner, paid for material for a crack pipe for her and smoked crack
with her, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Pamela J. Velia, 27, of St. Louis; the cab driver,
Alfred Triplett, 50, of East St. Louis; and Darryl Crawford, 30, of
Lovejoy, Ill., are also being held without bail. They will be
charged Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and Velia went to the motel room, the police said, where
they were joined by Crawford, whom police identified as a member of
a street gang. After Triplett created a disturbance at the door,
motel personnel called the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers left Stevens behind when they flew here Sunday
morning after recording their fifth straight victory on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is in his 13th season in the NHL. Twice in his career he
has scored more than 50 goals. This season, however, has been the
most frustrating one of his career. Stevens had been scratched four
consecutive games before Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the lineup only because Adam Graves, the Rangers'
acting captain, flew to New York to be with his wife, Violet, and
their twin boys, who were born prematurely recently.
</P>
<P>
   In 38 games this season, Stevens has three goals and five
assists and a plus-minus rating of minus-7. The Rangers have been
trying to trade Stevens to a team for which he can play regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is married with two children. His wife is expecting a
third child.

OILERS-TURNED-TITANS SUPER BOWL-BOUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID BARRON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
HOUSTON _ If you laughed or cried in good times and bad with a pro
football team that for 37 seasons was known as the Houston Oilers,
the team's coach has a message for you.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We're Super Bowl-bound,'' Jeff Fisher said Sunday afternoon.
``Please come with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and his team will make their long-awaited trek to Atlanta
for Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV against the St. Louis Rams in the
guise of the Tennessee Titans, the corporate name of the NFL
franchise that owner K.S. ``Bud'' Adams after the 1996 season moved
from Houston to Memphis and then to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But for thousands of Houston football fans who watched the
American Football Conference Championship Game at home or who
gathered with friends at sports bars around the city, under the
hide of the Tennessee Titans beats the heart of the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, the Titans didn't falter on the verge of
greatness. For the first time in four tries dating to the days of
the old American Football League, the franchise was victorious in a
championship game with a Super Bowl berth on the line, beating the
Jacksonville Jaguars 33-14 for the AFC title.
</P>
<P>
   They finally kicked in the door, and their reward is a date with
the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' Adams said while accepting the AFC
championship trophy. ``I'm getting pretty old. I didn't want to go
to the Super Bowl in a wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   During the team's days as the Oilers, Adams and Houston fans had
become accustomed to disappointment. After winning AFL
championships in 1960 and '61, Houston lost to the Dallas Texans in
the 1962 AFL Championship Game, to the Oakland Raiders in the 1967
AFL Championship Game and to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1978
and 1979 AFC title games. In each of the last three losses they
fell one game short of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ultimate disappointment _ a landmark January 1993
loss to the Buffalo Bills in the biggest choke in NFL playoff
history _ and what fans viewed as the ultimate betrayal _ Adams'
move to Tennessee when he was unable to obtain the backing of
then-Mayor Bob Lanier for a new stadium in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday against the Jaguars, the Titans were as ruthlessly
efficient in the second half as the Oilers were haphazardly
wretched in the second half of that memorable loss to the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee rallied from a 14-10 deficit with 16 points in 4{
minutes of the second half _ a one-yard touchdown run by
quarterback Steve McNair, a safety and an 80-yard return of the
ensuing free kick by Derrick Mason. McNair, who threw a nine-yard
pass to Yancey Thigpen for the Titans' first TD, later added a
second one-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a standing-room-only crowd at the SRO sports bar in West
Houston cheered the Titans' comeback, a few fans couldn't help but
think about what might have been had the Oilers not moved to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so bad that they're not here, because if they were we'd
have a Super Bowl team,'' said Todd Mason, who wore an Oilers
replica McNair jersey. ``I hope they win the Super Bowl. I really
do. I'd like them to be here, but money talks these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my voice screaming, and I'm going to be here for them
again next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sting over the Oilers' departure may have been
blunted by the impending arrival of a new NFL franchise, owned by
local businessman Bob McNair, that will begin play in a new stadium
for the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud was asking for $100 million, and what is McNair forking
over _ about a billion?'' said fan Bill Clark, who watched the game
at Dave and Buster's on Richmond Avenue. ``It doesn't seem quite as
stinky as it did a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for the Titans. I'm sure I'll be a total Texans fan or
whatever when that team starts here, but I love the Titans now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the SRO-OT Sports Bar and Grill in North Houston, the packed
house cheered enthusiastically when the CBS cameras focused on such
former Houston favorites as offensive lineman Bruce Matthews and
booed lustily when Adams was on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bittersweet, because this is supposed to be Houston's
celebration,'' Tara Davis said. ``The city went through so much
with that team, and to see them finally get to the top is great,
but there is supposed to be a big welcoming party at
Intercontinental tonight, not in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is supposed to be a parade downtown after the Super Bowl
like we had for the Rockets and Comets, not some Grand Ole Opry
hoedown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pulling for the guys, not the owner,'' said fan Bruce
Myers, who gleefully participated in a mock fund-raiser during the
game to raise money for a replacement hairpiece for Adams. ``The
guys on the team that have always put their heart into it like
Matthews, (Blaine) Bishop those guys. But not the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all fans were so anti-Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a business decision, and that you have to understand,''
said Ronnie Adams, who is not related to the Titans owner. ``I can
separate the business from the spectator part. I hated to see them
leave, but the team's leaving didn't stop me from rooting for them.
So if they win it all, it won't be the same as if they were here,
but I'll pull for them, and I'll be happy for them if they win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans general manager Floyd Reese, who came to Houston as an
assistant coach in 1986 before rising through the ranks, said the
team is glad to embrace fans from any locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we've got a lot of fans in Houston,''
Reese said in the Titans' locker room in Jacksonville. ``It
wouldn't matter if they were from Houston or Juneau, Alaska; we
love them. We're happy for the fans in Houston, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Fisher. Even though the AFC championship trophy will bear
the name of the Tennessee Titans, Fisher thinks there will be
enough glory for Houston fans to share as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed Luv Ya Blue (the nickname for the Bum
Phillips-coached Oilers of the late 1970s and 1980),'' Fisher said.
``The team came so close so many times, and a lot of people in
Houston are pulling for us. We left behind a legacy, and our fans
in Houston deserve to enjoy this with us.''

EDITORIAL: AN ACCORD ON CHILD SOLDIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 24:
</P>
<P>
   From Colombia and Chechnya to Congo and Sierra Leone, some
300,000 child soldiers _ some as young as 10 _ are killing, raping
and maiming in today's conflict zones. Press-ganged or lured by the
promise of booty or revenge, many of them orphans, some not much
taller than their automatic rifles, children are among the most
readily brutalized participants in modern warfare.
</P>
<P>
   So the new international protocol banning the use of child
soldiers, agreed to last week in Geneva, is a salutary achievement.
The new accord will revise the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
Child, raising the minimum age for participants in armed conflicts
from 15 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, under pressure from the Pentagon,
had previously blocked progress on the accord, insisting that any
agreement allow the United States to continue sending volunteers as
young as 17 into combat.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of resistance, the Pentagon accepted a
compromise allowing it to continue recruiting and training
17-year-olds while taking ``all feasible measures'' to keep them
out of combat. That cleared the way for an agreement that is after
all aimed not primarily at the United States but at Third World
countries and rebel insurgencies for which children are the
cheapest and most expendable killers and cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy that the chief American negotiator on the
protocol, Michael Southwick, has had firsthand exposure to the
problem of child soldiers as a former ambassador to Uganda, a
country with a long history of such exploitation. Uganda's national
army, which came to power in the 1980s in part by arming orphans,
is currently fighting a rebel insurgency in the north, known as the
Lord's Resistance Army, which has abducted thousands of children
for use as soldiers and sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
   This new protocol will provide a valuable basis for nations to
exert political and diplomatic pressure on states and rebel
movements that seek legitimacy in the eyes of the international
community. Combined with the new International Criminal Court,
whose governing statute, agreed upon in 1998 over American
objections, defined the recruitment or use of children under 15 as
a war crime, this new accord represents a potentially powerful
instrument for combating this horrific form of exploitation.

COMMENTARY: COURTING BORN-AGAIN GOP VOTERS IN IOWA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Of all the Republican presidential hopefuls
peddling their views in Iowa recently, Gary Bauer has been the most
inventive in waging his war against abortion. First, he offered his
campaign donors a chance to visit the McCaughey septuplets, whose
parents support Bauer and his platform. Then, on Saturday, he
staged a media event in a Des Moines cemetery where a local
anti-abortion group had provided a burial site in 1994 for a
discarded fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which drew about 30 shivering journalists and a few
supporters, went slightly off course when the candidate had to
acknowledge that this fetus had probably been stillborn, not
aborted. But by camera time, Bauer had nimbly shifted his pitch,
and with not so much as an ironic nod to the journalists trampling
an infant graveyard, he lamented the ``coarsening of our culture''
in today's America.
</P>
<P>
   If the battle for the ultraconservative Christian vote in Iowa
is not always a pleasant sight, it is definitely a full-scale
political war. The born-again voters in this state, variously
labeled evangelicals or sometimes, less generously, the righteous
wing of the Republican Party, make up a startling 40 percent of
those expected at Monday night's Republican caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the media have been busy yawning about what looks like
a ratification of both parties' front-runners, these Iowans know
this is their last chance this season to stamp any potential
president with their message. Thus, they have pushed Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas to clarify what had been an intentionally fuzzy stand
on abortion. Bush, whose shift to the right could jeopardize
support from moderates in a general election, has now explained
that he believes the Supreme Court ``stepped across its bounds and
usurped the right of legislatures'' when it legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The same groups of evangelicals also pushed their candidates to
pledge over the weekend to work against pornography and
homosexuality. The Iowa pledge for the Presidential Rally for
Family, Faith &AMP; Freedom created by several evangelical groups
includes opposition to ``special legal protections based on sexual
behavior or preference'' and a promise to help the Boy Scouts
``abide by their own moral code.''
</P>
<P>
   At a massive rally in Des Moines on Saturday, Steve Forbes, Alan
Keyes and Bauer each signed the huge poster-size pledge with a
flourish so theatrical their signatures became more artful than
legible. Bush declined by letter, explaining that he does not do
pledges. Bill Horn, president of Straight From the Heart ministry,
which helped organize the pledge, said Bush's letter ``explained
that he is against gay marriages and against pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   While politicians normally try to avoid such divisive issues, in
Iowa these topics deliver energetic caucus voters. Moreover, these
voters aren't particularly open about their favorites. A Des Moines
Register poll Sunday showed Bush far out front at 43 percent with
Forbes trailing in second place with 20 percent of the vote. But
polling for caucuses that often take over an hour is not the same
as polling for pulling a lever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polling in Iowa, especially on the Republican side, is a dicey
thing to do,'' explains Hugh Winebrenner, a Drake University
professor. ``The conservative Christians are a huge force in this
state, and while they don't show up in the polls, they do show up
at the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the conservative Christian bloc is especially
difficult this year since ardent believers have so many suitors. If
response at the Saturday rally is any indicator, Keyes has strong
emotional support, despite his polling place at 8 percent of the
vote. Keyes, who sounds like an old-fashioned prophet of doom,
warned about 1,200 listeners in the Des Moines Assembly of God
amphitheater on Saturday night against ``nice guys who equivocated
on the issues.'' The reference seemed to be aimed at Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush has his evangelical friends and a quiet, underground
campaign to make certain Christian groups know that he is a fervent
believer. In Iowa, Robert Cramer, a school board official and
Republican activist, has been working the born-again groups for
Bush. ``This time I think the Christian conservatives might split
up a little differently,'' he says, because ``the so-called
establishment candidate is solid in his faith also.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Bush, the establishment candidate, arrived at the
Assembly of God church for the 11 a.m. service, which featured a
crowd of musicians who were clearly trying out for a possible Bush
inauguration. The question, of course, is how many of them will be
at the caucuses voting for his competition. Another question is
whether Bush can scurry back to the center before Election Day.

AVALANCHE STRUGGLES IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a lost weekend for the Colorado Avalanche,
who were 8-1-2 in their previous 11 games before arriving in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks tied Colorado 3-3 Friday, when
the Avalanche was outshot 19-1 in the final 15 minutes. Sunday
afternoon, Colorado lost 3-2 to drop its record to 1-3 against the
Los Angeles Kings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado pulled goalie Marc Denis after he allowed three goals
in the first period. Two were on the power play. But it was not
enough, even though the Avs had four straight power-play
opportunities midway through the game and scored twice in the final
two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our slow start definitely cost us two points,'' Colorado coach
Bob Hartley said. ``We are mature enough and have enough leaders on
this team to recognize that we did not have a very good first
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, with 55 points, still has a wide lead in the Northwest
Division and should become the first team since 1975 to win six
consecutive division titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so many skill players you can never let up,'' Kings
coach Andy Murray said. ``You have to keep after them all the time
or they will blow by you. We just have to do it without so many
penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: The Kings are 14-4-3 when they score first....
With Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray returning, the Kings are missing
just Donald Audette from their first two lines on opening night.
Audette still is nursing a sprained left ankle and is hoping to
return by the end of the week. Without their top players, the Kings
power play has suffered, even though it is ranked seventh in the
league with a 18.3conversion rate. ``You need to get all six of
your forwards from the first two lines to get the consistency you
need,'' said assistant Dave Tippett, who works with the team's
power play. ``We're in better shape now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who has missed most of the past 10 weeks with abdominal
and knee injuries, wants to stay healthy the rest of the season.
``I've just never been able to get going all year,'' he said. ``In
the first month, everything looked so great for us. There is no
reason we can't have that again.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Dave Rein scored the Avs' second goal, his seventh of the
season. He had six all last year. ... The Kings are off today but
will practice Tuesday morning at their new facility in El Segundo
before leaving for Dallas.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve McNair has
been suffering from a case of turf toe that is so severe he has
been forced to wear a plastic boot to immobilize it and protect it
during the week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the swollen big toe on McNair's left foot did not keep him
from kicking the playoff life out of Jacksonville on Sunday by
running for two touchdowns and throwing for another in Tennessee's
33-14 victory, which sent the Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea behind Steve wearing the boot was to get him ready to
play today,'' coach Jeff Fisher said after the Titans secured their
first appearance in a Super Bowl. ``What a courageous performance.
Steve's so tough, he plays when most quarterbacks would sit out.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair completed 14 of 23 passes for 112 yards, including a
nine-yard touchdown pass to Yancey Thigpen. He was sacked once and
intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   McNair did more damage to the Jaguars' defense with his running.
He ran nine times for a team-high 91 yards and scored twice on
one-yard sneaks. He had runs of 19 and 51 yards, the latter setting
up the touchdown that put the Titans ahead 33-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to sit out this game for anything, because this
is something I've dreamed about and worked hard for,'' McNair said.
``I wasn't going to let a chance like this slip away. I was ready
to face the consequences of how bad my toe was going to hurt after
the game, and right now it hurts good.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who came to the then-Houston Oilers from Alcorn State in
1995 as the team's No. 1 draft choice, underwent back surgery early
in the season and has seldom played without injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times last week, Steve couldn't even touch his toe without
it killing him,'' Titans tight end Frank Wycheck said. ``For him to
take the shots he took and make those kinds of plays shows what a
true warrior he is. He's an unbelievable leader, and we follow
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Titans are following McNair to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say to dare McNair, and he was going to do whatever he
could to make sure we won this game,'' Titans strong safety Blaine
Bishop said. ``People are going to have to start tackling him like
he's a tailback and not a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory over the Jaguars improved his record as a
starter this season to 11-2. In three playoff games, he has thrown
for 76, 112 and 112 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's all about winning, not statistics,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Added guard Bruce Matthews: ``Steve just sucks it up. He doesn't
care what the media thinks about him, and he doesn't care about
what his passer rating is. All he cares about is winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be pretty, but he's finding ways to make plays.
He's a lineman's best friend. I can't tell you how many times he's
saved me when I've been beat on a pass rush.''
</P>
<P>
   At times during the first half, McNair struggled. He seemed
confused by Jacksonville's strategy of reading and holding at the
line rather than penetrating and trying to sack him. Jaguars
defensive coordinator Dom Capers didn't want McNair to hurt his
team with his running and was confident McNair couldn't find his
receivers downfield.
</P>
<P>
   When McNair couldn't locate a receiver, he either dumped off the
ball or tucked it in and took off. He was dangerous either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the reason we won,'' Titans linebacker Eddie Robinson
said. ``Steve made the big plays today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have another African-American quarterback from the SWAC
going to the Super Bowl _ a la Doug Williams. Hopefully, he'll have
the same results.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now the coach at Grambling State, his alma mater, led
the Washington Redskins to their third Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what numbers I put up, we're winning, and that's
all that matters,'' McNair said. ``Our goal is to run the ball and
move the chains. Now we've got one goal left. As long as we're
going to the Super Bowl, we might as well win it.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Executives on Music Row in Nashville, Tenn.,
would not even consider listening to Uh Oh, The Jaguars Super Bowl
Song, but the Tennessee Titans had no choice but to sit through the
rap video at a team meeting Saturday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before coach Jeff Fisher dismissed his players from their
regular meeting the night before Sunday's AFC Championship Game,
the lights went out, and the music came on. The Titans saw Jaguars
defensive tackle Gary Walker, receiver Keenan McCardell, offensive
tackle Leon Searcy, receiver Jimmy Smith and cornerback Fernando
Bryant rapping their way to Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When coach played it, I couldn't believe it,'' Titans middle
linebacker Barron Wortham said after Tennessee's 33-14 victory over
Jacksonville. ``We were kind of shocked that they'd do something so
arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the video was over, there was total silence in the room.
The guys took it to heart. If you're a man and you get slapped in
the face, you strike back. And we did. That video was a big factor
in our mental approach to this game. Hey, that video's no good.
They should throw it in the trash and let BFI pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nashville isn't exactly a rap music kind of town, so no wonder
news traveled slowly. The Jaguars video was made in November and
wasn't supposed to be released unless they reached the Super Bowl,
but a radio station in Jacksonville began playing it the week
before the divisional playoff game against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were furious that the Jaguars could be so
presumptuous, but they failed to back it up during Jacksonville's
62-7 victory. The Titans hadn't heard anything about the video, and
the players thought the Jaguars recorded it last week before
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Bruce Matthews, a 17-year veteran, is an old rock 'n'
roller who loves Elvis and the Beatles. Matthews paid particular
attention to the performance of Walker, who left the Titans after
last season and signed with the Jaguars as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm no music expert, but that video was horrible,
especially Walker's part,'' Matthews said. ``He should definitely
stick to football. I liked the Bears' Super Bowl Shuffle (1985),
but this one was real cheesy. It took some nerve for the Jaguars to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   When informed that the Jaguars made the video in November and
that it began playing in Jacksonville two weeks ago _ not the week
before the Tennessee game _ Matthews smiled and said, ``Really?
Huh. I hadn't heard anything about it, but I'm not a real big fan
of rap music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, over the years, I've become a little jaded to
motivational tools, but I have to admit this one piqued my
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Joe Bowden was the only player in the
Tennessee dressing room who had anything remotely positive to say
about the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that I liked the video,'' he said. ``It had a
nice beat. It had me bobbing my head a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, though? That video definitely showed their lack
of respect for us. As for Walker, he's a better player than he is a
rapper. He should keep the day job.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had someone tape the video when it was shown on Jaguars
coach Tom Coughlin's television show. When asked about the
motivational tactic, Fisher had a sly smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you do different things at different times to
prepare your players,'' he said. ``I thought the team meeting the
night before the game would be a good time to show the players the
Jaguars' mindset, how confident Jacksonville was going into this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the rivalry between these AFC Central foes grows more
bitter by the season, the Titans agreed that making a Super Bowl
video during the season and then allowing it to be released in the
playoffs was rather typical of such an arrogant team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they're arrogant,'' Matthews said. ``But when you're a
winner, you can't help but be arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are 16-3 and on their way to their first Super Bowl,
so they must be arrogant, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah, I guess you could say we're getting there,''
Matthews said.

<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ On the first play from scrimmage Sunday, the
Tennessee Titans were flagged for delay of game, an almost
inconceivable penalty _ but exactly the kind of dumb mistake we
grew used to expecting from the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto rookie Jevon Kearse's stunningly ill-advised attempted
lateral early in the fourth quarter, with Tennessee having just
recovered a Jacksonville fumble deep in Jaguars territory, a
turnover that surely would have proved a fatal blow for the home
team.
</P>
<P>
   But the Titans, we can say for certain now, are not the Oilers.
What's in a name? Apparently, everything. We first suspected as
much the afternoon of the magical finish against Buffalo, of all
people, and the feeling grew when the Titans rallied past the
favored Colts in Indianapolis. This represents inarguable,
unequivocal confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Four lost fumbles and two Mark Brunell interceptions deep-sixed
the uptight Jaguars. They stumbled, bumbled, fumbled and ultimately
crumbled, reeling into an angst-filled offseason by losing to a
franchise that had, for most of its 37 seasons in Texas _ and for
the 39 its helmet logo was the oil derrick _ established the
highest imaginable standards for creative stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention buzzard's luck.
</P>
<P>
   The simple folk of Nashville have no idea, do they? Heck, not
more than a year ago, Eddie George noted, they were merrily
cheering for the opposing team the day after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings were going to the playoffs,'' George said,
remembering the franchise's final game as the Oilers, played at
Vanderbilt Stadium. ``It was pretty strange. But that's all behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of things are behind them, from the Steel Curtain to
Stagger Lee to Buddy Ryan's trying to slap Kevin Gilbride silly.
</P>
<P>
   For Super Bowl-bound Tennessee, so cruelly uprooted from Houston
when owner Bud Adams was rebuffed in his efforts to force the city
to give him a new stadium, the old demons have been exorcised.
While the Titans didn't play the perfect AFC Championship Game, as
the aforementioned gaffes plus a handful of other goofs would
suggest, they picked the Jaguars' pockets at the most opportune
moments.
</P>
<P>
   They made the plays Jacksonville couldn't and ultimately made
some convincing history 33-14, becoming the first team to complete
a single-season trifecta on an opponent's field. Never mind that
the Titans lost both valued free safety Marcus Robertson and
marquee receiver Yancey Thigpen to a broken ankle and a broken
foot, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As the Oilers, Bud's bunglers seemed doggedly destined to lose
in the end. Reincarnated as the Titans, they are, pure and simple,
a team of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Jags went 15-0 vs. everybody else but 0-3 vs. the Titans,
who march on Atlanta as a wild card by definition only. Nothing is
fluky about their 16-3 record, which includes a Halloween defeat
of, uh-huh, the NFC champion Rams, their fellow nomads from St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe 75,206 people in Alltel Stadium couldn't believe it had
happened to their hexed heroes again, but the Titans fully assumed
they would prevail. Coach Jeff Fisher, who prides himself on
preparing his charges for every fathomable scenario, had even
rehearsed their receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, the oilman owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, was here to
hand over his namesake piece of hardware to Adams, whose franchise
won the first two titles in the league _ the AFL _ that he and Hunt
founded in 1959 but, ironically, would be the last of its original
members to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At 77, Adams is only slightly older than his left guard, 17-year
veteran Bruce Matthews, who admitted he has grown tired of
answering the same tired questions for what feels like a lifetime.
Finally Sunday, Matthews had something fresh to say in reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to the Super Bowl,'' he said. ``I'm going to the
Super Bowl. Hey, I like the sound of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans came to town convinced of their superiority, a
mindset the Oilers never quite mastered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence was a big factor in our favor,'' said defensive
coordinator Gregg Williams, whose big halftime adjustment was to
ask his charges to get themselves under control and ``stop trying
to blow up'' a Jaguar on every tackle.
</P>
<P>
   So ol' Bud heads off to the NFL's big hoedown, feeling
vindicated, no doubt. We thought (and perhaps hoped) hell, and
Atlanta, would freeze over before that would transpire. Well, as it
happens, Atlanta was socked hard by an ice storm over the weekend,
leaving thousands without power, and snow is in the forecast for
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Not that winter's intrusion on America's party will matter to
the Titans, especially to the happy handful of long-suffering,
one-time Oilers in their midst. For them, the next stop is heaven.
</P>

AGASSI IN QUARTERFINALS, AND NOW SAMPRAS LOOMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ If you wanted to understand what Sunday's
fourth-round match against Andre Agassi meant to Mark
Philippoussis, you did not need to look at the capacity crowd
surrounding and supporting him or the intensity with which he and
Agassi exchanged shots that were much closer to blows.
</P>
<P>
   All you needed to do was look at the condition of his racket
just moments after the end of the second set. Philippoussis had
already lost the first, and now he had gone down two sets to love
after surrendering a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker. While Agassi
clenched his fist in the direction of his friends Steffi Graf, Brad
Gilbert and Gil Reyes, Philippoussis hurled the tool of his
lucrative trade at the Rebound Ace surface. Only it did not rebound
all that much. Instead, it hit the ground with a frame-cracking
crunch and lay there looking like road kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can make a racket look like a toothpick, you know,''
Agassi said. ``I was just thinking, `I'm glad I'm not the
racket.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is rare that Philippoussis shows much emotion in public,
either in interviews or on the court. Although his 6-foot-4-inch,
195-pound frame makes him look like a heavy, he does not have a
temper to match. But this was an encounter of rare quality and
significance to the Australian, who grew up in Melbourne and had
raised his standard of play to high levels in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His problem was and remains that Agassi appears to be rising,
too, despite his coming 30th birthday and despite all the energy
and adrenaline he expended during his remarkable 1999 season.
Philippoussis managed to win the third set, as Agassi finally began
making a few unforced errors and double faults, but the No.
1-seeded player got his quick hands back around the match for good
to win, 6-4, 7-6 (4), 5-7, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is 29 years old and is playing the best tennis of his life;
it's quite incredible,'' Philippoussis said. ``He is the cleanest
hitter of the ball of any person I have played. He is not really a
nice player to meet early on in tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   This tournament, the year's first Grand Slam event, is entering
its second week, and Agassi and Pete Sampras are just one victory
apiece away from meeting in a semifinal that could end up feeling
more like a final.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also advanced to the quarterfinals in four sets Sunday,
defeating Slava Dosedel, a part-time actor and full-time Czech,
6-1, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1. Sampras was considerably sharper than in his
five-set victory over Wayne Black in the third round. Although
statistics are an overused commodity in tennis, the fact that
Sampras managed to hit 68 percent of his first serves into play was
a telling reflection of his form on courts he considers too quick
for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it woke me up a touch,'' Sampras said of his third-round
scare. ``I don't like to be down two sets and be woken up, but I
realized that my game isn't quite where I want it to be, playing
against Black. Today, I felt a little bit better out there, a
little more comfortable, and that's all you can ask for the second
week. This is where I raise the level, and I hope it happens this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Two seeded players _ Tim Henman of Britain and Mary Pierce of
France and Florida _ proved incapable of raising their level enough
to make it to the second week. Henman, the No. 11 seed who has
struggled lately, was beaten in five wind-swept sets by Chris
Woodruff, a former NCAA singles champion from Tennessee. Pierce,
the women's No. 4-seeded player who won this tournament in 1995,
was beaten by Ai Sugiyama of Japan, 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The victories put Woodruff and Sugiyama in their first Grand
Slam quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The first man into the quarterfinals was Hicham Arazi of
Morocco, who defeated France's Nicolas Escude in a match that was
much more eye catching than its 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7) score line.
Another Moroccan, Younes el-Aynaoui, reached the fourth round by
completing a rain-delayed five-set victory over Spain's rising Juan
Carlos Ferrero.

SCHOOL VOUCHER ISSUE COULD GAIN GROUND IN KANSAS LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The debate over state-funded private school
vouchers has changed this year, and some believe the new focus
might be gaining ground in the Kansas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Past proposals, mainly offered by state Rep. Kay O'Connor of
Olathe, have gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, O'Connor prodded a voucher bill out of the
House Education Committee only to see it crushed 98-23 on the House
floor. The issue has never been considered by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a House majority leader is proposing a
limited ``research project'' on vouchers as part of an overall
education improvement package. State Rep. Kent Glasscock, the
majority leader, is co-sponsoring the bill with the chairman of the
House Education Committee, state Rep. Ralph Tanner, a Baldwin City
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Barbara Lawrence, a Wichita Republican who is
chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee, is sponsoring a bill
to start a pilot project on vouchers. A hearing on the measure is
scheduled for Tuesday in her committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under voucher programs, students receive funds that can be used
to pay tuition at the private school of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Grant, a lobbyist for the Kansas chapter of the National
Education Association, said he had never seen this much support
among legislative leaders for a voucher plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a little more steam this year but not enough,
at least currently, to get it out of the House or Senate
committees,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he was worried that the Glasscock-Tanner legislation
could capture a lot more votes than O'Connor's ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Glasscock, a voucher opponent, said some of his friends are
wondering if he's lost his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``While school choice has been hotly debated around the country,
as far as we can tell there hasn't been a controlled research
project anywhere that answers the question: Is there a positive
correlation between school choice and student learning?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glasscock and Tanner want Kansas to do the first definitive
study, something they believe could have national significance.
</P>
<P>
   Their idea is to give state vouchers to one group of
economically disadvantaged students and then track their academic
progress over several years. A control group from the same area
would be identified and tracked through the public school system.
At the end of the study, their academic progress would be compared.
</P>
<P>
   Students taking part would have to be eligible for
government-subsidized lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Glasscock said the number of students involved and how the
evaluation would be conducted would be left up to researchers. His
proposal only directs the State Department of Education to find a
reputable researcher to do the project. He's not certain, at this
time, how much such a study would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 295, Lawrence's bill, would allow 100 pupils to
receive vouchers in four school districts _ Kansas City, Kan.,
Wichita, Garden City and Topeka _ and their academic progress would
be monitored each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we owe it to our children to have the courage to ask
the question and find the answer,'' Glasscock said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects major opposition from public school organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tallman, an assistant executive director for advocacy at
the Kansas Association of School Boards, won't disappoint him.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman said adopting a research or pilot program would only be
the first step toward an eventual full-fledged voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the Legislature adopts this idea, they're not going to
back away from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman said a study wasn't necessary because many private
schools take the same tests as public schools and comparisons could
be made from the results.
</P>
<P>
   He added that any such study won't address the underlying
problem with vouchers _ public funds being used to send students to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact you have someone like Kent Glasscock saying, `Let's
study it,' will change the complexion of the debate,'' Tallman
said. ``Now, we'll be portrayed as being against gaining
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who directs a pro-voucher organization called Parents
in Control, said interest in vouchers is picking up nationally. She
said there are more than 75 voucher programs nationwide using
private funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those involve 50,000 students with another 1.25 million on
waiting lists,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said she is backing the current efforts in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that we're having this discussion pleases me,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Glasscock acknowledged that passage of either bill would be an
uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   He said his legislation won't be ready for introduction in the
House for another couple of weeks.

FORBES ACCUSES BUSH OF SABOTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(AMES, Iowa) - With voting in the Iowa caucuses a day away, the
skirmishing between the Republican presidential hopefuls
intensified Sunday as Steve Forbes accused front-runner George W.
Bush of last-minute political sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign accused the Bush campaign of using a new
method of negative campaigning, a charge the Bush camp denied.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership Council, a group of moderates who
support abortion rights, are calling Forbes supporters through a
Phoenix-based telecommunications company and asking them whether
they disapprove of Forbes' television ads in Iowa. If they answer
with anything that resembles an affirmative, the call is switched
to the Forbes campaign headquarters in Iowa, Forbes charged on
Sunday, Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a pro-abortion, liberal organization that is
supporting George Bush, and then they go and do a job on me,''
Forbes said at a campaign stop in central Iowa. ``I think that
underscores that we are a threat for the political establishment.
It says it all that they have to do this on the QT.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership Council has run a series of television
ads in Iowa and New Hampshire accusing Forbes of negative
campaigning. The group is made up largely of Bush financial backers
and includes several members of Bush's ``Pioneers,'' the group of
financial donors who have helped Bush raise $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days in Iowa, reporters and Forbes supporters have
been pushing Bush to clarify his stand on abortion rights, and he
has been making statements opposing them. Many observers of the
campaign believe that Bush has moved further to the right in his
public statements on the issue than he is comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain has also recently complained about negative tactics
by Bush, and Forbes took the opportunity to associate himself with
the Arizona senator, saying, ``The Bush campaign has used other
outsiders to attack me and John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush denied any part in the negative telephone
campaigning, saying the Texas governor has focused his efforts on a
get-out-the-vote effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's categorically not true,'' said Brian Jones, a Bush
spokesman. ``Our phone banks are calling people to inform them of
where their caucus locations are and to remind them to come out and
support the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the close ties between the Bush campaign and
the Republican Leadership Council, Jones said, ``I'm not aware of
what the RLC is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes aides pressed their point, saying the Bush campaign
is desperately trying to suppress what is expected to be a muscular
turnout for Forbes today, Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes team produced a pamphlet from the Phoenix-based
political firm. It contained an endorsement from Karl Rove, Bush's
campaign chairman, and boasts of having the Republican Leadership
Council as a client. The company specializes in patch-through
calls, according to the Forbes campaign, and was responsible for
making phone calls on behalf of Bob Dole's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the age of modern communications there is much that can be
done, and they are doing it,'' said Bill Dal Col, Forbes' campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, some Bush supporters say the Forbes
campaign is doing negative calling of its own. Dal Col acknowledged
the campaign was calling Bush supporters in Iowa to try to sway
them at the 11th hour on four issues: taxes, education, Social
Security and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   One resident who said he received such a call, Brad Trow, a Bush
precinct leader, said he considered the appeal ``negative
calling.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the caller identified himself as a Forbes campaign
representative and said Bush had broken a pledge not to raise taxes
in Texas. ``They are not pushing their candidate, they are trying
to push negative information about other candidates,'' Trow said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's phone-call campaign could hurt Forbes, who is expected to
place second in the Iowa caucuses to Bush's first place. A Research
2000 survey of 311 likely GOP voters earlier this week had Bush at
43 percent, Forbes with 25 percent and Alan Keyes with 9 percent.
McCain and Gary Bauer had 7 percent each. The poll had a margin of
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col acknowledged that last-minute dog-fighting is the norm
for the Iowa caucuses, but insisted that it has never been
perpetrated by a third party. He vowed to amend a recent complaint
he had filed with the Federal Elections Commission about the
Republican Leadership Council television ads against Forbes to
include the phone-call campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``However this campaign turns out, this is going to be the start
of a fund-raising investigation not unlike the Democrats had in
1996,'' Dal Col said. ``The questions will be raised, `Who was it,
where did the money come from? Who made the calls?' ''
</P>
<P>
   At a Forbes campaign stop in Waterloo, several undecided voters
expressed their dissatisfaction with the growing bitterness between
the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like little kids tattling on each other,'' Claudia
Martin of Cedar Falls said. ``After a while, you start to tune it
out.'' &QL;

IOWA CAUCUSES MORE ABOUT EXPECTATIONS THAN OUTCOMES

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Ah, the incredible clout of the Iowa
presidential caucus. Without it, there'd have been no President
Muskie, no President Gephardt, no President Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe the small Midwestern state falls a bit short in the
game of picking winners. But presidential nominees Walter Mondale,
Gerald Ford and Bob Dole did survive to the general election in
large part by virtue of their Iowa victories.
</P>
<P>
   And surprising second-place finishes in the state propelled
George McGovern and Ronald Reagan to bigger things. Jimmy Carter
came from near anonymity in his close loss to ``undecided'' to
charge ahead of more prominent politicians in 1976 on his way to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Today in tiny Iowa _ population less than 3 million in a nation
of more than 275 million _ perhaps 100,000 voters will gather for
an hour or three in school cafeterias and church basements to kick
off America's race to November.
</P>
<P>
   One in three caucus voters will have seen a White House wannabe
in person during the last four months, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   In the voters' choices, the infancy of a prolonged process of
picking the state's paltry number of delegates to the Republican
and Democratic national conventions, candidates will find varying
measures of victory. Others likely will be winnowed out.
</P>
<P>
   Much will turn not on who wins, but on how much. Historically
reliable polls suggest Texas Gov. George W. Bush will top the
Republican field and Vice President Al Gore will win among
Democrats. Bush and Gore concur. So do those predicted to run
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the focus among politicians and pundits is whether
Steve Forbes, for instance, can do better than the 18 percent he
scored in an August straw poll of Republicans. Or whether former
Sen. Bill Bradley can meet the 31 percent target the New Jersey
Democrat has set for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like sports contests because there's a winner,'' said Hugh
Winebrenner, a Drake University professor who studies the caucuses.
``In politics, you can lose when you win and win when you lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's all about expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years have passed since the expectations mattered so
much. In 1996, President Clinton was unopposed in the Democratic
race. In 1992, favorite son Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa robbed the
Democratic contest of any meaning and President George Bush had the
GOP race to himself. So not since 1988 _ when the elder Bush and
Michael Dukakis finished embarrassing but surmountable thirds _
have both party races mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the attention and the open nature of this year's
races, it could bring in more people,'' said Donn Stanley, Iowa's
deputy secretary of state. ``But if the weather's bad, you can have
trouble getting people out on a Monday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical turnout is one in 18 of the state's registered voters,
as opposed to the 70 percent that usually show for Iowa's general
elections. So few come partly because going to a caucus is not as
simple, or as quick, as simply voting.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the state doesn't run the election. Political
parties do. And the rules for each are different.
</P>
<P>
   At 2,131 precincts across Iowa's 99 counties, Republicans will
file in to select temporary caucus chairmen. Voters can register,
even switch party allegiances, on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll agree on rules for the caucus. Next, they'll select
delegates to their county conventions. Months later, those
delegates will select delegates to district and state conventions,
who will, in turn, choose delegates to the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus voters also will fill out ballots marking their
presidential preferences. It's all for show, but those are the
numbers reported to party headquarters tonight, and that will trim
the field of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats meet in much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Their votes on president, however, are not by secret ballot.
Instead, the participants will declare their preferences publicly
with a show of hands or by standing in Gore and Bradley clumps. If
one group makes up less than 15 percent of the caucus, the process
is repeated. If, say, Bradley supporters can't gather more than 10
out of a caucus of 100, their numbers are called into Des Moines as
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   At Democratic and Republican caucuses, voters also will chew
over planks to party platforms. With 30 to 700 people at any
caucus, the discussions can run long or short.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Citizens Action Network, a self-styled consumer group,
plans to send 700 persons to nearly as many caucuses to insist on
``comprehensive campaign finance reform,'' although the group
doesn't say what reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make our politicians and elected officials know
that this is something people care about,'' said Betty Ahrens, the
group's program director. ``The caucuses give us a forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics claim that a campaign season that begins with
overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire overlooks much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long time into the process where you have people who
are black and brown having much influence,'' said Ron Walters, who
was a senior adviser in Jesse Jackson's two runs at the presidency.
``This is a state that doesn't reflect the demographics of the
country. That means issues of race get left out.''

OILERS-TURNED-TITANS SUPER BOWL-BOUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID BARRON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
HOUSTON _ If you laughed or cried in good times and bad with a pro
football team that for 37 seasons was known as the Houston Oilers,
the team's coach has a message for you.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We're Super Bowl-bound,'' Jeff Fisher said Sunday afternoon.
``Please come with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and his team will make their long-awaited trek to Atlanta
for Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV against the St. Louis Rams in the
guise of the Tennessee Titans, the corporate name of the NFL
franchise that owner K.S. ``Bud'' Adams after the 1996 season moved
from Houston to Memphis and then to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But for thousands of Houston football fans who watched the
American Football Conference Championship Game at home or who
gathered with friends at sports bars around the city, under the
hide of the Tennessee Titans beats the heart of the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, the Titans didn't falter on the verge of
greatness. For the first time in four tries dating to the days of
the old American Football League, the franchise was victorious in a
championship game with a Super Bowl berth on the line, beating the
Jacksonville Jaguars 33-14 for the AFC title.
</P>
<P>
   They finally kicked in the door, and their reward is a date with
the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' Adams said while accepting the AFC
championship trophy. ``I'm getting pretty old. I didn't want to go
to the Super Bowl in a wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   During the team's days as the Oilers, Adams and Houston fans had
become accustomed to disappointment. After winning AFL
championships in 1960 and '61, Houston lost to the Dallas Texans in
the 1962 AFL Championship Game, to the Oakland Raiders in the 1967
AFL Championship Game and to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1978
and 1979 AFC title games. In each of the last three losses they
fell one game short of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ultimate disappointment _ a landmark January 1993
loss to the Buffalo Bills in the biggest choke in NFL playoff
history _ and what fans viewed as the ultimate betrayal _ Adams'
move to Tennessee when he was unable to obtain the backing of
then-Mayor Bob Lanier for a new stadium in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday against the Jaguars, the Titans were as ruthlessly
efficient in the second half as the Oilers were haphazardly
wretched in the second half of that memorable loss to the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee rallied from a 14-10 deficit with 16 points in 4{
minutes of the second half _ a one-yard touchdown run by
quarterback Steve McNair, a safety and an 80-yard return of the
ensuing free kick by Derrick Mason. McNair, who threw a nine-yard
pass to Yancey Thigpen for the Titans' first TD, later added a
second one-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a standing-room-only crowd at the SRO sports bar in West
Houston cheered the Titans' comeback, a few fans couldn't help but
think about what might have been had the Oilers not moved to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so bad that they're not here, because if they were we'd
have a Super Bowl team,'' said Todd Mason, who wore an Oilers
replica McNair jersey. ``I hope they win the Super Bowl. I really
do. I'd like them to be here, but money talks these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my voice screaming, and I'm going to be here for them
again next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sting over the Oilers' departure may have been
blunted by the impending arrival of a new NFL franchise, owned by
local businessman Bob McNair, that will begin play in a new stadium
for the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud was asking for $100 million, and what is McNair forking
over _ about a billion?'' said fan Bill Clark, who watched the game
at Dave and Buster's on Richmond Avenue. ``It doesn't seem quite as
stinky as it did a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for the Titans. I'm sure I'll be a total Texans fan or
whatever when that team starts here, but I love the Titans now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the SRO-OT Sports Bar and Grill in North Houston, the packed
house cheered enthusiastically when the CBS cameras focused on such
former Houston favorites as offensive lineman Bruce Matthews and
booed lustily when Adams was on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bittersweet, because this is supposed to be Houston's
celebration,'' Tara Davis said. ``The city went through so much
with that team, and to see them finally get to the top is great,
but there is supposed to be a big welcoming party at
Intercontinental tonight, not in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is supposed to be a parade downtown after the Super Bowl
like we had for the Rockets and Comets, not some Grand Ole Opry
hoedown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pulling for the guys, not the owner,'' said fan Bruce
Myers, who gleefully participated in a mock fund-raiser during the
game to raise money for a replacement hairpiece for Adams. ``The
guys on the team that have always put their heart into it like
Matthews, (Blaine) Bishop those guys. But not the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all fans were so anti-Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a business decision, and that you have to understand,''
said Ronnie Adams, who is not related to the Titans owner. ``I can
separate the business from the spectator part. I hated to see them
leave, but the team's leaving didn't stop me from rooting for them.
So if they win it all, it won't be the same as if they were here,
but I'll pull for them, and I'll be happy for them if they win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans general manager Floyd Reese, who came to Houston as an
assistant coach in 1986 before rising through the ranks, said the
team is glad to embrace fans from any locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we've got a lot of fans in Houston,''
Reese said in the Titans' locker room in Jacksonville. ``It
wouldn't matter if they were from Houston or Juneau, Alaska; we
love them. We're happy for the fans in Houston, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Fisher. Even though the AFC championship trophy will bear
the name of the Tennessee Titans, Fisher thinks there will be
enough glory for Houston fans to share as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed Luv Ya Blue (the nickname for the Bum
Phillips-coached Oilers of the late 1970s and 1980),'' Fisher said.
``The team came so close so many times, and a lot of people in
Houston are pulling for us. We left behind a legacy, and our fans
in Houston deserve to enjoy this with us.''

PARNEVIK WINS HOPE TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. _ Jesper Parnevik often has been regarded
as one of the PGA Tour's most-unusual characters, a reputation
earned from the upturned bill on his cap to eating volcanic ash and
wearing unusual golf outfits.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing unusual about his game. Parnevik not only
is a top international player and a two-time member of the European
Ryder Cup team, but he's also a three-time winner in the U.S. His
latest victory occurred Sunday at Bermuda Dunes Country Club, when
he outlasted Rory Sabbatini to win the $3 million Bob Hope Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Swede came from three shots down with a 6-under
65 to defeat Sabbatini for the first-place check of $540,000.
Sabbatini, a second-year touring pro who also let a lead slip away
in last year's Bell South Classic in Atlanta, won $324,000 for his
68 and solo second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion David Duval, expected to make a final-round
push like last year, when he shot a 59 at the Arnold Palmer Course
at PGA West, instead tied Hal Sutton for fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, who had a 64 at Bermuda Dunes on Sunday, finally
passed Sabbatini with a 15-foot birdie on the par-4 11th hole, and
then it came down to who would falter first down the stretch. It
wasn't the best golf, but it did have its share of drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little more interesting than I wanted,'' Parnevik
said. ``That's just the way I do things, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbatini birdied five of his first nine holes and had a
two-stroke lead on Parnevik at the turn when his driver
</P>
<P>
   and a marshal _ gave him trouble. He bogeyed the 10th hole when
a marshal almost stepped on his ball _ twice _ next to the green.
Sabbatini had to sink a six-footer for bogey to salvage what he
could on the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very unnecessary,'' he said of the marshal's actions.
``He decided he was going to play soccer with my golf ball. It took
me out of my chain of thought. For a while, it kind of played on my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbatini bogeyed the 11th hole, and an errant driver forced him
to make three consecutive saving pars on holes 15-17.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, meanwhile, had birdied holes 11 and 13 for a
two-stroke lead, but he gave one back with a six-foot miss on the
385-yard 14th hole. He had his own problems with his driver and
even hit a spectator on the 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked terrible,'' Parnevik said. ``It looked like a golf
ball was growing out of his forehead. He said, ``As long as you win
the tournament, I'll be OK.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, playing one hole ahead of Sabbatini, birdied the 18th
hole by two-putting from 40 feet, and then it was Sabbatini's turn.
</P>
<P>
   He left his drive on No. 18 ``about five yards too far left,''
he said, and it stopped behind a tree. He pitched out with a wedge,
but the ball stopped next to a group of palm trees alongside a
pond. He then hit a 114-yard sand wedge over the trees to 25 feet,
but his effort to force a tie missed short and low of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy with that shot,'' he said, ``considering what
I had facing me. These things ... they occur, but hopefully, less
frequently in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, who is No. 1 on this year's tour money list with
$808,700 _ he earlier tied for sixth and third at the Mercedes
Championships and Sony Open, respectively _ said a 10-week break he
took at the end of last year has helped him start well in 2000. He
also is feeling better after being a diagnosed with an irregular
heartbeat last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the same thing three years ago,'' he said, referring to
his extended break from the game. ``I probably took 15 weeks off to
just relax and play for fun with friends at home, and I did well in
my first four tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time I feel like I have a good time on the golf
course, I have a lot of fun and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was one of those.
</P>
<P>
   First-round leader David Toms challenged for the lead Sunday but
settled for a third-place finish with J.L. Lewis at 25-under. Each
player won $174,000. Fred Funk had the low round of the day, an
8-under 63, and tied John Huston and tour rookie Matt Gogel for
seventh and $93,500.

`HANDHAKE': THERE MAY BE TOO MANY DOCTORS IN THE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As television learned early, there is inherent drama
in medicine: the human body at war against alien invaders or even
against itself, doctors marshaling the forces of modern science and
technology to combat disease and save lives. But it's a drama that
seldom transfers to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   While the camera can transport an audience into the corridors of
big city hospitals or mobile army field stations, into operating
theaters and emergency rooms, creating a verisimilitude of
blood-and-guts action that captures the life-and-death struggle
being played out, the stage can take us, at best, into a hospital
room in which a patient is hooked up to an IV drip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handshake,'' a play by Julie Gilbert and Dr. Robert A.
Brodner, a neurosurgeon, about an ophthalmologist named Bill Ford
who is suffering from Parkinson's disease, tries to recreate a
surgical procedure called pallidotomy. But in the staging at the
Miranda Theater it looks more like an execution in the electric
chair and serves as a testament that brain surgery is not
playwriting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Handshake'' is less a real play than a staged case
history of one Parkinson's patient and his family, with an
infomercial for pallidotomy running through. The whole exercise
turns on whether Ford will agree to undergo the new and risky
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a conflict is the debate within his family
over whether he should have the surgery. His daughter is against
it, his son is for it, and his wife wavers back and forth. Since
Brodner is a strong advocate of the procedure, there are no
surprises in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the two hours is padded with flashbacks to Ford's
earlier, happier times with his wife, Helen, and by cutting back
and forth to a support group for families of Parkinson's patients,
all of whom deliver a laundry list of complaints about spouses or
relatives who drool and shake and are an embarrassment at the
dinner table. One can only pray to be preserved from the love of
such relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The co-authors fill the rest of the two hours with peripherals.
A running subplot questions why the surgeon would even want to
attempt the operation; it takes two long scenes to persuade an HMO
doctor to approve the surgery; and two early scenes deal with a
malpractice suit against Ford that never figures again in the plot.
</P>
<P>
   In plays in which the drama is internal _ as when disease is the
protagonist _ it is the characters who must maintain an audience's
interest, as in successful medical dramas like ``Wit,'' ``As Is''
and ``Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' Although there is biographical
data about Ford and his family (and the surgeon) strewn through
``Handshake,'' one never really gets to know any of them.
</P>
<P>
   When Helen, for example, relates having a brief sexual fling in
a hotel room, then coming home to find her husband sitting in a
chair waiting for her, she simply stands downstage and recites the
facts. A scene with Helen and her lover in the hotel room, followed
by the one in which she opens the door to find her husband awaiting
her return would give both Helen and Ford a chance to examine
exactly what the disease had done to each of them.
</P>
<P>
   For a play about a disease that is supposed to produce such
extreme emotion, the production, under Yanna Kroyt-Brandt's
direction, is curiously listless. None of the performances rise
much above scene-study level. M.J. Karmi delivers a credible
reading as Helen, and Oliver Vaquer brings some energy to the role
of Ford's son. As Ford, Brian Delate is oddly low-key, and it is
only in the final scene that his slurred speech and shaking find a
consistency that arouses some sympathy.
</P>

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS' DERRICK THOMAS INJURED IN AUTO ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nine-time Kansas City Chiefs Pro Bowler
Derrick Thomas was seriously injured Sunday in a single-car
accident on Interstate 435 near Woodland Avenue in Kansas City,
North, that killed one person and injured another, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and another passenger, who was pronounced dead at the
scene, were thrown from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the family, who asked not to be identified,
said that as Thomas was treated at the scene, he was conscious and
said he had no feeling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Later at the Liberty Hospital emergency room in Liberty, Mo.,
Thomas, 33, reportedly still had no feeling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the Missouri Highway Patrol identified the man who
was killed as Michael D. Tellis, 49, of Kansas City, Kan., a friend
of Thomas' who once was a business partner in a limousine venture.
</P>
<P>
   A third man, John C. Hagebusch, 34, of Raymore, Mo., suffered
minor injuries in the accident. He was taken to Liberty Hospital
but was not admitted. Only Hagebusch was wearing his seat belt,
according to the Missouri Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs President and General Manager Carl Peterson would not
confirm the nature of Thomas' injuries, only their severity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been seriously injured,'' Peterson said. ``The extent
of those injuries are still being determined. He is alert,
comfortable, stable and will be in the hospital in Liberty
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are following the dictates of the medical people and will
provide you with information as it becomes available to us. We ask
for Kansas City fans and fans everywhere for their prayers for
Derrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Crossett, Liberty Hospital administrator, said members of
Thomas' family had asked the hospital not to discuss his injuries
in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Chiefs organization reacted to news of
Thomas' accident with shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating to me,'' coach Gunther Cunningham said Sunday
night. ``Forget about the football aspect of it. He has given a lot
to this city and to this organization. It's a tough thing to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates also were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' tight end Tony Gonzalez said. ``It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been praying for him, his family and for Mike and
his family,'' said fullback Tony Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who was attending the NFC championship game between
the Rams and Buccaneers in St. Louis Sunday, tried to leave early
to return to Kansas City, said Chiefs public relations director Bob
Moore. However, weather prevented Peterson from catching a flight
in.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was reportedly on his way to Kansas City International
Airport to catch a flight to St. Louis for the game, where he had
sideline passes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, Thomas was driving about 1:30
p.m. when he lost control of the vehicle on the snow- and
ice-covered road. The car traveled into the median and rolled
several times.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Tellis were thrown from the vehicle. Tellis was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' 1999 Chevrolet Suburban looked as though it had rolled
at least twice, said tow truck driver Jerry Thomas, no relation to
Derrick Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof was smashed down in on it, I'd say at least 8 inches
on the driver's side,'' Jerry Thomas said. ``The hood was squashed
down on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle's right rear tire and brake drum was ripped off as
well, Jerry Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The grassy median where Thomas crashed rests along a serene,
deserted stretch of I-435.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas arrived at Liberty Hospital about 2:30 p.m. and was
conscious when he came in, said Crossett, who briefed reporters
about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians had not operated but had conducted diagnostic tests
on Thomas, Crossett said, declining to specify the nature of the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was with family members, Liberty Hospital physicians and
Chiefs doctors. Thomas' mother, Edith Morgan, was in Orlando, Fla.,
earlier Sunday and didn't learn of her son's injury until she
returned to her Miami area home later in the day. She was
attempting to reach Kansas City Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Crossett would not characterize Thomas' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of calls, and there are a number of his
friends and family here,'' Crossett said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' sister and former Kansas City Councilwoman Carol Coe
were among the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Other visitors included Dennis Thum, the Chiefs' executive vice
president and assistant general manager, Jon Browne, team
physician, and Joe Waeckerle, a trauma specialist who works on the
sidelines at Chiefs games.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates Marcus Spears and Bracy Walker and former teammate
Tracy Simien also were at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been one of the NFL's most dominant pass rushers. He
could single-handedly dominate games and became feared by opponents
for his ability to not only rush from a quarterback's blind side,
but also for his skill in creating turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had a league-record seven sacks in a 1990 game against
Seattle. He had six sacks in a 1998 game against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had 20 sacks in 1990, putting him fifth on the NFL's
single-season list.
</P>
<P>
   His production slowed the past two seasons, and he was even
benched during running situations in 1998. But he was still
respected by opponents, who game-planned to account for Thomas on
every pass play.

RAMS SAVE SUPER BOWL FROM BEING TOTAL SNOOZER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Look at it this way:
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl was saved.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, there is no known reason on this little plastic
parcel of God's green turf that the St. Louis Rams deserve to be
Georgia-bound.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's most entertaining team _ and that has definitely been
the Rams _ was reduced to an offensive version of the Cowboys here
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration, futility and yellow-flag stupidity _ it all came
tumbling down on the Rams in the NFC Championship Game. St. Louis
was an outplayed team, and seemed to be a beaten team.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay came ``this'' close to pulling off the largest post
season upset since Namath's Jets. In no way, defensively, did the
Buccaneers remotely resemble a 14-point underdog. For the Bucs,
there would be no football justice in the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it's best this way. Best the Rams didn't fade,
and finally survived with a wing, a prayer and, yes, a ``fade.''
The wing belonged to quarterback Kurt Warner. The prayer was the
jump ball Warner tossed toward a single-covered Ricky Proehl in the
end zone. It's called a ``fade'' route. Proehl won his battle, and
the Rams won the game, 11-6. Aaron Sele can relate. He won many
games for the Rangers, 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fortunate we escaped with this one,'' said St. Louis
coach Dick Vermeil, an honest man supplying the understatement of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   But go ahead and rejoice, all you neutral observers of the Super
Bowl. Despite what didn't happen here yesterday, the Rams will
still bring to Atlanta plenty of razzle-dazzle. At least the
potential for fun and fireworks will be there Sunday against
Tennessee. When St. Louis has the ball, butts will be planted on
sofas all over America. Step away for a beer, and you might miss
something.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL is going to be reduced to Brand X teams now playing
for conference championships _ hello again, Mr. Parity _ then the
entertainment value of the Super Bowl becomes more important than
quality. Particularly when the NFL has become void of quality.
</P>
<P>
   A Super Bowl being played with teams that have name value and
regal history on their resumes is now doubtful. Yesterday, in the
conference championship games, there were exactly none of those
among the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Rams and Titans kick it off Sunday in Atlanta _
hey, this match-up is OK. The Rams bring their offense, and the
Titans bring their January mojo. From that disputed miracle ending
against Buffalo three weeks ago, to yesterday in Jacksonville, when
a lost fumble on the 1-yard line ended up producing nine points _
for some unknown reason, is Tennessee being blessed, or being just
flat lucky?
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Titans also beat St. Louis, 24-21, in the
regular season. But as Tennessee had to have the ``Music City
Miracle'' to get to Atlanta, maybe yesterday was the Rams' divine
moment of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   They won when they shouldn't have won, partly became Tampa Bay's
rookie quarterback made a very poor choice on a mid-field pass late
in the game. The Bucs were up 6-5 and were holding all the
defensive trump cards, including field position.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-11 from the 50, Shaun King didn't need to be
reckless, particularly with eight minutes to play. A punt from
there was as a good as a first down. The Rams' offense would be
pinned deep again, and this was an offense in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   King, normally a heady kid, tried to connect with running back
Warrick Dunn on a timing route underneath the defensive coverage.
``The timing wasn't there, and a good defense will capitalize on
that,'' said the rookie. His poorly thrown duck to the left flat
was intercepted by nickel back Dre' Bly. Life returned to the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   King's mistake would become the second biggest play of the
afternoon. The biggest would follow nearly four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The deeply religious Warner became a cold-blooded gambling man
with the ball at the Tampa Bay 30. On third-and-four, Warner read a
blitz by safety Damien Robinson, and immediately shoved all his
chips to the middle of the table.
</P>
<P>
   Proehl, a 10-year veteran, made the same read as his quarterback
when he saw the safety blitz. He streaked toward the end zone,
locked in one-on-one coverage with nickel back Brian Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ``fade'' Troy Aikman attempted with Nine-Toed Deion
at a critical point in the Jets' game? Except Deion was outmuscled
and the ball was intercepted, and Aikman was wrongly blamed by many
for ``underthrowing'' his receiver?
</P>
<P>
   Aikman made the same throw Warner did yesterday. The difference
was Proehl, and how he played the fade. The pattern is about
you-against-him. Go get the jump ball. Proehl did. His first TD
catch of the season was the biggest of the season for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   With the lead, St. Louis still had a late sweat. But the Bucs'
final drive was stalled, and then killed, by a controversial
instant-replay overturn of a pass completion.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, of course, were very lucky to win. For entertainment
purposes next week, be glad they did.

IT'LL STILL BE A SUPER GAME TO WATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Amen for Tennessee and St. Louis. The Titans and
Rams making it to Super Bowl XXXIV is the best thing to happen to
the NFL since instant replay (Sorry, Tampa Bay).
</P>
<P>
   We realize in sports bars and other such places of idle worship
there are many who don't share our belief. It's six days before
sport's biggest excuse for a party and already some casual fans are
moaning and groaning as though they just swallowed a stale tortilla
chip covered in rotten guacamole.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, we have no patience for those fixated on John Elway's
retirement and Vinny Testaverde's season-ending injury and Dan
Marino's naked ring finger and Nashville's status as the
30th-largest television market.
</P>
<P>
   To say there are no immortals in Sunday's game and little
imperative to watch is as off the mark as the Jaguars' Super Bowl
ditty, ``Uh-oh,'' henceforth known as ``The Oh-No Song.''
</P>
<P>
   What advertisers are paying $3 million for 30 seconds of airtime
for, what ESPN is sending 18 reporters to Atlanta for and what a
television audience in the billions will tune in for is something
very sacred indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the NFL's Salvation Bowl I.
</P>
<P>
   Honest-to-God, if you're a faithful football fan, you have to
thank heaven for the Titans and Rams. From NFL parvenu Kurt Warner
to the long-suffering Bruce Matthews, this Super Bowl promises to
deliver the league from every evil that assailed it this season.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, you'll remember, gave us:
</P>
<P>
   The throat-slashing gesture;
</P>
<P>
   Randy Moss squirting a referee with a water bottle;
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Brown toppling a referee;
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Collins' arrest on burglary charges;
</P>
<P>
   Rae Carruth's arrest on first-degree murder charges, and:
</P>
<P>
   Tony Martin's federal money-laundering trial.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it was starting to seem the NFL stood for Narcissists,
Felons and Louts, the league somehow assembled a cast of solid
citizens and commendable characters for the season's final act.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos, forget if you can that the Rams' 11-6 win over Tampa
Bay in the NFC Championship Game was a feather in the boa of
Georgia Frontiere, who on any given Sunday will never be confused
with Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Focus instead on how fitting it is that Jeff Fisher will grace
the sidelines of the first Super Bowl contested since the death of
one of the game's all-time finest players and people, Walter
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, an L.A. native who attended Taft High in Woodland Hills,
was a teammate of Payton on the Chicago Bears. He also was a
teammate of Titans offensive guard Bruce Matthews at USC.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews showed the patience of Susan Lucci. He persevered, and
in his 17th season, he finally was rewarded with a trip to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told myself it didn't bother me `never to have played
in a Super Bowl,' '' Matthews finally was free to admit. ``But it
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the Titans were the Cal State Northridge of the
NFL. That's right; in a league where money flows like Dom Perignon,
the Titans' coaching brain trust was housed in one portable trailer
while meetings were held in another. Another Jeff, the Matadors'
Kearin, can relate.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN players, take note: The Titans didn't get an inferiority
complex, they got fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years, four stadiums, three cities, two states, two names
and we heard almost no complaints,'' Titans general manager Floyd
Reese has said, alluding to Tennessee's nomadic existence after
departing Houston. ``The way our players handled the adversity has
made everyone in the organization proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee running back Eddie George is a pretty fair Payton
knockoff, rushing for more than 1,000 yards in four consecutive
seasons. Not that many people noticed. It says a lot about George
that he didn't pound his chest and roar to draw raves. He was too
busy pumping iron.
</P>
<P>
   George is so durable he hasn't missed a game in four seasons and
so diligent he had to check himself into a hospital last year after
working himself to exhaustion in Ohio's searing summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is forever telling George he should go easier on himself.
Think Lawrence Phillips' actions prompted the same lectures from
the Rams' Dick Vermeil and Miami's Jimmy Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Titans quarterback Steve McNair, the anti-Ryan
Leaf. The next arrogant remark he makes will be his first.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's athleticism, not his ancestry, is what makes him such a
great story. Heaven help our society if McNair has to field the
same question asked of Washington's Doug Williams before Super Bowl
XXII: ``How long have you been a black quarterback?''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans assembled their team the old-fashioned way; they
started 16 draft picks Sunday in their 33-14 victory over
Jacksonville. In this age of free agency and salary cap
maneuverings, the Titans are throwbacks. They hark back to a
simpler era when you didn't buy championships, you built them.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, the Rams' quarterback, also is old-school. His story is
the stuff of which Johnny Unitas' legend was made. A one-year
starter (and four-year benchwarmer) at Division I-AA Northern Iowa,
Warner went undrafted in the NFL and was rejected by the Canadian
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for a while stocking shelves for minimum wage at a
Hy-Vee supermarket in Cedar Falls, Iowa. That was followed by short
stints in the Arena Football League and NFL Europe. The Rams signed
him in 1998, but he appeared in only one game. They thought so much
of him, they left him unprotected in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleveland didn't want him, either. And so Warner remained in
the shadows of well-compensated starter Trent Green.
</P>
<P>
   Green got injured in the exhibition season, Warner stepped in
and the rest is a story that doesn't need to be told by the likes
of the late John Facenda to bring about shivers.
</P>
<P>
   His 19th career start will be in the Super Bowl. Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Warner did upon being summoned to the microphone
to address the Trans World Dome crowd was praise the Lord. His
expression left no room for questioning his sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   And how about Rams receiver Isaac Bruce, who turned to the
Scriptures for relief (and got it) when his hamstring injury flared
last week?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that: A Super Bowl that counts the Creator among its
sponsors. In a season that saw so many sacred cows get tipped,
isn't that the best reason of all to embrace Super Bowl XXXIV?

NOW USC REALLY WILL FEEL THE PRESSURE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After their unlikely victory over No. 2-ranked
Arizona, USC basketball players talked about how no one gave the
Trojans a chance to pull off the upset.
</P>
<P>
   But even within the team, there was some doubt over how the
injury-riddled Trojans could defeat the Wildcats, as USC tried to
overcome the loss of forward Sam Clancy (broken foot) and Jarvis
Turner (broken ankle).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weird feeling but I wasn't sure we would win this
game,'' USC forward Brian Scalabrine said. ``I could not get those
injuries out of my head. It was hard to believe Sam was hurt but I
said to myself that we've just got to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Trojans are 5-0 (12-5 overall) and in sole
possession of first place in the Pacific-10 Conference, Scalabrine
thinks the task will become considerably tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be very difficult to sustain it. Not because
we can't keep it up playing this well. But people will look to
knock us off now, no matter what,'' he said. ``And they know we
won't have our leading scorer and rebounder.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy led USC in both categories (17.2 points, 7.7 rebounds)
before suffering his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Encore, encore: How will the Trojans top last weekend? After
defeating Arizona State in overtime, overcoming the loss of Clancy
and Turner and upsetting Arizona, what else could they do to top
their current emotional high?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to keep winning,'' point guard Brandon Granville
said. ``We're going to ride the roller coaster until it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scalabrine already has an immediate goal in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``How hard is that going to be to top this?'' he asked, then
answered the question. ``A win at the Pit would be huge. If we can
do that ...''
</P>
<P>
   USC plays at Oregon on Thursday night. The Ducks (13-3, 4-1) are
5-2 at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   No fear: Scalabrine said none of the reserves who got their
first significant minutes in weeks were overwhelmed by the thought
of playing against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different generation. These kids think they can play no
matter who they are. There's no fear,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Home-court advantage: USC has defeated Arizona three of the past
four seasons at the Sports Arena. The Trojans are also 7-0 at home
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to be getting more support now,'' forward David
Bluthenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   USC has also won seven straight games for the first time since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Iron man: Granville played all 40 minutes against Arizona, the
fourth time he has done it this season. He had just three
turnovers, and recorded his fourth double-double (12 points, 10
assists).
</P>
<P>
   Football commitment: USC received an oral commitment from
offensive lineman Travis Watkins of Helix High in San Diego.
Watkins (6-foot-4, 290 pounds) selected USC over San Diego State,
Oregon and Washington and is the fifth offensive lineman to commit
to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   USC now has 17 commitments and has five available scholarships,
although the Trojans could use more with the recent medical
redshirt of Matt Welch and transfer of Darren Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cornerback Eric Reese, who was in jeopardy of being
ineligible, has met the necessary academic requirements and will be
available to participate in spring practice in March. In another
development, wide receiver Kareem Kelly has experienced a change of
heart and will attempt to run track this season.

ELEVEN KILLED, DOZENS INJURED IN WRECKS ON ICY STREETS

 THE KANSAS CITY STAR STAFF

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A fiery 24-vehicle, chain-reaction crash on
Interstate 29 Sunday afternoon killed 10 people and injured 42
others.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was one of a series of multi-vehicle accidents spawned
by freezing drizzle and snow that transformed highways throughout
the metropolitan area into ice-glazed slides. In all, 11 persons
were killed and 108 injured.
</P>
<P>
   Quantifying the tragedy was difficult Sunday because police and
fire departments as well as ambulance services and hospitals were
too overwhelmed by the volume of accidents and injuries to compile
complete figures.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 p.m. law enforcement agencies had reported at least 430
accidents in the metropolitan area and the number was bound to
increase, officers said. Kansas City had more than 200 accidents
and Independence had logged 70.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in Jackson, Clay and Platte counties in MIssouri and
Johnson and Wyandotte counties in Kansas had reported treating 108
accident victims with injuries ranging from critical to minor. Most
of the injuries were not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   On the stretch of Interstate 29 between Kansas City
International Airport and St. Joseph, Mo., there were at least 50
accidents involving 100 vehicles from about 1 to 3 p.m., according
to the Missouri Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Interstates and highways in the metropolitan area fared little
better. Damaged cars and trucks littered the shoulders and medians
of I-435, I-70, I-29 and I-35.
</P>
<P>
   The worst accident was on I-29 near Missouri 273 north of Platte
City where five tractor-trailers and 19 other vehicles were
involved in a chain-reaction crash.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Jim McMillen of the Missouri Highway Patrol said the names
of the dead probably wouldn't be released until today after
relatives were notified. He said one of the victims was a
grandfather from Florida who was visiting family in St. Joseph for
his 16-year-old grandchild's birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Identification of the victims was made more difficult because
several of the bodies were burned and were difficult to reach
because of the mangled wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were unsure of the cause of the accident, but
McMillen said one of those involved said visibility on the highway
was near zero.
</P>
<P>
   He said that one or more of the vehicles began sliding about
1:10 p.m. on the ice-covered highway. Before it was all over, five
tractor-trailers had jackknifed and 19 other pickups and cars had
collided in the chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   One of the semitrailers caught fire. Because it was wedged in
with two other semis and about a dozen other vehicles, those
vehicles also were engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the dead were burned, according to McMillen.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the vehicles involved were welded together by the
force of the crash and the heat of the fires, and it was difficult
to discern where one began and the other ended.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers had a difficult time getting to the wreck because of
traffic that was backed up for miles and heavy snow that cut
visibility to about 100 yards at 2:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Once they arrived they were met with a grisly scene. Several of
the victims who had burned in their cars were still inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol closed I-29 for about 10 miles north of
Platte City. Traffic south of Platte City slowed to a crawl for
miles because of the fatal wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers were stranded at the nearby QuikTrip Travel Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no place to park,'' said Kathy Smith, a
diesel clerk at the store. ``We've got about 20 people standing
around just at the phones. Truckers are parked everywhere, even on
the fuel islands, because there's no place to go. Even the
McDonald's lot is full.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the witnesses at the scene were still too distressed to
comment or declined to comment on the advice of their insurance
agents.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was not expected, and the ice proved a challenge for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were having a heck of a time just getting around with the
tow trucks,'' said Donald Adamson, a Northland Tow Service driver.
</P>
<P>
   A separate multi-vehicle wreck forced police to close northbound
Interstate 435 at Truman Road. Throughout the metropolitan area,
stretches of road were shut to all but rescuers and tow truck
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Transportation tried to prepare for
the snow that had been forecast as a possibility by pretreating
highways and bridges, and crews expected to be out all Sunday
night. Still, so many cars collided that many drivers were told to
walk into police stations to report their wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers looking for a wreck near the Downtown Airport reported
that the Broadway bridge was coated with a sheet of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Other rescuers reported similar scenes.
</P>
<P>
   One ambulance crew reported seeing cars sliding off an exit ramp
from I-29 and ``shooting right off the ramp and going
upside-down.''
</P>
<P>
   The deluge of crashes began about 1:30 p.m., and the pace slowed
two hours later. But rescue crews worked frantically for hours
trying to pull apart the wreckage and treat the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a roundup of accidents in the metro area, culled from
dispatchers' estimates and police reports as of 8 p.m. Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County, Mo., had at least 303 accidents. Kansas City had
the most, with 200 as of 5 p.m.; Independence had 70 accidents, one
with a serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Cass County, Mo., had 12 accidents. Most of them were minor, but
one accident on U.S. 71 South and Missouri 58 near Raymore had
seven injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County, Mo., had five or six minor accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Missouri Highway Patrol handled about 60
accidents between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. in Platte, Clay and Jackson
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County, Kan., had 16 accidents, mostly fender benders.
</P>
<P>
   Wyandotte County, Kan., had 14 accidents, none of them serious.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Kansas Highway Patrol handled more than 26
accidents in Johnson and Wyandotte counties. In one of the
accidents, a victim was sent to a hospital with injuries that were
not life-threatening.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``A VAST CONSPIRACY'' &QL; 
By Jeffrey Toobin (Random House, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toobin's last book was about the O.J. Simpson trial. We've had a
hard time deciding whether he has come up in the world or plunged
to new depths by taking on this more recent tangle of thorns, the
Clinton sex scandal. In the end, of course, he has traded up _
there was no blood shed in the White House, merely a shedding of
judgment and esteem and familial accord. We spoke with Toobin after
the Simpson book was released, and he told us that as a lawyer he
was both horrified and fascinated by the trial, like a passing
motorist gaping at a terrible accident. This time, Toobin has
jumped out of his vehicle and is selling tickets, tour guide
extraordinaire. He covered the Clinton saga for ``The New Yorker,''
and he offers all the details, including Paula Jones' relentlessly
explicit descriptions of Clinton's flawed anatomy. And, of course,
we knew as we read it that we, like Toobin, were no longer just
driving by. We became part of the ghoulish scene. &QL; 
``AMERICAN FAN'' &QL; 
By Dennis Perrin (Spike, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   errin offends just about everybody in this look at sports in
America, and it's great fun watching him do it. Christians take a
beating in the section about ``religious'' athletes. Radio
talk-show hosts are taken to task for being ``White, male,
heavyset, obsessive, egomaniacal, brusque,'' and only once removed
from the people who call them. Shaquille O'Neal, Nike and college
basketball coaches (with ``Nike bucks stuffed in their G-strings'')
come under scrutiny in a chapter on sports marketing. Even Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa suffer under Perrin's analysis of the home
run race, during which ``Big Mac was the All-American boy . . .
(and) Sosa the Dominican was made his comic sidekick: less Sancho
Panza (McGwire was no wayward Quixote), more a smiling Tonto to
McGwire's Lone Ranger.'' Women are left out altogether, and we
should be grateful. ``I deal almost exclusively with male sports
and male fans,'' Perrin writes, ``for the simple reason that this
is where the true lunacy lies.'' &QL; 
``THE COMFORTS OF HOME'' &QL; 
By Merritt Ierley (Potter, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1799, the family of a Philadelphia woman named Elizabeth
Drinker purchased a ``shower bath'' _ a framework holding a
container of water that would fall on a bather's head when she
pulled a cord. It was an odd luxury. ``I bore it better than I
expected,'' Elizabeth wrote in her diary, ``not having been wett
(SIC, CORRECT) all over att (SIC, CORRECT) once for twenty-eight
years past.'' When Thomas Jefferson moved into the White House in
1801, there was only a privy out back. Jefferson, who had witnessed
innovations in modern convenience in France, requested that a water
closet be installed (it was, but not until 1804, leaving Jefferson
to suffer in the privy for three long years). Ierley charts the
evolution of comfort and convenience in the American home,
beginning with the turn of the 19th century; jumping to 1860,
before the mass-production spurred by the Civil War; and ending
with 1920s to the present, with America on the cutting edge of
household convenience. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``JAMES JOYCE'' &QL; 
By Edna O'Brien (Viking, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all its great writers, James Joyce's relationship with
Ireland is the most contradictory. ``He determined to reinvent the
city where he had been marginalized, laughed at and barred from
literary circles,'' O'Brien writes. ``He would be the poet of his
race. In one of his early verses he likened himself to a stag,
antlers charging upon the land.'' That sets the tone for this
wonderful volume from the ``Penguin Lives'' series of short
biographies. O'Brien reveals Joyce's tumultuous ties to his mother,
who bore 16 children, and to the Catholic Church; his sexual
appetite for Nora Barnacle, the common girl from Galway who would
be his wife (and who would never read beyond the first pages of
Ulysses; his attractions to other women; his struggle to find
acceptance for his work; and his self-absorption and eccentricity.
``He was a tragic man with a staggering genius for whom humor was a
weapon,'' O'Brien says. Or, as another writer put it, he was ``a
Dante who had lost the key to his own inferno.'' &QL;
