<HEADLINE> Irish Lawmakers' Visit to Northern Cyprus Illegal: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Thursday
said it is taking appropriate measures regarding the illegal
visit of Irish lawmakers to the Turkish-occupied northern part of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The visit of the Irish parliamentarians to the occupied areas
is illegal," government spokesman Costas Serezis said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus government, through its embassy in Dublin,
"is taking all appropriate measures."
</P>
<P>
Asked if similar representations were made regarding recent
visits to the Turkish Cypriot area by the ambassadors of Pakistan
and Bosnia in Ankara, Serezis said "representations had been made
by our permanent mission to the U.N. and at an ambassadorial
level."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot daily Kibris reported Wednesday that the
four Irish lawmakers, Evin Ryan and Sean Power of the Fianna
Party, and Denis Naughel and Liam Cosgrane of the Fine Gael Party,
arrived in northern Cyprus on July 5 and will leave there on July
10.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is recognized only by
Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Hails British Decision to Resume Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid Thursday hailed the decision by the British
government to resume diplomatic relations with Libya.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the league secretariat, Abdel-Meguid
expressed hope that Britain's decision would lead to the lifting
of sanctions on Libya due to the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sanctions "have caused damage to the Libyan
people and its neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a Pan AM flight was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland,
leaving 270 people dead. Britain and the United States accused two
Libyans of masterminding the explosion and demanded that Tripoli
hand over the suspects for trial.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. pressed the U.N. Security Council to
impose an air and arms embargo on Libya in 1992 for its failure to
extradite the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Saudi Arabia and South Africa, Libya handed over
the two suspects in April to a Scottish court in the
Netherlands. And the U.N. Security Council suspended the sanctions
according to a resolution adopted before the Libyan move.
</P>
<P>
Britain severed its diplomatic relations with Libya in 1984
after someone at the Libyan Embassy in London shot dead a British
policewoman, who was maintaining order in a protest against Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi outside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said on Wednesday that the
British government decided to resume diplomatic ties with Libya
after the main issues affecting the bilateral ties have been
solved, especially Libya has promised to cooperate with Britain in
investigating the killing of the policewoman.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nostalgia Arises From a Wine Glass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A couple were sipping wine at a
road-side open-air restaurant. Zvanko Antic simply watched them
drinking. He could not afford to spend any of his remaining few
dinars on even a single glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
The man, who has spent 30 years of his life making wine in
southwestern Kosovo, was now hundreds of kilometers away from the
vineyard and brewery he used to work at. He stayed at a motel 20
kilometers outside Belgrade, as a refugee or internally displaced
person.
</P>
<P>
Along with him were 122 other people from the same region of
the Yugoslav province. The oldest of the group was 95 while the
youngest six months.
</P>
<P>
Half of the group was formed by children under the age of 14.
They travelled in five tractors and four family cars from their
villages around Prizren northward until they stopped at the motel,
known as Pension Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
They first thought that they had finally survived the NATO
bombing after the western military alliance stopped dropping
missiles and bombs in early June. But they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
Some Kosovo separatists set fires to the houses of Kosovo Serbs
who were thus forced to leave.
</P>
<P>
With no relatives to seek help from, the refugees ended up in
the motel in which they used mattresses made of chemical fabric as
cover and artificial foam as stuffing.
</P>
<P>
The 12 members of Zvanko's family included his parents, his
brother and sister-in-law and their six children ranging from two
to nine. They squeezed onto eight mattresses spread over a corner
of the dining hall of the motel.
</P>
<P>
Two other big families shared the same dining hall.
</P>
<P>
Upstairs in a guest room measuring three meters by four lived a
95-year-old man called Dragutinovic Dragutin.
</P>
<P>
The old man, one of the dozen who took part in the Salunski
battle of the First World War for Serbia and was still alive,
shared the room with his son and daughter-in-law, his grandson and
granddaughter-in-law and his great grandsons. Eight of them on
six mattresses.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic Branislav was even less lucky. Due to the mismatch
of motel rooms and the number of refugees, he had to live in the
huts made of plastic sheet on the trailer behind his tractor.
</P>
<P>
Another adult also lived outside in another trailer.
</P>
<P>
Left with their houses on fire, these people grabbed whatever
they could before they set off on a journey nobody knew where it
would end.
</P>
<P>
They now got one hot meal each day from the student center of
the capital city and they had to make do with whatever they could
for the other two meals, be it cold bread, cold pancakes or
sometimes nothing to eat with.
</P>
<P>
Each and every family of the group had to carefully calculate
to make their remaining money last longer. They never dared to
think that they could raise 10,000 German marks to arrange a heart
correction operation for 16-month-old Momirka Ilic of their group.
</P>
<P>
After NATO stopped bombing, the Yugoslav authorities appealed
the Kosovo Serbs to return to their homes in the province.
</P>
<P>
Already knowing that they had no place to return to, these
refugees asked that how could they be expected to return to a
place that is not secure even with an international security force
present.
</P>
<P>
Zvanko said that who would not be nostalgic after leaving his
native land for so long. When asked whether he used to drink wine
in his hometown, he replied it was only commonplace to drink wine
in a place that has best been known for its wine producing repute.
"It is like drinking water," said he with an imaginery glass
lifted toward his lips.
</P>
<P>
The man said that with last season's produce still in the wine
cellar and no one was at home to attend this season's production,
how could they be expected to return with no money left.
</P>
<P>
Zvanko, whose forefathers lived in Kosovo for centuries, said
that in his family was left 300 liters of family-made wine behind
and there were 12 million German mark worth of red wine, white
wine and brandy left in the vinery he used to work in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Watching the couple drinking away, Zvanko said that the wine
made him all the more homesick.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestant March Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland authorities on
Thursday banned the Protestant Orange Order from holding a major
demonstration on July 12 near a Roman Catholic area in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The independent Parades Commission said the order's plans to
gather in a park near the mostly Catholic Lower Ormeau Road area
risked sparking sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
Commission head Alistair Graham told a news conference the
demonstration could have involved up to 20,000 Orangemen, bandsmen
and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
"It is bound therefore to bring problems, major problems of
disruption, tension and damage to fragile community
relationships," Reuters quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order planned the demonstration after it was earlier
banned from marching directly through the Lower Ormeau Road area
on July 12, a day celebrated by Protestants for centuries-old
battlefield victories over Catholics.
</P>
<P>
The new ban came as Britain and the Irish Republic stepped up
efforts to get feuding politicians from the British province's
Protestant majority and Catholic minority to end a deadlock over
guerrilla disarmament that has paralysed the peace process. They
have set July 15 as a new deadline for a deal.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets in Mixed Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON July 8 (Xinhua) - European bourses ended mixed Thursday
as London and Paris closed lower in reaction to an opening slide
on Wall Street, while Frankfurt gained on the strength of
financial issues.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 ended the session down 40.1, or 0.61 percent,
at 6557.3 despite almost unanimous predictions that the Bank of
England's lending rate would not change.
</P>
<P>
The fallers included most of the high-street banks, with
Barclays down 38 pence to 1821p, NatWest down 40p to 1332p and
Lloyds down 14p to 841p.
</P>
<P>
Oil stocks were the one bright spot in the market, with both
Shell and BP Amoco edging up on the back of rising oil prices,
adding 15 points to the FTSE index.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 closed down 31.07 points at 4631.13, a
fall of 0.67 percent, led by bond market weakness and selling
pressures on three of the issues involved in oil and banking
takeover battles.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax closed 18.60 points higher at 5607.10, a
gain of 0.33 percent, buoyed by a strong run among banking stocks.
</P>
<P>
Dresdner Bank added 2.51 euros to 43.01 euros, while Deutsche
Bank was up 4.75 percent at 64.16. Commerzbank was 1.26 euros
firmer at 33.26.
</P>
<P>
Car shares also performed quite strongly. BMW finished 12.49
euros higher at 719.49, and Volkswagen gained 0.74 at 62.05.

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits New low but off Lows in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The euro fell to yet another record
low against the dollar Thursday after comments from Germany's
finance minister convinced traders that central banks would not
step in to prevent the currency's fall.
</P>
<P>
The euro fell to a new life low of 1.0149 U.S. dollars, down
from around 1.018 U.S. dollars before German Finance Minister Hans
Eichel said its weakness was not a problem because it boosted
German exports. But it recovered some ground late in the European
day.
</P>
<P>
Traders took Eichel's comments, made during a visit to Denmark,
to mean that European central banks were in no hurry to support
the currency.
</P>
<P>
"When you have Eichel saying it (the weak euro) is helping
Euroland growth, it is a red rag to a bear as far as the euro is
concerned," a Reuters reported quoted Steve Barrow, currency
strategist at Bear Stearns in London, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, by midday in the U.S. traders were again
wondering if European central banks might intervene to prop up the
euro as it neared parity with the dollar. A market rumor that
Germany's central bank had asked commercial banks to stay open
after hours fueled intervention speculation and the euro popped
back up above 1.02 U.S. dollars, compared with 1.0220 U.S. dollars
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Euro zone government bond prices fell again in tandem with
drops in the euro against the dollar, and traders saw potential
for further falls.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 10-year German Bund saw its yield rise quickly to
4.85 percent from around 4.2 percent just three weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil at New High With Falling U.S. Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices climbed to a
19-month high Thursday after weekly data signaled accelerating
petroleum demand in the United States, the world's biggest oil
consumer.
</P>
<P>
London futures for benchmark Brent blend crude in early trade
peaked at 18.61 U.S. dollars a barrel before profit taking left
the contract up 12 cents by late afternoon at 18.25 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the gains to Wednesday's inventory
statistics from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showing a
draw in U.S. gasoline stocks in the week to July 2 and lower crude
stocks.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. oil demand is apparently growing much faster than
expected," a Reuters report quoted Peter Gignoux, head of the
London energy desk at Salomon Smith Barney, as saying. "It's
another week in which the inventory statistics have shown a
stockdraw and taken prices to new highs."
</P>
<P>
U.S. crude stocks fell for the third consecutive week and, at
328 million barrels, now show a 13 million barrel deficit versus
the high levels of the same time last year, the API said.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have jumped more than two U.S. dollars in just over
two weeks, the latest leg in a rally which has carried Brent up
from sub-10-dollar lows in February.
</P>
<P>
That has moved prices quickly into the 18 to 20 U.S. dollars a
barrel range targeted by OPEC exporters who in March this year
agreed to stringent supply limits. Dealers said the bullish mood
on oil markets was underpinned by OPEC's determined effort to
erase surplus petroleum stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys have estimated OPEC adherence with the output
curbs at just short of 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's OPEC President Youssef Yousfi Wednesday said the
cartel would not consider easing the limits until they were due to
expire at the end of March next year. He ruled out any increase in
OPEC oil output quotas before March 2000, saying there was a
consensus in the cartel to stick by export limits despite rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
Major OPEC producer Iran Thursday showed support for Yousfi's
position, as Iran's OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said
that "all member countries are for full compliance with the cuts
until March 2000."
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said they expect surplus stockpiles to be erased
by the end of September, leaving the market exposed to higher
prices during the peak northern hemisphere winter demand season.
</P>
<P>
"By avoiding a significant second quarter build this year OPEC
has done a great deal to meet its objective of eliminating excess
inventories on world markets," Reuters quoted Washington
consultancy Petroleum Finance as saying. "If the third quarter
draw is as large as expected, the inventory surplus will be
eliminated before demand peaks in the fourth quarter."

<HEADLINE> Poverty, Major Cause for Conflicts in Africa: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is one of the key factors
that leads to the unrest and wars in Africa, a senior U.N.
official said here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of OAU's 70th ordinary session
of the Council of Ministers in Algerian capital Algiers, Kingsly
Amoako, U.N. Undersecretary-General and Executive Secretary of the
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said that at least four
hypotheses have been advanced to explain the cause of civil wars
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The first factor, Amoako said, is the innate ethnic and
religious hatred, where these hatreds are then exploited by
ambitious leaders.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is inextricably related to conflicts, particularly when
the lack of human capital becomes a viable employment opportunity
where job markets do not incorporate youth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The national grievance, where the performance of a government
is held to be against the national interests, is regarded as the
second one behind the unrest and conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Employment, when taken as a motivation for gains of capturing
the resources, is also seen by the U.N. official as one of the
roots for instability and armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, which often leads to war in the continent, is costly
when natural resources are not managed equitably and governments
are not democratic and societies are polarized, he added.
</P>
<P>
"War is undoubtedly the destroyer of economic development on
our continent," Amoako noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that regional organizations should play a leading role
in ensuring cooperation among states and in guiding support from
the international community toward sustained and durable peace in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
OAU's Council of Ministers meet twice a year to discuss, among
other things, the organization's annual budget and make
preparations for the annual OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
The OAU was founded on June 25 of 1963 to promote unity and
solidarity among independent African countries. It had 32 members
when established and now has 53 member states.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian Trade Union Federation
(SSS) has so far offered financial assistance to 80,000 Serbian
jobless people.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoting the trade union said on Thursday that the
SSS in cooperation with the Federal Labor Ministry offered aid to
those people rendered jobless by NATO bombing against Yugoslavia
between March 24 and June 9.
</P>
<P>
SSS Secretary Slobodan Jovanovic was quoted as saying that the
NATO bombing-caused jobless people were getting a minimum monthly
wage of 230 dinars (20 U.S. dollars) along with their pension and
healthcare payments.
</P>
<P>
The financial assistance will be available for three months.
</P>
<P>
The SSS secretary said that 100,000 workers in Serbia alone
were made jobless as a direct result of NATO bombing which made
about half a million jobless further down the production chain.
</P>
<P>
Some of the factories have been trying to start production in
order to help solve the NATO bombing-caused unemployment problem,
according to the secretary.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Meets Saudi Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Saudi Defense and
Aviation Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul Aziz held talks Thursday
with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani on bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed issues concerning the march of
the Gulf Arab nations and the latest regional developments,
according to reports by Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the visit by Sultan, also Saudi second deputy
prime minister and general inspector, bolstered ties between Doha
and Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi defense chief arrived in Qatar earlier in the day
from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the first stop of his
four-nation Gulf tour which will later take him to Bahrain and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He canceled his visit to Oman due to the absence of Sultan
Qaboos Bin Sayed who is on a private visit abroad.
</P>
<P>
Since Sultan is making the trip to the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states five days after GCC foreign ministers
concluded a meeting aimed at closing differences among member
states over a GCC-Iranian rapprochement, the visit is believed to
be a show of solidarity of alliance.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers agreed during their gathering to form a
tripartite committee, comprising Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, to
solve the dispute between the UAE and Iran over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also reaffirmed their support for the UAE's
sovereignty over the islands of Abu Moussa, Greater and Lesser
Tunbs, which are now controlled by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi recently voiced dismay over the warming up of ties
between some GCC states, headed by Saudi Arabia, and Iran, fearing
the rapprochement would undermine the GCC support for the UAE in
the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Romania Calls for Urgent Suspension of Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei
Plesu Thursday called for the urgent suspension of the embargo on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We realized we could not act individually before the entire
community resolves on a coherent and steady strategy in this
problem," he said when meeting here with the visiting German
Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Plesu hoped that the issue would be debated and settled soon
and that the outcome would be positive.
</P>
<P>
Joschka Fischer was in Romania on Thursday at the invitation of
his Romanian counterpart Andrei Plesu. He was also received by
President Emil Constantinescu and Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Constantinescu, the German Foreign Minister
said a group of states, NATO and EU members, examined the issue of
embargo relaxation. "There is a European interest to unblock the
Danube river and it is hoped that a decision will be made to lift
the oil embargo very soon and resume the traffic", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is resolute to commit itself to achieving a zone of
stability and prosperity in south-eastern Europe," Fischer
stressed, adding that for this zone to become safe, both
individual and joint efforts were needed to accelerate integration
of south-eastern European states into the big European family.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Safe for Visitors: Tourist Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- All tourists and other visitors are
assured that it is safe and secure when they visit Kenya and the
capital Nairobi, the Kenya Tourist Board said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tourists and visitors to the country "should feel free to come
and enjoy the cool July and August temperatures," the board said
in a statement issued after the privately-owned public vehicles
known as "matatu" strike Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the strike entered its second day, the board said, Kenyan
capital Nairobi was calm and that people were going about their
businesses as usual.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the strike will go on is unclear, what is clear,
however, is that Nairobi is safe and Kenya is safe." the board
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the strike was only affecting commuters who have
to make use of matatus or mini-buses as means of public transport
and did not affect visitors to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The board also mentioned that visitors from most countries of
the world do not need visas if they are coming for less than 30
days, saying that those tourists already in Kenya are encouraged
to relax and enjoy their holidays.
</P>
<P>
Matatus went on strike Wednesday in protest against the
introduction of the new regulations by the Transport Licensing
Board aiming at streamlining the matatu industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strikers, mainly touts, attempted to disrupt the smooth
flow of traffic by burning tires in the middle of some roads
leading to the cities, including capital Nairobi and Nakuru, the
country's third largest city in the central region.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, the matatu touts are to be
replaced by civic council workers at bus terminuses while matatu
drivers and conductors should wear identification badges, all
matatus are to be licensed by the board and matatu routes are to
be re-allocated.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Unhappy With OIC Resolution on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government Thursday
expressed dissatisfaction with a resolution adopted by the foreign
ministers of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), who met
recently in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Thew OIC foreign ministers expressed "firm support for the
rightful cause of the Turkish Muslim people of Cyprus" in its
resolution.
</P>
<P>
While describing the resolution as "adverse," Cyprus government
spokesman Costas Serezis told the press that it was not the first
time the OIC had issued an unfavorable resolution on Cyprus and
this time "it went further."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Cyprus government was taking necessary
measures through diplomatic channels on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The organization also reaffirmed its solidarity with the
Turkish Cypriots and "called for a just political settlement with
respect to the legitimate aspirations of the Turkish Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
It stressed that implementing a proposal, presented by Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in 1998, for the establishment of
confederation of two states in Cyprus holds the key to a political
and viable settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is pushing for reunification of Cyprus under a
bi-communal, bi-zonal federation formula but all efforts have so
far failed.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges Africans to Meet Challenges Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, Thursday
urged African people to rise up against the "daunting challenges
of the peace and security" in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of OAU's 70th ordinary session
of the Council of Ministers in Algerian capital Algiers, Salim
said that the OAU meeting is held at the turning of the century
when the continent is facing daunting challenges in the
socio-economic and political fields and in a context of a rapidly
changing world.
</P>
<P>
There is increasing concerns on whether Africa can succeed in
putting its house in order and enter the new millenium better
prepared for peace and development and assume the right position
in the world, said the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
In a continent plagued by political instability and conflicts,
both domestic and regional, the OAU meeting will discuss first of
all the political issues like the peace and stability in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the border dispute between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, and some other conflicts in such countries
as Angola and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Despite the determined efforts at various levels, Salim said,
conflicts continue to rage in the continent.
</P>
<P>
These conflicts, whether internal or inter-state, he said, have
caused considerable loss of life, imposed immense suffering on the
people and destroyed valuable infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Refugees and displaced people, a by-product of armed conflicts
and instability, will also be discussed at the OAU meetings.
</P>
<P>
On the socio-economic front, African people are still suffering
from poverty, illiteracy, diseases, including pandemics such as
HIV/AIDS and malaria, afflict an increasing segment of the
population, he said.
</P>
<P>
Debt, which has piled up to 370 billion U.S. dollars, is
draining off African people's effort for socio-economic recovery,
Salim pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will examine the specific recommendations and
proposals from a special contact group to negotiate with creditor
nations and organizations for debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Insecurity and instability also effectively undermine efforts
at economic and social transformation, he said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenges of peace and development, "development
through cooperation and economic integration should be considered
in the context of the challenge of peace, security and stability,"
Salim said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU was founded on June 25 of 1963 to promote unity and
solidarity among independent African countries. It had 32 members
when established and now has 53 member states.

<HEADLINE> Summers Warns Not to Become Overconfident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States can't become
overconfident, and markets must be opened and exports promoted,
new Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is on a course to allow workers wage increases
that exceed inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we can keep our fundamentals strong and continue the
terrific productivity improvement, I think we have got room to
give people wage increases that run ahead of price increases and
represent really higher standards of living," Summers said on
NBC's "Today" in his seventh day as new Treasury chief.
</P>
<P>
He said the right course for the economy was set during the
tenure of his predecessor Robert Rubin at the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
"Our challenge is to carry on," Summers said. "I think we are
going to be able to do that under President Clinton's leadership,
to keep paying down that federal debt, to put in place a framework
for the beginning of the next century, when, I think, our country
is going to be in a much, much stronger economic position than
anyone thought likely a few years ago."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he signalled steady U.S. economic priorities on a
strong dollar and urged both Europe and Japan to boost their
domestic demand.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister

</P>
<P>
To promote economic development, Tanzania will give priority to
 agriculture, mining, tourism and infrastructure development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China cherishes its traditional friendship with
Tanzania and is willing to expand economic and trade cooperation
with the east African country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not trying to Block IMF Funding to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not try to
block Zimbabwe's funding from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), visiting U.S. Congressmen said in Harare Thursday.
</P>
<P>
California Republican Tom Campell and New Jersey Democrat
Donald Payne dismissed reports that the U.S. was interfering in
the disbursement of the long-awaited 53 million U.S. dollars
balance of payment support to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"Implications that we are blocking IMF funding to Zimbabwe are
not true. We are encouraging that Zimbabwe will resolve with the
IMF anything outstanding," Campell said during a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. had always been supportive for Zimbabwe and
wanted it to make good economic decisions.
</P>
<P>
He also said he supported the forgiveness of debts to poor
countries because they were incurred by previous regimes which
they had no control over.
</P>
<P>
Payne said although Zimbabwe had tremendous potential, it had
undergone several economic problems.
</P>
<P>
He said they were pleased the involvement in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) was coming to an end following the signing
of a peace agreement by the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressmen who were expected to leave for home
Thursday were on a fact-finding mission in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
During their visit to Zimbabwe, they met with Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe and discussed regional issues related to
security, trade and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended aid to Zimbabwe last August because of
concerns over the Zimbabwean government's policies, price controls
on essential goods, Zimbabwe's involvement in the DRC and the slow
pace of selling loss-making state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, Mugabe has lambasted the IMF, saying that it could
keep its aid if it continued to attach conditions before releasing
the funds.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Inflation Reduces to 2.1 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece' consumer price inflation
dropped from 2.4 percent in May to 2.1 percent in June, the
National Statistics Service (NSS) announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation trend would depend on the impact of rising fuel
prices in international markets, the NSS said, adding that
developments in the domestic market were satisfactory particularly
in fruit and vegetables prices.
</P>
<P>
Greece's consumer price index rose 3.8 percent in June still
far from a target of 2.3-2.2 percent for the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Greece's consumer price index rose 2.8 percent on the
year from a rise of 3.4 percent in March, falling below 3 percent
for the first time since 1971.
</P>
<P>
Greece aims to join the European Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU) in January 2001, but inflation is seen as the toughest
hurdle for the country to take in its progress towards its
accession to EMU.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht criteria, inflation should be no more than
1.5 percentage points above the average inflation of the three
European Union (EU) best-performing nations.
</P>
<P>
In order to contain the increases of fuel prices, Greece's
Development Ministry and the oil trade companies have agreed to
split by half the burden of price rises.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A new report, which is to be
released by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on July
12, shows how the forces of globalization have generated
unprecedented wealth for those who have been able to take
advantage of the increasing flow of goods and services across
national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
But globalization, as it has been allowed to proceed so far,
has also been driving a deeper wedge between richer and many poor
countries, and among people within countries, UNDP officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
People in some 85 countries are in fact worse off in many
respects than they were a decade ago, according to the 1999 Human
Development Report.
</P>
<P>
The challenge is to ensure that the benefits of globalization
are shared equitably, the report says. Globalization can be made
"to work for people as well as for profits."
</P>
<P>
The report, produced by an independent group of scholars and
development experts for UNDP, also ranks 174 countries according
to their level of human development.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Thursday praised China's continuous aid to his country while
inspecting a Sino-Tanzanian joint medicine factory that will soon
go into operation.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzansino United Pharmaceuticals (T) Ltd. factory on the
suburb of capital Dar es Salaam is expected to produce about one
billion tablets and 200 million capsules annually worth two
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 1.85-million-dollar project, invested by China and Tanzania
with a ratio of 55 percent and 45 percent, produces mainly
medicine to treat epidemic diseases in Africa such as cholera,
malaria and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told factory staff that he hoped this joint venture would
set a good example to attract more Chinese investment to deepen
bilateral economic cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Haibin, General Manager of the plant,
beginning in November 1997, the factory has been designed and
constructed strictly in line with the international Good
Manufacturing Practice (GMP), the first of its kind in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The factory is expected to be commercially operational soon
after going through all necessary quality and environmental
processes.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Faster Growth to Eradicate Poverty: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Undersecretary-General Kingsly Amoako said Thursday Africa needs
developing faster in order to be really integrated with the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official made the comment when addressing the opening
ceremony of the 70th ordinary session of OAU's Council of
Ministers here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Without exception, the countries in the region are growing at
less than 7 percent per annum, the rate needed for Africa to meet
the international development target of reducing poverty in half
by the year 2015," said Amoako.
</P>
<P>
What is more, there are significant sub-regional differences in
Africa's growth performance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Of the five sub-regions in the continent, only two, accounting
for only about 25 percent of the continent's population, enjoyed a
positive growth performance.
</P>
<P>
Growth decelerated in the remaining three sub-regions where the
 overwhelming 75 percent of the population reside.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the drastic sub-regional difference in growth
performance to the incidence of war and civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 32 countries in Africa experienced some improvement
while 17 were worse off at the start of 1999 than they had been
one year before.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Africa's population are still living under
the poverty line, and wars and unrest are held responsible for
millions of refugees.

WHO experts said a cholera jab was only a stop-gap measure
while a long-term solution lay in changing the people's eating and

UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has prepared to deploy United Nations military observers at
an early date to the Democratic Republic of the Congo ahead of a
full-scale U.N. peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Annan, now touring Africa, expressed the readiness in a
statement issued through his spokesman at the U.N. Headquarters in
New York late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after African defense and foreign

for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important and welcome step towards the restoration
of peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Great
Lakes region of Africa," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General urged the governments and rebel leaders
concerned to sign and ratify the cease-fire agreement as a matter
of urgency and called on them to enact an immediate cessation of
hostilities and troops standstill, pending the entry into force of
the pact.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations will spare no effort in mobilizing the
international community to assist the peoples of the region in
their efforts to achieve reconciliation, reconstruction and
development," the statement added.

BEIRUT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Lebanese Prime Minister
Chafic al-Wazzan, 74, died of a heart attack Thursday, a
statement of prime minister's palace said.
</P>
<P>
Wazzan's funeral will be held on Friday, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Public institutions' flag across Lebanon will fly at half-mast
and radio and television stations will broadcast
non-entertainment programs for three days, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Wazzan served as head of the Lebanese government from 1980 to
1984.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Israel launched the second massive invasion
of Lebanon with the declared aim of finally eliminating the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)'s military threat to
Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
The PLO led by Yasser Arafat, which was then stationed in south
Lebanon to launch attacks on northern Israel, was forced to leave
the country for Algeria, Tunisia and Yemen when Wazzan was in
office.
</P>
<P>
He resigned after the country's conflicting factions failed to
reach an accord to end the 15-year civil war which erupted in
1975.

LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Royal Mail, the Post

government owning its shares.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers told MPs in a White
Paper the Royal Mail's monopoly on letter deliveries would be
reduced in return for more commercial freedoms.
</P>
<P>
The move would honor Labor's manifesto commitment to give the
state organization greater commercial freedom, the Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, the Government will continue to own all
the shares in the Organizatiion, a move designed to reassure trade
unions that there are no plans to privatize the service.

"We intend to provide commercial freedom while maintaining the
Post Office in public ownership," Byers said.

LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee on Thursday left Britain's key short-term
interest rate unchanged at 5.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision was widely expected, as the Bank has already cut
base rates seven times in the last nine months to boost the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Last month the Bank reduced base rates by a quarter point to a
22-year low. Since then there have been clear signs of economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The stock market and the pound were lower after the Bank's
decision. The pound has continued to weaken against the dollar
after U.S. interest rates were raised, falling to a three-year low
of 1.5542 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's decision was welcomed by business leaders.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Foreign Minister Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu
fired the country's Foreign Minister Amri Sued Ismail in a
surprising move Wednesday, the Rwanda News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A senior Rwandan government official who requested not to be
named said that Ismail was not defending the interests of the
country in his declarations to the media and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"He is also charged with embezzlement," the official was quoted
as saying. "As Ambassador to Egypt before becoming Foreign Affairs
Minister, he was using his position to force his successor to
continue to pay his salary, and rent to his wife who stayed in
Cairo."
</P>
<P>
Ismail was appointed to the foreign affairs portfolio in
February 1999 following an overwhelming cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
He had been heading the Rwandan delegation that was negotiating
peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) before he was
called back to Kigali late last week.
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by Augustin Iyamuremye who was serving as
Information Minister.
</P>
<P>
Ismail's sacking occurred as he was preparing to leave for
Algerian capital Algiers, to participate to the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) summit.
</P>
<P>
Official sources from the President's office said that the
firing of Ismail will not change Rwanda's stand on the DRC issue
and will not harm the signing of a peaceful agreement.

WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Boeing company Thursday

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Fall While Retail Sales Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday the number of new claims for unemployment benefits
dropped last week to the lowest level in more than three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the nation's largest retailers said that
their June sales rose to better-than-expected levels.
</P>
<P>
June's strong retail sales, which followed big gains in
May,were attributed to the hefty U.S. economy and
warmer-than-normal weather that sent shoppers into stores for
everything from bathing suits to air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department's report, 294,000 people filed new
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 3, down by
6,000 from the previous week. Last week's level was the lowest
since 289,000 in the week ending March 27.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out
week-to-week volatility, also was down to 299,000, the lowest
level since April 3, when they were at 296,500.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the remaining low jobless claims applications
reflect an extremely tight labor market, on which the Federal
Reserve is keeping a watchful eye.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Sao Tome and Principe Foreign
Minister Alberto Paulino Thursday formally handed in his
resignation to Prime Minister Guilherme Posser da Costa, the
Angolan News Agency Angop reported.
</P>
<P>
Posser confirmed this but he stressed that he would discuss the
matter with President Miguel Trovoada because the president has
his say in the appointment or dismissal of the foreign minister or
defense minister according to the constitution of the republic.
</P>
<P>
Paulino was reluctant to comment on his intention to resign,
only attributing it to his own health condition and the prime
minister's intention to reshuffle the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Posser admitted that he intends to reshuffle his cabinet,
saying that he would do so in a bid to improve the performance of
the government departments.
</P>
<P>
Paulino has been the second minister tendering a resignation
since the Posser administration came into being early this year.
</P>
<P>
The scandal of illegally issuing 500-million-U.S. dollar
treasury bills forced former minister of planning, finance and
cooperation, Afonso Varela, to resign on March 25. He was
replaced by Adelino Castelo David.

"In negotiations, you can't get everything you want. We hope
all parties are genuine," said Mugabe referring to the Lusaka
draft cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the peace plan provides for a cease-fire
24 hours after the signing, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the
cessation of all military activities, the creation of a new
national army and the release of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The draft cease-fire document aimed at ending the war between
the allied forces helping Kabila troops and the rebels allegedly
backed by Rwanda and Uganda is now awaiting to be signed by heads
of the states which have been sucked in the war.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad had sent troops fighting
alongside Kabila's soldiers to fend off the rebels who are
reported to be holding vast areas of land in eastern side of the
mineral-rich country.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mugabe and Kabila were also attended by two
DRC senior government officials, Zimbabwean Vice-President Simon
Muzenda, Zimbabwean Defence Forces Commander Vitalis Zvinavashe
and Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
Kabila left here for home on the same day.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sees Urgency in Ending Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The conflicts in the world
today has given "particular urgency" to the United Nations in
playing its role in disarmament, demobilization and peacekeeping
operations, a top U.N. official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The conflicts with which the Security Council is grappling
today have given these tasks particular urgency," the U.N. deputy
secretary-general, Louise Frechette, told an open Security Council
debate on the maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict
peace-building.
</P>
<P>
"Those conflicts are more often than not internal civil wars,
with some degree of cross-border or international implications,"
she said. "They tend to take place in poorer countries, with vast
movements of internally displaced persons as well as refugees."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has been mandated to undertake disarmament
in peacekeeping operations in Africa, Southeast Asia, Central
America, and the Balkans," she said, "Each is a different
experience, reflecting a particular country's circumstances, the
terms of the peace agreement and the mandate approved by the
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, the disarmament of civilians is not the
responsibility of a peacekeeping mission, but rather a task
incumbent upon national authorities, sometimes with assistance
provided by the international community," she said.
</P>
<P>
"However, by supporting efforts to strengthen national law
enforcement capacity, a peacekeeping operation can play a key role
in creating an environment in which the general populace does not
deem weapons to be necessary," she said.

<HEADLINE> UK Firms Rush to Libya for Trade Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- British firms are racing to Libya to
cash in on an expected trade boom after sanctions are suspended
and diplomatic ties restored.
</P>
<P>
For Libya, the end of U.N. sanctions in April should herald a
new era of increased business with the outside world, while for
Britain, the resumption of diplomatic relations on Wednesday means
its companies are now as free as their main European rivals to
capitalise on a key Arab market.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas, construction, telecommunications in a country with
no mobile phones and even tourism, pristine beaches and roman
cities preserved by the sand, may offer ripe pickings.
</P>
<P>
"The end of sanctions is sure to increase foreign business in
Libya, particularly on the energy side," Walter Drysdale, who is
organising a trade mission to Libya next week, the first in which
British government officials will take part, was quoted as saying
by a Reuters report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Engineers Costain Plc, Rolls Royce Plc and Thames Water
International are also involved. Just last week, a separate trade
mission, including Lloyds TSB Plc, Taylor Woodrow Construction Plc
and Tate &AMP; Lyle, set off for Col Muammar Gaddafi's Libya.
</P>
<P>
They left before London reestablished ties once Tripoli agreed
to help investigations into the 1984 shooting of a policewoman
outside its London embassy which led to the rupture, according to
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
British exports to what is officially known as the Great
Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah were worth 418.5
million U.S. dollars in 1997 and imports from Libya 231 million.
</P>
<P>
It was the UK's 12th largest market in the Middle East/North
Africa, from number two in the 1970s. Iran, with which Britain has
also just restored ties, offers good prospects too.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. ban on flights into Libya and limits on exports of
sensitive oil equipment were suspended in April, after Tripoli
handed over for an international trial the two men accused of
bombing a Pan Am Flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270.
</P>
<P>
British firms will now get official support to help them
compete with Italy, Libya's biggest trade partner and former
colonial power, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and others.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Immediate Start of Disarming S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday in Sierra Leone urged the country to immediately
start the disarming process under the newly assigned peace accord,
a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who paid the war-torn state a short visit Thursday,
promised the U.N. help in bringing in a lasting peace for the
long-suffered Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
Annan said there was "an immediate need for ECOMOG (the west
African peace-keeping force) and military observers to move very
quickly, for the rebel troops and militia to disarm and to be
directed to more productive activities."
</P>
<P>
"I can promise you that the U.N. can work hand in glove with
the government to bring peace about, but we all have to pool our
efforts. No one can do it alone," he told a press conference held
in Sierra Leonean capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
He added that some U.N. refugee organizations would soon resume
their work on bringing the war-created refugees back to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that he was happy to be in Sierra Leone
only one day after a peace accord was assigned in Togolese capital
Lome.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Freetown from Dakar, capital of Senegal. He
was due to spend a few hours in Monrovia, capital of Liberia
Thursday before flying to Guinea, and then visit Nigeria Saturday
before leaving for Algerian capital Algiers to attend the
Organization of African Unity Summit.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Economy on Right Track: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An independent research body
Thursday commended the Ghanaian government for the tremendous
improvement in the country's economic management, the Ghana News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 State of the Ghanaian Economy Report, the Ghana
Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research of the
University of Ghana said with a 4.6 percent gross domestic product
(GDP) growth, it was "heart warming" to find end-of-year inflation
at 15.7 percent, down from 20.8 percent at the beginning of 1998
and 70.8 percent at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ghana Statistical Service, inflation was 9.4
percent in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Kwadwo Asenso-Okyere, Director of the economic research
institute, attributed the reduction in inflation to the moderate
growth in money supply of 17.3 percent last year as against 39.5
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ghanaian currency Cedi was stable in 1998 with a
relative depreciation of just 4.2 percent in the inter-bank
market and 3.9 percent at the forex market.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the fiscal performance of the economy last year,
Asenso- Okyere said, the overall budget deficit in 1998 was about
6.3 percent of the GDP as compared with a projected 7.9 percent
for the year and 8.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the low budget deficit resulted from better expenditure
 monitoring and control in 1998 than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Asenso-Okyere said government expenditure on salaries and
wages continue to decline as a proportion of recurrent
expenditure, adding that the proportion had gone down from 90
percent in the 1980s to 33.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He was happy about the performance of industry, service and
manufacturing sectors and emphasized that more efforts be put in
to make the situation get better.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the economy could have done better if it
were not for some external shocks experienced last year.
</P>
<P>
Giving the outlook for 1999, Asenso-Okyere said care must be
taken not to run the country into a recession, adding that other
indicators like unemployment must be watched closely.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Asutifi district records 178 Buruli cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and seventy-eight
cases of Buruli ulcer have been recorded in the Asutifi district
in Ghana's Brong Ahafo region, the Ghana News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
 Mr Stephen Anane, Asutifi District Diseases Control Officer,
told the reporters Wednesday at Kenyasi that out of the number,
eight have been referred to the Komfo Anokye and Sunyani hospitals
while ten victims have recovered.
</P>
<P>
 Most of the reported victims are said to be school children.
</P>
<P>
 Mr Anane said the disease is endemic in three of the six
sub-districts of the district. These are Dadiesoaba, Hwidiem and
Acherensua.
</P>
<P>
 He said most of the victims are finding it difficult to
travel to the sub-district headquarters for treatment due to
financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
 He, therefore, suggested the establishment of treatment camps
in the endemic communities to treat the victims.
</P>
<P>
 The Brong Ahafo Regional Health Management Team and Action
Aid, an NGO,
</P>
<P>
have provided the District Health Management Team with dressing
materials.
</P>
<P>
 Mr Anane commended Mr Hyiaman Asante Amoako, Asutifi District
Chief Executive, and the District Assembly for providing one
million cedis (about 432 U.S. dollars) to supplement the DHMT's
efforts in combating the disease.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Adopt Pragmatic Approach to Social </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) --The International Social Security
Association Conference in Accra Thursday called on the Africans to
adopt pragmatic approach to wider social security coverage, the
Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The delegates at the conference called for the strengthening of
public awareness and the introduction of improved means of
reaching out to the public on the importance of protecting their
future.
</P>
<P>
A clear and pragmatic use of public information as a method to
considering social security protection issues in the informal
sector would improve social security coverage on the continent and
help contributors to understand the scheme and comply with it,
they said.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to adopt measures that will not only introduce
the private sector in the provision of social protection, but will
also offer wide options to the individuals," a Kenyan delegate was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most African delegates blamed the poor coverage on the weak
public education campaign which have not had the expected impact
on the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary allocation in Africa for public information
reportedly ranges between 0.15 percent to five percent.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which has brought together over 200 delegates
from 30 African countries, the World Bank, International Labor
Organization and other donor agencies, is brain-storming on the
way forward for Africa's social security systems.
</P>
<P>
Some of the issues, which have featured prominently on the
agenda of the three-day conference, include the autonomy of the
social security institutions in Africa and the low coverage of the
scheme.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries are currently covering only 10 percent
of its active population under assured benefits from
contributions.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in Ghana, the current number of contributors is
about 770, 000 which is less than 10 percent of the estimated
working population of about eight million.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Phase Out Its Troops from S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to phase out its troops in
Sierra Leone with the progress of the implementation of a peace
accord signed Wednesday, an aide to Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo said in Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Doyin Okupe, a press assistant to the president, told a news
briefing in the capital that Nigeria will "begin to put in place
a process of gradual and phased withdrawal of Nigerian troops from
Sierra Leone aligned with the stage by stage developmental
progress of the Lome peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
"This action will be in keeping with the electioneering
promises of President Obasanjo to get Nigerian troops back home at
the soonest possible time, without jeopardy to the peace process,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops form the backbone of the more than
12,000-strong west Africa peace-keeping force ECOMOG which first
intervened in Sierra Leone in 1997 to reinstate President Tajen
Kabbah after he was overthrown by his army.
</P>
<P>
But peace-keeping efforts in Sierra Leone has proved to be too
costly, especially at a time when Nigeria's own economy is
tottering.
</P>
<P>
The peace efforts have cost Nigeria hundreds of lives so far
and reportedly one million U.S. dollars a day, according to
Nigerian newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
A peace deal was signed in Togo's capital Lome Wednesday
between Sierra Leonean President Kabbah and rebel leader Foday
Sankoh, with several west African presidents including Obasanjo as
the co-signers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Probe White Supremacist Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
said Thursday the Justice Department is trying to decide whether
to investigate a group linked to a white supremacist who killed
two minority people.
</P>
<P>
Reno, speaking at a weekly press briefing, said the department
had not made the decision yet on whether to investigate the World
Church of the Creator, a group which espouses anti-minority views.
</P>
<P>
Smith, 21, a member of the group, killed two men and wounded
eight, all blacks, Asians and Orthodox Jews, in a recent three-day
shooting spree in Illinois and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
He killed himself in a hijacked van on the highway in Illinois
as the police closed in on him for arrest.
</P>
<P>
Reno, who was "appalled" to hear the shooting incident, said
the Justice Department must have "a reasonable indication of
criminal conduct" by the group before it can investigate it.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Justice are
paying special attention to the group's activities to determine
whether it promotes violence by its members, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The group's leader, Matt Hale, claimed that his group is
nonviolent and uses "persuasion" to accomplish its goal of
promoting the white race.
</P>
<P>
Smith was seen distributing racist pamphlets when he was a
member of the World Church of the Creator.

WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States will consider

"We are eager to be supportive," State Department spokesman

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Confident on Sharif for Ending Kashmir Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
that it has confidence on Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
for the withdrawal of militants over the line of control in
Kashmir despite the militants vowed to fight on.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident the prime minister wishes to see an end to
this crisis (in Kashmir)," State Department spokesman James Foley
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sharif agreed at a hastily arranged meeting with President Bill
Clinton in Washington Sunday that he would get the militants to
pull out of Indian Kashmir and thus defuse a crisis with New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
But the militants denounced the agreement reached between
Sharif and Clinton and vowed to continue to fight Indian troops in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Washington believed that it was necessary "for
Pakistan to ensure that those forces that have crossed from its
side of the line of control onto the Indian side be withdrawn, and
that is certainly what Prime Minister Sharif committed to do when
he was here and met with President Clinton on Sunday."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Borrowing Shows Sharp Rise in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers' credit
outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, grew sharply at a 10.9
percent annual rate in May to a seasonally adjusted 1.34 trillion
dollars, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In May, consumers borrowed 12.1 billion dollars more than the
month before. The sharp increase in borrowing rate follows much
smaller gains in April and March and marked the largest increase
since January when consumer credit climbed at an annualized rate
of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
In April, total credit outstanding rose at an annual rate of
just 0.4 percent, much less than the Fed previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said May's increase was led by demand for non-revolving
loans, which rose at an annual rate of 15.7 percent. That category
includes loans for autos, mobile homes, boats, trailers, education
and vacations. It was the biggest increase for non-revolving
credit since January when it rose at an annual rate of 17.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Revolving credit -- primarily credit cards -- also went up in
May to an annual rate of 4.4 percent. That follows a bigger gain
of 5.9 percent rate in April.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said strong consumers' borrowing is a reflection of a
healthy economy. Owing to the robust consumer spending, the U.S.
economy is growing. At present, both inflation and unemployment
are low while consumer confidence is high and the stock market is
continuing to post record gains.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's report of consumer credit is the first one in which
the Fed stopped breaking out automobile loans as a separate
category. It's also the first report without a separate catchall
category that lumped loans for things including education,
vacations, mobile homes and boats.
</P>
<P>
These two categories, instead, are now folded into one called
nonrevolving credit. The Fed explained that it was going to a
larger category because it didn't trust the month-by-month
reliability of the previous smaller breakdowns.

<HEADLINE> China's Customs Revenue Above Target in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's customs revenue amounted to
78.36 billion yuan (9.44 billion US dollars) in the first half of
this year, accounting for 93.4 percent of the target for the whole
year, according to information released today by the General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Among the total, 1.79 billion yuan were spent on policy-related
tax refunds, and 76.57 billion yuan was passed to the state tax
coffers, up 117 percent from the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials here attributed the rise to the country's fierce
fight against smuggling since last July, which helped halt illegal
channels of imports and increase imports through general trade in
the first six months by 80 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the customs department has stepped up efforts to
crack down on tax evasion, which added 8 billion yuan to the tax
collection figures.

<HEADLINE> 3 Million Chinese to Lose Jobs This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- More than three million Chinese
state-owned enterprise (SOE) employees are expected to get laid
off this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure was revealed today by Zhang Zuoji, Minister of Labor
and Social Security, in a report to the Financial and Economic
Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's top
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The current number of former SOE workers who haven't found jobs
nationwide is estimated at 6 to 7 million.
</P>
<P>
"Among SOE laid-offs, 95 percent have registered at re-
employment agencies, and 94 percent of those registered have been
provided with basic living expenses," said Zhang, citing the
results of a survey made by the ministry in more than 3,000 SOEs
across the country.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriation of basic living expenses among and re-employment
of laid-off workers play a positive role in promoting reform,
development and social stability," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that China will need 24.5 billion yuan this year
to provide basic living expenses to laid-off workers but the
amount available now is only 19.5 billion yuan. And traditional
industrial bases like Liaoning, Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces
and poor central and western provinces and regions like Sichuan,
Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia are those suffering most from funding
shortages.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments at all levels to adjust local budgets to
increase funds to help laid-off workers, and enhance the
management and auditing of the use of the funds to prevent
misappropriation.

<HEADLINE> 90 Million Chinese Join Pension Security Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- By the end of this June, 91.2
million in-service employees in China have been listed under a
national pension security program, an increase of 6.44 million
over the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zuoji, Minister of Labor and Social Security, disclosed
the figures in a report to today's hearing on the issue of state
factory layoffs by the Financial and Economic Committee of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this June, the country's pension security funds
have raised 72.5 billion yuan (8.7 billion US dollars), up 10.1
billion yuan, while the collection rate of the pension security
reached 87.1 percent, up 4.4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, 99 percent of pension-holders
got paid, with the distribution of 296 million yuan delayed, of
which, 200 million yuan has been paid so far.
</P>
<P>
The official disclosed that while trying to make timely and
efficient payment of pension, the governments at different levels
have also made more than five billion yuan due payment to
pensioners.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country's social security programs mostly cover
state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged to expand the coverage of social security programs
and said efforts should be made to include overseas-funded
companies, collectively-owned firms and private industries in the
programs.
</P>
<P>
He also called for stricter control over the pension security
funds and stopping the misuse of the funds.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Exert Every Effort to Make Peace with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA (Egypt), July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said Friday that Israel will try to seek every
possible way to make peace with its Arab neighbors, adding
he needs more time to revive the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make serious efforts backed by the leaders and the
peoples of the region to end the 100 years of conflict between
Israel and the Arabs," Barak said at a joint press conference with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
He had a two-hour meeting with Mubarak in Alexandria and left
for Israel after the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he will never compromise Israel's security or give
up fighting terrorism, but together with the people of the Middle
East "I am determined to make peace."
</P>
<P>
Asked how he will deal with the thorny issues of returning land
to the Palestinians, stopping Jewish settlements in Arab areas,
withdrawing Israeli forces from Syria's Golan Heights and south
Lebanon, Barak said it would be better for him to answer the
question at a later time.
</P>
<P>
"You are describing too detailed a map for me at this stage,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who said Barak represents a "golden opportunity" for
peace, also urged that the moderate leader be given time before he
can revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Give the man some time, two months, something like that,"
Mubarak said. "We should let him take his time to make his own
estimation of the whole situation."
</P>
<P>
Barak has scheduled a series of talks beginning with his
Friday's trip to Egypt - his first meeting with an Arab leader
since winning the May general elections on a platform of making
peace.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday at
the entrance to the Gaza Strip, Jordan's King Abdullah Bin Hussein
in Jordan Tuesday and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington at
the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who has played a key role in helping the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, said Barak "quite knows that the
Palestinian issue is the core of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Barak gave the clearest signal that his government will resume
the implementation of the Wye accord signed in October between the
Palestinians and hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
was defeated by Barak in May elections.
</P>
<P>
The accord, which envisages that Israel should have withdrawn
from an additional 13.1 percent of the West Bank by the end of
January, was suspended in early December last year.
</P>
<P>
"Israel basically abides by its international agreement that
has been taken by any previous governments," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his government will evict recent Jewish settlers,
Barak said "we are not going to build new settlements and we are
not going to dismantle" the old ones.
</P>
<P>
However, the settlement issue should be decided in the
final-status talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo agreements between the Palestinians and
Israel, the final status talks, which were designed to tackle the
thornist issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, refugees and
borders, should have started by May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Barak's government hopes to resume talks simultaneously with
the Palestinians and the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
He said he would be glad to meet the Syrian people to convince
them about his commitment to making peace. "I can only say that we
are determined to turn every stone to find a way to go forward,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria have been stalled since
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, the south China economic
powerhouse opposite Hong Kong, has provided the best air for
Chinese city dwellers over the past week.
</P>
<P>
From July 2-8, the city's air pollution index was only 13,
according to a weekly report by the China Environment Monitoring
Center. It was followed by Zhuhai, a city opposite Macao, and
Beihai, a coastal city in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The weekly report on air quality in 46 major Chinese cities,
issued here today, said that widespread rainfalls over the past
week has helped improve air qualities in most northern cities
compared with the previous week, and most Chinese cities reported
fairly good air quality.
</P>
<P>
Slight air pollution was reported in Beijing, whose air
pollution index was 114 last week, Urumqi, 116, Jinan, 116, and
Tianjin, 102. All four are located in the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Besides the three cleanest cities, ten more including Xiamen
and Guilin reported excellent air quality, while 29 cities
including inland ones like Shenyang, Taiyuan and Xi'an, and
coastal ones like Shanghai, Qingdao and Fuzhou reported good air
quality.
</P>
<P>
Suspended articles have been the main pollutants in most
northern cities, including Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Ends Ukraine Visit After Signing of Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the visit, Schroeder held talks with Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma and Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko to exchange
views on promoting the development of bilateral economic
cooperation, the shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and
joint participation in the reconstruction of Yugoslavia after NATO
's 78-day bombardment.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Kuchma said that his country will do it can to
improve the investment environment and expressed the hope that
Germany will increase its direct investment in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that regular high-level consultations and
political contacts between the two countries will promote the
development of mutual economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Ukraine's second largest trade partner only after
Russia. Trade turnover between Germany and Ukraine totaled less
than 2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the controversial Chernobyl nuclear power plant,
Kuchma reaffirmed that Ukraine will act to close it down by 2000
as long as the Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized nations
honors an agreement signed between the two sides in 1995 that G-7
would fund two new nuclear power stations in return for Ukraine's
shutdown of the Chernobyl power plant.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine will continue to use the nuclear power plant on the
basis of reliability and safety because it is cheaper, Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that the German government will make a decision
by September on whether to join the multinational program to aid
Ukraine in funding the two new nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
The G7 -- which groups the United States, Germany, Japan,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- agreed to hold off a decision
on going ahead with the new reactors until after Schroeder had
visited Ukraine.

URUMQI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- An international symposium on China'
s reform of tax and fee systems ended today in the capital city of
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The five day event was organized by the State Administration of
Taxation, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"China's reform on tax and fee systems should be focused on
solving the problem of unreasonable charges, which have
aggravated the burden on enterprises and residents and caused
losses of state revenues and weakened the macro-control capacity
of the government," said Mi Jianguo from the Development Research
Center of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Unreasonable fees mainly refer to those charged by local
governmental departments of different levels without obeying
central regulations.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and scholars probed the necessity and task
of China's reform of tax and fee systems and carried out wide
exchanges on their views at the symposium, sources said.

<HEADLINE> China Lifts Ban Conditionally on Sealed European Imports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to lift the ban
on imports suspected of being contaminated by the cancer-causing
agent dioxin from four European countries under certain conditions,
according to a latest circular issued by seven government
departments.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following the latest development of the
investigation and examination by the European Commission and its
relevant members as well as in other nations that have imported
relevant products from Germany, France, the Netherlands and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Exporters from Germany, France, and the Netherlands need to
produce one of the following documents to have their sealed
exports in China taken off the restricted list, according to the
circular which was jointly issued on July 2 by the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), the Ministry of
Health, the General Administration of Customs, the State
Environmental Protection Administration, the State Administration
for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine, the State Administration
of Internal Trade, and the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
1. Official documents showing the amount of dioxin contained in
the relevant product or showing the relevant product is dioxin
free, signed by an authoritative examination body authorized by
the host government;
</P>
<P>
2. Government certified document allowing the sales of the
suspected product in its own country after June 1;
</P>
<P>
3. Documents of relevant organizations within the EU certifying
that the suspected product is allowed to be marketed in EU member
nations.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that exporters of suspected products sealed
for storage in China's market can apply for approval from the
Ministry of Health with the above mentioned documents that are
confirmed by the relevant embassy in China.

<P>
Those whose products were sealed in Chinese Customs, except for
those banned by Chinese quarantine law, can apply to the State
Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine with the
documents for examination, and then for release approval at the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Sealed products that were produced before January 15, 1999 in
Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium, have had
restrictions lifted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the circular has further laid down the scope of
products which will receive an import suspension. They include:
oxen, pigs, birds, rabbits and fish. Other banned products include
fodder (additives excluded), and meat products, eggs and egg
products, milk and milk products, and other products made with
these materials.
</P>
<P>
But sealed suspected products from Belgium will be treated
differently. Belgium exporters will have to show official dioxin-
free documents signed by the European Commission's authorized
examination agencies, and the documents must be confirmed by the
EU mission in China, before the confinement of their products is
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Unless banned by China's quarantine law, animals from Germany,
France and the Netherlands can be exported to China with
certification signed by the relevant administrative departments of
the respective governments stressing that the animals have not
been fed with dioxin-contaminated food. But the time for a
resumption of relevant imports from Belgium is yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, the seven departments issued an emergency circular,
calling for the suspension of the importing of livestock, poultry,
fish, fodder, meat, eggs and dairy products from those countries
as of the day. All the contaminated food brought in by travelers
or mailed from those countries will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The animals and food that have arrived in China from those
countries will be put in sealed storage and sales suspended, the
circular noted, adding that only those products that pass rigorous
examination will be allowed on sale.

<HEADLINE> China Approves 50 Firms as Overseas Processing Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Fifty Chinese firms that have
investments abroad have been officially certified and approved as
overseas processing ventures, which gives them priority in terms
of seeking financing, tax returns and future investments hopefully
enabling them to expand their exports volume.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that overseas Chinese processing firms
have been certified. The 50 firms, based in Africa, Latin America,
Asia and east Europe, mostly started their operations in 1995 and
1996. They have helped the exports of China-made raw materials,
parts and semi-finished goods up to the value of 135 million US
dollars, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
These ventures are now manufacturing motor vehicles,
refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners in the
overseas areas. The total investment of the Chinese side added up
to 40 million US dollars, according to the MOFTEC official, who
declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
"Following the certification, they will enjoy preferential
treatment in financing, tax, insurance and applications for the
rights to import and export," said the official. "They therefore
will enjoy a better policy environment for their overseas
operations."
</P>
<P>
To encourage qualified enterprises to invest abroad is a "
strategic measure" to cultivate new growth areas of China's
exports, MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng said earlier this year. A
number of policies have been introduced this year as an
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
The "strategic measure" will benefit both Chinese firms and the
target investment areas, Chinese trade experts said.
</P>
<P>
"While Chinese companies can benefit from the investment, they
also create job opportunities, raise the technical level and meet
the market demand in the target areas," said Sun Weiyan, a
professor with the University of International Business and
Economics in Beijing.

BRUSSELS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
proposed a conditional lifting of a three-year ban on British beef
exports from August 1, a spokesman said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected to end a worldwide embargo on British
beef sales which is said to have cost Britain's farming industry
about two billion U.S. dollars in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
But the EU executive Thursday extended a ban on Portuguese beef
exports because of fears of transmitting mad cow disease. The ban
will not be lifted until August 2000. The decision has been
slammed by the Portuguese government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the European Union's Standing Veterinary
Committee said the date for lifting the British beef ban was set

<HEADLINE> Top Lawmaker Calls for Greater Care of Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Strong efforts should be made to
ensure the needs of workers laid off by state-owned enterprises,
and the process of finding new jobs for them is a priority.
</P>
<P>
The call for action was made by Li Peng, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) who
stressed that China is a socialist country with its people the
masters.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the Communist Party of China (CPC), along with
party committees and governments at different levels should take
note of the plight of laid off workers," said Li today at a
meeting of the NPC Financial and Economic Committee to hear
reports by relevant State Council departments on the issue of
factory layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized that the NPC should supervise the government as
well as the supreme court and the supreme procuratorate with its
power endorsed by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of state factory layoffs is one that has drawn
attention from the whole society and is related to the interests
of workers as well as the general situation of the reform,
development and stability," the top lawmaker noted.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that to deal with the issue of factory layoffs
is a long term task, adding that it can only be done through the
joint efforts of the whole society.
</P>
<P>
NPC Vice-Chairman Tian Jiyun also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Cambodian Human Rights Workers Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A Cambodian court Friday
suspended the trial of two Cambodian human rights workers on
charges of involvement in illegal demonstrations and inciting
violence.
</P>
<P>
The court's judge Try Lay An said the trial will resume on July
21. The reason he gave for the suspension of the trial was that
more witnesses are needed and lawyers are busy.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Meas Minear, 30, and Kim Sen, 37, began on
Thursday in the southwestern city of Sihanoukville. They were
charged with involvement in illegal demonstrations and incitement
leading to violence and property damage during violent protests
last December prompted by the dumping of toxic wastes by a Taiwan
company in Sihanoukville.
</P>
<P>
Protesters, enraged by the danger of the wastes, destroyed the
building of the goods-inspection office and looted the villa of
the city's deputy governor.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least four died and 18 were injured in
the protests and road accidents as residents fled the town.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the two insisted they were not involved in
any illegal activities, but only monitoring the demonstrations and
providing legal advice to the protesters.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Foreign Minister in Greece for Talks on Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo arrived here Friday for talks with Greek officials on the
deportation by Greece of illegal Albanian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his talks with Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis, Milo said that they jointly ascertained that
passing phenomena should not have repercussions on the "very good
relations" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kaklamanis stressed the need for further
cooperation between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to tackle the problem and restore the climate that
has existed in Greek-Albanian relations and reflects the desire of
the two peoples to live peacefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece has since last Friday begun a nationwide crackdown on
illegal immigrants, mostly Albanians, in a bid to fight increasing
crimes and provide a clear picture of how many foreigners were
living legally in the country.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are an estimated 700,000 illegal immigrants in
Greece. According to the deadline set by the Greek government,
all illegal immigrants should have applied for a green card to
work before June 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Labor and Social Security Minister Miltiadis
Papaioannou warned earlier this week that some 500,000 illegal
immigrants who have not applied for a green card or have entered
the country illegally since the deadline for submissions would
face deportation.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Greece has since the beginning of the year started to
deport illegal immigrants. Some 50,000 illegal immigrants, mostly
Albanians, have been ordered to leave Greece.
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with the deportation by Greece of large numbers of
Albanians, Tirana has sought explanations from Athens for its
deportation operations.

<P>
MOGADISHU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The funeral of the assassinated
Colonel Abdullahi Irad took place Friday in south Mogadishu where
many officials from his organization, the Islamic fundamentalist
group known as Al-Itihad Al-Islam, paid him the last respect.
</P>
<P>
Irad, head of the operations for the Al-Itihad Al-Islam, was
killed in south Mogadishu late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the official, whose organization is based in
Zone Five, was attacked by about four gunmen riding a taxi outside
a mosque in Towfiq quarter of south Mogadishu controlled by
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the gunmen had been wandering around quite a
while before identifying their target.
</P>
<P>
Relatives said Irad was hit by four bullets in the chest and
died in Mogadishu Private hospital Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Irad's relatives claimed that he was assassinated by Ethiopian
manipulated Somali gunmen, and that he has been having problems
lately with the Ethiopians who had recently been influencing some
Somali factions and what they called unknown missionaries working
inside the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Itihad Al-Islam of Ethiopia who call themselves "West
Somali Liberation Front" claim that they are fighting to liberate

RIO DE JANEIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Brazilian soccer star
Zico praised Philippe Troussier's Japanese team playing to its
limits despite eliminated out in the first round at the Copa
America held in Paraguay, Kyodo said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"They gave it everything, but it shows that the Japanese
national team needs to play more competitions in Europe or South
America in order to improve its quality of play," Zico, who works
on the coaching staff of J-League champion Kashima Antlers, was
quoted by Kyodo News as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zico, assisting Brazil coach Wanderley Luxemburgo at the Copa
America, said that Troussier was right to try different lineups in
his side's Group A matches, despite the fact Japan lost to Peru
and host Paraguay before a 1-1 draw with Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
"It was very important for Japan to blood some young players
and get them some experience at the highest level. With enough
experience Japan can work out their problems on the pitch," he

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Advance ASEAN Tariff Schedule by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will have 9,100
tariff lines in the inclusion list in the year 2000, ahead of the
full implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The lines represent almost 90 percent of Malaysia's total
tariff lines at 0-5 percent tariff in the year 2000, said Minister
of International Trade and Industries Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Of the 9,100 tariff lines, she said, 4,850 are with zero
percent tariff, 2,953 with tariffs ranging from 1-5 percent, 70
ranging from 6-10 percent and 1,227 ranging from 11-20 percent,
including 408 tariff lines on specific duty rates.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah was speaking at a seminar on "Business Opportunities In
Malaysia" in Tokyo, Japan, and the text of the speech was released
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
As at April, 1999, 85.4 percent or 47,489 of the total ASEAN
tariff lines are in the inclusion list, of which 73 percent have
duties ranging from 0-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Individually, she said, all countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will have at least 85 percent of
their tariff lines at 0-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The current average regional tariff is 4.5 percent and it is
expected to be 3.7 percent by next year.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Rafidah invites Japanese investors to
explore further investment opportunities in Malaysia because they
will enjoy the benefits of an expanded market in the ASEAN where
tariffs will be 0-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysian government offers attractive incentives for
various promoted products and activities such as high-tech
industries, research and development and skills training," she
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The current education drive
underlining "Three Emphases," theoretical study, political
awareness and good conduct, is aimed at improving the quality of
officials and bolstering the nationwide anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central
Committee, made these comments at a meeting to inaugurate the
education drive in the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection of the CPC and Ministry of Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Wei termed the education as a creative exploration of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and urged leading officials in the
discipline inspection and supervision departments to deeply
understand the inevitability, urgency and significance of the
education.
</P>
<P>
"Further progress has been made in the country's anti-
corruption battle, but corruptive elements are still breeding in
some localities and units," he said. "Some problems are very
serious," he added.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the "Three Emphases" education drive can be
taken as a turning-point to ceaselessly explore the
characteristics and law of and effective approaches for improving
the Party's work style, building a clean government and fighting
corruption under the condition of a socialist market economy and
to increase the foresight and initiative in the anti-corruption
drive.
</P>
<P>
"This anti-corruption drive must be led by the CPC and focused
on the economic development, the central task," he said, adding
that the campaign is a long-term one.
</P>
<P>
He noted that officials from discipline inspection and
supervision departments are at the forefront of the anti-
corruption drive and should play an exemplary role in abiding by
the Party's political and work discipline.

NEW DELHI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Indian
External Affairs Ministry Friday refused to comment on a decision
of the Pakistani government of "appealing to the Mujahideen
(freedom fighters) to help resolve the current situation in
Kargil" of Kashmir.
</P>

The Defense Committee of the Cabinet, the highest

to persuade the Mujahideen to withdraw.
</P>

India has stuck to its firm position that its military
operations would continue in full force till all the "intruders"
are driven out of the Indian side of the Line of Control in

<HEADLINE> China Visit to Open up New Future, Japanese FM (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua)-- The current Japan-China relationship
is one of the most important bilateral ties for his country,
visiting Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi stressed during his
first China visit since he assumed the post.
</P>
<P>
As a result of regular meetings between leaders of the two
countries, there are promising prospects and Obuchi said he has
come to China filled with enthusiasm to open up future ties.
</P>
<P>
He recalled the successful state visit paid by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin last Autumn when a joint declaration was
signed in which both sides agreed to build up their friendly and
cooperative partnership to achieve global peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The two sides already have a consensus which will take them
forward into the 21st century, Obuchi commented, adding that he
and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji confirmed such a stance when they
met earlier today.
</P>
<P>
There was also further discussions on 33 cooperative areas
which had first been raised during Jiang's Japan trip.
</P>
<P>
In fact there have been two very positive achievements from his
trip, said Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The first is that there has been a substantial conclusion
reached in the talks on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and secondly on bilateral service trade. In
addition, Japan agreed to provide 10 billion yen for the
establishment of an afforestation fund for China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope such results can be helpful to pushing
forward the on-going negotiations between China and other
countries and play a positive role in China achieving WTO entry
within the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He particularly mentioned Japan's regret over the WTO
negotiations deadlock between China and the United States.

On China's concerns over the expansion of the controversial
Japan-U.S. defense sphere, Obuchi said that Japan will continue to
follow its defence-only policy, will adhere to three nuclear-free
principles and not become a military power. He said the Japan-U.S.
defense mechanism is totally responsive and does not target at any
specific country or region.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, he said Japan's principles outlined in the
Japan-China Joint Statement signed in 1972 on the issue remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi stressed that the economic and trade relationship was a
vitally important part of bilateral ties and that he hoped the
investment and trade development momentum can be recovered,
provided the two sides make concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
As influential countries in the Asia-Pacific region, China and
Japan should hold discussions on such universal issues as
population, the environment and food supply," he said.

<HEADLINE> ITF to Experiment Larger, Slower Balls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Tennis
Federation has voted to experiment with three different types of
balls depending on the surface to slow down the men's game.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision taken at the 1999 AGM, a slow pace
ball, eight percent larger than standard, will be used on fast
surfaces such as grass or indoor carpet.
</P>
<P>
A faster, harder and lower-bouncing ball will be used on slow
surfaces such as clay with the existing ball will be used on
medium-paced surfaces.
</P>
<P>
The tennis ruling body hailed the experimental introduction of
balls as "a great step forward", thinking it will make the men's
competition "more attractive to spectators".
</P>
<P>
Critics have claimed that the 240 kph service speeds in the men
's game have reduced the sport to a contest of strength and that
the skill and artistry of the game have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The two-year experiment will begin in January 2000 and be
conducted from club level to the lower reaches of the Davis and
Fed Cups.

SNOW DRAGON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A potentially dangerous oil
leak on China's North Pole Expedition ship the Snow Dragon was
repaired after six hours today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Kazakh Entrepreneurs Discussing Ways for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh government has mapped
out a long-term development plan for trade and economic
cooperation with China and has presented it to the Chinese
government for study, according to visiting Kazakh Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev.
</P>
<P>
At a China-Kazakhstan trade seminar which opened here today,
Tokayev said the new plan focuses on promoting cooperation between
local areas of the two countries, setting up joint ventures in
various forms, and increasing exchanges of production experience
and advanced technology in many areas including industry, machine
building, transportation, telecommunications, agriculture,
textiles, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
In order to establish direct contacts with Chinese enterprises,
he said, some 30 Kazakh companies sent representatives to join his
delegation, and this is expected to help expand cooperation on the
basis of mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiang, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said at the opening ceremony that the increased
exchanges and cooperation between governments and entrepreneurs of
the two countries in recent years have promoted the development of
the Sino-Kazakh economic and trade cooperation both in scale and
level.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the total trade volume between
China and Kazakhstan amounted to 375 million U.S. dollars in the
first five months this year, more than double that a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 370 Chinese enterprises have set up joint ventures
in Kazakhstan, involving a total investment of 330 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that there still exist great potentials in bilateral
economic and trade cooperation. He hoped that the seminar will
help Chinese and Kazakh entrepreneurs to better understand the
products and market demand of the two countries for further
cooperation in the next century.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 entrepreneurs from the two countries attended
today's seminar.

<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said here
today that the NPC is very much in favor of the growth of Sino-
Japanese relations and is ready to reinforce its friendly contact
with Japanese parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement during a meeting with visiting Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi here this afternoon. He said that the
NPC is willing to make joint efforts with the Japanese parliament
to advance Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that Japan is also ready to boost the exchange
between the parliamentarians of the two countries and hopes that
more deputies to the NPC would visit Japan.
</P>
<P>
Li elaborated his ideas on economic globalization and world
multi-polarization. He said that the former is the development
trend of the world economy and the development of the information
industry has made closer the economic links among countries, which
has brought about opportunities for economic growth in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"China and Japan have substantially reached consensus on the
issue of China's WTO membership, which indicates that Japan favors
China's access into the process of economic globalization," Li
noted.

<P>
However, Li said, the Asian financial crisis which broke out in
1997 has demonstrated that the developing nations are at a
disadvantageous position when it comes to economic globalization
and it is imperative for them to learn to better protect their
legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
"A multi-polarized world is better than one with a single-
polarity in which one country dominates world affairs," Li
continued, saying that the world itself is diversified and it is
impossible to ask all nations to develop along similar lines. "The
development path of a country could only be decided by the people
of that country," he added.
</P>
<P>
"China does not subscribe to the view that 'human rights
outweigh the sovereignty', because this will provide the pretext
and basis for aggression and interference into the internal
affairs of other countries," Li told Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the fact that Japan has reiterated many times
that it would stick to the path of peaceful development, Li went
on.
</P>
<P>
"China carries out an independent foreign policy of peace and
will continue to contribute to the regional and world peace and
stability," Li noted, adding that the United Nations should
continue to play a positive role in maintaining the world's
security and peace.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said he agrees with Li's viewpoints. He noted that
globalization should be more beneficial to everyone and side
effects should be avoided. "Each nation has its own conditions and
its own way of doing things and it is not in an ideal situation if
one country dominates the world," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged ideas on international and
regional issues of common interest.

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said that
Japan's Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's current visit is beneficial
in further confirming and consolidating the important consensus
reached by the two countries last year to push China-Japan ties
into the new century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Denies Deal Involving Marcos Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government denied
Friday that it would allow the use of a portion of the alleged
ill-gotten money of the heirs of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos as collateral for a loan.
</P>
<P>
Reports claimed that the government is wrapping up an agreement
with a New York-based securities firm that allows the government
to borrow from the 590-million-U.S. dollar Marcos funds held in
escrow.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu of the Department of Finance said
such a deal, even if it existed and got the approval of former
First Lady Imelda Marcos as reports claim, has to get the approval
first of all signatories to the escrow account.
</P>
<P>
He said any deal involving the escrow funds should have the
approval of Philippine President Joseph Estrada and the concerned
government agencies, as well as the signatories of the Marcos
foundations in which the accounts were placed.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said he had merely asked the Philippine National Bank,
where the funds are held in escrow, to determine how the
government can make use of the funds for the benefit of the people
while awaiting the final court decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
About 150 million of the 590 million dollars of the escrow
accounts would be set aside by the government to compensate
victims of human rights abuses law during the Marcos
administration, following an agreement reached by the victims with
the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Estrada said he wants an early resolution to
cases involving the wealth of the Marcoses so that the government
can use the money to bankroll government programs to improve the
life of the poor.

<HEADLINE> Delegates Seeking World Women's Youth Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Delegates at a Women's Football
Symposium was seeking a world women's youth championship
comparable to FIFA's under-20 or under-17 World Cups for boys,
according to reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a 10 percent increase in women playing in national
federation-sanctioned events over the next four years and
promoting women within the decision-making levels also were set as
goals for the international soccer community in the symposium's "
Los Angeles Declaration on Womens' Football."
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium, which concluded on Thursday, was held in
conjunction with the weeklong preparations for the Women's World
Cup final on Saturday between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We're putting this on the hands of the national associations
and confederations," Per Ravn Omdal of Norway, chairman of FIFA's
Committee for Women's' Football, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Omdal said a next step would be for FIFA, as part of its
distribution of profits from the 2002 World Cup to the national
associations and regional confederations, to require those bodies
use a fixed percentage of the money to develop the women's game.
</P>
<P>
Despite only 63 of FIFA's 203 registered federations taking
part in qualifying for the 1999 Women's World Cup, Omdal said he
is confident many nations would participate in a world youth
qualifying tournament if FIFA sanctioned such an event.

"In line with the spirit of 'taking history as the mirror and
facing up to the future,' the two countries have agreed to build
up a friendly and cooperative partnership devoted to peace and
development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Declaration signed during the visit is one of the
three important guiding documents signed between the two countries,
along with the China-Japan Joint Statement and the China-Japan
Peace and Friendship Treaty, according to the Chinese President.
</P>
<P>
"All documents have far-reaching impact on the growth of
bilateral ties and reflect the fundamental interests and common
aspiration of the two peoples and follow the trend of peace and
development in our time," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the prime minister's current visit is beneficial to
further affirm and consolidate the important common understanding
reached last year, carry out the planned series of cooperative
projects and speed bilateral relationships into the 21st century
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
As for historical issues, Jiang pointed out, "taking history as
the mirror" should be insisted on so that we might draw lessons
from history, and to understand and treat history correctly."
</P>
<P>
As for the Taiwan issue, Jiang said he hopes Japan will keep
its promise.
</P>
<P>
"The world today is not peaceful. Safeguarding peace and
promoting development are still two key tasks facing human society,
" Jiang said. "Maintaining a Cold War mentality, relying on
military alliance and strengthening the role of military factors
do not accord with the trend of development of the time, nor are
they good for establishing a truly safe environment."
</P>
<P>
"Japan has taken two totally different tracks of development
this century. And the peaceful development after the War has
brought about today's prosperity to it. History has proven that
this choice is correct and we hope Japan will continue to take the
path of peace and development," Jiang added.

<P>
SINGAPORE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar will arrive here next Monday for a two-day official
visit at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart, Shunmugam
Jayakumar, the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press statement that this will be Syed
Hamid's introductory visit to Singapore as foreign minister and he
will be accompanied by his wife and a number of senior Malaysian
officials.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay in Singapore, Syed Hamid will meet with
Jayakumar and call on Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the visit, the first by a Malaysian
foreign minister in at least more than a year, will be beneficial
to the improvement of the relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Malaysia are bound by a multiplicity of complex
ties and their relations have seen many ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the two sides have run into a rough patch with

The Chinese government erected the monument in 1958 to
commemorate the heroes "fighting against domestic and foreign
enemies and for the freedom and happiness of the people".
</P>
<P>
The monument's designers also carved ten big reliefs, featuring
important historic events since the Opium War (1840-1842), around
the four sides of the base. One of the ten, which directly faces
the Great Hall of the People, shows the Chinese people bravely
combating Japanese invaders from 1937 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
At 11:45, Prime Minister Obuchi began to circle around the
monument and carefully studied the reliefs. Then, for the third
time he made a deep bow in front of the monument.

Horticultural experts from the park explained that the reason
why pine tree saplings were chosen was because they fit in with
the overall design of the garden.
</P>
<P>
What is more important, however, is that pine trees are
evergreen, which represent Obuchi's hope to strengthen bilateral
cooperation in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan have an increasingly close cooperation in
environmental protection and a number of Japanese have helped
China to plant more trees to create a greener environment.

China and Japan signed a Joint Communique on Environmental

NEW DELHI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Armed Forces Friday
claimed to have cleared all intruders from the Batalik sub-sector
of Kashmir after a fierce battle and the army was on the Line of
Control (LOC) between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The last of the intruders in Batalik sub-sector had been
kicked out and we are on the LOC in this entire sub-sector," Press
Trust of India (PTI) quoted Lt. Gen. Krishan Pal, who is in charge
of the entire Kargil operations, as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The process of pushing the intruders out of Drass and Mushkoh
sub-sectors were continuing and "it is a matter of time before the
intruders are thrown out of these areas, where small pockets are
still with them," he said. He added that the army had intensified
operations to evict what he called remaining Pakistan intruders in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
India launched a big military operation on May 8 to "flush out
infiltrators" from its side of the LOC and the fighting is still
going on.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Islamabad, Pakistan
Friday decided to appeal to the Mujahideens fighting the Indian
Army to "help resolve the Kargil situation." The decision was

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Both China's and Japan's foreign
ministers spoke highly of the high level talks and meetings
between the leaders of their two countries during Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's current China visit.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan told his Japanese counterpart Masahiko Komura that
the leaders had confirmed the significance of the establishment of
a friendly and cooperative partnership which is devoted to peace
and development, especially as this had been achieved in the light
of historical lessons to help both face the future positively.
</P>
<P>
"They had also agreed to speed up the implementation of a
series of important political consensus and cooperation agreements
reached last year," Tang added in his meeting with Komura.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that there had been a frank exchange of views about
certain historical issues which still concern Chinese people,
other matters such as the involvement of Taiwan in Japan-U.S.
security cooperation, and Japan's development direction.
</P>
<P>
"China hopes that Japan will stick to and implement its
commitments to avoid disturbance of the normal development of Sino-

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Protest Against New Press Law, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Iranian university
students staged a rally here Thursday night to protest against the
newly-approved press law and a ban on the popular moderate daily
Salam (Hello), a spokesman from the Interior Ministry announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Bahaeddin Sheikholeslam, said that the students
shouted slogans outside the Tehran University dormitory, marched
toward the freeway nearby and scuffled with plainclothes
policemen.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of students and police officers were
injured in the scuffle and were transferred to nearby hospitals,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sheikholeslam said that the policemen entered the scene of the
protest without informing the Interior Ministry and arrested a
number of the students at the dormitory.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the security council of Tehran province
convened and decided to release all arrested students except the
organizers of the rally, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian conservative-dominated Majlis (parliament) on
Wednesday approved the general outlines of a new press law,
threatening to put more strict rules and pressure on the country's
freedom-seeking press.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the country's most popular moderate daily
Salam was closed down by the conservative-dominated judiciary for
publishing a "classified document" of the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, the Intelligence Ministry announced later to drop its
complaint against Salam in order to "prevent tension in the
country."
</P>
<P>
Salam reported Tuesday in its front page that Saeed Emami, one
of the main agents behind serial political killings in the
country, had proposed to amend the country's press law in order to
control the press.
</P>
<P>
It said that Emami, former deputy intelligence minister for
security affairs, sent a letter last October to the then
intelligence minister, calling on the ministry to raise proposals
to amend the press law.
</P>
<P>
Emami, well-known as Islami, was arrested for masterminding
killings of several Iranian dissidents and committed suicide in
prison on June 19 by taking depilatory substance while taking a
bath.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Iran Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his wife
were stabbed to death at home while at least three dissident
writers were mysteriously killed in Tehran later last year.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In stumping the nation this week to bring jobs and hope to
impoverished regions, President Bill Clinton has mixed a dash of
liberalism's old War on Poverty with a pinch of conservatism's
laissez-faire philosophy, yielding his latest recipe for centrist
solutions to society's challenges.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite plummeting computer prices and billions of dollars
spent wiring public schools and libraries, white, high-income
Americans continue to predominate in the on-line world in the
United States, according to a new government report.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. government's efforts to fight the spread of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons are disorganized and
overlapping, says an independent commission that calls for a new
White House czar to direct a streamlined defense against "a grave
threat to the United States."
</P>
<P>
-- A report to be released soon concludes that government
regulators allowed corrupt practices to drive Mexico's banking
system into insolvency, forcing a financial rescue that has cost
taxpayers 80 billion U.S. dollars in four years, Mexican lawmakers
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia and New Zealand, outraged by new U.S. penalty
tariffs on their lamb exports, accused the United States of
hypocrisy and promised to seek retribution in international trade
forums.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Final Accounts Show Lower Expenditure, Higher Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The final accounts of the Hong
Kong Special Administration Region Government for the financial
year 1998-99 ending March 31, 1999 show that government
expenditure was lower and revenue higher than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures published Friday in the government
Gazette, expenditure for the year amounted to 239.3 billion HK
dollars (30.67 billion U.S. dollars) and revenue to 216.1 billion
HK dollars (27.70 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The resultant deficit for the year amounted to 23.2 billion HK
dollars (2.97 billion U.S. dollars), which is 9.1 billion HK
dollars (1.16 billion U.S. dollars) lower than the revised
estimate of 32.3 billion HK dollars (4.14 billion U.S. dollars)
announced by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen in his
budget speech in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Revenue was 3.3 billion HK dollars (423 million U.S. dollars)
higher and expenditure 5.8 billion HK dollars (743.5 million U.S.
dollars) lower than anticipated at the time of the revised
estimate.
</P>
<P>
"The additional revenue was attributable to higher than
anticipated earnings on the investment of the fiscal reserves with
the Exchange Fund," a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The lower than forecast expenditure comprised lower than
expected recurrent spending of 2.6 billion HK dollars (333.3
million U.S. dollars) spread over a wide range of items, and lower
capital spending of 3.2 billion HK dollars (410.2 million U.S.
dollars) arising largely from delays in the acquisition of a
number of major capital items together with a lower than expected
take-up from a number of loan assistance schemes," the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Ministerial Session to Discuss Ethio-Eritrean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The border conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea will be discussed Friday, the second day of
the ministerial meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
here in the Algerian capital.
</P>
<P>
The eruption of the conflict between the two Horn of African
countries, which came as a most unexpected development to the
continental bloc and the international community at large, was one
of the major concerns of the annual OAU ministerial and summit
meetings last year.
</P>
<P>
OAU has been making sustained efforts at the level of
ambassadors, ministers and heads of state in bringing the
conflicts to a peaceful end.
</P>
<P>
A proposal, known as OAU framework agreement, was made on
November 8, 1998 to press for an immediate cessation of
hostilities, redeployment of the armed forces present in Badme,
one of the disputed areas along the common border between the two
neighboring countries, and the deployment of a group of military
observers to supervise the redeployment and demilitarization
process for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the efforts made, the two sides have been fighting
each other in the border areas, with each side accusing the other
for ignoring the OAU peace framework.
</P>
<P>
The 35th OAU summit, the last of the century, is seen as yet
another chance for peace along the border of the two east African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The three-day ministerial meeting, a preparation for the 35th
summit of OAU, presents a series of document on the making and
preserving of peace in the conflicts-ridden continent for the
forthcoming summit.

<HEADLINE> Australia Calls for Urgent Talks on U.S. Lamb Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia Friday urged the
international trade umpire to convene an urgent meeting to try to
overturn a new U.S. tariff on Australian lamb.
</P>
<P>
Australia lodged a formal request in Geneva for World Trade
Organization (WTO) consultations after the United States announced
a three-year tariff and quota program designed to help U.S. lamb
producers compete against Australian and New Zealand imports.
</P>
<P>
Australia's acting Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim
Fischer said this would trigger a meeting with the U.S. trade
representative, which Australia wants to be held this week.
</P>
<P>
In a later statement, Fischer's office said Australia had
requested consultations in the next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
However, Fischer ruled out retaliatory action toward the United
States, saying such a move could cost thousands of Australian
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The move came as Australia's state and territory trade
ministers met in Australia's Darwin city and passed a unanimous
resolution condemning the outbreak of protectionism in the United
States on the lamb issue.
</P>
<P>
The resolution condemned "the total lack of justice and
fairness with the decision of the United States to impose barriers
on Australian lamb exports."
</P>
<P>
It also supported the Australian and New Zealand governments'
decision to take action in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration decided on Wednesday to impose a
9-percent tariff on Australian lamb and a quota which limits
imports for the next year to the 1998 levels.

<HEADLINE> Socio-Economic Strategy Tops OAU Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ALGIERS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) member countries are to make
socio-economic strategy for Africa as one of the top priorities at
the on-going session of the continental bloc.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the African Economic Community, a 34-year
program which started in 1991, will be one of the hot topics in
the continental socio-economic strategy, as Africa is trying to
find its place in the changing world in the new millennium,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim presented Friday a
report concerning the socio-economic development of the
pan-African organization before the 70th session of the OAU's
Working and Social Affairs Commission being held here.
</P>
<P>
Employment situation in Africa, the development of human
sources in Africa's social economic development, and Africa's
strategy for the fight against drug-trafficking constituted the
main subjects in the report.
</P>
<P>
Employment situation in Africa is still worsening, he said, as
the annual growth of labor, which is at the rate of three percent,
is accompanied by a rate of job creation approaching two to 2. 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of recommendations call particularly on political
and social stability, the development of structural adjustment
programs adapted to the countries' reality, the reduction or the
cancellation of debts, and the protection against the excess of
liberalization of economy.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also stressed that the effectiveness of training
policies and programs which concern the whole population, should
be guaranteed.

STOCKHOLM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Government officials are
considering tightening anti-hooligan laws ahead of next year's
European soccer championship which is co-hosted by Dutch and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Under current legislation, soccer fans charged with public
order offences are freed ahead of their trial on condition of good

</P>
<P>
The Dutch cabinet will discuss on Friday a proposal which will
enable judges to lock up even minor offenders if they believe
there is a significant risk of further trouble.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has already approved legislation that would allow
police to hold groups of suspected troublemakers for up to 12

<HEADLINE> French Olympic Champion to Return from Injury layoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Triple Olympic champion Marie-Jose
Perec will stage her comeback in Casablanca next week after
injuries have kept her out of top competition for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
The French sprinter announced on Friday at a news conference
that she will run the 400 meters at a track meet on July 15,
adding that after that race she will decide on her programs for
the rest of the track season.
</P>
<P>
Perec, 31, grabbed the 1996 Atlanta Olympics titles in 200
meters and 400 meters. She also came away with the 400-meter gold
medal in 1992 Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
But she has had terrible luck since the 1997 World
Championships in Athens, where she injured a hamstring while
preparing for the 200-meter semifinal race.
</P>
<P>
She had to pull out of the European Championships in Budapest
last year. Soon after, she was diagnosed with mononucleosis and
has not run competitively since.

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Reported at Lowest Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Similar reports are coming from Lake Erie about its lowest
water level since 1967. Lakes Michigan and Huron were also at
their lowest points since 1990, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
If this summer's hot temperatures and low rainfall persist, the
daily continued, commercial ships might not be able to navigate
the St. Lawrence Seaway.
</P>
<P>
But the problem is by no means limited to water course
navigation. The Council of Canadians predicts that the country
will be at the center of a global water crisis as foreign
businesses seek to privatize and export Canadian fresh water
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The trouble is being complicated by the fact that at least
three U.S. companies have already sued Canada under the North
America Free Trade Agreement for refusing to allow businesses to
export Canadian water to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The impacts of low water levels, which can also find their way
to hydro-electric production and big breweries, would be even more
damaging if they stayed a permanent way.
</P>
<P>
More salt water would move in from the ocean, endangering
freshwater supplies for towns on the St. Lawrence River. Marshes
and the plants and animals that live in them could be destroyed.
Contaminated sediments once under water would be exposed, the
daily newspaper warned.
</P>
<P>
Although many insist current water levels are within typical
cycles, others fear the problem is real and imminent: "If you
reduce the rainfall a little and raise the temperatures, it can
have a big effect," an export was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The argument is based on the reality that the Great Lakes have
a large surface area, which means they're prone to high levels of
evaporation.

<HEADLINE> Employment Considered as Means Against Poverty in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Employment is considered as a real
means of struggle against poverty in Africa, according to
representatives of African trade unions who are attending their
first summit here in Algerian capital.
</P>
<P>
Trade union leaders were unanimous in saying that the solutions
to the problems currently prevailing in Africa, notably those
related to debts, economic integration, the fundamental rights of
workers and employment, are a precondition for the improvement of
Africa's socio-economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Adevati Sunmonu, secretary-general of the Organization
of African Trade Union Unity, said "there could not be an
eradication of poverty without employment."
</P>
<P>
African continent should draw lessons from past experiences to
face the social injustice and the absence of solidarity of
workers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Sehbani, secretary-general of the Tunisian Trade Union,
indicated Thursday on the first day of the union meeting that
Africa must not cut off itself from the rest of the world at the
turn of the century when the world is witnessing an economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The two-day African trade union meeting will submit a
declaration of the continent's trade unions for the summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) scheduled for Monday to
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Improves Project Loan Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) has established a complete set of standards and
procedures for evaluating loaning project in a bid to improve
credit qualities.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC sources said that in 1998, to support the central
government's policies of expanding infrastructure construction and
domestic demand, the bank completed appraisal of 1,683 loaning
projects, involving 165.6 billion yuan in total loans.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, the ICBC established a bank-wide credit
appraisal committee, with 143 expert members from both the bank
and outside of the bank, aiming to improving the appraisal work.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the ICBC Tian Ruizhang said that, as a state-
owned commercial bank, the ICBC must foster the ability to
independently evaluate its loaning projects, selecting the right
clients while preventing repetitive construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ICBC should also improve its financial
services to promote the country's economic growth, at the same
time minimizing credit risks.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian, the ICBC will produce detailed procedures
and software systems for evaluating loaning projects in power
networks, highways, real estate development and other industries.
</P>
<P>
The repayment ability of the debtor and credit risks will be
the key factors in project appraisal, he added.

<HEADLINE> New Man-made Beach for Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A 35-hectare swimming area opened
today in the Pudong New Area, the financial and trade zone in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Administrative committee sources say that it is just a part of
the city's efforts to create more favorable living conditions for
tourists, investors, and local people.
</P>
<P>
Because of silt that washes down the Yangtze River into the
East China Sea at the northern part of Shanghai, the beaches along
the city's coastline are all very dirty and impossible to use for
swimming.
</P>
<P>
So, the man-made site was made with a small dam and by
filtering sea water from the eastern end of Pudong. The sand on
the 1,300-meter beach has been hauled in. There are some 100,000
square meters of palm trees and grass, with dozens of huts and
pavilions scattered about.
</P>
<P>
Pudong has a goal of becoming an international finance, trade,
tourism, conference, and exhibition center in the next century. It
was set up in 1990 and has completed 10 major infrastructure
projects, with another 10 under construction. These already there
include an international airport, a subway, and a pedestrian
passage across the Huangpu River, which separates it from downtown
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that investors from more than 60
countries and regions have established 5,437 projects in the area,
worth 28 billion U.S. dollars. The list of investors includes 88
of the world's top 500 multinationals.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Leaders Endorse Joint Statement With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's political and military
leadership Friday endorsed the joint statement on the Kargil
crisis in Kashmir signed during the visit by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif to the United States this week, and appealed to the
Mujahideen (freedom fighters) to help resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
This was the main message came from a meeting of the Defense
Committee of the Cabinet (DCC) presided over by Sharif, who
returned home Thursday from his visit to the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The DCC expressed satisfaction that the Joint Statement issued
in Washington during Sharif's visit to the United States had
included the main elements of Pakistan's position on the Kargil
crisis:
</P>
<P>
-- Respect for the Line of Control in Kashmir by both India and
Pakistan;
</P>
<P>
-- De-escalation of the volatile situation in Kargil and,
subsequently, the resumption of the dialogue for a final
settlement of the Kashmir dispute as part of the Lahore process.
</P>
<P>
The DCC decided that "Pakistan should appeal to the Mujahideen
to help resolve the current Kargil situation and provide an
opportunity to the international community to play an active role
for the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the Kashmiri
people and to promote peace and development in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
The DCC appreciated Sharif's diplomatic initiatives including
the efforts with the G-8 (group of eight) for a better
understanding of Pakistan's position, his visit to China earlier
this month and his contacts with world leaders.
</P>
<P>
The meeting expressed appreciation of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's pledge to continue to take "personal interest" in
encouraging an expeditious resumption and intensification of the
dialogue process between Pakistan and India for resolving all
issues including the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
The DCC considered the pledge a "significant development" as it
was the first time that the United States had agreed to play such
a role in the search for the final settlement of the Kashmir
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Participants in Friday's DCC meeting, the second since the
outbreak of the Kargil crisis in early May, included main cabinet
ministers and the three services chiefs of the Pakistani Army. The
DCC held its first meeting on the crisis on July 2.

<HEADLINE> S. African Rand Weaker on Dollar Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African rand opened
the day weaker, touching a worst level of 6.1200 against the U.S.
dollar in early trade.
</P>
<P>
The local currency defied its support level and moved weaker as
off- shore players demanded dollars. The rand was last quoted at
6.0880 per dollar from a previous close of 6.0550 of some offshore
dollar buying.
</P>
<P>
Dealers see the day's technical levels of 6.0800 as resistance
level and 6.1200 as a support level.
</P>
<P>
"Asian trade had seen some dollar buying by a San Francisco
bank which sparked a panic causing the rand to weaken to 6.1200,"
said a dealer.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the dollar remained strong, which increased the
demand to hold the safe currency as the world markets were subdued
throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
Sources said there had been some rand selling from Singapore
which depressed the rand.
</P>
<P>
The morning session had seen some profit taking around the
6.0750 level. Local players coming into the market, however,
helped stabilize the rand around the 6.0800 level.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that with gold holding around the 256/257 dollars
an ounce level, it offered some comfort to the local currency.
Bullion was last quoted at 256.00 dollars per ounce from 257.15
dollars at the New York close.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said the rand had, nevertheless, held its own in the
face of a turbulent gold price, due to windfalls from the Old
Mutual listing being slowly factored into the market.
</P>
<P>
South African life assurer Old Mutual lists on the London Stock
Exchange on July 12. Economists expect the Old Mutual listing to
inject around 5 billion rand (833 million dollars) into net
foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market is beginning to factor in another
decline in interest rates of about 50 basis points by next Friday.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Suggest New Guildline For ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government Thursday unfolded
a fresh six-point mandate for the Nigeria dominated West Africa
Peacekeeping Force or ECOMOG operations in Sierra Leone with new
thrusts toward reconstruction,
</P>
<P>
disarmament and integration.
</P>
<P>
The six-point mandate, contained in a briefing by the
president's spokesman reaching here Friday, includes
reconstruction, disarmament, mobilization, integration of the
citizenry, training of the Sierra Leonean Armed Forces, and
provision of security for VIPs in the post-war country.
</P>
<P>
The new agenda emanated from the signing three days ago, of the
Lome Peace Agreement between President Tejan Kabbah and Corporal
Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo returned to Abuja Wednesday from
Togo after two hectic days of negotiations toward the resolution
of the conflict - a move which, according to Okupe, was the
president's fresh diplomatic initiative.
</P>
<P>
The government, Okupe said, will commence a process of gradual
and phased withdrawal of Nigerian troops from Sierra Leone in
line with the stage-by-stage progress of the Lome Peace
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"This action will be in keeping with the electioneering promise
of President Obasanjo to get Nigerian troops back home as soon as
possible, without jeopardy to the peace process and diplomatic
gains already in place," Okupe said.
</P>
<P>
On the contributions of the Nigerian government to the
resolution of the conflict, Okupe said the President had a
well-focused and dynamic approach to the solution, noting that
the fresh approach opened a new vista to the problem which moved
the talk from the earlier rigid position which had negatively
affected the first peace agreement signed between both parties.
</P>
<P>
According to Okupe, the president has embarked on various
diplomatic shuttles to ensure the success of his diplomatic
initiative.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, even before President Obasanjo was sworn-in, during
his international shuttle, he laid the building blocks for the
Lome Peace Agreement when he visited the affected countries and
consulted widely with the leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
A week after assumption of office, President Obasanjo had
received President Charles Taylor who was in Abuja on June 26, and
also visited Liberia, Sierra Leone and Togo.
</P>
<P>
The president is also billed to travel to Algiers on Monday for
the opening of the 35th OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
"The president is looking forward to the first opportunity to
meet the largest gathering of African leaders to rub minds on the
numerous problems bedeviling the continent, with a view to
finding lasting solutions to them, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The meetings, he remarked, would go a long way in exploring
ways of moving Africa away from the stagnation, conflicts and
under-development which had hindered meaningful growth at the turn
of the new century.  Endetim

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Sues Officials for Disappearance of 16,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's presidential
commissions of inquiry have filed cases in courts against 425
state officials for the disappearance of about 16,500 people from
1980 to 1990, sources of the Attorney General's Department said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are complaints about the disappearance of about 16,500
people during the 1980-90 "period of terror" under the former
government of the United National Party, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
When President Kumaratunga's People's Alliance coalition came
to power in 1994, it promised to correct the human rights abuses
of the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
Three commissions were appointed by the president to inquire
into and report these incidents.
</P>
<P>
Based on the reports of these commissions, a special police
unit conducted further investigations and submitted reports on 825
persons found responsible by the commissions.
</P>
<P>
Of these people, cases have been filed against 425 state
officials, mainly from the security forces and the police.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, a U.N. study said that Sri Lanka has the
second highest number of disappeared people in the world, second
only to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Over 12,000 Sri Lankans have gone missing after being detained
by security forces since 1980, said the study by the United
Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are said to be young Tamil men accused of
supporting the Tamil rebels fighting for a homeland in Sri Lanka's
north and east.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Considers Approaching US for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate has considered
asking the government to sign military pacts with the United
States and any other west European powers to protect the new
civilian government from being toppled again.
</P>
<P>
The motion sponsored by about 12 senators says that "the
government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria should immediately
commence negotiation and sign a military pact with the United
States of America and any other democratic European nation for the
protection of democracy in Nigeria," the Guardian newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The motion was tabled Thursday "in view of the fact that
democratic governance in Nigeria has been rather unstable and
vulnerable to military incursions; and considering the fact that
there has been eight coups in Nigeria since independence in
1960."
</P>
<P>
In another interesting motion, the upper house of the Nigeria's
top legislature was asked to approve some senators' motions which
wanted the re- naming of all the public facilities named after
late military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The motion was tabled "in view of the fact that public
buildings, roads and institutions were unilaterally named after
the late head of state Gen. Sani Abacha, and that many prominent
Nigerians were either assassinated or incarcerated unjustly by
him," said its sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The motion then suggested that the names of the public
facilities should be renamed after "those innocent Nigerians that
were assassinated during the regime of late Gen. Sani Abacha."

<HEADLINE> Fourth EMEAP Governors' Meeting Held in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Central bank governors and
monetary authority chief executives in the Asia Pacific region
agreed here Friday that appropriate macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms are needed to ensure the current economic
recovery in the region a sustainable one.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made during the Fourth Governors' Meeting of
the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP),
which was held Friday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
EMEAP governors reviewed recent economic and financial
developments in the member economies, and noted encouraging signs
of economic recovery and stability returning to financial markets
in Asia, said Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA), who chaired the meeting, at a press
briefing after the conclusion of the closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
"But for the region's economic recovery to be sustainable,
governors agreed on the need to pursue appropriate macroeconomic
policies and to keep up the efforts to implement structural
reforms," Yam told reporters.
</P>
<P>
EMEAP is a co-operative organization comprising central banks
and monetary authorities of eleven economies: Australia, China,
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Indonesia, Japan,
South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Governors also called for a supportive international
environment characterized by continued and steady growth of the
industrialized economies and stability of the major currencies and
financial markets, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
They received reports on the last two meetings of the EMEAP
Deputies in Auckland and Melbourne and also progress reports from
the three Working Groups on Banking Supervision, Financial Markets,
and Payment and Settlement Systems.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their commitment to promote co-operation and
advances in the different areas of central banking functions.
</P>
<P>
On the strengthening of the international financial system,
participants noted the progress made in various international fora
to enhance transparency and disclosure as well as to improve
counterparty risk management.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the establishment of the Financial Stability
Forum (FSF) to co-ordinate efforts by various national and
international bodies.
</P>
<P>
They supported the studies of the three Working Groups
established by the FSF on highly leveraged institutions, short-
term capital flows and the offshore financial centers, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
Governors considered that these studies would be helpful in
addressing the potentially disruptive impact of highly leveraged
institutions' activities, particularly on market dynamics of small
and medium-sized financial markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
EMEAP Governors emphasized the need for adequate involvement of
EMEAP economies in the process of reforming the international
financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
They therefore welcomed the inclusion of some economies from
this region in the FSF and its working groups, and would like to
see a wider participation of other emerging market economies.
</P>
<P>
Finally, participants of the meeting noted substantial progress
made by members in addressing the Year 2000 issue and reaffirmed
their commitment to co-operate at both the regional and
international level in this area.
</P>
<P>
The EMEAP next governors' meeting will be held in South Korea
on July 7, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Blair's Fox Ban Pledge Raises Hackles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The issue of blood sports has again
aroused passionate debate in the UK, as pro-hunt campaigners have
criticized a new pledge by British Prime Minister to ban fox-
hunting.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told BBC One's Question Time program on
Thursday that everything possible was being done to ensure it had
space in the next session of parliament, which is due to begin
this autumn. Failing that, he said, space would be found in the
following session.
</P>
<P>
But the Countryside Alliance, which is committed to resisting a
hunting ban, has said rural areas would be hit hard. A spokesman
on Friday asserted the power of the people would overcome that of
the state, saying that "if time is found for a new fox hunting
bill, expect another noisy fight."
</P>
<P>
It was also revealed that the Scottish Parliament may have to
introduce legislation of its own for a ban to be imposed in
Scotland, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Ross, the spokesman for the Countryside Alliance in
Scotland, said: "Hunting has been in Scotland since the 1750s and
it has a secure future."
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the height of arrogance at two minutes to
midnight on the BBC's Question Time to announce a package that
would destroy rural Scotland and dustbin 16,000 jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Mike Baker, a spokesman for the Campaign for the Protection
of the Hunted Animal, which represents the League Against Cruel
Sports, the RSPCA and the International Fund for Animal Welfare,
described Blair's remarks as "great news."
</P>
<P>
"The government has really taken note of what the overwhelming
majority of people in Britain believe is a strong moral imperative
for the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair's comments followed the delivery of a petition, which
called for the banning of hunting with hounds and was signed by 42,
500 people, to the Commons on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, hunt supporters gathered outside Downing Street to
warn that a field-sports ban could hit hundreds of jobs.

the policies and programs presented by the government for the
1999/2000 fiscal year starting mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Though the policies and programs were attacked by the
opposition parties as lacking innovation and fresh approach and a
mere adherence to formality, they got passed in voice vote in the
House of Representatives where the ruling Nepali Congress party
holds a majority of seats.
</P>
<P>
The policies and programs focus on poverty reduction on the
national front and identify a number of priority sectors in this
regard.

About 42 percent to 50 percent of the population live below the
poverty line and poverty alleviation has been the primary
objective of the government in Nepal.

itself, among others, to making the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) more action- and result-oriented.

<HEADLINE> SAARC's Kathmandu Summit Should be Milestone: Nepali FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Ram Sharan Mahat
said here Friday that Nepal is making all types of preparations
for the forthcoming summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the summit should be a very
important milestone.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a face-to-face program organized by the Reporters'
Club of Nepal, Mahat said that preparations are being made
physically and logistically for the 11th SAARC summit scheduled to
be held in Kathmandu in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Various resolutions and priority orders are being prepared with
cooperation from the concerned countries and consultations are
underway with these countries to arrive at a time agreeable to all
parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, was formed in December 1985 to
promote social and economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the outstanding Bhutanese refugee issue, Mahat said that "we
want a quick resolution of the issue, our policy will be concrete
result-oriented." He said there is an all-party consensus in Nepal
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in U.N.-run camps
in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989 and
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan had held seven rounds of ministerial talks on
the issue but failed to make any headway.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said that the Kalapani and border demarcation issues
between Nepal and India will be resolved through bilateral
consultations on the basis of historical documents.
</P>
<P>
Kalapani in far-western Nepal has been claimed by both
countries for decades.
</P>
<P>
On Indo-Pakistani clashes over Kashmir, the foreign minister
called for both countries to respect the Line of Control and seek
a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
But he said economic development will be the focus of Nepal's
foreign policies. "The economic diplomacy will be continued," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nepali missions abroad will be made more active and effective
to achieve the goals, he said.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the government is fully committed to safeguard
the Nepalese people's interests wherever they work.
</P>
<P>
Mahat took office as Nepal's foreign minister on June 30. This
is his first meeting with the press.

<HEADLINE> S. African Labor Federations Meet over Job Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG,July 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's two of the
largest trade union federations held separate meetings here on
Friday to discuss the issue of thousands of job losses in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (CSATU) and the
Federation of Unions of South Africa (FUSA) met separately with
their affiliate unions to draw attention to the unemployment
issue.
</P>
<P>
Cosatu spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga said the meeting was called
to assess the massive job losses, including those in the country's
insurance and gold mining industries.
</P>
<P>
"Reports indicate that we may still experience more (job
losers)," he said
</P>
<P>
Cosatu hoped to come up with a "consolidated organizational
response" to the job loss threats.
</P>
<P>
This could include mass action, Ratshitanga said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SA Footplate Staff Association, which is
</P>
<P>
affiliated to FUSA, confirmed that the meeting would focus on
the rail company of Spoornet's new restructuring plan which,
according to labour unions, will involve 27000 retrenchments over
the next three years.
</P>

The state-owned communications company, Telkom, is expected to
shed 10, 000 jobs over the same period, while 11,700 jobs are
possibly on the line at five gold mines.

<P>
The SA Transport and Allied Workers Union, which has threatened
rolling mass action from Friday to protest Spoornet's
retrenchments, said the mass action would take the form of
lunchtime pickets.
</P>
<P>
"We start notifying workers today (Friday) and on Monday we
will have a full blown demonstration," the union's Gauteng
chairman Frans Marumo said, adding that a national strike was also
a possibility.
</P>
<P>
But Spoornet managing director Saki Macozoma on Thursday night
warned that rail transport would become less viable and more jobs
would be lost if the unions went ahead with mass action.
</P>
<P>
"If they go on strike on Friday, Spoornet will lose more
customers who will never come back to the railways. This can only
result in more job losses," he said.

SINGAPORE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to rebound
on Singapore Stock Market Friday as institutions returned to the
market and pushed up prices.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), that chalked up
Thursday for the first time this week, gained 21.77 points to end
at 2,181.63 points in modest trading, off from the intraday high
of 2,192.30 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume increased to 921.92 million shares valued at
1,031.81 million Singapore dollars (607.66 million U.S. dollars).
Gainers outnumbered losers by 268 to 77 with 100 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 205.24 million stock parcel by Golden
Ag which was transacted at 0.635 U.S. dollars per share. It was
followed by IPC that had 55.36 million units done. Hotung was the
next with 32.885 million counters traded.

<HEADLINE> Barak May Suggest Bypassing Parts of Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- In his first visit abroad after
taking office, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is expected to
present his suggestions for bypassing parts of the Wye accord and
moving directly to the final-status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak will meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the
Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria Friday morning. Their talks
are expected to focus on improving bilateral relations and moving
the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post quoted a source at the Prime Minister's
Office as saying Barak would suggest during the meeting that
Israel carries out the second phase of redeployment according to
the Wye accord, then passes over the third withdrawal, combining
it with the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
This would mean that Israel would withdraw within weeks from 5
percent of area C (area under full Israeli control) in the West
Bank, but postpone the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The next redeployment consists of a 5 percent withdrawal from C
to B (under joint control of Israel and the Palestinians), as well
as a 1 percent withdrawal from C to A (under full Palestinian
control), and a 7.1 percent withdrawal from B to A at a later date.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians, who call for a full implementation of Wye, are
expected to dismiss Barak's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak reportedly plans to urge Barak to
immediately freeze all Jewish settlement building in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
Regarding bilateral relations, the emphasis of the talks
between the two leaders, the source said, would be on developing
ways to increase the commercial ties, especially in the field of
energy.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Barak's office has not released information on the
talking points for the meeting, saying only that it would serve as
a chance for Barak to "familiarize" himself with a key regional
leader and begin building up a relationship built on trust.
</P>
<P>
Following his meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein next week, Barak is to
leave for the United States next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the way home the following week, Barak is scheduled to stop
over in Britain to meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair.

<HEADLINE> France's Public Debt Grows in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- France's public debt rose by 0.3
percent in 1998 over 1997 to 786.8 billion euros (about 803
billion U.S. dollars), according to an official report published
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The public debt represented 60.3 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) in the same year, surpassing the limit set
by the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, which asks all
countries in the euro zone to control their public debt under 60
percent of their GDP.
</P>
<P>
The figure was published by the French State Institute of
Statistics and Economics Study (INSEE) in its annual report on
public debt.
</P>
<P>
French Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said Friday morning that
France must continue to strictly control public spending.

The euro remained stable in international markets Friday
morning after the French government's announcement.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Lower Birth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government is drawing up a
draft of the national population plan for the period after 2000,
which will focus on ways to lower the birth rate, Vietnam News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In her recent interview with Vietnam News Agency on the
occasion of the World Population Day (July 11), Nguyen Thi Than,
chairwoman of Vietnam's National Assembly's Committee for Social
Affairs, said the draft was expected to be completed late this
year.
</P>
<P>
She said that over the past five years the allocated spending
for population and family planning programs had increased tenfold.
</P>
<P>
The success of Vietnam's population policies in the last few
years had helped lower population pressure on many areas. "Just
imagine how many more classrooms and jobs we would have to set up
should the population now be 82 million or 83 million rather than
the 77 million it actually is," Than said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was one of the two countries which have received a
population award from the United Nations this year.
</P>
<P>
The national population growth rate, Than said, had dropped to
2.13 percent in general but the birth rate was still high in some
areas, especially in remote and mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
In the Red River Delta provinces, the birth rate has fallen
below the fertility level of 1.99 children per woman since 1997.
However, the figure now stood as high as four in the Central
Highlands area and 2.6 to three in most of the central provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam's national population plan would also contain steps
to address the increasing proportion of the old people, and the
rising migration to urban areas, as well as to combat and prevent
HIV/AIDS, she said.
</P>
<P>
Predicting Vietnam's population growth over the next few
decades, Than said Vietnamese population would be aging, but not
as fast as the global average.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Acts Against Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
earmarked funds for emergency measures to fight drought and
protect the affected people.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Apolo Nsibambi said many parts of Uganda had been
afflicted by drought and face acute food shortage. People, crops
and animals were endangered, the New Vision newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nsibambi said his government had taken emergency steps which
include buying of cattles from badly hit areas. The cattle will be
used for restocking for other districts.
</P>
<P>
''The government also plans to purchase and distribute relief
food to the affected, construct valley tanks, sink bore holes and
desilt dams in the cattle corridor,'' added the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, many parts of the country has not
received reliable rainfall since last November. In southern
Uganda's Mbarara district, 700,000 people are faced with possible
starvation. Farmers in Kabale district in the southwest end of
the east African country expect to harvest less than 40 percent of
the normal sorghum harvest.

<HEADLINE> Price Controls Suggested to Increase Domestic Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to stimulate domestic
demand, China needs to end or reduce some levies on both
individuals and enterprises, the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC) says.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC was quoted by Friday's Shanghai Securities News as
having asked local governments to use prices to increase domestic
demand and promote growth in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production could be improved by raising the
purchasing prices of certain farm produce while reducing those of
poor quality products, the commission says in a recent circular.
</P>
<P>
Fees for education, medical care, marriage registration, family
planning, house building, electricity supply, and telephone
services in rural areas should be checked and improved to ease the
burden on farmers, while in urban areas, fees for electricity and
water supply and public transportation should be adjusted to the
ability of urbanites and companies to pay.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC has also asked for better charges for real estate and
has recommended favorable policies to encourage the development of
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
There will also be strict rules on highway tolls and foreign
investment and public capital will be encouraged in the
construction of roads.
</P>
<P>
Service charges for restructuring enterprises, and registration,
training, management and job hunting fees for the re-employment of
laid-off workers should be reduced or canceled, the SDPC says.
</P>
<P>
Import and export fees will also be lowered to help exporters,
while the dumping of goods will be banned to create a more
favorable environment for state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To increase car sales, the country needs to take a look at fees
for automobile purchase, registration and daily use, it says.
</P>
<P>
The tourism sector, which is also plagued by unreasonable
charges, will be straightened out to make China more attractive to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
And there will be stricter checks on these areas.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Cracks Down Armed Robberies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's security authority has
taken joint operations to crack down armed robberies that hit the
capital city Kampala in the past two weeks, a report here said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the security agencies have recovered
documents detailing majority areas targeted in a wave of armed
robberies. Four sub- machine guns, three pistols and live
ammunition have been recovered in Kampala and Entebbe, a city
south of the Ugandan capital, in the joint operations in which 10
robbers have been killed and scores captured.
</P>
<P>
The operations were triggered off by the robbery of an
unspecified amount of money from the United Forex Bureau on
Kampala Road on June 26. A policeman was shot dead and a gun
taken in the incident.
</P>
<P>
A security source said the robbers' maps recovered had on major
shopping complexes, forex bureaus and entertainment centers in
Kampala, which might be their targets.

<HEADLINE> Market Analyst Predicts Better Consumer Goods Sales In Latter Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer goods sales will
be more vigourous in the latter half of the year, according to Guo
Shouzhong, of the State Administration of Internal Trade's
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the government's attempts to stimulate the
market will give it a boost in the rest of the year and that buyer
sentiment will gradually increase and reach a peak in the fourth
quarter, the second peak after the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that annual growth in the consumer
goods market will stay at around 6.6 percent this year, slightly
lower than last year's percentage and this year's 7 percent GDP
growth target.
</P>
<P>
He cited deflation as a major cause of sluggishness in the
market, but said that the state's fiscal measures have, to a
certain degree, increased demand. From January to May, retail
sales were worth more than 1.23 trillion yuan, up 6.6 percent from
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
And, with the over-supply of goods, new areas of activity will
emerge in the second half of the year, Guo said, citing electric
appliances and telecommunications products as examples. These two
categories saw a more than 30-percent growth in sales in the first
two quarters and market demand is still rising.
</P>
<P>
Because of the deepening grain distribution reforms, the price
of some agricultural products and sales have both been rising, he
said, and market demand for livestock products, pork in particular,
will also change for the better, as many farmers sell fewer pigs
and go for in-depth processing.

<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Suspected two young recruits of the
terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group Thursday killed two army troopers
guarding a school in Basilan Province in the southern Philippines,
Philippine National Police said Friday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the killers who are both students of a high
school in the town of Sumisip casually approached the two
soldiers, drew their pistols and shot the unsuspecting soldiers at
close range.
</P>
<P>
One solider was killed on-the-spot while the other was
pronounced dead on arrival at Camp Navarro Hospital, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the military has yet to identify the
suspects who might have been indoctrinated by members of the
extremist Abu Sayyaf (Bearer of the Sword) and were given a test
mission.

<P>
TOKYO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's top professional cyclist
Yuichiro Kamiyama was stripped of his silver medal won at the
Asian championships last month, after failing to a doping test,
the Japan Cycling Federation announced here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kamiyama's urine sample was found to contain traces of banned
stimulant ephedrine, when being tested by the International
Cycling Union after he finished runner-up in the men's Keirin
final at the Green Dome Maebashi.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old sprint champion from the Bangkok Asian Games
last December was summoned by the Japanese federation Friday. He
explained to the officials that he took the pills in the morning
of the race, mistaking them as vitamins.
</P>
<P>
The federation disqualified his runner-up finish at the Asian
championships and fined him 2,000 Swiss francs (1,300 U.S. dollars)
. He was also suspended for one month till August 9.
</P>
<P>
But Kamiyama, the country's top professional cyclist in the
past two years, however, can compete in domestic professional
races as the Japan Keirin Association decided not to punish him.

Zhu said he hopes that the Japanese can place great importance
on this matter, take practical and effective steps to limit the
wrongdoing and remarks of the small handful of extreme rightists
and provide a correct view of history for Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can the lessons be drawn from historical
experience to guarantee the healthy and steady development of
relations between the two nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the U.S.-Japanese security cooperation, which
involves the Chinese territory of Taiwan and the future of Japan,
has become the focus of the Chinese government's and the Chinese
people's concerns.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's principled stance on the Taiwan issue,
emphasizing that the series of solemn promises made by Japan in
the China-Japan joint statement, the China-Japan peace and
friendship treaty, and the joint declaration the two countries
made last year have served as an important political basis for
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are firmly opposed to any
direct or indirect attempt to involve Taiwan in the Japanese-U.S.
security cooperation, he said, adding that he hopes the Japanese
will not be vague about this serious matter of principle and
clearly exclude Taiwan from the Japanese-U.S. security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he has noticed Obuchi's solemn attitude and hopes that
the Japanese will always stand by their word and take practical
steps to keep their promise.

<HEADLINE> Feature: China's Steel Giant Expecting New Life on 50th Birth Anniversary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANSHAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite its past glories of
providing steel for the country's first China made automobile,
plane and nuclear bomb, the first metallurgical venture of the
Chinese Communist Party embraced its 50th birth anniversary today
without any celebrations.
</P>
<P>
However, celebrations lasted days and nights when the Anshan
Iron and Steel Complex (Angang) turned out its first converter of
steel 50 years ago. "We also held a gala at the city stadium to
celebrate the 30th birth anniversary of the plant," said 83-year-
old Leng Yuelin, a retired worker of Angang.
</P>
<P>
Like many other State enterprises emerged under the planned
economy, this first iron and steel producer of the country in
northeast China's Liaoning province is now mired in difficulties
such as inefficiency, aging equipment, and sales problems. This
year will be vital for Angang to pull out of these problems.
</P>
<P>
A view of the company presents a typical picture of the kingdom
of a Chinese State enterprise: a sprawl of factory buildings
stretching over a hundred square kilometers and a forest of
chimneys, company-run schools, hospitals and even police stations
can also be found in the factory area. The number of workers once
hit 500,000 at its prime time.
</P>
<P>
The huge population of retirees is another woe of the steel
giant, which has to take care of 100,000 such people and help
another 20,000 laid-off workers find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
"All these problems are dealt with by a social security service
in developed countries," the company president Liu Jie said.
</P>
<P>
Today is just not the right time for birthday celebrations, Liu
Jie said. "Angang is facing a problem of survival or death for the
present," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, some workers were posing for pictures before
the No. 2 blast furnace, which produced the first furnace of
melton iron 50 years ago. "We hope to remember the company's past
glories in spite of all the difficulties we are facing today,"
model worker Wang Erjiang told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"China has produced iron for over 2,000 years, and it's Angang
which helped restore the nation's former glory as an iron and
steel giant in the world," Wang said. "In the future, China will
always be in harness with our company," he added.

<P>
The company morale also received a good boost when the workers
felt their own destiny are inseparable from the company's and
their welfare depends on the welfare of the company.
</P>
<P>
With his own savings and borrowed money, veteran worker Hu
Kangzhen set up a storehouse to recall idle machine spare parts.
With the help of other workers, Hu has collected more than 3,000
such parts in his storehouse, which may be used to replace failed
parts on other machines.
</P>
<P>
"Cost reduction is vital for the company's competitiveness, as
well as for our incomes," Hu told a team of young workers visiting
his storehouse.
</P>
<P>
But the hope for Angang to restore past glories does not solely
lie in workers' disillusion about life-long employment, nicknamed
as "iron rice bowl" in China, Yang said, Angang is also building a
modern enterprise mechanism to survive market competition.
</P>
<P>
For the present, a lot of subsidiary units of Angang have
become its affiliations independent in management and finance, and
some other subsidiaries unrelated with steel production have also
disengaged from Angang. Schools and hospitals run by the company
are being handed over to the city government. It has also set up
share-holding companies to pool funds through public listing on
stock markets in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"We felt strange when we set out to do all these novel things,
but the result is promising: we are already starting to make
profit," company manager Na Jin said. "There is nothing that we
Angang people can not achieve."
</P>
<P>
In one of the factory workshops stands a three-man high open-
hearth furnace, once the biggest in the nation. This black monster-
like furnace had turned out 12 million tons of steel for the
nation, but it is now no longer in service.
</P>
<P>
Not far from the furnace, two workers are operating the
computer-controlled converter, which can produce four or five
times the steel produced by an open-hearth furnace. The old
furnace, as the witness of the ups and downs of Angang, will be
painted and become a site for visitors.
</P>
<P>
In a large scene, Angang plans to complete an unprecedentedly
massive project in technical renovations by the end of this year.
"Angang will gain a new life then when we will become equally
competitive as any other steel ventures at home or abroad,"
company engineer Yu Shujuan said.

Angang, some 700 km in northeast of Beijing, was first built in
1916, and it then fell under the colonial rule of the Japanese.
But people take July 9, 1949 as its real birthday, when Angang
resumed its production under the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Not long after it gained new life, Angang became a major
logistics supplier in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid
Korea in the early 1950s. The central government has since spared
no effort to build it into the nation's largest iron and steel
complex.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Angang was ordered to send 50,000 of its backbone
technicians to help establish major iron and steel plants in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
China is the leading steel producer in the world today with an
annual output of more than 100 million tons, 700 times the figure
half a century ago. Angang now produces more than 20,000 tons of
steel a daily.
</P>
<P>
But problems also arose as a result of its prestigious status.
"As the largest iron and steel producer of China, Angang had got
used to producing iron and steel on government orders," deputy
secretary of the company's Party Committee Yang Baoxing said, "
Many people could not believe the fact that the State stopped
purchasing and buying its products in 1995," he added.
</P>
<P>
In spite of its reluctance, Angang departed the haven of
planned economy in the end, and became the last state-owned large
iron and steel producer to step into market. "This indicated China
's determination to adhere to socialist market economy," company
official Ma Enqing said.
</P>
<P>
Ma is leaving for Beijing today to market company products. "
There was no need for us to think about market in the past, but
marketing has become a top priority for us nowadays," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The company even initiated heated discussions among its workers
about the marketability of its products when one of China's
largest automobile manufacturers declared to stop placing orders
for steel products from Angang because of its poor service.
</P>
<P>
Slogans saying "Client is God" are a common scene in Angang
today, and any worker who is seen to cold-shoulder clients will
have to make a self-criticism or may even be fired.
</P>
<P>
"Steel output is no longer our goal. We regard product quality,
work efficiency and service as our top priorities," Yang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Two armed bandits brandishing AK-47
rifles staged a dramatic robbery Thursday at a five-star hotel in
Zambian capital Lusaka in broad daylight and got away with about
70 million kwacha (about 28,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The gunmen clad in jeans and T-shirts waylaid a cashier who
had just returned from withdrawing the cash for the salaries of
the hotel staff from a bank at about 14:00 hours at the hotel's
entrance, Times of Zambia reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bandits grabbed the cash box from the cashier before
speeding off in a car.
</P>
<P>
Hotel workers scampered in all directions right afterwards.
</P>
<P>
According to another local newspaper, The Post, police officers
have been placed at all filling stations here with effect from
Thursday to prevent possible robberies because of the expected
huge cash-collections during the critical fuel shortage period.
</P>
<P>
As the petrol shortage is biting the country, the fuel prices
rose by 12. 8 percent from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Armed robberies have been on the rise in the southern African
country.

The two said that China's accession is in the common interest
of China and Japan and also in the interest of all WTO members.
They agreed to continue their close cooperation in the group talks
in Geneva to reach the goal of China's entry into the WTO as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the belief that the conclusion of the talks
on China's WTO accession between China and Japan will further
strengthen the bilateral long-term, stable trade and economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
The talks on China's entry into the WTO between China and the
United States came to a standstill following the U.S.-led NATO
attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 8.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said earlier that China
hasn't changed its stand, viewpoint, or attitude on its accession
to the WTO. But, he said, now is not the proper time to resume the
WTO talks with either the United States or the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO missile attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade damaged the good negotiation atmosphere, he said, and it
is only when NATO has given a response that China is satisfied
with and the good atmosphere reinstated that the talks can resume.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- More foreign-funded
enterprises have increased their investment in north China's Hebei
Province after achieving initial good economic returns and thanks
to the province's improving investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the provincial foreign investment bureau
show that 11 of the 23 world famous transnational corporations
already in the province, including Siemens, Mitsubishi, Hoechst

The bulk of increased funds was reportedly invested in the iron,
steel, chemicals and electronics sectors.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has approved a total of 5,120 foreign-invested
enterprises with gross investment reaching 7.23 billion dollars
since it began introducing foreign funds in the mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1999, the industrial and agricultural

<HEADLINE> Asia Says to Boycott 2002 World Cup Qualifiers (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Asia said on Thursday it would
boycott the qualifying competition for soccer's 2002 World Cup
because it had not been given enough berths by the world governing
body FIFA, according to reports from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after an emergency meeting of Asian
delegates attending Friday's 203-nation FIFA congress in Los
Angeles said that Asia had no choice but to give up its two
existing qualifying positions and go into the tournament solely
with Japan and South Korea, the joint hosts and automatic
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
"Since FIFA has not acceded to Asia's request for an extra
qualifying position, it is compelled to boycott the qualifying
tournament," said the statement issued by the Asian Football
Confederation (AFC).
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision of great gravity for world football and for
Mr. (FIFA President Sepp) Blatter, but our members have shown
great solidarity," Malaysian Peter Velappan, AFC's general
secretary, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"No one should mess about with Asia. All of this has been
totally ignored and (World Cup) seats given away to those who don'
t deserve them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a full extraordinary meeting of the Asian
congress would take place as soon as possible to endorse the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Asia originally wanted a full extra qualifying spot at the
World Cup. Instead, FIFA granted on Tuesday only half a place,
which was given up by European soccer's' governing body UEFA.
</P>
<P>
Asia had earlier raised the boycott threat because of the
matter. And Velappan indicated that Asia might change its mind if
FIFA reconsidered the allocation of berths, the reports said.

SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China would like to share
research data and the results of its first government-sponsored
North Pole expedition with the world to increase international
cooperation in Arctic Research.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi, the chief scientist of Chinese research expedition
said today from aboard the Snow Dragon, which is nearing the
Arctic Ocean, that the study of global environmental changes can
not be done by one country but requires the joint effort of the
whole world.

<P>
China has joined the International Arctic Science Committee and
would like to make its contribution to Arctic research, said Chen,
who is also in charge of the polar research office of China's
State Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
According to him, first-hand data is very important in
geoscience research but much data on the polar regions has been

</P>
<P>
But countries have begun to be more open with their data
because of improvements in the international cooperation
atmosphere in recent years and this may produce better results
with less cost, Chen said, pointing to the assistance he and his
team have got from Canada, the United States, and other countries
in this year's research.

Two pieces of Chinese pottery in Latham's office illustrate his
belief. Jingdezhen pottery can be found in the markets in the
Middle East or on shipwrecks in the Philippines. It is trade that
links different countries, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Chinese pottery made Jingdezhen, a small obscure city in
Jiangxi Province, famous. But, it is no longer the only thing that
links Jingdezhen with the rest of the world. Latham's company has
more than 20 joint ventures in China and one is in that city.
</P>
<P>
The company's president, George David, told the Congress that
in the past two decades, China has gone from a closed economy to
an open-trade one and its trade as a percentage of GDP exceeds
that of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Latham said that his company believes that China is, "every day,
every week, every year," making progress towards establishing an
economy based on market forces and on clear laws and transparency,
so there are reasons for continuing to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
He said China's strongest friends in the U.S. are American
companies, not because of the money involved -- not all companies
are profitable -- but because of that relations between countries
are always based on trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will seek to
attract potential partners to assist with petroleum prospecting.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Energy Minister Chris Okemo made the remarks Thursday
when addressing the launch of the Petroleum Institute of East
Africa in capital Nairobi, the East African Standard newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Okemo said a lot of data had been collected and his government
had compiled documents to be used to attract interested partners.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the Kenyan government has so far spent 10
billion shillings (about 169 million U.S. dollars) in the
exploration of oil and gas over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The ministry once said an area of about 300,000 square
kilometers in the country is considered suitable for oil and gas
exploration.
</P>
<P>
Okemo also urged oil industry players in the country to make
contributions to the proposed environment protection bill.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established institute should actively participate on
the National Spill Response Committee to ensure Kenya can
effectively handle disasters and prevent serious environmental
damage and loss of life and property, the minister added.

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned enterprises
paid 25.3 billion yuan (about three billion U.S. dollars) in
income taxes from January to May, a 38-percent increase over the
same 1998 period, the State Tax Administration reports.
</P>
<P>
Many state enterprises has been losing less money since the
beginning of the year, and their better performance has allowed
them to pay more taxes, according to the administration.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the increase in state revenues to the change
of tax collection from the Finance Ministry to the State
Administration of Taxation last year.
</P>
<P>
They predict that revenues from state enterprise will continue
to grow in the second half of this year, in spite of their other

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Ethiopia
has announced that a sum of 879 million U.S. dollars had been
earned in foreign currency during the just-ended 1998/99 fiscal
year ending on July 7.
</P>
<P>
Bank Governor Tekle-Wold Atnafu said the amount, earned from
foreign trade, foreign loans and private dealings, will make
substantial contributions to improve the country's foreign
currency reserve, the state-run Ethiopian Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This year's earning shows an increase of 72 million U.S.
dollars over that of the previous 1997/98 year, said Tekle-Wold.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the amount earned from foreign trade was 499.8
million U.S. dollars, the governor said this represented a fall of
17 percent from that of the previous year resulting from a decline
in coffee prices on the world market and reduced earnings from
hides and skin sector due to the financial crisis in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,448.5 million dollars had been disbursed for the
importation of goods during the 1998/99 year, which represented an
increase of 47 million dollars over the previous year, added the
governor.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Gov't Considers Food Security Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
considering some food security strategies to do away with
continued dependence on the food import, the Daily Star newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The strategies include keeping the public sector food reserve
at one million tons at the minimum always and providing the
vulnerable section of the rural poor with free food for at least
two months during the lean period of the year when there are
lesser job opportunities in the countryside, official sources were
quoted as stating.
</P>
<P>
The government is not in favor of getting food aid in terms of
cash as is being considered by European donors, they said.
</P>
<P>
As the issue of food security surfaced as a major challenge
amidst mounting pressure on the public exchequer to meet the huge
food import bill, the government had to borrow 338 million U.S.
dollars from the International Monetary Fund and the International
Development Association to meet the food import bill of 733
million dollars in the 1998-99 fiscal year, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Against a target of 350,000 tons of food import by the public
sector from the government's own resources, it had to import one
million tons due to the loss of rice crop in the last year's
severe flood. So the government had to borrow to meet the
additional cost for food import.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year, food imports in the private sector
totaled over one million tons, while in 1998-99 fiscal year, the
imports crossed three million tons.
</P>
<P>
"It is not sufficient to raise production of food in the
country, it is essential to strengthen the food security system,"
Finance Minister S.A.M.S Kabria pointed out while presenting the
national budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year in the parliament on
June 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh would chart out its own national food security
strategy, according to the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 128 million, this agriculture-based South
Asian country's annual needs of food grains is over 21 million
tons.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Introduce 4-stroke 3-wheelers This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- With the increase in supplementary
duty on two-stroke "baby taxis" (three-wheeled motorized vehicle),
the capital city of this South Asian nation will soon have cleaner
four-stroke three-wheelers, The Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's main importer of three-wheelers, Menoka Motors,
will import a first batch of four-stroke three-wheelers, a most
popular means of transport here, by December.
</P>
<P>
"We will first bring a test consignment of 25 taxis... In
March (next year) we will start commercial import," said Kazi
Imdad Hossain, executive director of Menoka Motors. The
newly-imposed supplementary duty on two-stroke engines in the
current fiscal year beginning July 1 has made the import of
four-stroke engines viable, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The new duty structure has discouraged us from importing those
(two-stroke engines)," said Hossain.
</P>
<P>
In the budget the parliament passed at the end of last month,
the supplementary duty on two-stroke engines, regarded as the
major air polluter in the city, has been increased from 50 percent
to 100 percent, raising the price of a two-stroke baby taxi to
135,000 taka (2,783 U.S. dollars) from 115,500 taka (2,381
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Four-stroke engines are exempted from any supplementary duty.
Uttara Motors, another importer of three-wheelers, hopes to market
the four-stroke petrol three-wheelers at a price of 140,000 taka
(2,887 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000 two-stroke baby taxis are plying the roads in
Dhaka, emitting exhaust of petrol and unburned lubricant which is
hazardous for health. Some 1 million people commute daily on these
three-wheelers.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb the growing air pollution in the capital city,
home for some 9 million residents, the government banned import of
two-stroke baby taxis, mostly from India, last year but later
withdrew the order in the face of agitation by their owners.
</P>
<P>
The existing two-stroke taxis will take eight to 10 years to be
completely phased out, and till then, they will continue to
pollute the air and the environment, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Phase Out Troops from S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to phase out its troops in
Sierra Leone with the progress of the implementation of a peace
accord signed Wednesday, an aide to Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo said in Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Doyin Okupe, a press assistant to the president, told a news
briefing in the capital that Nigeria will "begin to put in place
a process of gradual and phased withdrawal of Nigerian troops from
Sierra Leone aligned with the stage by stage developmental
progress of the Lome peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
"This action will be in keeping with the electioneering
promises of President Obasanjo to get Nigerian troops back home at
the soonest possible time, without jeopardy to the peace process,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops form the backbone of the more than
12,000-strong west Africa peace-keeping force ECOMOG which first
intervened in Sierra Leone in 1997 to reinstate President Tajen
Kabbah after he was overthrown by his army.
</P>
<P>
But peace-keeping efforts in Sierra Leone has proved to be too
costly, especially at a time when Nigeria's own economy is
tottering.
</P>
<P>
The peace efforts have cost Nigeria hundreds of lives so far
and reportedly one million U.S. dollars a day, according to
Nigerian newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
A peace deal was signed in Togo's capital Lome Wednesday
between Sierra Leonean President Kabbah and rebel leader Foday
Sankoh, with several west African presidents including Obasanjo as
the co-signers.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Safe for Visitors: Tourist Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- All tourists and other visitors are
assured that it is safe and secure when they visit Kenya and the
capital Nairobi, the Kenya Tourist Board said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tourists and visitors to the country "should feel free to come
and enjoy the cool July and August temperatures," the board said
in a statement issued after the privately-owned public vehicles
known as "matatu" strike Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the strike entered its second day, the board said, Kenyan
capital Nairobi was calm and that people were going about their
businesses as usual.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the strike will go on is unclear, what is clear,
however, is that Nairobi is safe and Kenya is safe." the board
said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the strike was only affecting commuters who have
to make use of matatus or mini-buses as means of public transport
and did not affect visitors to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The board also mentioned that visitors from most countries of
the world do not need visas if they are coming for less than 30
days, saying that those tourists already in Kenya are encouraged
to relax and enjoy their holidays.
</P>
<P>
Matatus went on strike Wednesday in protest against the
introduction of the new regulations by the Transport Licensing
Board aiming at streamlining the matatu industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strikers, mainly touts, attempted to disrupt the smooth
flow of traffic by burning tires in the middle of some roads
leading to the cities, including capital Nairobi and Nakuru, the
country's third largest city in the central region.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, the matatu touts are to be
replaced by civic council workers at bus terminuses while matatu
drivers and conductors should wear identification badges, all
matatus are to be licensed by the board and matatu routes are to
be re-allocated.

Another way to promote the equitization process, Gia said, was
to lift the limit on the number of shares that can be bought by
domestic buyers.
</P>
<P>
He said that a government meeting in Hanoi last Monday and
Tuesday, held to review operations and look at the remainder of
the year, concurred that the first six months had met with
difficulties which saw higher unemployment, a decline of incomes
in certain business sectors, particularly in rural and flood and
drought-stricken areas, and an increase in social evils in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
These factors combined to cause concern among the population
and minimize economic growth rates.
</P>
<P>
"The government recognizes the need to devise contingencies in
case of harder times ahead," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government also decided to release extra
budgetary investment to accelerate ongoing construction of
development projects and more bank loans to farmers to increase
rural purchasing power for the remainder of the year.

<HEADLINE> Zhu and Obuchi Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua)-- The ongoing visit to China by
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is of great importance,
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the official talks with Obuchi, Zhu said he
and his Japanese counterpart had had a frank and in-depth exchange
of views on some important issues during a closed-door session.
</P>
<P>
This has helped increase mutual understanding and expand
common grounds, and served to push the bilateral political
relations onto a right and healthy track, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during President Jiang Zemin's 1998 visit to
Japan, both sides, in the spirit of taking history as a lesson and
facing the future, promised to collaborate in efforts to set up
the friendly and cooperative partnership which is devoted to peace
and development and oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This had set the guidelines for the cross-century relationship
between the two countries, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier noted that the two sides had also made an
overall plan for bilateral cooperation in various fields in the
form of a joint press communique.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he is glad to see the results are being
implemented through joint efforts and have scored periodical
achievements.
</P>
<P>
It is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples to
continue to consolidate the political foundation of the Sino-
Japanese relations, and to further promote and carry out solid
cooperation in various sectors, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister said that it is of great
significance to visit a country like China when it is celebrating
its 50th anniversary of founding at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Zhu presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of Obuchi.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Seafood Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam earned 410.3 million U.S.
dollars from exports of seafood in the first half of this year,
registering a year-on-year increase of eight percent, according to
a report of Vietnam's official news agency VNA.
</P>
<P>
Localities attaining high export value included Vietnam's
southern provinces of Ca Mau (61.82 million dollars), Soc Trang
(54 million dollars), Can Tho (35 million dollars), Ho Chi Minh
City (33 million dollars), Bac Lieu (26 million dollars), and
Khanh Hoa (24.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has made great efforts to boost seafood export. The
Ministry of Fisheries held a conference on seafood quality early
this year and created favorable conditions for enterprises to
participate in international fisheries fairs in Boston and
Brussels in March and April respectively. The ministry also
organized a fisheries fair in Ho Chi Minh City in February to
create opportunity for domestic and foreign businesses to seek
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure of Vietnam's seafood-export turnover in the
first half of the year represented only 43 percent of this year's
fisheries plan.
</P>
<P>
High cost of materials (marine products) and low
competitiveness of exports in the world market, strict quality
requirements of the EU countries and limited capability in
processing high-quality products are reasons behind the low
accomplishment of the yearly plan.

</P>
<P>
In bank-raised foreign funds in Brazil, the share of foreign

<HEADLINE> Ancient Rhinoceros Fossil on Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The fossil skeleton of a rhinoceros
dating back 3 million years ago was recently restored and shown in
public in Xunyi County of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first integrated rhinoceros fossil ever assembled
in the world," said Xue Xiangxi, a Chinese archaeologist who heads
the effort to assemble the skeleton.
</P>
<P>
Also on display was a sabre-tooth elephant fossil assembled
earlier. The elephant is 8.45 meters long and 4.3 meters high. Its
front teeth had a length of 3.17 meters.
</P>
<P>
The rhinoceros skeleton is 4.8 meters long and 3.1 meters high.
It was composed of 62 fossils which were linked up with armor
plates and iron bars.
</P>
<P>
Restoration of the rhinoceros fossil is of great value to the
study of ancient geology, physiognomy and climate of Loess Plateau
and to the evolution of living things in ancient times in the
middle reaches of Yellow River, said Guan Jian, a research fellow
of the Beijing Nature Museum.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is a rare sample for disseminating popular science,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Reports Big Increases in Tax Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen City of south China's
Guangdong Province collected a total of 6.82 billion yuan in local
tax revenues in the first six months of the year, up 14.9 percent
from the same period last year, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city also collected 12.1 billion yuan in
state tax revenues from January to June, up 10.6 percent from the
first six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Of the total state tax revenues, 10.78 billion yuan went to
the state coffers. The Shenzhen State Taxation Bureau also paid
the city's foreign trade companies 420 million yuan in tax rebates.
</P>
<P>
Local taxation officials attributed the big increases to rapid
expansion of the city's electronics and information, commerce,
power sectors, big increases in stamp taxes of active securities
transactions in the wake of a bullish bourse, and a sharp increase
in import tariffs recovered from crackdowns on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Local taxation departments have also made efforts to improve
service to facilitate tax payers.
</P>
<P>
China started to introduce a tax sharing system between the
Central Government and governments at local levels beginning in
1994 by setting up two taxation bodies -- the State taxation
bureaus and local taxation bureaus.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Allow Logging for Wood-Based Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities will allow
both local citizens and foreigners to fell trees required for
establishing wood-based industries for the production and export
of value-added wood products, according to a notice of the
state-run Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Logging for a minimum of 20 years is guaranteed in Dawei, Myeik
and Kawthoung areas and adjacent islands in the southern coastal
Tanintharyi division, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
The notice urged entrepreneurs to take special care in the
extraction to avoid depletion of the resources and adverse effect
on the environment of the islands and the region.
</P>
<P>
However, clear felling will not be allowed, it said, adding
that only those logs meeting the girth limits set by the Forest
Department can be felled.
</P>
<P>
The MTE has been cooperating with local and foreign firms to
establish wood-based industries in the country. So far, seven
foreign firms from China, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Norway
and Thailand have reached agreements with the MTE, setting up
plywood, molding and furniture factories in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The MTE is the sole organization allowed to extract timber out
of forests in the country and it undertakes logging,
transportation, milling, processing, distribution of products
within the country, and exportation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar restricts export of logs and bans the private sector
from exporting teak logs after the enactment of the country's
Forest Law in 1992. However, export of value-added wood products
is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar exported 133,717 cubic meters of teak and 235,739 cubic
meters of hardwood in 1998, through which a total of 123.6 million
U.S. dollars of foreign exchange earning was obtained, according
to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources with forest covering 50
percent of its land area.

<HEADLINE> Asia Delegated May Walk Out of FIFA Congress: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Asian countries may walk out of
Friday's congress of soccer's world governing body FIFA in Los
Angeles, in protest over the allocation of berths in the 2002
World Cup's qualifying tournament, their leader said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision of great gravity for world football and
for Mr. (FIFA President Sepp) Blatter, but our members have shown
great solidarity," said Malaysian Peter Velappan, general
secretary of the Asian Football Confederation, was quoted by
Reuters news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"No one should mess about with Asia. All of this has been
totally ignored and (World Cup) seats given away to those who don'
t deserve them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asia had earlier threatened to boycott the qualifying
tournament for the 2002 World Cup because FIFA had not been given
them enough berths.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after an emergency meeting of Asian
delegates attending Friday's FIFA congress in Los Angeles said
that Asia had no choice but to give up its two existing qualifying
positions and go into the tournament solely with Japan and South
Korea, the co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup finals and thus
automatic qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Velappan, however, indicated that Asia might change its mind
on the boycott if FIFA reconsidered the allocation of berths, the
reports said.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Exports More Bicycles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
exported 4.73 million bicycles in the first five months of the
year, earning 188 million U.S. dollars, up 26 percent and nine
percent respectively from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as "kingdom of bicycles", China enjoys the reputation in
producing qualtiy bicycles.
</P>
<P>
But the country suffered setbacks in the export of bicycles
since the later half of 1997 due to the adverse impact of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong exported 8.65 million bicycles in 1998, with the
monthly export figure standing at 500,000 bicycles in the later
half of the past year.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts predict that in the later half of this year,
the province's export will continue to rise thanks to the improved
macro external environment.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China has also raised tax rebate rate for
export of bicycles from 11 percent to 17 percent since January of
this year and the move has been proved good.

GENEVA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Marcelo Rios, who
returned to the tennis court from a five-week injury lay-off,
conceeded 7-6, 7-6 to Morocco's Younes El Aynaoui in the second
round of the Swiss Open in Gstaad, Switzerland, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean's departure combined with earlier exits by top seed
Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, number two Alex Corretja of Spain and
number four Greg Rusedski of Britain, left Spain's Felix Mantilla
as the highest remaining seed.
</P>
<P>
Mantilla, the fifth seed and 1997 Swiss champion, entered the
quarter-finals with a 6-2, 6-0 victory over another Moroccan
Hicham Arazi.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Mariano Zabaleta of Argentina also joined the
exodus of seeds, falling 6-7, 7-6, 6-3 to Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi.
</P>
<P>
Playing in his first tournament since a quarter-final loss to
Dominik Hrbaty at the French Open, Rios showed plenty of
determination against El Aynaoui but his game lacked the sharpness
that helped him to titles in Hamburg and St Poelten earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
El Aynaoui will face sixth seed Francisco Clavet of Spain, who
beat American qualifier Don Johnson, ranked 522 in the world, 6-4

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Program to Boost Power Generation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a program to
invest 175 billion rupees (2.5 billion U.S. dollars) to step up
power generation within the next seven years to keep pace with the
growing demand for electricity, said a Electricity Board spokesman
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demand for electricity has been increasing at an annual
rate of 10 percent since 1990 and the demand is expected to grow
at about the same rate during the next few years, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said about 160,000 new consumers are connected to
the existing electricity distribution network every year while the
demand for more power by existing consumers is also rising.
</P>
<P>
The country's electricity generating system comprising 1,135
megawatt hydro electric power and 478 megawatt thermal power can
provide electricity needs to about 4,800 gigawatt hours.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a 40 megawatt thermal power plant is
proposed to be built at Sapugaskanda in the suburbs of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The Kelanitissa thermal power plant in Colombo will be boosted
by a 150 megawatt Combined Cycle Plant at a cost of 1,850 million
rupees (26.4 million dollars) funded by the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Work has also begun on a 15 billion rupees (214 million
dollars) hydro power station with a capacity of 70 megawatts at
Kukule Ganga.
</P>
<P>
The West Coast Coal Fired Power plant at Kalpitiya, Puttalam in
northwestern Sri Lanka, will come on line also with funds from the
OECF of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, plans are under way to commence village and
estate hydro electricity programs to meet the increasing demand
for power.
</P>
<P>
Only 52 percent of Sri Lanka's households now have access to
electricity. The Sri Lankan government has decided to observe
1999-2009 as a decade of power development in a bid to provide
every household with electricity.

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua)-- A ferocious forest fire has been put
out in the Greater Hinggan Mountains in North China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Controls Pests with Ecological Means </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Every morning this summer, the first
thing Yasen Tohuti, a cotton grower in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, did was to pick up the poplar branches he
put in his cotton field the day before and shook off dead
bollworms from the poplar branch leaves.
</P>
<P>
"I had to deal with these insects with the unique method
because the more they nibble the less I earn," said Yasen, a 36-
year-old farmer of Uygur Nationality.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the several non-chemical methods the local
farmers use to prevent and control pests and is being popularized
in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
As the largest cotton producer in China, Xinjiang grows cotton
on 980,000 hectares of land, which yield an annual output of 1.3
million tons, making up one third of the nation's total. Nearly
one third of local farmers' annual income comes from cotton
production.
</P>
<P>
At present, the majority of cotton growers in Xinjiang would
like to control pests with non-toxic or biological means. Some put
up light bulbs in their cotton fields as they know bollworm loves
to swirl around lights. When the bollworms touched the metal wires
twined on the bulbs, they will get an electric shock and die.
</P>
<P>
As aphids is attracted to yellow color, farmers hang up plates
brushed with yellow paint in the fields. When the worms touch the
plates, they would get stuck on the plates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers keep insects out of the cotton fields by
inter-planting crops to create natural enemy of the insects. They
also dig up soil and use water irrigation method to drown insects.
</P>
<P>
"These measures cause no pollution and are good for the
ecological environment," said Zhong Yanlong, an agricultural
specialist.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists speak highly of the insect-control method by
ecological means. They said cotton fields account for one seventh
of the oases on the vast desert in Xinjiang. The new method is of
vital importance to controlling desert encroachment in the region.

<P>
MANAGUA, July 8 (Xinhua)-- Nicaragua earned last year 200
million dollars from foreign remittance inflows, rather than 800
million dollars announced by the Economic Commission for Latin
America (CEPAL), said Central Bank President Noe Ramirez on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez noted that 60 percent of the remittances came from the
United States and 40 percent Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The president described the remittances as a "blessing" for the
country as they went to the poorest of the society, relieving the
government from the burden of social spending.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 450,000 Nicaraguans living in the
United States and 300,000 in Costa Rica, Nicaraguan authorities
said.

<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- English premier league football club
Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has targeted Arsenal midfielder
Stephen Hughes as a possible replacement for Paul Ince.
</P>
<P>
Hughes has struggled to find a regular first-team place at
Highbury, and Houllier has confirmed his interest in the England
Under-21 international.
</P>
<P>
"He is a player I like," said the Liverpool manager. "We may
need a player to fill Paul Ince's position, though I am not saying
we are definitely going to do that. But obviously Paul won't be a
member of the Liverpool squad next season."
</P>
<P>
Houllier's interest in the 3.5 million pound-rated Hughes may
have been intensified by the failure to sign Marc-Vivien Foe from
West Ham after transfer talks broke down over his personal terms.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's gross domestic product
(GDP) will increase by 3 percent in 1999, analysts of the

</P>
<P>
The experts said the figures was obtained from the encouraging
growth of the macro-economy in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
They said Mexico's economy will surge more rapidly due to the
sound economic situation in the United States, which will permit
more Mexican exports to its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, Mexico's exports rose 10 percent,
especially in the manufacturing section.
</P>
<P>
Investment will also remain dynamic in the second half of the
year and surge by 6.2 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the annual inflation rate will reach 14 percent, they
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Local Banks Lose 24.4B Dollars in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's locally incorporated
banks suffered net losses totaling 166.4 trillion rupiah (24.4
billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, compared with the 2.3 trillion
rupiah net income in 1997, according to the latest issue of
monthly magazine Info Bank.
</P>
<P>
The magazine's managing editor Eko B. Supriyanto said that the
figures were based on the 1998 financial reports published by the
banks.
</P>
<P>
As many as 168 banks were included in the magazine's report,
but only 158 of them were assessed because the other 10 banks did
not publish balance sheets for the period.
</P>
<P>
The above figure would increase by about 50 trillion rupiah to
216 trillion rupiah (30.8 billion dollars) in net losses if it
included also the losses suffered by these 10 banks, Supriyanto
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 10 banks include the four state Banks (Bank Bapindo, Bank
Bumi Daya, Bank Exim and Bank Dagang Negara) now in the process of
being merged into newly established Bank Mandiri.
</P>
<P>
The remaining six banks are three provincial banks and three
private banks.
</P>
<P>
The magazine also said the other three state banks, namely,
Bank Negara Indonesia, Bank Rakyat Indonesia and Bank Tabungan
Negara contributed a total of 84.4 trillion rupiah (12 billion
dollars) to the figure.
</P>
<P>
"State banks are definitely the major contributors to the big
total net loss figure of the 168 national banks," Supriyanto said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Mayon Volcano Shows Weak Steaming Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Mayon Volcano has shown weak
steaming activity for the past 24 hours and seismic stations have
registered four high frequency volcanic earthquakes during the
period, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(Phivolcs) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the Phivolcs said that its
experts recorded an emission rate of about 2,800 tons of sulfur
dioxide Thursday and a slight inflation in the southeast slope of
the volcano.
</P>
<P>
The volcano's overall condition stays at Alert Level 2, which
means the public should not venture inside the delineated
six-kilometer radius permanent danger zone and the seven-kilometer
safety buffer zone in the southeast sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
The institute said residents near the volcano's slopes should
be aware that gullies radiating out of Mayon, which is about 330
kilometers southeast of Manila, can easily serve as conduits for
loose volcanic debris that may be transported downslope.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs has noted since May 13 the ongoing activity of the
volcano, which is characterized by intermittent crater glow at the
summit area and a slight increase in sulfur dioxide emission.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, Mayon's mild eruption rained ash over surrounding
towns of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Mayon's last major eruption on February 2, 1993 killed 78
people and affected 17,119 persons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Forestry Ministry Acts Against Soeharto Family's Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Forestry and
Agriculture Ministry has taken actions against companies involved
in corruptive, collusive and nepotist (KKN) practices, including
those belonging to the family and cronies of former president
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Forestry and Plantations Muslimin Nasution said
Thursday that eight forest concessions totaling 1.17 million
hectares owned jointly by Soeharto's children and their business
associates were revoked because they were allegedly granted
through KKN.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen other forest concessions covering 1.36 million
hectares will not be renewed when they expire next March.
</P>
<P>
"These measures were based on the findings of joint audits and
comprehensive due diligence by the Government Finance Comptroller
and (foreign auditor) Ernst and Young Auditors," Muslimin was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the audits and investigations of forest concessions and
plantation licenses were part of the national drive against KKN
headed by Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision and
State Administrative Reforms Hartarto Sastrosoenarto.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus now is safeguarding state assets," he said, adding
that further investigations into the concessions would be
conducted for the purpose of possible criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that all the concessions and licenses
obtained by the Soehartos and their business associates appeared
to be technically legal because regulations during the Soeharto
regime were designed to legalize such practices.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the forest concessions had been obtained
through KKN as defined by Hartarto on the basis of President B.J.
Habibie's directives.

<HEADLINE> Three More Arrested for Faulty Expressway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Three project officials have been
arrested in central China's Henan province for severe dereliction
of duty which has resulted in a shoddy expressway culvert.
</P>
<P>
The three officials are project engineer Li Pengying, assistant
project supervisor Shi Haicheng and project supervising engineer
Guo Jinxing.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, the police have apprehended three project
contractors who are directly responsible for the building of the
faulty culvert.
</P>
<P>
The provincial transport authorities received a report about
the shoddy culvert and discovered severe quality problems with the
expressway culvert, which was filled with rocks and bags of cement
instead of concrete.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has ordered the culvert be demolished
and reconstructed, and called up leading officials from ten other
key transportation projects to the site to learn a lesson from it.
</P>
<P>
China has increased quality inspections about engineering
projects nationwide since an improperly-built bridge collapsed in
the southwestern city of Chongqing earlier this year, killing 40.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that the culvert project has been illegally
sub-contracted and the individual contractor used stone instead of
concrete to fill the culvert.
</P>
<P>
Due to severe dereliction of duty, the three project
supervisors failed to discover quality problems with the culvert
and resulted in an economic loss of 340,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Luosan expressway, extending 135 kilometers to link Luoyang
and Sanmenxia city, is listed as a key State project. Construction
of the 4.3-billion-yuan expressway started in early 1998 and is
expected to complete in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Set Up 150 Computer Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
launched a program to set up at least 150 computer centers
islandwide by year 2000 to offer 150,000 school leavers and young
job aspirants an opportunity to acquire competency in computer
science, media sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Richard Pathirana was quoted as saying that
the entire project will cost 450 million rupees (6.34 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The centers which will be equipped with the latest facilities
will be designed to accommodate 1,000 students each.
</P>
<P>
Already fifty centers have been set up by the ministry and
45,000 young people have completed their one-year training course.
Over 100 such centers will be set up by the end of this year for a
student intake of 125,000 per year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The project has been launched as school children find it
difficult to gain computer literacy, vital for employment, during
school days due to limited opportunity, lack of time and
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The computer center program was launched by the Sri Lankan
government in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Inspection Shows Home-made Air-Conditioners in Good Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent spot-check, conducted by
the State Quality and Technical Supervision Administration,
indicates that the quality of all the inspected air-conditioners
has reached the state quality standards.
</P>
<P>
The products were collected from 20 air-conditioner
manufacturers in eight provinces and municipalities including
Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Air-conditioners from these enterprises make up 80 percent of
the Chinese market, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at a larger share of the rich air-conditioner market in
China, the enterprises have invested heavily to strengthen quality
control and develop new functions to cater to varying requirements
from consumers, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Besides bringing down room temperatures during the sweltering
summer, some air conditioners can also filter the air in the house
and improve ventilation, to make staying indoors more comfortable
for residents.
</P>
<P>
However, compared to the enhanced performance of the air-
conditioners, the after-sales services provided by the air-
conditioner manufacturers remain far from satisfactory.

more fresh vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
A lack of physical exercise and the intake of too much fatty
food may account for the large increase in breast and colon
cancers, while pollution, radiation, excessive drinking, and
certain medicines may also be a cause.
</P>
<P>
However, one study found the surprising fact that more women
who are not smokers suffer or die from lung cancer, something that
scientists say could be caused by too much cooking with coal or
natural gas and frying too much food.
</P>
<P>
Cooking with coal for more than 15 years has been found to
increase cancer incidence by 125 percent, while women with shorter
menstrual cycles have been found to be more likely to have lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The greater intake of fresh vegetables and fruits and the
elimination of pollutants in the house can reduce the death rate
of lung cancer, scientists suggest, and an improved diet, more
physical exercise, and the prevention of obesity can reduce the
cancer rate by some 30 to 40 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Yuan Hua took the
first judo title when she triumphed in the women's over 78-kg
category of the judo competitions which started here Thursday
afternoon at the 20th World University Games.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Chinese judoka defeated Russian T. Dongouzachvi
by "ippon" as the four-minute final clicked towards its ending at
the Principes de Espana, with the bronze medals even split by
Cuban Beltran Daima and Japanese Shintani Midori.
</P>
<P>
"I cared nothing of defense as I took the initiatives
throughout the final," said Yuan Hua, who started her training at
the age of 15 and won her her debutant title in the world junior
championship in 1992 in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"The gold medal is surely within my expectation because I beat
her in the world military championships last August in St.
Petersburg," said the native of Liaoning province and Asian Games
champion last December in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"I have my advantages of quick moves despite a little bit
shorter than the Russian," explained the Chinese who ranked third
in the 1997 world championships.
</P>
<P>
En route to her victory, Yuan Hua floored her three previous
opponents -- Briton Callende Simone, Dutch Harte Francoise and
South Korean Lee Hyung-kyung -- all by ippon within one minute.
</P>
<P>
"She has displayed her level of competitiveness as she prepares
well for the Universiade despite an injury to her left knee
suffered some 20 days ago," said Chinese coach Fu Guoyi.
</P>
<P>
Of the three other titles taken away on Thursday, Frenchwoman
Lebrun Celine outpowered Romanian Richter Simona in the women's 78-
kg category with the bronze medal being shared by Spanish San
Miguel Esther and Japanese Matsuzaki Mizuho.

SAN JOSE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua has accepted an apology
from the Costa Rican Foreign Ministry over its imprudent remarks
about Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman, easing days of tension
between the two neighboring countries, Costa Rican daily La Nacion
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Problems cannot and should not obstruct the fraternity that
has always prevailed between our two brotherly countries," Aleman
told La Nacion correspondents during a tour in the border area
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Nicaragua protested against a statement by Costa
Rican Foreign Minister Juan Rafael Lizano who said President
Aleman had threatened to shoot any armed Costa Rican police agent
traveling along the border river of San Juan.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican Foreign Ministry made an apology on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
La Nacion daily quoted Aleman as advising officials of both
countries to "avoid making ill-considered remarks which are good
only for creating unnecessary conflicts."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Spikers Make Semi-final in Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese spikers initiated
the quarter-finals of the women's volleyball tournament by beating
their Thai peers 3-1, booking the first semi-final berth at the
20th World University Games here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Despite its lack of systematic training due to an assembly in a
hurry for the Games, the Chinese established a 18-12 lead before
taking the first set 25-23 in 20 minutes in front of dozens of
spectators.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the second set witnessed a see-saw battle until setter
Feng Kun was fielded in to pull the Chinese ahead with five
straight points from 11-12 to 16-12 and sealed the set 25-16 for a
comfortable 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
In the third set, the Thais exerted every effort to rally from
a four-point deficit at 7-11 to a 26-all tie, before taking the
heated set 28-26 in their favor.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese rushed ahead from 7-all in the decisive fourth set
to 19-11 before sealing the competitions 25-17.
</P>
<P>
"The Thais resorted to aggressive serves and seldom committed
mistakes," said Zhen Jiucheng, manager of the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
"It's really better for the Chinese to lose one set as their
opponents in later stages are much more strong," said Zhen. "We
are very rusty in team work which is the key for success,
especially in volleyball, just because we don't have enough time
for systematic training."
</P>
<P>
"But our players are of great potentials, and I dare bet to put
them in the top three in the national league should I be given
three months," he added.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, China will face Japan in the semi-final
Friday evening as Japan routed the Chinese Taipei 25-20, 26-24, 22-
25 and 25-17.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final pits France against Russia after France
scored its straight-set win over Spain 25-19, 25-23 and 25-23,
while Russia won a full-set victory over Romania 16-25, 25-23, 25-
27, 25-23 and 15-4.
</P>
<P>
In the matches for the ninth to 16th places, the United States
defeated Switzerland 25-19, 25-18 and 25-19, Canada outwitted
Ukraine 19-25,20-25, 25-21, 25-22 and 15-8, the Czech Republic
savored an easy win over South Africa 25-10, 25-6 and 25-5 while
Brazil was protracted to five sets before beating Sweden 20-25, 25-
23, 24-26, 25-21 and 15-8.

<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An unnamed Premiership trainee has
admitted taking heroin after testing positive for morphine during
an FA random drug test.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, FA spokesman Steve Double announced
another player, Reading's Byron Glasgow, had tested positive for
recreational drugs.
</P>
<P>
The results of the tests mean that the FA will increase the
amount of random drug testing during the following season.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Double confirmed that the
increase in testing was at the request of Premiership clubs. "At
the moment, our problem is the same that faces any parent of a
young boy or girl - the drugs are out there. We are encouraged by
the fact that during the last five years there has been a steady
decline in the amount of positives," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Chief Denies Moving Troops From Panama to Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, July 8 (Xinhua)-- Chief of the U.S. South Command,
General Charles Wilhelm, denied an eventual move of his troops in
Panama to Honduras, local media reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm said that the South Command, the U.S. operational force
for Latin America, will be based in Miami following dismantling
American military installations at the Canal zone in Panama, which
is to gain the control of the canal by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He met with Honduras Defense Minister Edgardo Dumas Rodriguez
here on Wednesday. The two military chiefs discussed cooperation
on Cuban issues.
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm said that future cooperation will be concentrated on
technical assistance, providing supplies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, United States gave more than 400 million dollars
of military aid to Honduras within the framework of its anti-
gurerrilla warfare for Central America.
</P>
<P>
General Wilhelm denied that Palmerola base, about 80 kilometers
north of Tegucigalpa, is to be converted into a center for anti-
drug traffic in Central America, but admitted it has been used as
a base for certain special operations against drug-traffic.
</P>
<P>
The base at Palmerola was built by the United States in the
past decade for "dissuading" operations against Nicaragua's
Sandinista movement and El Salvador's guerrilla forces.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Denies Pressing Man United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Football's world governing body FIFA
has denied pressing Manchester United to compete in their brand
new World Team Championship rather than the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The row over which trophies the treble-winners will compete for
next season continues to drag on - with everyone from the domestic
cup's sponsors to the manager of United's rivals Arsenal having
their say.
</P>
<P>
Players' union chief Gordon Taylor also entered the fray on
Thursday, as United boss Sir Alex Ferguson insisted again the club
will not change its mind.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said United's decision to pull
out was "slowly killing the FA Cup" while PFA boss Taylor insisted
the government had put pressure on United.
</P>
<P>
"I remember 1958 and, days after the Munich air crash,
Manchester United had a team playing in the FA Cup," said the
union chief.
</P>
<P>
"They then had a team in the European Cup and they stayed in
both competitions.
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible to think that four decades on they have
dropped out of this FA Cup with the resources they have."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile FIFA president Sepp Blatter, the man behind the
international event, said the withdrawal saddened him.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that because the FA Cup is the cup competition in the
world," he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Inside Edge program
</P>
<P>
"But it was their decision. We have never had any contact with
Manchester United directly from FIFA to the club because we went
through the UEFA channel."
</P>
<P>
Blatter believes that the inclusion of United in the tournament
will add to the quality of competition in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"The qualification for this was through the confederations and
we would like to have the champions from each one," he explained.
</P>
<P>
That could be unlikely in the long-term, with UEFA chief
Lennart Johansson warning that the European champions'
participation could be a one-off.
</P>
<P>
"For this once, we are going to Brazil out of loyalty to the
football family," he said. "But we cannot guarantee participation
in the future."
</P>
<P>
FA Cup sponsors AXA appear determined to get United into their
competition, whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
One of their ideas was to fly United's English opponents to
Brazil midway through the new competition.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we are aware that there is considerable feeling
amongst fans the length and breadth of the country," explained AXA
spokesman Phil Hickley said.
</P>
<P>
"This one was one of a number of private and initial ideas,
which have not been discussed with the FA. We have not even
attempted to consider their feasibility, and of course, Manchester
United would have to take part in any decision."
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double immediately dismissed the plan. "It
is an amusing idea but completely unworkable," he said. "It would
mean the competition would be taken out of English football's
jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
And despite all the talk, United boss Ferguson is unmoved. "
Obviously a lot of concern has been expressed by various bodies
such as the government, FIFA and UEFA," he said while in Glasgow
to open a new media center at Hampden Park.
</P>
<P>
"But we took everything into consideration when we made the
decision and now it has been taken we have to get on with it.
There are all sorts of rumours flying about but we have to deal
with the facts and get on with our job," he added.

provincial and six overseas committees.

<P>
According to the results of the PPI vote counting so far, the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) leads in eight
provinces, namely, Bali, Yogyakarta, Central Java, Lampung,
Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, South Sumatera and Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Golkar Party meanwhile leads in Riau, Jambi, Irian
Jaya and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party (PPP) leads in Aceh and the
National Awakening Party (PKB) in East Java.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial results collected by the official
Antara News Agency from the provincial chapters of PPI, up to
Friday morning, PDI-P remains in the lead with 35 million votes,
Golkar 22.7 million votes, PKB 13.2 million votes, PPP 10.9
million votes and the National Mandate Party (PAN) 7.3 million
votes.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Largest Corporations Post Higher Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- All but one of the top ten largest
corporations in the Philippines registered increased sales in
1998, the year Asian economies were hit hardest by the region-wide
economic crisis, Business World reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted data released Thursday by the country's
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as saying that the 10 had
combined sales of 576.5 billion pesos (14.4 billion U.S. dollars),
an increase of 22.5 percent over the sum in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Total profits doubled to 29.54 billion pesos (739 million
dollars) from the record of 1997, SEC said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to SEC, two of the 10 suffered financial
losses in 1998, while two of the eight that reported profits
experienced thinner gains.
</P>
<P>
SEC's data showed that the top ten list was made up of the same
names as in the preceding year, with state-owned National Power
Corp. and Manila Electric Co. maintaining their No.1 and No. 2
positions respectively.
</P>
<P>
In terms of profits, food and beverage giant San Miguel Corp.
remained on top with 24.41 billion pesos (610 million dollars)
while the Philippine Amusement Gaming Corp. kept its second
ranking with profits of 6.73 billion pesos (168 million dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Argentine, British Foreign Ministers to Meet Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Foreign Minister
Guido di Tella announced Thursday that he will meet his British
counterpart Robin Cook next Tuesday in London to continue
negotiations on the renewal of flights to the Malvinas Islands.
</P>
<P>
Refuting a newspaper report, he said imminent announcements to
renew flights between Argentina's mainland and the Malvinas are
not to be expected.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations concerning these matters have been frozen since
1982, and to revitalize the process needs time and patience, he
noted, adding that a constructive climate now prevailed for
continuing such talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers met three times last week to discuss
the issue, with  Argentina favoring restarting flights to the
Malvinas via its mainland territory in order that Argentines may
travel there with national documents. But the British government
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Flights to the Malvinas, known in Britain as the Falkland
Islands, were suspended since the 1982 war between the two
countries over the sovereignty of the archipelago.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Hails Peace Accord in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Thursday evening "warmly welcomed" a peace accord signed by Sierra
Leone's warring parties, saying that "the United Nations will have
a key role to play in the implementation of this agreement."
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the 15-
nation Security Council, Hasma Agam of Malaysia, said, "Members of
the Council stressed that the signing of this agreement is a
significant achievement for all concerned, and a historic turning
point for Sierra Leone and its people."
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of a closed-door session of the
Security Council, which began on Thursday evening to discuss the
latest development in the efforts to end the civil war in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held only one day after the warring Sierra
Leonean parties signed in Togo a peace accord, which formally ends
eight years of civil war that has killed tens of thousands and
maimed many more.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council urged both the government of
Sierra Leone and the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to
ensure that the accord's provisions are implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council also paid tribute to the key role
played by the ECOMOG (West African peacekeepers) in Sierra Leone,
without whose commitment this achievement would not have been
possible," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Security Council called upon the international
community to assist Sierra Leone in their efforts at
reconciliation and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his welcome to the peace accord, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who was on a visit to the West African nation, said
Thursday that the peace deal signed this week to end the civil war
in the country was an encouraging sign for peace across the whole
continent of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah and RUF leader Foday Sankoh in Togo's capital of Lome late
Wednesday. Francis Okelo, the U.N. special representative for
Sierra Leone, also inked the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The fighting raged until just six weeks ago, when a cease-fire
was signed, and rebels were blamed for the bulk of the atrocities
against unarmed civilians, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, while visiting Sierra Leone, held separate talks with
Kabbah, U.N. observers and officers in the Nigerian-led ECOMOG,
which will form the core of a new peacekeeping force, U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since the latter part of the war, ECOMOG has stationed some 15,
000 soldiers in Sierra Leone and has been the strongest military
force defending the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 people were feared dead
on Thursday in a heavy fighting between the government forces and
the rebels near the country's capital of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
About 40 government soldiers and 37 Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombian guerrillas died in the battle that began at dawn
around the Andean village of Gutierrez, 15 miles (25 km) south of
Bogota, an army spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 96 troops were missing after they lost radio
contact with the rest of their company shortly after midday, she
added.
</P>
<P>
"There are a large number of dead on both sides. I don't know
what the rebels' targets were but they were coming toward Bogota
and were going to carry out attacks in Bogota or the outskirts,"
armed forces chief Gen. Fernando Tapias told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"This is an act of war," he added.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which was the worst in a series of recent clashes
between the government forces and the rebels, occurred after the
two sides agreed Tuesday to postpone for two weeks their peace
talks that started in early January.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are aimed at ending Colombia's long-running
war that has claimed more than 35,000 lives in just 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Digital Broadcast Services Market to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 8 (Xinhua) -- As with all communications
technologies today, digital technology will be the key to
broadcast services including the new age of television, said a new
report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide digital broadcast, including satellite, cable and
terrestrial services, will have a 43 percent compound annual
growth rate from 1999 to 2005, according to the report from Allied
Business Intelligence, Inc. (ABI), a U.S. technology research
think tank which publishes strategic research on the broadband,
wireless, electronic, automation, energy and transportation
industries.
</P>
<P>
ABI said that growth is being driven by the convergence of
computers with televisions, spawning an ever-widening audience for
new services. Entertainment will attract the majority of
subscribers, and real video-on-demand -- when it arrives -- will
be a major source of income for broadcasters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, there will be a 2.5 percent worldwide
penetration of digital TVs per household for all digital
broadcasting services. This penetration rate will rise to 21
percent by year-end 2005, ABI predicted.
</P>
<P>
Global digital TV and set-top box sales will rise in 2003,
igniting a sharp annual growth rate of 121 percent for digital
terrestrial services and a penetration of 5.2 percent of all TV
households over the next five years. Digital satellite will have
the largest number of worldwide digital subscribers in 2005 with
94.7 million.
</P>
<P>
North America and Europe are the most active broadcast regions,
with 92 percent of the worldwide digital subscribers, according to
ABI. In the two regions, the United States and the United Kingdom
have deployed more digital satellite, digital cable and digital
terrestrial services than any other nation.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the current penetration rate of 16
percent for digital services for all TV households primarily stems
from digital broadcast systems subscribers. ABI expects the total
U.S. digital service penetration rate to increase to 60 percent by
2005.
</P>
<P>
There are over 1.4 billion television sets in the world, and
250 million in the United States. Transitioning to digital TV sets
is going to take some time due to lack of content, cost, signal
reception and compatibility. ABI estimates that 15 percent of all

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Enjoying Greater Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Since 1956, Tibet has made 72 local
laws and 71 sets of local government resolutions with the power of
law that consider the ethnic, cultural and local features of
Tibetans, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Tibet started its democratic reforms in 1959 after the Dalai
Lama's failed rebellion and today the Tibetans enjoy complete
freedom that could not have been dreamed of by their forefathers
under the old feudalistic serf system.
</P>
<P>
Even bigamy, which could land most Chinese in jail for several
years, is allowed among Tibetans if they married before China's
first marriage law took effect in 1950. The local law is flexible
in the matter of marriage, and Tibetans who married in the early
years can maintain or change their marital status.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the flexible regional rules also allow Tibetans to
go marry at the age of 20, in the case of men, and 18 in the case
of women. Under the national marriage law, the majority of Chinese
adults are not legally allowed to take a spouse until 22 for men,
and 20 for women.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans are free to do anything lawful, including using their
mother tongue both at home and during official rites, as well as
to elect officials at the grass-roots levels.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of eligible Tibetan voters take part in
regular township and county level elections.

<HEADLINE> Fiat Voices Confidence on Deal With Mitsubishi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Fiat Chairman Paolo Fresco Thursday
voiced confidence on Wednesday's deal with the Japanese car-marker
Mitsubishi to jointly produce a new four-wheel-drive sports
utility car in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"It's above all a reinforcement," Fresco said at the annual
general meeting of the Italian Association of Motor Car
Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Fiat in recent months has denied rumors of deals with Renault
and Ford.
</P>
<P>
The head of Fiat's car division, Roberto Testore, said he was
"very satisfied" with the deal with the Japanese car-maker.
</P>
<P>
As for possible further cooperation with Mitsubishi in the
field of joint engine development, Testore said, "We'll see, we're
working on it. It's too early to say we'll get a deal, but it's
likely."
</P>
<P>
Fiat will invest 250 billion lire (about 135 million U.S.
dollars) in the city-jeep project with Mitsubishi. It will be
responsible for the car's design and styling, while Mitsubishi,
with its expertise in four-wheel-drive vehicles, will produce the
chassis and engine.
</P>
<P>
Production is scheduled to begin in 2001 at the plant near the
Italian northeast city of Turin. The two groups plan to build
30,000 of the cars each year, taking roughly 10 percent of the
European market in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The car will allow Fiat to complete its range of vehicles and
at the same time renew Mitsubishi's range of four-wheel-drive
vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Albanian President Stresses Regional Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani
Thursday said that stability in the Balkan region closely linked
with its development.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani made this remark while meeting his Macedonian
counterpart, Kiro Gligorov, in Skopje, capital of Macedonia,
during his one-day tour of the country, according to the Albanian
Telegraphic Agency (ATA).
</P>
<P>
"The development of the region, its transformation into a space
of civil, not national states, where the high standard of living,
free education and other political and civic rights are respected,
should be our common objective," Mejdani was quoted by the ATA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Albania supported a new Marshall plan covering not only
Albania, but also "a democratic Serbia," Mejdani noted.
</P>
<P>
The related pact of stability is the key to development and
stability in the region, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The solution of the Kosovo conflict gave a clear response to
many issues and a new more advanced era in the Albanian-Macedonian
relationship should begin, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ATA reported that there were some differences between
Albania and Macedonia on the future status of Kosovo. Gligorov
backed a wider-ranging autonomy for Kosovo without changes of
borders, while Mejdani said that it will not hurt the relations
between Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani also met with Macedonian Parliament Speaker Savo
Klimovski. He stressed that the parliaments of both countries
should support and encourage the cooperation between the two
countries and implementation of agreements signed between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani also said that Albanians should be represented in the
entire Macedonian administration. He asked the Macedonian
parliament to back the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Klimovski expressed his support for intensified contacts

<HEADLINE> Disarmament Agenda Remains Unfinished: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking United
Nations official Thursday called for "sustainable disarmament" as
the world is facing globalization of the arms industry and growing
arms trade.
</P>
<P>
The globalization of the arms industry generates new threats
and new insecurities, said U.N. Under-Secretary-General for
Disarmament Affairs Jayantha Dhanapala.
</P>
<P>
As the U.N. pursues sustainable development, so can it work to
foster sustainable disarmament, he told Friedrich Ebert Foundation
in New York.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala said disarmament agenda remains unfinished because
</P>
<P>
-- The treaties banning chemical and biological weapons are not
universal while over 30,000 nuclear weapons reportedly remain in
military arsenals around the world;
</P>
<P>
-- The so-called "peace dividend" remains elusive when the use
of high-tech weaponry in modern warfare such as recent wars in the
Persian Gulf and the Balkans encourages weapons proliferation and
"potentially to new arms races;"
</P>
<P>
-- The global arms trade grew 36 percent from 1995 to 1997
against a 11.2 percent decline in the decade before 1995, and
"ongoing efforts to expand NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) and to modernize existing arsenals will no doubt
encourage further increases;"
</P>
<P>
-- The global arms industry, particularly in the Atlantic area,
is undergoing a wave of mergers and acquisitions in its post-Cold
War consolidation; and
</P>
<P>
-- European countries will likely increase research and
development in the defense sector if they follow the U.S. and
expand R&AMP;D on missile defense.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Dhanapala said, a "revolutions in
disarmament affairs" must accompany the U.N. performance of its
duties under the Charter in international peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Outsourcing Services Grow: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide outsourcing services
grow fast on its way to blowing by the marker of 100 billion U.S.
dollars, according to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, spending topped 99 billion dollars, and by 2003, it
will explode to more than 151 billion dollars, said the U.S.
market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Explaining the rapid growth, the IDC said that economic factors
such as globalization, privatization, deregulation and
technological innovation have increased competition in many
industries and regions across the world. "To remain competitive,
many companies outsource as a way to reduce costs, increase
efficiencies, and refocus critical resources," the firm said.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, the majority of worldwide outsourcing
spending occurs within the United States. In 1998, U.S. companies
spent 51.5 billion dollars, accounting for almost 52 percent of
all outsourcing spending worldwide. By 2003, the United States
will spend more than 81 billion dollars annually for outsourcing,
almost 54 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
In the rest of the world, information systems outsourcing
markets are also growing fast, at a torrid 26.9 percent compound
annual growth rate through 2003. Asia-Pacific will increase its
spending at a 15 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The IDC said that factors contributed to the fast growth in the
rest of the world include small and midsized companies' increasing
PC use and dramatic growth of the Internet in some countries.
</P>
<P>
Processing services, including payroll, claims and credit card
processing, have been the most popular outsourcing activity,
according to the IDC. In 1998, this activity claimed almost 60
percent of all outsourcing spending worldwide with 59.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Information systems outsourcing, which includes data center,
client/server, and help desk applications, is the fastest-growing
segment of the market. In the United States, information systems
outsourcing services will largely be driven by small and
medium-sized companies.

<HEADLINE> Italian Central Bank Governor Urges Reform on Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Antonio Fazio, governor of the Bank of
Italy, the Italian central bank, said Thursday that a reform of
the Italian pension system earlier rather than later was
indispensable if difficulties midway through the next decade were
to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Reporting to the House and Senate budget committees, he said
that early reform of the pension system "is the premise for a
rapid and incisive lowering of the fiscal burden and for an
increase in investment spending."
</P>
<P>
He said that innovations in the pension system must be careful
to avoid substantial differences in how the generations are
treated.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, complementary retirement schemes should be
encouraged, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the level of fiscal pressure in Italy, Fazio said it
is in line with the euro area's average.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he admitted that those Italians who pay their
taxes labor under a heavy fiscal burden.
</P>
<P>
A real and lasting tax cut for families and for businesses is
definitely required, he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the government's economic planning document approved by
government last week, Fazio said it would have been opportune to
have set a balanced budget as the goal "at least for the year
2002" and not 2003.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tariffs for Lamb Imports Condemned in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton's latest endorsement of tariffs for New Zealand and
Australian lamb imports have met with outrage from New Zealand
farmers, exporters and politicians.
</P>
<P>
They attacked the U.S. move as "protectionist and
unwarranted."
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Friday quoted President Malcolm Bailey of the NZ
Federated Farmers as saying that the move defies logic and makes
the United States look silly in the year that it is hosting a
World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting to launch multilateral
trade talks.
</P>
<P>
"It's a blow for New Zealand sheep farmers. It's not going to
destroy our industry but there's an incredible anger about this,"
he said. "The U.S. has lost respect and credibility with this
awful decision."
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand farmers, meat processors and exporters have every
right to be angry at President Bill Clinton," the Wellington-based
newspaper quoted Meat NZ Chairman John Acland as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision contradicts the United States' rhetoric on
free trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jim Sutton, agriculture spokesman of the Labor Party, said:
"This is the ugly face of America, the bully throwing its weight
around."
</P>
<P>
He said it is hypocrisy for the American administration to put
partisan political advantage ahead of the true interests of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Sutton predicted that Clinton would face "farmer protests" when
 he comes to the informal meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation leaders in Auckland in September.
</P>
<P>
Jim Anderton, leader of the New Zealand Alliance, said New
Zealand is being swindled by its trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion also quoted NZ Prime Minister Jenny Shipley as
saying that New Zealand has immediately started active
consideration of its WTO option.
</P>
<P>
"We will be working closely with Australia on any action that
will be taken," she said.
</P>
<P>
International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith met with NZ meat
industry representatives Thursday to discuss the government's
planned WTO action.
</P>
<P>
The minister Thursday also summoned U.S. Ambassador to New
Zealand Josiah Beeman to his office to hear the New Zealand
government's formal protest.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Says "No" to Nuke Shipments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
concerned that two lightly armed ships carrying enough plutonium
to build 60 nuclear weapons may travel through the Tasman Sea on
their way from Europe to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Friday reported that the ships, whose departure
from Britain is believed to be imminent, will carry MOX fuel, a
mixture of uranium and plutonium recycled from spent nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted a spokesman for NZ
Foreign Minister Don Mckinnon as saying that the NZ government has
expressed concern to Japan and that the ships should not approach
New Zealand waters.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know which of the three possible routes -- the
Panama Canal, South America, or South Africa-Tasman Sea-southeast
Pacific -- will be used," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have repeatedly stated that we would want all shipments of
nuclear material to stay as far away from New Zealand as possible.
Our missions in London, Paris and Tokyo have made a number of
diplomatic representations to underline the fact that the MOX
shipment would not be welcome here," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Say Osama Is in Afghanistan: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Thursday admitted Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist wanted
by the United States, is still in their country, according to a
report by the News Network International of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Taliban had reiterated that they had no information
about the whereabouts of Osama.
</P>
<P>
Taliban spokesman Maulvi Wakeel Ahmed Mutawakil was quoted as
saying Thursday from Kandahar, headquarters of the student
militia, that a Taliban commission is monitoring Osama's
activities.
</P>
<P>
"We keep secret Osama's movement due to security reasons," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Accused by the United States of masterminding the bomb attacks
on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August, Osama was
listed in the top ten most wanted persons by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation last month.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi dissident left his dwelling in Kandahar in February
this year and then the Taliban kept saying that they did not know
where he was.
</P>
<P>
But the United States recently claimed that they found new
bases of Osama in Afghanistan and decided to impose economic
sanctions on the Taliban who they said are still supporting the
suspected terrorist.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi said, "Taliban are ready for talks with the United
States on Osama, but they are not listening to us."
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban can not extradite Osama because they do not
have any extradition treaty with any country.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the U.S. sanctions, the spokesman said, "we can
live without the assistance of Americans."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Underlines Disarmament in Conflict Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday said the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of
ex-combatants in a peacekeeping environment is part of its effort
to enhance the effectiveness of United Nations peacekeeping and
peace-building activities in conflict situation around the world.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a presidential statement adopted at the
end of an open debate on the issue, which involved representatives
from 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is seriously concerned that in a number
of conflicts, armed fighting among various parties or factions
continues despite the conclusion of peace agreements by the
warring parties and the presence of United Nations peacekeeping
missions on the ground," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council recognizes that disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration cannot be seen in isolation but
rather, as a continuous process which is rooted in and feeds into
a broader search for peace, stability and development," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Effective disarmament of ex-combatants represents an important
indicator of progress towards post-conflict peace-building and
normalization of the situation," the statement said. "The
demobilization effort is only possible when there is some level of
disarmament and its success can only be achieved when there is
effective rehabilitation and reintegration into society of
ex-combatants."
</P>
<P>
"Disarmament and demobilization must take place in a secure and
safe environment, which will give ex-combatants the confidence to
lay down their arms," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council emphasizes that for disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration to be successful, there must be
political will and a clear commitment by the parties concerned to
achieve peace and security," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it is vital that such commitment by the
parties be reinforced by political will and consistent, effective
and determined support from the international community to
guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace, including through
its contributions of long-term assistance for development and
trade, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council affirms its commitment to the principles
of the political independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all States in conducting peace-building activities,
and the need for States to comply with their obligations under
international law," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the success of the process, the statement
suggested the inclusion of clear terms of disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, the
establishment by Governments contributing to peacekeeping
operations of databases of experts on disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration of ex-combatants, and the prevention and
reduction of the excessive and destabilizing flow, accumulation
and illegitimate use of small arms and light weapons.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday evening began a closed-door session to discuss the latest
developments in efforts to end the civil war in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The meeting simply came one day after the Sierra Leonean
warring parties signed in Togo a peace accord, which formally ends
eight years of civil war that has killed tens of thousands and
mained many more.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to discuss the U.N. Mission in
Sierra Leone and humanitarian relief in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the peace accord, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
who was on a visit to the West African nation, said Thursday that
the peace deal signed this week to end the civil war in the
country was an encouraging sign for peace across the whole
continent of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah and rebel Revolutionary United Front leader Foday Sankoh in
Togo's capital of Lome late Wednesday. Francis Okelo, the U.N.
special representative for Sierra Leone, also inked the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The fighting raged until just six weeks ago, when a cease-fire
was signed, and rebels are blamed for the bulk of the atrocities
against unarmed civilians, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, while visiting Sierra Leone, held separate talks with
Kabbah, U.N. observers and officers in the Nigerian-led West
African peacekeepers, known as the ECOMOG, which will form the
core of a new peacekeeping force, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since the latter part of the war, the ECOMOG has had some
15,000 soldiers in Sierra Leone and has been the strongest
military force defending the government.
